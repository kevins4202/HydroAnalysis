pollutants has been receiving great attention in the last decades because these pollutants cannot be effectively degraded by the conventional methods persulfate ps activation processes that can generate highly potent sulfate radical so4 are considered to be a promising technique for removing refractory pollutants 1 4 ps activation with solid catalysts has attracted more interest due to its low energy consumption and easy operation however some ions in real water can readily capture the generated radicals and so significantly suppress the degradation of target pollutants 5 7 moreover halide radical produced from the reaction of halide ion and radical might lead to the formation of harmful halide organic intermediates 8 10 these are common problems for advanced oxidation processes and limit their practical application recently some researchers found that non radical activation of ps can be achieved by some carbonaceous materials such as carbon nanotube and graphene 11 14 ps adsorbed on catalyst surface can be activated via the electronic effect between ps and catalyst the activated ps is relatively stable and cannot be further decomposed into radical although its oxidation ability might be lower than radical it can also effectively oxidize organic pollutants moreover it shows much higher selectivity towards target pollutants and is less affected by ubiquitous

outer sphere interaction and then oxidized 2 4 dcp in solution this process has distinct advantages over so4 oxidation in terms of degradation efficiency of 2 4 dcp and inhibition of toxic intermediates formation du et al 16 17 found that the activated ps was the dominant reactive species in cuo ps process and neither chloride ion nor bicarbonate ion had negative effect however the decomposition of ps usually leads to the decrease of solution ph and the leaching of cu ion is serious at low ph values ubiquitous bicarbonate was found to be effective to solve this problem due to its buffering ability at weak alkaline ph lei et al 18 reported that bicarbonate had positive effect on the degradation of phenol in the cuo fe3o4 ps process due to the suppression of copper leaching our recent work 19 found that the positive effect of bicarbonate on ciprofloxacin removal with cuo ps could be ascribed to the suppression of copper leaching as well as the enhanced non radical activation of ps at higher solution ph therefore cuo activated ps with the assistance of bicarbonate should be a promising technique for wastewater treatment it is well known that various radicals including so4 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical o2 can be produced in cuo ps process bicarbonate is an effective radical scavenger and hco3 can be produced via its reaction with radicals 20

efficiency of ps by cuo bicarbonate are tightly associated with the structure and property of cuo which also need further investigation therefore a systematic study of bicarbonate cuo ps process is highly desired for its practical application in this work four types of cuo were synthesized by different methods they were used to activate ps in the presence of bicarbonate for removing different

resultant solution was heated in a water bath at 55 c for 3 5 h the product was washed with ethanol and water and dried in an oven at 75 c for 12 h 2 2 characterization of cuo the crystal phase and morphology of the samples were examined by a bruker d8 advance powder x ray diﬀ ractometer xrd and a hitachi s 4800 ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy fesem respectively the chemical state of surface cu was measured by a thermo escalab 250 x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps surface area was determined using a quantachrome nova 4000e surface area analyzer the ph of the point of zero charge pzc of the samples was determined by the ph drift method 2 3 degradation of organic pollutants by bicarbonate cuo ps bicarbonate 5 mmol l 1 na2s2o8 1 mmol l 1 and organic pollutant were dissolved in 100 ml deionized water in a 200 ml glass beaker this solution was adjusted to ph 9 5 by naoh solution at this ph cu leaching can be avoided and ps cannot be activated by cu2 or oh thus the contribution of homogeneous cu ion and base for ps activation can be excluded then 0 05 g of cuo was added and this reaction was started at given time intervals samples were withdrawn and a drop of 0 1 mol l 1 na2s2o3 solution was added to quench the reaction the concentration of orange ii was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 7504 the concentration of cephalexin and ofloxacin was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 at the wavelength of 254 and 294 nm respectively acetonitrile and ammonium acetate aqueous solution 15 85 were used as the mobile phase for cephalexin while acetonitrile and formic acid aqueous solution 25 75 were used for ofloxacin the mineralization efficiency of organic pollutants was measured by a phoenix 8000 total organic carbon toc analyzer the concentration of ps was determined by the potassium iodide method ps can oxidize i to i2 which can be determined by uv vis spectrophotometer the active radicals generated in different cuo ps processes were analyzed by a ms 5000 epr spectrometer magnettech using 5 5 dimethy 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp as the probe 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization results of different cuo samples the xrd peaks in fig 1 can be indexed to monoclinic cuo crystal jcpds 80 1268 indicating that all the samples are pure cuo the sharp peaks of cuo 1 and cuo 4 indicate their high crystallinity while the weak and wide peaks of cuo 3 suggest its low crystallinity and or small crystal size fig 2 shows the sem images of these samples the micrometer scale aggregates of cuo 1 are assembled from irregular polyhedrons cuo 2 is composed of sea urchin like microspheres cuo 3 has a cotton like morphology composed of curved nanofibers cuo 4 contains a large number of irregular nanosheets the xps spectra in fig 3 show that the binding energies of cu 2p3 2 are 933 3 934 5 ev demonstrating the presence of cu2 the higher binding energies of cuo 1 and cuo 4 compared to cuo 2 and cuo 3 might be attributed to the presence of cu2 with more electron deficiency 5 27 28 the cu 2p3 2 peak can be further deconvoluted into two peaks indicating the presence of two cu2 species the one at higher binding energy named as cu2 h can be assigned to cu2 with more electron deficiency while the other one at lower binding energy named as cu2 l can be assigned to cu2 with higher electron density the percentage of cu2 h in the total cu2 was calculated to be about 50 38 24 and 59 for cuo 1 cuo 2 cuo 3 and cuo 4 respectively suggesting that cuo 1 and cuo 4 have more cu2 with more electron deficiency the surface areas of cuo 1 cuo 2 cuo 3 and cuo 4 were determined to be 5 8 9 9 26 0 and 76 4 m2 g 1 respectively the four samples have similar phpzc in the range of 7 6 7 85 according to the above results these cuo samples have different crystallinity morphology surface area and chemical state which might lead to their different performance for ps activation 3 2 ps activation with different cuo samples for organic pollutants removal the performance of the cuo catalysts for ps activation was investigated using orange ii cephalexin and ofloxacin as the target pollutants in the absence of cuo orange ii cannot be degraded by ps bicarbonate and the degradation efficiencies of cephalexin and ofloxacin were only 10 5 and 3 6 respectively as shown in fig 4 the degradation of these pollutants was significantly accelerated by the addition of cuo among these catalysts cuo 1 exhibited the lowest activity for removing the three pollutants as for cuo 2 it showed slightly higher activity than cuo 1 for removing cephalexin and ofloxacin however it is interesting that cuo 2 exhibited the highest activity for orange ii degradation cuo 3 and cuo 4 exhibited similar activity for removing different pollutants the degradation rates of orange ii with them were slightly lower than that with cuo 2 while those of cephalexin and ofloxacin were much higher although the leaching of cu in the absence of bicarbonate was serious due to the decrease of solution ph the activities of these cuo catalysts without bicarbonate were similar to that with bicarbonate the result further demonstrates the advantage of bicarbonate cuo ps process the adsorption of a catalyst towards pollutants is important in a heterogeneous catalytic reaction as presented in fig 5 the catalysts showed low adsorption capacity towards these pollutants at ph 9 5 the sulfo group of orange ii and the carboxyl group of cephalexin and ofloxacin were deprotonated 29 31 and the cuo surface was negatively charged the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged surface and the deprotonated groups led to the low adsorption capacities of these pollutants on cuo in addition the adsorption capacities of the catalysts towards these pollutants followed the order of cuo 3 cuo 4 cuo 2 cuo 1 highly positively correlated to their surface area since the catalysts have same crystal phase and similar phpzc their adsorption capacity should be mainly dependent on their surface area the higher adsorption capacity towards pollutants might facilitate the surface reactions of pollutants with active species resulting in higher degradation efficiency however cuo 2 has a much smaller surface area than cuo 3 and cuo 4 but higher activity for orange ii degradation this might be associated with their properties that need further investigation in this bicarbonate cuo ps process the concentration of bicarbonate a well known radical scavenger is far higher than that of pollutants bicarbonate can react with the generated radicals to form hco3 therefore it can be deduced that radicals except for hco3 are not the active species for pollutants degradation hco3 and or activated ps might be responsible for pollutants degradation the oxidation ability of hco3 and activated ps should be lower than active radicals such as so4 and oh which might lead to low toc removal efficiency hence the mineralization efficiency of pollutants was further investigated to assess this process the toc removal efficiency of cephalexin and ofloxacin was 68 6 and 67 3 reaction time 30 min for the cuo 3 system slightly higher than that for the cuo 4 system 66 5 and 65 3 the toc removal efficiency of orange ii was 52 1 and 48 0 reaction time 10 min for the cuo 2 and cuo 3 systems respectively the result demonstrates that the bicarbonate cuo ps process is effective not only for degradation but also for mineralization of organic pollutants 3 3 possible activation pathway of ps with different cuo samples it is generally believed that ps can be decomposed into radicals in the radical activation process whereas it is relatively stable and cannot be decomposed in the absence of reductant in the non radical activation process therefore the consumption efficiency of ps with different catalysts can reflect the possible ps activation pathway the concentration of ps in solution in different systems was presented in fig 6 in the absence of organic pollutants ps was stable with the addition of cuo 1 indicating the very poor activity of cuo 1 for ps decomposition ps might be mainly activated by cuo 1 through the non radical pathway as for the other three cuo catalysts the concentration of ps decreased gradually with reaction time in the absence of pollutants cuo 3 and cuo 4 exhibited similar activity for ps consumption while cuo 2 showed the highest activity according to the result cuo 2 seems to have the highest activity for ps activation through the radical pathway however it only exhibited the highest activity for orange ii removal and its activity for removing cephalexin and ofloxacin was much lower than cuo 3 and cuo 4 this implies that the non radical activation of ps might also occur in the cuo systems fig 6 shows that the addition of organic pollutants promoted the consumption of ps in different cuo systems this phenomenon is similar to that in the non radical activation process it is worth pointing out that the consumption of ps with orange ii was not presented due to the interference of orange ii on i2 determination although the activated ps on catalyst surface cannot be further decomposed into radical it can oxidize organics in solution since the activated ps was consumed due to its reaction with organics the catalyst surface was recovered and could adsorb new ps ions in solution thus the consumption of ps increased due to the reaction of organics with activated ps the increased ps consumption after the addition of pollutants suggests that all the four cuo catalysts can activate ps via the non radical pathway the amount of increased ps consumption by cuo 3 and cuo 4 seems to be higher than that by cuo 2 suggesting that the higher pollutants degradation efficiency by cuo 3 and cuo 4 might be due to the formation of more activated ps it is well known that the activated ps is stable and adsorbed on catalyst surface fig 6 only presented the concentration of ps in solution which was determined via the reaction of ki with the filtrate after filtering off cuo the consumed ps should contain the decomposed ps and the adsorbed ps on cuo surface the activated ps adsorbed on catalyst surface has not been quantitatively determined although the concentration of ps adsorbed on catalyst surface could be determined via its reaction with ki the amount of activated ps cannot be accurately obtained from this result on one hand cu3 which is generated via the reaction of cu2 with ps 18 32 can also oxidize i and interfere the detection of adsorbed ps on the other hand some of the adsorbed ps should be only adsorbed on catalyst surface and have not been activated since ofloxacin can be oxidized by activated ps and hardly adsorbed on the cuo surface it can be used as the probe for determining activated ps the catalyst was recycled from the ps solution without pollutants after reaction for 30 min and then dispersed in 100 ml of ofloxacin solution without ps if the adsorbed ps has been activated via the non radical pathway it can oxidize ofloxacin whereas it was only adsorbed on cuo surface it cannot oxidize ofloxacin thus the amount of activated ps with different cuo can be estimated by the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin as presented in fig 7 cuo 3 and cuo 4 exhibited similar activity for ofloxacin degradation although cuo 2 exhibited the highest activity for ps consumption fig 6 its activity for ofloxacin degradation was much lower than cuo 3 and cuo 4 implying the formation of less activated ps on its surface the results in fig 6 and 7 suggest that cuo 4 has the highest proportion of activated ps in total consumed ps while cuo 2 has the lowest proportion according to the above results the non radical activation efficiency of ps was found to be associated with the surface area and chemical state of cuo cu2 h with more electron deficiency should be the active sites for non radical activation of ps cuo 1 and cuo 4 have relatively higher percentage of cu2 h 50 and 59 and so they have higher proportion of activated ps in the total consumed ps especially for cuo 4 it has the highest percentage of cu2 h and a much higher surface than cuo 1 and cuo 2 so it exhibited much higher activity than cuo 1 and cuo 2 for pollutants degradation although cuo 3 has a much lower percentage of cu2 h it has the largest surface area for instance the surface area of cuo 3 is about 2 9 times than that of cuo 4 while the percentage of cu2 h in cuo 4 is about 2 5 times than that in cuo 3 it can be estimated that the total content of surface cu2 h in cuo 3 is similar to that in cuo 4 hence cuo 3 and cuo 4 exhibited similar activity for non radical activation of ps as well as pollutants degradation although the percentage of cu2 h in cuo 1 is about 1 3 times than that in cuo 2 the surface area of cuo 2 is about 1 7 times than that of cuo 1 accordingly the total content of surface cu2 h in cuo 2 should be higher than that in cuo 1 and so cuo 2 exhibited higher activity than cuo 1 for non radical activation of ps and pollutants degradation 3 4 active species for pollutants degradation according to the above results both radical and non radical activation of ps occurred in the bicarbonate cuo ps process it is well known that so4 is generated via the cleavage of peroxy bond of ps in the radical activation pathway eq 1 oh can be generated through the reaction of so4 with oh eq 2 our recent work found that o2 can be generated via the cleavage of so bond of ps 27 33 in addition singlet oxygen 1o2 is frequently reported to be a possible active species for pollutants removal in ps activation process 28 34 35 in this process bicarbonate can react with these radicals to form hco3 eq 4 and 5 previous literature reported that h2o2 can be produced in the bicarbonate ps system 36 hco3 can react with h2o2 to form o2 o2 can react with oh and h2o2 to generate 1o2 35 36 accordingly various reactive species including so4 oh o2 1o2 hco3 and activated ps can be produced in the bicarbonate cuo ps process in order to identify the active species for pollutants degradation the influence of various scavengers on this process was investigated because cuo 2 exhibited the highest activity for orange ii degradation while cuo 3 for cephalexin and ofloxacin degradation they were used as the typical processes to perform the scavenger experiments 1 s2o8 2 cu2 so4 so4 2 cu3 2 so4 oh so4 2 oh 3 cu2 s2o8 2 2h2o cu 2hso4 o2 2h 4 so4 hco3 so4 hco3 5 oh hco3 oh hco3 6 oh o2 oh 1o2 7 oh h2o2 oh 1o2 oh ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba are effective scavengers for so4 and oh and the former has a much higher rate constant with so4 37 nan3 is an effective scavenger for 1o2 and oh with the rate constant of 1 109 and 1 2 1010 m l s l 38 39 respectively however the addition of tba etoh and nan3 with much higher concentrations than pollutants had little effect on pollutants degradation in the cuo ps processes with bicarbonate fig 8 indicating that so4 oh and 1o2 are not the active species although bicarbonate can react with so4 and oh to form hco3 its reaction rate constants are lower than that of etoh with these radicals 36 37 moreover the concentration of etoh used in this experiment was much higher than that of bicarbonate and it could significantly suppress the formation of hco3 however its addition had no effect on pollutants degradation indicating the contribution of hco3 is also excluded the active species were also identified by epr measurements using dmpo and temp no signals for so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were observed throughout this reaction further demonstrating that bicarbonate can effectively capture these radicals since 1o2 cannot be quenched by bicarbonate it might not be formed in this process it is interesting that the addition of tempol 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl significantly hindered the degradation of cephalexin and ofloxacin fig 8b and c tempol is an effective scavenger for o2 40 but o2 was not detected by epr measurements the inhibitory effect of some reagents could be ascribed to their competition for adsorption sites which might inhibited the surface reaction of target pollutants with active species however the scavengers used in this work had little effect on pollutants adsorption excluding the inhibitory effect from competing adsorption sites hence it can be assumed the inhibited degradation of cephalexin and ofloxacin by tempol might be due to their competition for activated ps this assumption was confirmed by another interesting phenomenon observed in the epr measurement using tempo 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxy as the probe as shown in fig 9 the signal of tempo can be observed in different systems but its intensity is quite different typically in the cuo 1 ps system the intensity of tempo decreased with reaction time fig 9a the result in fig 6 has demonstrated that ps is hardly decomposed by cuo 1 but can be activated via the non radical pathway therefore the decreased intensity of tempo could be attributed to the reaction between tempo and activated ps fig 9 b d show the signal intensity of tempo in different cuo ps systems at the same reaction time it can be seen that the signal intensity decreased with time in all cuo ps systems moreover the signal intensity at the same reaction time followed the order of cuo 3 cuo 4 cuo 2 cuo 1 this means that the amount of tempo degraded by activated ps followed the order of cuo 3 cuo 4 cuo 2 cuo 1 in other words the amount of activated ps generated by different catalyst should follow the order of cuo 3 cuo 4 cuo 2 cuo 1 this result agrees well with that presented in fig 7 therefore the inhibitory effect of tempol on cephalexin and ofloxacin degradation can be ascribed to the scavenging of activated ps activated ps should be the active species for the degradation of cephalexin and ofloxacin however the addition of tempol had little effect on orange ii degradation with cuo 2 fig 8a this phenomenon was also observed in the other three cuo systems since cuo 1 has very poor activity for ps decomposition activated ps should be responsible for orange ii degradation in its system it can be assumed that the rate constant of orange ii with activated ps is far higher than that of tempol which still needs further investigation in the future for comparison the effect of scavengers on the degradation of pollutants in the cuo ps processes without bicarbonate was also studied the result was similar to that in the bicarbonate cuo ps processes and ethanol only slightly hindered the degradation of pollutants this means that activated ps generated via the non radical way should also be the dominant reactive species at neutral ph without bicarbonate agreeing well with the result in our previous work 19 the high toc removal efficiency by bicarbonate cuo ps has demonstrated that activated ps can effectively oxidize not only these target pollutants but also their degradation products previous work reported that hco3 is a selective oxidant 36 41 42 although the reaction rate constants of hco3 with orange ii might be much lower than that of activated ps they might react readily with some degradation products of orange ii this can reduce the competition from the intermediates for activated ps thus more ps can react with the target pollutants thus the higher activity of cuo 2 for ps decomposition could lead to the formation of more hco3 which would cause the slightly higher degradation efficiency of orange ii finally the possible mechanism for ps activation with bicarbonate cuo was summarized as follow firstly ps is adsorbed on the cuo surface some of the adsorbed ps locate at the cu2 sites with more electron deficiency and can be activated through the non radical pathway eq 8 the activated ps has high oxidation ability and can effectively oxidize the target pollutants and their intermediates eq 9 after that the active sites on cuo can be recovered and can adsorb and activate new ps ions in addition some ps can be decomposed into so4 which can subsequently oxidize hco3 to hco3 hco3 is a more selective oxidant and might oxidize some intermediates as a result the target pollutants are almost completely degraded and a high toc removal efficiency is also achieved 8 cu2 s2o8 2 cu2 s2o8 2 9 cu2 s2o8 2 organics cu2 2so4 2 co2 h2o 4 conclusion four types of cuo samples were investigated as heterogeneous catalysts for ps activation in the presence of bicarbonate both radical and non radical activation of ps occurred in the bicarbonate cuo ps process cuo 2 exhibited the highest activity for ps decomposition and orange ii degradation while cuo 3 and cuo 4 exhibited higher activity for non radical activation of ps and degradation of cephalexin and ofloxacin activated ps should be the dominant reactive species for pollutants removal hco3 might participate in the oxidization of some intermediates cu2 h with more electron deficiency should be the active sites for non radical activation of ps tempo l could act as a scavenger probe for the determination of activated ps the catalyst after adsorption of ps can also be used for determining activated ps this work provides a new pathway for exploring the non radical activation process of ps and as well as the rational design of the corresponding catalyst declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by the foundation for

different cuo ps processes were analyzed by a ms 5000 epr spectrometer magnettech using 5 5 dimethy 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp as the probe 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization results of different cuo samples the xrd peaks in fig 1 can be indexed to monoclinic cuo crystal jcpds 80 1268 indicating that all the samples are pure cuo the sharp peaks of cuo 1 and cuo 4 indicate their high crystallinity while the weak and wide peaks of cuo 3 suggest its low crystallinity and or small crystal size fig 2 shows the sem images of these samples the micrometer scale aggregates of cuo 1 are assembled from irregular polyhedrons cuo 2 is composed of sea urchin like microspheres cuo 3 has a cotton like morphology composed of curved nanofibers cuo 4 contains a large number of irregular nanosheets the xps spectra in fig 3 show that the binding energies of cu 2p3 2 are 933 3 934 5 ev demonstrating the presence of cu2 the higher binding energies of cuo 1 and cuo 4 compared to cuo 2 and cuo 3 might be attributed to the presence of cu2 with more electron deficiency 5 27 28 the cu 2p3 2 peak can be further deconvoluted into two peaks indicating the presence of two cu2 species the one at higher binding energy named as cu2 h can be assigned to cu2 with more electron deficiency while the other one at lower binding energy named as cu2 l can be assigned to cu2 with higher electron density the percentage of cu2 h in the total cu2 was calculated to be about 50 38 24 and 59 for cuo 1 cuo 2 cuo 3 and cuo 4 respectively suggesting that cuo 1 and cuo 4 have more cu2 with more electron deficiency the surface areas of cuo 1 cuo 2 cuo 3 and cuo 4 were determined to be 5 8 9 9 26 0 and 76 4 m2 g 1 respectively the four samples have similar phpzc in the range of 7 6 7 85 according to the above results these cuo samples have different crystallinity morphology surface area and chemical state which might lead to their different performance for ps activation 3 2 ps activation with different cuo samples for organic pollutants removal the performance of the cuo catalysts for ps activation was investigated using orange ii cephalexin and ofloxacin as the target pollutants in the absence of cuo orange ii cannot be degraded by ps bicarbonate and the degradation efficiencies of cephalexin and ofloxacin were only 10 5 and 3 6 respectively as shown in fig 4 the degradation of these pollutants was significantly accelerated by the addition of cuo among these catalysts cuo 1 exhibited the lowest activity for removing the three pollutants as for cuo 2 it showed slightly higher activity than cuo 1 for removing cephalexin and ofloxacin however it is interesting that cuo 2 exhibited the highest activity for orange ii degradation cuo 3 and cuo 4 exhibited similar activity for removing different pollutants the degradation rates of orange ii with them were slightly lower than that with cuo 2 while those of cephalexin and ofloxacin were much higher although the leaching of cu in the absence of bicarbonate was serious due to the decrease of solution ph the activities of these cuo catalysts without bicarbonate were similar to that with bicarbonate the result further demonstrates the advantage of bicarbonate cuo ps process the adsorption of a catalyst towards pollutants is important in a heterogeneous catalytic reaction as presented in fig 5 the catalysts showed low adsorption capacity towards these pollutants at ph 9 5 the sulfo group of orange ii and the carboxyl group of cephalexin and ofloxacin were deprotonated 29 31 and the cuo surface was negatively charged the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged surface and the deprotonated groups led to the low adsorption capacities of these pollutants on cuo in addition the adsorption capacities of the catalysts towards these pollutants followed the order of cuo 3 cuo 4 cuo 2 cuo 1 highly positively correlated to their surface area since the catalysts have same crystal phase and similar phpzc their adsorption capacity should be mainly dependent on their surface area the higher adsorption capacity towards pollutants might facilitate the surface reactions of pollutants with active species resulting in higher degradation efficiency however cuo 2 has a much smaller surface area than cuo 3 and cuo 4 but higher activity for orange ii degradation this might be associated with their properties that need further investigation in this bicarbonate cuo ps process the concentration of bicarbonate a well known radical scavenger is far higher than that of pollutants bicarbonate can react with the generated radicals to form hco3 therefore it can be deduced that radicals except for hco3 are not the active species for pollutants degradation hco3 and or activated ps might be responsible for pollutants degradation the oxidation ability of hco3 and activated ps should be lower than active radicals such as so4 and oh which might lead to low toc removal efficiency hence the mineralization efficiency of pollutants was further investigated to assess this process the toc removal efficiency of cephalexin and ofloxacin was 68 6 and 67 3 reaction time 30 min for the cuo 3 system slightly higher than that for the cuo 4 system 66 5 and 65 3 the toc removal efficiency of orange ii was 52 1 and 48 0 reaction time 10 min for the cuo 2 and cuo 3 systems respectively the result demonstrates that the bicarbonate cuo ps process is effective not only for degradation but also for mineralization of organic pollutants 3 3 possible activation pathway of ps with different cuo samples it is generally believed that ps can be decomposed into radicals in the radical activation process whereas it is relatively stable and cannot be decomposed in the absence of reductant in the non radical activation process therefore the consumption efficiency of ps with different catalysts can reflect the possible ps activation pathway the concentration of ps in solution in different systems was presented in fig 6 in the absence of organic pollutants ps was stable with the addition of cuo 1 indicating the very poor activity of cuo 1 for ps decomposition ps might be mainly activated by cuo 1 through the non radical pathway as for the other three cuo catalysts the concentration of ps decreased gradually with reaction time in the absence of pollutants cuo 3 and cuo 4 exhibited similar activity for ps consumption while cuo 2 showed the highest activity according to the result cuo 2 seems to have the highest activity for ps activation through the radical pathway however it only exhibited the highest activity for orange ii removal and its activity for removing cephalexin and ofloxacin was much lower than cuo 3 and cuo 4 this implies that the non radical activation of ps might also occur in the cuo systems fig 6 shows that the addition of organic pollutants promoted the consumption of ps in different cuo systems this phenomenon is similar to that in the non radical activation process it is worth pointing out that the consumption of ps with orange ii was not presented due to the interference of orange ii on i2 determination although the activated ps on catalyst surface cannot be further decomposed into radical it can oxidize organics in solution since the activated ps was consumed due to its reaction with organics the catalyst surface was recovered and could adsorb new ps ions in solution thus the consumption of ps increased due to the reaction of organics with activated ps the increased ps consumption after the addition of pollutants suggests that all the four cuo catalysts can activate ps via the non radical pathway the amount of increased ps consumption by cuo 3 and cuo 4 seems to be higher than that by cuo 2 suggesting that the higher pollutants degradation efficiency by cuo 3 and cuo 4 might be due to the formation of more activated ps it is well known that the activated ps is stable and adsorbed on catalyst surface fig 6 only presented the concentration of ps in solution which was determined via the reaction of ki with the filtrate after filtering off cuo the consumed ps should contain the decomposed ps and the adsorbed ps on cuo surface the activated ps adsorbed on catalyst surface has not been quantitatively determined although the concentration of ps adsorbed on catalyst surface could be determined via its reaction with ki the amount of activated ps cannot be accurately obtained from this result on one hand cu3 which is generated via the reaction of cu2 with ps 18 32 can also oxidize i and interfere the detection of adsorbed ps on the other hand some of the adsorbed ps should be only adsorbed on catalyst surface and have not been activated since ofloxacin can be oxidized by activated ps and hardly adsorbed on the cuo surface it can be used as the probe for determining activated ps the catalyst was recycled from the ps solution without pollutants after reaction for 30 min and then dispersed in 100 ml of ofloxacin solution without ps if the adsorbed ps has been activated via the non radical pathway it can oxidize ofloxacin whereas it was only adsorbed on cuo surface it cannot oxidize ofloxacin thus the amount of activated ps with different cuo can be estimated by the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin as presented in fig 7 cuo 3 and cuo 4 exhibited similar activity for ofloxacin degradation although cuo 2 exhibited the highest activity for ps consumption fig 6 its activity for ofloxacin degradation was much lower than cuo 3 and cuo 4 implying the formation of less activated ps on its surface the results in fig 6 and 7 suggest that cuo 4 has the highest proportion of activated ps in total consumed ps while cuo 2 has the lowest proportion according to the above results the non radical activation efficiency of ps was found to be associated with the surface area and chemical state of cuo cu2 h with more electron deficiency should be the active sites for non radical activation of ps cuo 1 and cuo 4 have relatively higher percentage of cu2 h 50 and 59 and so they have higher proportion of activated ps in the total consumed ps especially for cuo 4 it has the highest percentage of cu2 h and a much higher surface than cuo 1 and cuo 2 so it exhibited much higher activity than cuo 1 and cuo 2 for pollutants degradation although cuo 3 has a much lower percentage of cu2 h it has the largest surface area for instance the surface area of cuo 3 is about 2 9 times than that of cuo 4 while the percentage of cu2 h in cuo 4 is about 2 5 times than that in cuo 3 it can be estimated that the total content of surface cu2 h in cuo 3 is similar to that in cuo 4 hence cuo 3 and cuo 4 exhibited similar activity for non radical activation of ps as well as pollutants degradation although the percentage of cu2 h in cuo 1 is about 1 3 times than that in cuo 2 the surface area of cuo 2 is about 1 7 times than that of cuo 1 accordingly the total content of surface cu2 h in cuo 2 should be higher than that in cuo 1 and so cuo 2 exhibited higher activity than cuo 1 for non radical activation of ps and pollutants degradation 3 4 active species for pollutants degradation according to the above results both radical and non radical activation of ps occurred in the bicarbonate cuo ps process it is well known that so4 is generated via the cleavage of peroxy bond of ps in the radical activation pathway eq 1 oh can be generated through the reaction of so4 with oh eq 2 our recent work found that o2 can be generated via the cleavage of so bond of ps 27 33 in addition singlet oxygen 1o2 is frequently reported to be a possible active species for pollutants removal in ps activation process 28 34 35 in this process bicarbonate can react with these radicals to form hco3 eq 4 and 5 previous literature reported that h2o2 can be produced in the bicarbonate ps system 36 hco3 can react with h2o2 to form o2 o2 can react with oh and h2o2 to generate 1o2 35 36 accordingly various reactive species including so4 oh o2 1o2 hco3 and activated ps can be produced in the bicarbonate cuo ps process in order to identify the active species for pollutants degradation the influence of various scavengers on this process was investigated because cuo 2 exhibited the highest activity for orange ii degradation while cuo 3 for cephalexin and ofloxacin degradation they were used as the typical processes to perform the scavenger experiments 1 s2o8 2 cu2 so4 so4 2 cu3 2 so4 oh so4 2 oh 3 cu2 s2o8 2 2h2o cu 2hso4 o2 2h 4 so4 hco3 so4 hco3 5 oh hco3 oh hco3 6 oh o2 oh 1o2 7 oh h2o2 oh 1o2 oh ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba are effective scavengers for so4 and oh and the former has a much higher rate constant with so4 37 nan3 is an effective scavenger for 1o2 and oh with the rate constant of 1 109 and 1 2 1010 m l s l 38 39 respectively however the addition of tba etoh and nan3 with much higher concentrations than pollutants had little effect on pollutants degradation in the cuo ps processes with bicarbonate fig 8 indicating that so4 oh and 1o2 are not the active species although bicarbonate can react with so4 and oh to form hco3 its reaction rate constants are lower than that of etoh with these radicals 36 37 moreover the concentration of etoh used in this experiment was much higher than that of bicarbonate and it could significantly suppress the formation of hco3 however its addition had no effect on pollutants degradation indicating the contribution of hco3 is also excluded the active species were also identified by epr measurements using dmpo and temp no signals for so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were observed throughout this reaction further demonstrating that bicarbonate can effectively capture these radicals since 1o2 cannot be quenched by bicarbonate it might not be formed in this process it is interesting that the addition of tempol 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl significantly hindered the degradation of cephalexin and ofloxacin fig 8b and c tempol is an effective scavenger for o2 40 but o2 was not detected by epr measurements the inhibitory effect of some reagents could be ascribed to their competition for adsorption sites which might inhibited the surface reaction of target pollutants with active species however the scavengers used in this work had little effect on pollutants adsorption excluding the inhibitory effect from competing adsorption sites hence it can be assumed the inhibited degradation of cephalexin and ofloxacin by tempol might be due to their competition for activated ps this assumption was confirmed by another interesting phenomenon observed in the epr measurement using tempo 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxy as the probe as shown in fig 9 the signal of tempo can be observed in different systems but its intensity is quite different typically in the cuo 1 ps system the intensity of tempo decreased with reaction time fig 9a the result in fig 6 has demonstrated that ps is hardly decomposed by cuo 1 but can be activated via the non radical pathway therefore the decreased intensity of tempo could be attributed to the reaction between tempo and activated ps fig 9 b d show the signal intensity of tempo in different cuo ps systems at the same reaction time it can be seen that the signal intensity decreased with time in all cuo ps systems moreover the signal intensity at the same reaction time followed the order of cuo 3 cuo 4 cuo 2 cuo 1 this means that the amount of tempo degraded by activated ps followed the order of cuo 3 cuo 4 cuo 2 cuo 1 in other words the amount of activated ps generated by different catalyst should follow the order of cuo 3 cuo 4 cuo 2 cuo 1 this result agrees well with that presented in fig 7 therefore the inhibitory effect of tempol on cephalexin and ofloxacin degradation can be ascribed to the scavenging of activated ps activated ps should be the active species for the degradation of cephalexin and ofloxacin however the addition of tempol had little effect on orange ii degradation with cuo 2 fig 8a this phenomenon was also observed in the other three cuo systems since cuo 1 has very poor activity for ps decomposition activated ps should be responsible for orange ii degradation in its system it can be assumed that the rate constant of orange ii with activated ps is far higher than that of tempol which still needs further investigation in the future for comparison the effect of scavengers on the degradation of pollutants in the cuo ps processes without bicarbonate was also studied the result was similar to that in the bicarbonate cuo ps processes and ethanol only slightly hindered the degradation of pollutants this means that activated ps generated via the non radical way should also be the dominant reactive species at neutral ph without bicarbonate agreeing well with the result in our previous work 19 the high toc removal efficiency by bicarbonate cuo ps has demonstrated that activated ps can effectively oxidize not only these target pollutants but also their degradation products previous work reported that hco3 is a selective oxidant 36 41 42 although the reaction rate constants of hco3 with orange ii might be much lower than that of activated ps they might react readily with some degradation products of orange ii this can reduce the competition from the intermediates for activated ps thus more ps can react with the target pollutants thus the higher activity of cuo 2 for ps decomposition could lead to the formation of more hco3 which would cause the slightly higher degradation efficiency of orange ii finally the possible mechanism for ps activation with bicarbonate cuo was summarized as follow firstly ps is adsorbed on the cuo surface some of the adsorbed ps locate at the cu2 sites with more electron deficiency and can be activated through the non radical pathway eq 8 the activated ps has high oxidation ability and can effectively oxidize the target pollutants and their intermediates eq 9 after that the active sites on cuo can be recovered and can adsorb and activate new ps ions in addition some ps can be decomposed into so4 which can subsequently oxidize hco3 to hco3 hco3 is a more selective oxidant and might oxidize some intermediates as a result the target pollutants are almost completely degraded and a high toc removal efficiency is also achieved 8 cu2 s2o8 2 cu2 s2o8 2 9 cu2 s2o8 2 organics cu2 2so4 2 co2 h2o 4 conclusion four types of cuo samples were investigated as heterogeneous catalysts for ps activation in the presence of bicarbonate both radical and non radical activation of ps occurred in the bicarbonate cuo ps process cuo 2 exhibited the highest activity for ps decomposition and orange ii degradation while cuo 3 and cuo 4 exhibited higher activity for non radical activation of ps and degradation of cephalexin and ofloxacin activated ps should be the dominant reactive species for pollutants removal hco3 might participate in the oxidization of some intermediates cu2 h with more electron deficiency should be the active sites for non radical activation of ps tempo l could act as a scavenger probe for the determination of activated ps the catalyst after adsorption of ps can also be used for determining activated ps this work provides a new pathway for exploring the non radical activation process of ps and as well as the rational design of the corresponding catalyst declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by the foundation for

13851,one of the major environmental problems is the industrial waste called vinasse also known as distillery spent wash dsw produced in large amount by ethanol distilleries in this study we aimed at to improve the production of single cell oil sco using the oleaginous yeast yarrowia lipolytica mucl30108 on dsw and to determine the main factor influencing biomass production growth of y lipolytica was assessed on dsw with modifications of the effluent for biomass production chemical acid hydrolysis enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulases and hemicellulases or by mobilizing the hydrolytic tools of aspergillus niger mucl19001 were used as pretreatment to improve sugar release in the effluent and to improve yeast biomass production subsequently the impact of ph adjustment and of vitamins glucose and minerals supplementation was investigated to understand the specific nutritional and physiological limitations of the yeast biomass production the pretreatment of dsw with a niger cellular extracts provided the highest release of reducing sugars up to 5 65 g l principally composed of glucose and a 30 increase in yeast biomass production as compared to crude dsw additionally addition of potassium phosphate resulted in a significant improvement of the yeast biomass production reaching up to 70 increase as compared to crude dsw without affecting the lipid content of the yeast biomass the microbial lipids produced were mainly composed of fatty acids suitable for biodiesel valorisation globally our findings suggested that phosphate but not the carbon source was the major limiting

biodiesel distillery spent wash yarrowia lipolytica aspergillus niger oleaginous yeast microbial lipids 1 introduction rarefaction of fossil fuels has led to research for renewable energy sources among them biodiesel is of particular interest due to its ability to directly replace fossil diesel with only minor modifications of its energetic properties 1 global biodiesel production has been growing in recent years whereas in 2016 more than 30 8 million metric tons of biodiesel were produced worldwide with a global biodiesel market estimated at usd 28 04 billion the global biodiesel production is expected to increase up to 41 4 billion litres by 2025 2 3 the expansion of global biodiesel production will be driven by policies in place in the united states argentina brazil and indonesia and to a lesser extent the fulfilment of the red target in the european union that encourage the use and production of biofuels due to the perception that it could provide energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in relevant sectors 3 however biodiesel derived from conventional edible oil resources is limited by their quantities and their use leads to significant increase in feedstock prices to avoid these limitations the use of cheap and renewable feedstocks such as industrial effluents as a nutrient source to grow the oleaginous microorganisms is increasingly considered such raw materials have many advantages over other conventional resources in order to face up the economic and technological constraints which affect any biodiesel production process these industrial effluents are specially adapted to produce cheap and cleaner single cell oil for biodiesel using oleaginous microorganisms e g absence of competition with edible oil resources used in the food market possibility to scale up the production volume etc 4 biodiesel production using oleaginous microorganisms has shown much interest with respect to lipid yield and productivity 5 6 advantages of using microorganisms are their ability to metabolize complex medium such as industrial wastes and their rapid growth rate enabling reduction of biodiesel production cost and pollution 5 11 the lipids accumulated in the cells of oleaginous microorganisms also referred to as single cell oils sco have a fatty acids profile similar with those of vegetable oils which are generally used for biodiesel production 5 6 12 yarrowia lipolytica is widely recognised as a model species of oleaginous yeast its fully sequenced genome and well known metabolism gave it this status of a model of oleaginous yeast in research devoted to sco biosynthesis 7 13 19 oleaginous yeasts can synthesize lipids through two different biochemical pathways depending on the carbon substrate used in the culture medium 20 21 de novo lipid accumulation involves formation of acetyl coa resulting from the inhibition of the krebs cycle in sugar based media the ex novo route is characterized by incorporation of final products or intermediates of fatty acid β oxidation into triacylglycerol molecules in media containing hydrophobic carbon sources 20 21 the oleaginous yeasts accumulate a large amount of microbial oil under nutrient deprived stress conditions sco biosynthesis is favoured in nutritive media limited by nutritive sources other than carbon as such nitrogen limitation is notably recognized to trigger lipid accumulation in microbial systems 22 although other nutrient limitations such as sulfate or phosphate limitations are also effective 23 24 refined sugars are generally irreconcilable with industrial processes because of their high cost 5 25 therefore low cost raw materials such as raw glycerol industrial sugars ligno cellulosic residues and energy crops should be considered as substrates 26 31 sugarcane vinasse also known as distillery spent wash dsw is a complex liquid aqueous effluent produced by the sugar industries in most southern countries this waste stream contains large amount of organic and complex nutrients characterized by a high chemical oxygen demand cod and is produced in high quantity throughout the world making it a potential low cost nutrient source for industrial production of oleaginous microorganisms 4 29 31 global production of alcohol is expected to grow mainly because of the continuous development of bioethanol for energetic purpose 29 as a consequence a strong increase of the production of its main by product namely dsw which is responsible for the pollution of large natural areas 29 30 is also expected dsw contains nutrients in terms of potassium sulphur nitrogen and phosphorus as well as adequate amounts of micronutrients in previous studies using 28 fungal and yeast strains we highlighted the potential of this effluent as a low cost feedstock for microbial growth particularly with the fungal strain aspergillus niger mucl 19001 which resulted in production of high cell dry weight up to 24 05 g l dw on pure vinasse 30 31 however using the same effluent the oleaginous yeast yarrowia lipolytica mucl 30108 could only produce at best 4 g l of dry biomass and rather low lipid productivity 0 3 g l thus limiting its potential for biodiesel production as such in this effluent 30 in the field of yeast biomass and lipids much effort has been directed toward optimizing production with regard to this production of oleaginous yeast biomass can be improved by optimizing the physical parameters and nutritional constituents of the employed medium in this study we attempted to identify potential nutritional limitations that would allow to significantly increasie the biomass production of the yeast y lipolytica mucl 30108 when grown on dsw for biodiesel production pre treatment of the mash was performed using two methods namely i chemical acid hydrolysis of the effluent to provide nutrients amenable for easy assimilation by the yeast enzymatic systems and ii enzymatic hydrolysis with commercial cellulases and hemicellulases or by evaluating the potential of a niger mucl 19001 in the pre treatment of the effluent in fact our previous findings showing that a niger is able to produce high amounts of microbial biomass on this effluent revealed that it can make use of a larger panel of nutrient sources for its growth on raw dsw as compared to y lipolytica 31 a niger is a well known filamentous fungus which produces many intra and extracellular cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes that allow synergistic degradation of plant polymers and cell wall polysaccharides 32 33 hence mobilization of the hydrolytic tools of a niger to release fermentable nutrients from dsw was investigated in order to improve biomass production of the oleaginous yeast y lipolytica additionally we investigated the improvement of the culture medium through specific nutritional supplementations vitamins glucose oligo elements etc to identify potential nutritional limitations 2 materials and

conditions described hereafter 2 2 chemical and biological methods used for pre treatment of dsw 2 2 1 acid hydrolysis of whole dsw the whole stillage was subjected to acid hydrolysis with h2so4 at

dsw 2 2 2 enzymatic degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose from whole dsw degradation of complex polysaccharides such as cellulose and hemicellulose from raw dsw was carried out using commercial enzymatic cocktails namely cellic htec2 htec and cellic ctec2 ctec from novozymes pre treatment of dsw was carried out by incubation of 0 1 ml enzymatic cocktail htec or ctec with 20 ml of raw stillage during 72 h at 50 c and 140 rpm combined treatment with htec and ctec called hctec was done under similar conditions 0 1 ml htec 0 1 ml ctec for 20 ml total effluent the 72 h pretreated effluent was then heat sterilized 121 c 15 min and used as culture medium for growth and lipid production by y lipolytica under experimental conditions described above results were compared to those

deactivated enzymes before incubation with whole dsw in the same conditions as previously described dilution was mandatory due to solid precipitation at 95 c when pure enzymatic cocktail was used 2 2 3 pretreatement of dsw by aspergillus niger extracts a niger biomass was harvested after 3 days of growth in baffled flasks containing 50 ml of raw dsw after growth biomass was separated from liquid

filtered sterilized minisart 0 45 μm to provide the intracellular enzymatic extract ie of a niger pretreatment of dsw by the sn extracellular and ie intracellular extracts of a niger were carried out as follow for sn pre treatment 20 ml sn was added to 20 ml sterile lyophilized raw stillage for lyophilisation sterilized stillage in sterile conical tubes was frozen at 80 c overnight and then lyophilized during 48 h with a freeze dryer labconco freezone 2 5 l for ie pre treatment 4 ml of ie extract was added to 16 ml sterile distilled water and added to 20 ml sterile lyophilized raw stillage stillage was also treated with a combination of sn and ie where 16 ml sn and 4 ml ie were mixed with 20 ml sterile lyophilized raw vinasse the mixtures were then incubated for 72 h at 28 c

used as culture medium for growth of y lipolytica in conditions as described above results were compared to culture of y lipolytica on pure dsw 2 3 assessment of specific limitations of dsw for y lipolytica growth specific limitations of the raw dsw for y lipolytica growth were evaluated in five experimental conditions and two control experiments to explore the possible growth and nutrient limitations of the whole dsw based on its composition the effect of addition of vitamins on growth was explored adding filtered sterilized 1000x vitamin solution composed of myoinositol 25 g l

naoh before sterilization limitation of carbon of dsw was assessed by addition of 20 g l glucose before sterilization the overall inhibition effect of the stillage on growth was tested using yeast extract 10 g l peptone 20 g l and glucose 20 g l into whole dsw before sterilization named dsw ypd mineral limitation was also evaluated using kh2po4 7 g l and mgso4 1 5 g l effect of individual salt

results and discussion 3 1 improvement of biomass production and free fermentable sugars among the complex compounds present in raw dsw dark brown melanoidins phenols polyphenols tannic and humic acids caramels and furfurals are particularly notable 4 36 the chemical composition of pure dsw used in this study additional file 1 indicated that this effluent contains complex carbon sources that are potentially not metabolically accessible for the yeast their transformation into fermentable forms has been envisaged to improve digestibility of the effluent to increase the overall biomass production of the oleaginous yeast for instance reducing complex sugars into fermentable sugars is expected to help yeast growth and lipid production in an attempt to increase the level of free sugars in vinasse we tested different methods including chemical acid and enzymatic hydrolysis to improve the fermentable sugar content of the whole dsw for enzymatic hydrolysis we tested the effect of a commercial enzymatic complex commercial cellulase and hemicellulase as well as the effect of enzymatic extracts generated by the filamentous fungi a niger the results of this experiment are presented in table 1 the initial reducing sugars content in the crude effluent was evaluated as being approximately 12 5 g l using the 3 5 dns method table 1 and the total organic carbon content at 33 g l table b1 the chemical and enzymatic treatments applied to the crude dsw resulted in accumulation of reducing sugars from 1 48 g l for acid hydrolysis i e 14 11 g l total reducing sugars content to 5 65 g l i e 22 12 g l total reducing sugars content for combined extracellular and intracellular extracts of a niger pre cultivated on dsw comparing with the respective controls table 1 the low amount of free sugars released from acid hydrolysis may result from interactions between sugars and other components of the stillage such as melanoidins and others maillard reaction products 36 the conditions for such reaction are indeed favourable at low ph ph 4 7 relatively high temperature 50 c and in the presence of nitrogenous compounds cellulose and hemicellulose are sugar polymers involved in cell wall composition of sugarcane they are present in the milling step and are generally removed from the process as dried biomass also known as bagasse to produce electricity however a fraction of it could pass through the process and remain in the end stream bagasse from sugarcane milling has been investigated as a source of carbon for microbial growth 37 this process requires the use of cellulolytic enzymes and is known to release free sugars that microorganisms can use for growth hydrolytic enzymes are therefore expected to reduce the cellulosic fraction of dsw into fermentable carbon sources for microbial growth our results indeed showed that cellulase ctec hemicellulase htec and a combination of both hctec were able to release reducing sugars from 2 10 to 4 79 g l of reducing sugars production comparing with the respective controls table 1 surprisingly combination of both enzymes did not provide higher reducing sugar release than individual celullases treatment but higher than htec suggesting that hemicellulases did not completely degrade the available polymers and need further addition of cellulases sugar release profile along time showed a first increase in sugar concentration followed by a decrease after 3 h treatment data not shown when htec was used as standalone or in combination with ctec suggesting that a polymerization of simple sugars could occur due to a probable polymerizing activity of htec and explaining the lower reducing sugar yield obtained with this enzymatic preparation the yeast biomass production in g l plus the comparison with control are indicated in the table 1 pre treatment of dsw with ctec and htec increased the y lipolytica biomass production by 12 and 16 respectively when used alone and by 27 when used in combination hctec as compared to non treated dsw this result proved that both treatments with cellulases and hemicellulases are working synergistically and combined their effect to improve yeast biomass production despite the lower amount of reducing sugars released by the combined treatment hctec as compare to ctec treatment alone this result suggests that the molecules released through the combined treatment are optimally used by the yeast for its growth in sum other assimilable carbon sources than glucose e g sugars peptides present in the growth medium as well as the organics acids probably produced during the fermentation certainly contributed to the growth of the yeast treatment of the whole dsw with extracellular sn and intracellular ie extracts of a niger pre cultivated on raw dsw produced the highest sugar release among the hydrolytic treatments tested in fact the dsw treated with the supernatant sn of a niger containing the extracellular enzymes released 3 17 g l of reducing sugars production while the effluent treated with the a niger intracellular extract ie released 4 16 g l of reducing sugars production comparing with the respective control the dsw treated with a combination of both extracellular and intracellular extracts of a niger culture sn ie released even higher reducing sugars 5 65 g l comparing with the respective control table 1 these results showed that complex carbon sources in dsw can be degraded into free reducing sugars the fungal metabolites such as β glucosidase hemicellulases etc contained in the extra and intra cellular extracts of a niger probably degraded part of the same substrate as shown by the lower observed yield when using both combined treatments as compared to the sum of the two separated treatments this result suggests a combined action of both extracts during the dsw degradation process a niger is known for its ability to degrade large spectrum of polymerised substrates including cellulosic and complex organic molecules thanks to a large set of hydrolytic enzymes 30 33 our results suggested that extra and intra cellular extracts of a niger degraded more than just cellulosic substrates in the spent wash because higher amount of reducing sugars where released by this method than using commercial cellulolytic enzymes these fungal enzymatic preparations could hence represent an interesting alternative to increase digestibility of distillery spent wash the cultivation of y lipolytica in pre treated dsw with extra and intra cellular extracts of a niger yielded different amount of biomass depending on the method used table 1 dsw pre treatment with extracellular extract sn was not able to improve the yeast biomass production whereas treatment with intracellular extract ie yielded to a moderate biomass increase comparing with the respective controls unexpectedly the use of combined fractions sn ie yielded a 30 improvement in the yeast biomass production i e 9 43 g l of biomass as compared to the biomass yield obtained in the respective control during growth of a niger on vinasse a number of enzymes are produced intracellularly for one part and extracellularly for the other part thus the excreted sn fraction probably contained enzymes that degraded high molecular weight polysaccharides present in the medium into oligosaccharides these smaller polymers can then enter the cytoplasm of a niger and get degraded by the ie enzymes produced by a niger into sugar monomers during the yeast growth on pre treated dsw in the presence of these a niger enzymatic extracts the oligosaccharides resulting from digestion with the sn fraction are probably not transported into the cytoplasm as shown by the low biomass produced when sn was used alone in contrast when ie extract is added biomass increase was observed probably due to the production of a higher reducing sugar yield to our knowledge there are currently no studies on the intracellular and extracellular production of the hydrolytic enzymes produced by the fungus a niger in dsw cultures polysaccharides are the largest carbonated compounds of the vinasse to study its degradation analysis of the sugar released after hydrolytic treatments have been carried out using high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detector hpaec pad separation techniques the non identified polysaccharide fractions of soluble sugars represented the major part of the carbon source in the effluent first their presence was checked in the centrifuged effluent using pa100 column and their degradability using chemical acid hydrolysis then a second column pa1 was used to characterize more precisely the composition of the acid hydrolyzed dsw the results of this experiment are presented in fig 1 it is clear from the hpaec pad profile of the acid hydrolyzed dsw eluted using the first pa100 column that the peak detected at 28 min of retention time in raw dsw fig 1 a 1 disappeared after chemical acid hydrolysis fig 1 b 1 while another peak appeared at 3 min on the hpaec pad profile of the acid hydrolyzed dsw fig 1 b 1 with the first pa100 column polysaccharides were generally eluted according to their molecular weight indicating that the late peak probably corresponds to polymers of the earlier peak results obtained using the second pa1 column fig 1 a 2 b 2 allowed us to identify the major peak observed in the acid hydrolyzed dsw as glucose fig 1 b 2 other lower intensity peaks were also identified as arabinose xylose and galactose acid hydrolysis was clearly able to degrade polysaccharides fractions into simpler and metabolizable sugars we showed earlier that pre treatment of raw dsw with combination of cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes hctec treatment or with combined enzymes present in intra and extra cellular extracts from a niger sn ie treatment were also able to release reducing sugars for the improvement of yeast biomass production in order to determine which sugars are released by the different hydrolytic treatments the peaks were identified and their intensity was compared with those of the respective control experiment fig 2 similar sugar release profiles were depicted for the three hydrolytic treatments namely effluent treated through chemical acid hydrolysis treated with a combination of commercial cellulases and hemicellulases or treated with combination of extra and intra cellular enzymes from a niger extracts fo which a major glucose released peak was found with an intensity comprised between 54 4 and 61 nc fig 2 among the minor peaks fructose and trehalose were measured at lower intensity on the pre treated dsw than for controls whereas arabinose galactose and xylose were found in higher amounts on the pre treated dsw as compared to control experiments for each of the three hydrolytic treatments from this result it could be concluded that each treatment yielded the same degradation of the carbonaceous matters present in the effluent 3 2 search for the limiting factor pre treated dsw led to higher y lipolytica biomass production than raw dsw concomitantly with production of reducing and fermentable sugars to check whether the sugar release was the main factor influencing yeast biomass production in dsw we tested yeast growth upon addition of external glucose as well as vitamins ph or salt deficiency results are presented in fig 3 the overall inhibition effect of the stillage was assessed by growing y lipolytica in dsw containing dissolved ypd powder i e dsw ypd in fig 3 biomass production under such conditions was higher than when cultured in standard ypd medium and even higher than the sum of the biomass obtained in separate dsw and ypd media this result suggests that the presence of recalcitrant compounds such as melanoidins phenols polyphenols tannic and humic acids caramels and furfurals in raw dsw do not generate inhibition of the y lipolytica growth in liquid medium with improved nutrients such as the one contained in ypd our results also demonstrated that the main factor affecting significantly the yeast biomass production on pre treated dsw was the addition of salts fig 3 namely when potassium phosphate and magnesium sulphate salts were added to a final concentration of 7 0 and 1 5 g l in pure dsw respectively these two salts were chosen because of the low concentration of phosphate and magnesium identified in the raw dsw composition additional file 1 surprisingly glucose addition dsw glucose 2 did not have a significant effect on biomass production showing that carbon sources naturally present in dsw are not the limiting factor for the growth of the yeast in dsw fig 3 this in turns has argued against the hypothesis of a fermentable carbon deficiency in dsw likewise addition of vitamins or ph adjustment at 7 0 in the raw dsw did not have a significant effect on yeast biomass production fig 3 in order to assess the effect of salt limitation we tested the impact of addition in raw dsw of potassium phosphate and magnesium sulphate salts on yeast biomass production the yeast biomass production was evaluated using surface response methodology for a combination of both salts fig 4 the potassium phosphate concentration was varied from 0 to 14 g l and the magnesium sulphate concentration from 0 to 3 g l under such conditions the maximum biomass production was found to be particularly impacted when potassium phosphate concentration was increased as compared to the other salt the maximum y lipolytica biomass production was set at 7 34 g l meaning a 70 increase in biomass production as compared to raw dsw table b2 when 7 0 and 1 5 g l of potassium phosphate and magnesium sulphate were added to the stillage respectively certainly y lipolytica doesn t need so high quantities of kh2po4 and mgso4 notwithstanding the supplementation of the effluent with adequate concentration of these two salts has a strong impact on the yeast growth one possibility is that these salts may create a buffered medium allowing yeast to grow after all it is known that in the de novo lipid accumulation citric acid is the donor of acetyl coa in the cytoplasm 38 39 for this reason the growth of oleaginous microorganisms like y lipolytica is often accompanied by the secretion of citric acid in the growth medium and after the depletion of the carbon source in the medium citric acid is re consumed 40 the flux of citric acid in the growth medium probably depends on the activity of atp cl therefore if the yeast growth in unbuffered media that can result from the lack of these salts in raw effluent was the main limiting factor for the yeast the growth should be strongly inhibited by the low ph due to citric acid secretion during fermentation however from the result of a previous experiment performed with y lipolytica in raw dsw by monitoring the ph of the broth in 2 l bioreactor fig a1 30 our results showed that no acidification of the broth i e no ph decrease was occurred during fermentation in dsw in fact the ph of the broth increases from initial value of 5 0 raw dsw may probably contain citric acid to the final ph 8 0 at 72 h probably due to consumption of other organic acids e g isocitric transaconitic acids present in the medium as previously reported 31 it was demonstrated that the ph of the broth still increased even after cell growth completed and stopped at about 24 h with a corresponding ph of the broth set at 5 5 therefore assessment of specific limiting factors for growth of the yeast in raw dsw revealed that phosphate salt but not carbon is probably the major limiting factor we already seen that the use of extra and intra cellular extracts from a niger on raw dsw led to similar biomass enhancement suggesting that phosphate compounds are probably released during the enzymatic treatment however phosphate concentration was low in the dsw supernatant hence phosphate may be present in solid fraction of sugarcane vinasse solid forms of phosphate known as apatite have low reactivity thus limiting their use for microbial growth numerous fungi belonging to penicillium species have showed their ability to solubilize these phosphate rocks 41 and a niger have demonstrated ability to solubilize fluorapatite in vinasse medium 42 from these results it can be hypothesized that solid fractions of dsw contain solid form of phosphate which can be solubilized and metabolised for growth of a niger and probably also caused the y lipolytica growth improvement observed using the extra intracellular extracts of a niger 3 3 lipid composition the effect of potassium phosphate kh2po4 on lipid composition of y lipolytica cells grown in pre treated vinasse was assessed through analysis of changes in total lipids composition evaluated by thin layer chromatography analysis and on fatty acid composition determined by gas chromatography analysis of the lipid transesterification products i e fatty acid methyl esters fame of the yeast cells grown on dsw with or without kh2po4 supplementation at 7 0 g l and the results are shown in table 2 addition of potassium phosphate to raw dsw yielded to a higher total lipid content of 9 15 in the yeast biomass as compared to raw vinasse which contained 7 28 of lipids the salt supplementation did not affected composition of the different lipids produced in the yeast cells indeed the lipid composition and the fatty acid profile did not differ from the lipid composition of the same biomass grown on raw dsw table 2 the major lipids were phospholipids near 34 of total lipids with or without kh2po4 supplementation whereas triacylglycerols tags and free fatty acids ffas represented from 34 to 38 of total lipids as phospholipids contain fatty acids the total saponifiable fraction of lipids in the yeast biomass reached up to 72 of total lipids the main fatty acids identified were linoleic acid c18 2 n 6 31 33 4 oleic acid c18 1 n 9 25 4 28 1 and palmitic acid c16 0 19 20 7 thus representing more than 80 of total fatty acids the fatty acid composition is similar to those from conventional microbial and plant oils 34 43 the low lipid content of the yeast biomass might be attributed to the low c n ratio equivalent to 24 5 of the dsw used in this study in fact lipids accumulation is usually triggered by nitrogen starvation with high c n ratio such as up to 70 20 22 44 however phosphate limitation has earlier been reported to favour lipid accumulation in some microorganisms 23 in this case we expected a higher lipid content in raw than in supplemented dsw further study of the dynamic of lipid accumulation in dsw should therefore be carried out to better understand the reasons of this lack of accumulation 4 conclusion distillery spent wash is a complex industrial effluent containing valuable nutritive resources the aim of this study was to develop a new engineering approach to improve the production of single cell oil from vinasse using the oleaginous yeast y lipolytica the yeast can be grown in dsw and an improvement of the biomass production was achieved using bulk treatment consisting of culture supernatant and intracellular enzymatic extracts from aspergillus niger the fungal extract treatments upgrade the digestibility of dsw furthermore a significant increase 70 of the yeast biomass was obtained in the culture medium by the addition of potassium phosphate in raw dsw composition of sco produced by the yeast on treated or supplemented dsw remained unchanged and the sco are mainly composed of saponifiable lipids suitable

13851,one of the major environmental problems is the industrial waste called vinasse also known as distillery spent wash dsw produced in large amount by ethanol distilleries in this study we aimed at to improve the production of single cell oil sco using the oleaginous yeast yarrowia lipolytica mucl30108 on dsw and to determine the main factor influencing biomass production growth of y lipolytica was assessed on dsw with modifications of the effluent for biomass production chemical acid hydrolysis enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulases and hemicellulases or by mobilizing the hydrolytic tools of aspergillus niger mucl19001 were used as pretreatment to improve sugar release in the effluent and to improve yeast biomass production subsequently the impact of ph adjustment and of vitamins glucose and minerals supplementation was investigated to understand the specific nutritional and physiological limitations of the yeast biomass production the pretreatment of dsw with a niger cellular extracts provided the highest release of reducing sugars up to 5 65 g l principally composed of glucose and a 30 increase in yeast biomass production as compared to crude dsw additionally addition of potassium phosphate resulted in a significant improvement of the yeast biomass production reaching up to 70 increase as compared to crude dsw without affecting the lipid content of the yeast biomass the microbial lipids produced were mainly composed of fatty acids suitable for biodiesel valorisation globally our findings suggested that phosphate but not the carbon source was the major limiting

biodiesel distillery spent wash yarrowia lipolytica aspergillus niger oleaginous yeast microbial lipids 1 introduction rarefaction of fossil fuels has led to research for renewable energy sources among them biodiesel is of particular interest due to its ability to directly replace fossil diesel with only minor modifications of its energetic properties 1 global biodiesel production has been growing in recent years whereas in 2016 more than 30 8 million metric tons of biodiesel were produced worldwide with a global biodiesel market estimated at usd 28 04 billion the global biodiesel production is expected to increase up to 41 4 billion litres by 2025 2 3 the expansion of global biodiesel production will be driven by policies in place in the united states argentina brazil and indonesia and to a lesser extent the fulfilment of the red target in the european union that encourage the use and production of biofuels due to the perception that it could provide energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in relevant sectors 3 however biodiesel derived from conventional edible oil resources is limited by their quantities and their use leads to significant increase in feedstock prices to avoid these limitations the use of cheap and renewable feedstocks such as industrial effluents as a nutrient source to grow the oleaginous microorganisms is increasingly considered such raw materials have many advantages over other conventional resources in order to face up the economic and technological constraints which affect any biodiesel production process these industrial effluents are specially adapted to produce cheap and cleaner single cell oil for biodiesel using oleaginous microorganisms e g absence of competition with edible oil resources used in the food market possibility to scale up the production volume etc 4 biodiesel production using oleaginous microorganisms has shown much interest with respect to lipid yield and productivity 5 6 advantages of using microorganisms are their ability to metabolize complex medium such as industrial wastes and their rapid growth rate enabling reduction of biodiesel production cost and pollution 5 11 the lipids accumulated in the cells of oleaginous microorganisms also referred to as single cell oils sco have a fatty acids profile similar with those of vegetable oils which are generally used for biodiesel production 5 6 12 yarrowia lipolytica is widely recognised as a model species of oleaginous yeast its fully sequenced genome and well known metabolism gave it this status of a model of oleaginous yeast in research devoted to sco biosynthesis 7 13 19 oleaginous yeasts can synthesize lipids through two different biochemical pathways depending on the carbon substrate used in the culture medium 20 21 de novo lipid accumulation involves formation of acetyl coa resulting from the inhibition of the krebs cycle in sugar based media the ex novo route is characterized by incorporation of final products or intermediates of fatty acid β oxidation into triacylglycerol molecules in media containing hydrophobic carbon sources 20 21 the oleaginous yeasts accumulate a large amount of microbial oil under nutrient deprived stress conditions sco biosynthesis is favoured in nutritive media limited by nutritive sources other than carbon as such nitrogen limitation is notably recognized to trigger lipid accumulation in microbial systems 22 although other nutrient limitations such as sulfate or phosphate limitations are also effective 23 24 refined sugars are generally irreconcilable with industrial processes because of their high cost 5 25 therefore low cost raw materials such as raw glycerol industrial sugars ligno cellulosic residues and energy crops should be considered as substrates 26 31 sugarcane vinasse also known as distillery spent wash dsw is a complex liquid aqueous effluent produced by the sugar industries in most southern countries this waste stream contains large amount of organic and complex nutrients characterized by a high chemical oxygen demand cod and is produced in high quantity throughout the world making it a potential low cost nutrient source for industrial production of oleaginous microorganisms 4 29 31 global production of alcohol is expected to grow mainly because of the continuous development of bioethanol for energetic purpose 29 as a consequence a strong increase of the production of its main by product namely dsw which is responsible for the pollution of large natural areas 29 30 is also expected dsw contains nutrients in terms of potassium sulphur nitrogen and phosphorus as well as adequate amounts of micronutrients in previous studies using 28 fungal and yeast strains we highlighted the potential of this effluent as a low cost feedstock for microbial growth particularly with the fungal strain aspergillus niger mucl 19001 which resulted in production of high cell dry weight up to 24 05 g l dw on pure vinasse 30 31 however using the same effluent the oleaginous yeast yarrowia lipolytica mucl 30108 could only produce at best 4 g l of dry biomass and rather low lipid productivity 0 3 g l thus limiting its potential for biodiesel production as such in this effluent 30 in the field of yeast biomass and lipids much effort has been directed toward optimizing production with regard to this production of oleaginous yeast biomass can be improved by optimizing the physical parameters and nutritional constituents of the employed medium in this study we attempted to identify potential nutritional limitations that would allow to significantly increasie the biomass production of the yeast y lipolytica mucl 30108 when grown on dsw for biodiesel production pre treatment of the mash was performed using two methods namely i chemical acid hydrolysis of the effluent to provide nutrients amenable for easy assimilation by the yeast enzymatic systems and ii enzymatic hydrolysis with commercial cellulases and hemicellulases or by evaluating the potential of a niger mucl 19001 in the pre treatment of the effluent in fact our previous findings showing that a niger is able to produce high amounts of microbial biomass on this effluent revealed that it can make use of a larger panel of nutrient sources for its growth on raw dsw as compared to y lipolytica 31 a niger is a well known filamentous fungus which produces many intra and extracellular cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes that allow synergistic degradation of plant polymers and cell wall polysaccharides 32 33 hence mobilization of the hydrolytic tools of a niger to release fermentable nutrients from dsw was investigated in order to improve biomass production of the oleaginous yeast y lipolytica additionally we investigated the improvement of the culture medium through specific nutritional supplementations vitamins glucose oligo elements etc to identify potential nutritional limitations 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw material strains and culture conditions production batches of raw dsw from the sugarcane obtained from the french company distillerie rivière du mât saint benoit reunion france were used aspergillus niger mucl 19001 and yarrowia lipolytica mucl 30108 were obtained from the mycothèque de l université catholique de louvain mucl the yeast y lipolytica strain was pre grown on 5 ml

a niger was used for pre treatment of the stillage flasks were inoculated with 105 yeast cells or fungal spores ml and incubated in a rotary incubator shaker at 28 c 150 rpm for 96 h cultures of y lipolytica and a niger were performed in 250 ml baffled shaked flasks containing each 50 ml heat sterilized 121 c 20 min sugarcane distillery spent wash raw dsw or pretreated dsw in the various conditions described hereafter 2 2 chemical and biological methods used for pre treatment of dsw 2 2 1 acid hydrolysis of whole dsw the whole stillage was subjected to acid hydrolysis with h2so4 at final concentration of 0 5 m 120 c during 1 5 h before being neutralized with 1 m naoh and centrifuged 8000 rpm 15 min prior to filter sterilization minisart 0 45 μm of the supernatant the sterile supernatant was used as culture medium for growth and lipid production by y lipolytica in culture conditions as described above results were compared to those obtained by y lipolytica culture on raw dsw 2 2 2 enzymatic degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose from whole dsw degradation of complex polysaccharides such as cellulose and hemicellulose from raw dsw was carried out using commercial enzymatic cocktails namely cellic htec2 htec and cellic ctec2 ctec from novozymes pre treatment of dsw was carried out by incubation of 0 1 ml enzymatic cocktail htec or ctec with 20 ml of raw stillage during 72 h at 50 c and 140 rpm combined treatment with htec and ctec called hctec was done under similar conditions 0 1 ml htec 0 1 ml ctec for 20 ml total effluent the 72 h pretreated effluent was then heat sterilized 121 c 15 min and used as culture medium for growth and lipid production by y lipolytica under experimental conditions described above results were compared to those obtained by y lipolytica culture on raw dsw negative controls consisted of 1 10 dilution of 0 1 ml enzymatic cocktail in distilled water 1 ml final volume heated at 95 c for 10 min i e thermally deactivated enzymes before incubation with whole dsw in the same conditions as previously described dilution was mandatory due to solid precipitation at 95 c when pure enzymatic cocktail was used 2 2 3 pretreatement of dsw by aspergillus niger extracts a niger biomass was harvested after 3 days of growth in baffled flasks containing 50 ml of raw dsw after growth biomass was separated from liquid through buchner filtration using whatman n 1 filter the filtrate or supernatant sn containing the extracellular metabolites of a niger was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c and filtered sterilized minisart 0 45 μm the biomass of a niger was washed twice using distilled water then re suspended in 10 ml tris hcl 50 mm nacl 300 mm buffer and the intracellular metabolites were extracted by sonication in ice bath 5 x 20 s at 180 w 20 khz and 4 min cooling in ice the intracellular metabolites were separated from the cell pellet through centrifugation 8000 rpm 15 min and further filtered sterilized minisart 0 45 μm to provide the intracellular enzymatic extract ie of a niger pretreatment of dsw by the sn extracellular and ie intracellular extracts of a niger were carried out as follow for sn pre treatment 20 ml sn was added to 20 ml sterile lyophilized raw stillage for lyophilisation sterilized stillage in sterile conical tubes was frozen at 80 c overnight and then

results and discussion 3 1 improvement of biomass production and free fermentable sugars among the complex compounds present in raw dsw dark brown melanoidins phenols polyphenols tannic and humic acids caramels and furfurals are particularly notable 4 36 the chemical composition of pure dsw used in this study additional file 1 indicated that this effluent contains complex carbon sources that are potentially not metabolically accessible for the yeast their transformation into fermentable forms has been envisaged to improve digestibility of the effluent to increase the overall biomass production of the oleaginous yeast for instance reducing complex sugars into fermentable sugars is expected to help yeast growth and lipid production in an attempt to increase the level of free sugars in vinasse we tested different methods including chemical acid and enzymatic hydrolysis to improve the fermentable sugar content of the whole dsw for enzymatic hydrolysis we tested the effect of a commercial enzymatic complex commercial cellulase and hemicellulase as well as the effect of enzymatic extracts generated by the filamentous fungi a niger the results of this experiment are presented in table 1 the initial reducing sugars content in the crude effluent was evaluated as being approximately 12 5 g l using the 3 5 dns method table 1 and the total organic carbon content at 33 g l table b1 the chemical and enzymatic treatments applied to the crude dsw resulted in accumulation of reducing sugars from 1 48 g l for acid hydrolysis i e 14 11 g l total reducing sugars content to 5 65 g l i e 22 12 g l total reducing sugars content for combined extracellular and intracellular extracts of a niger pre cultivated on dsw comparing with the respective controls table 1 the low amount of free sugars released from acid hydrolysis may result from interactions between sugars and other components of the stillage such as melanoidins and others maillard reaction products 36 the conditions for such reaction are indeed favourable at low ph ph 4 7 relatively high temperature 50 c and in the presence of nitrogenous compounds cellulose and hemicellulose are sugar polymers involved in cell wall composition of sugarcane they are present in the milling step and are generally removed from the process as dried biomass also known as bagasse to produce electricity however a fraction of it could pass through the process and remain in the end stream bagasse from sugarcane milling has been investigated as a source of carbon for microbial growth 37 this process requires the use of cellulolytic enzymes and is known to release free sugars that microorganisms can use for growth hydrolytic enzymes are therefore expected to reduce the cellulosic fraction of dsw into fermentable carbon sources for microbial growth our results indeed showed that cellulase ctec hemicellulase htec and a combination of both hctec were able to release reducing sugars from 2 10 to 4 79 g l of reducing sugars production comparing with the respective controls table 1 surprisingly combination of both enzymes did not provide higher reducing sugar release than individual celullases treatment but higher than htec suggesting that hemicellulases did not completely degrade the available polymers and need further addition of cellulases sugar release profile along time showed a first increase in sugar concentration followed by a decrease after 3 h treatment data not shown when htec was used as standalone or in combination with ctec suggesting that a polymerization of simple sugars could occur due to a probable polymerizing activity of htec and explaining the lower reducing sugar yield obtained with this enzymatic preparation the yeast biomass production in g l plus the comparison with control are indicated in the table 1 pre treatment of dsw with ctec and htec increased the y lipolytica biomass production by 12 and 16 respectively when used alone and by 27 when used in combination hctec as compared to non treated dsw this result proved that both treatments with cellulases and hemicellulases are working synergistically and combined their effect to improve yeast biomass production despite the lower amount of reducing sugars released by the combined treatment hctec as compare to ctec treatment alone this result suggests that the molecules released through the combined treatment are optimally used by the yeast for its growth in sum other assimilable carbon sources than glucose e g sugars peptides present in the growth medium as well as the organics acids probably produced during the fermentation certainly contributed to the growth of the yeast treatment of the whole dsw with extracellular sn and intracellular ie extracts of a niger pre cultivated on raw dsw produced the highest sugar release among the hydrolytic treatments tested in fact the dsw treated with the supernatant sn of a niger containing the extracellular enzymes released 3 17 g l of reducing sugars production while the effluent treated with the a niger intracellular extract ie released 4 16 g l of reducing sugars production comparing with the respective control the dsw treated with a combination of both extracellular and intracellular extracts of a niger culture sn ie released even higher reducing sugars 5 65 g l comparing with the respective control table 1 these results showed that complex carbon sources in dsw can be degraded into free reducing sugars the fungal metabolites such as β glucosidase hemicellulases etc contained in the extra and intra cellular extracts of a niger probably degraded part of the same substrate as shown by the lower observed yield when using both combined treatments as compared to the sum of the two separated treatments this result suggests a combined action of both extracts during the dsw degradation process a niger is known for its ability to degrade large spectrum of polymerised substrates including cellulosic and complex organic molecules thanks to a large set of hydrolytic enzymes 30 33 our results suggested that extra and intra cellular extracts of a niger degraded more than just cellulosic substrates in the spent wash because higher amount of reducing sugars where released by this method than using commercial cellulolytic enzymes these fungal enzymatic preparations could hence represent an interesting alternative to increase digestibility of distillery spent wash the cultivation of y lipolytica in pre treated dsw with extra and intra cellular extracts of a niger yielded different amount of biomass depending on the method used table 1 dsw pre treatment with extracellular extract sn was not able to improve the yeast biomass production whereas treatment with intracellular extract ie yielded to a moderate biomass increase comparing with the respective controls unexpectedly the use of combined fractions sn ie yielded a 30 improvement in the yeast biomass production i e 9 43 g l of biomass as compared to the biomass yield obtained in the respective control during growth of a niger on vinasse a number of enzymes are produced intracellularly for one part and extracellularly for the other part thus the excreted sn fraction probably contained enzymes that degraded high molecular weight polysaccharides present in the medium into oligosaccharides these smaller polymers can then enter the cytoplasm of a niger and get degraded by the ie enzymes produced by a niger into sugar monomers during the yeast growth on pre treated dsw in the presence of these a niger enzymatic extracts the oligosaccharides resulting from digestion with the sn fraction are probably not transported into the cytoplasm as shown by the low biomass produced when sn was used alone in contrast when ie extract is added biomass increase was observed probably due to the production of a higher reducing sugar yield to our knowledge there are currently no studies on the intracellular and extracellular production of the hydrolytic enzymes produced by the fungus a niger in dsw cultures polysaccharides are the largest carbonated compounds of the vinasse to study its degradation analysis of the sugar released after hydrolytic treatments have been carried out using high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detector hpaec pad separation techniques the non identified polysaccharide fractions of soluble sugars represented the major part of the carbon source in the effluent first their presence was checked in the centrifuged effluent using pa100 column and their degradability using chemical acid hydrolysis then a second column pa1 was used to characterize more precisely the composition of the acid hydrolyzed dsw the results of this experiment are presented in fig 1 it is clear from the hpaec pad profile of the acid hydrolyzed dsw eluted using the first pa100 column that the peak detected at 28 min of retention time in raw dsw fig 1 a 1 disappeared after chemical acid hydrolysis fig 1 b 1 while another peak appeared at 3 min on the hpaec pad profile of the acid hydrolyzed dsw fig 1 b 1 with the first pa100 column polysaccharides were generally eluted according to their molecular weight indicating that the late peak probably corresponds to polymers of the earlier peak results obtained using the second pa1 column fig 1 a 2 b 2 allowed us to identify the major peak observed in the acid hydrolyzed dsw as glucose fig 1 b 2 other lower intensity peaks were also identified as arabinose xylose and galactose acid hydrolysis was clearly able to degrade polysaccharides fractions into simpler and metabolizable sugars we showed earlier that pre treatment of raw dsw with combination of cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes hctec treatment or with combined enzymes present in intra and extra cellular extracts from a niger sn ie treatment were also able to release reducing sugars for the improvement of yeast biomass production in order to determine which sugars are released by the different hydrolytic treatments the peaks were identified and their intensity was compared with those of the respective control experiment fig 2 similar sugar release profiles were depicted for the three hydrolytic treatments namely effluent treated through chemical acid hydrolysis treated with a combination of commercial cellulases and hemicellulases or treated with combination of extra and intra cellular enzymes from a niger extracts fo which a major glucose released peak was found with an intensity comprised between 54 4 and 61 nc fig 2 among the minor peaks fructose and trehalose were measured at lower intensity on the pre treated dsw than for controls whereas arabinose galactose and xylose were found in higher amounts on the pre treated dsw as compared to control experiments for each of the three hydrolytic treatments from this result it could be concluded that each treatment yielded the same degradation of the carbonaceous matters present in the effluent 3 2 search for the limiting factor pre treated dsw led to higher y lipolytica biomass production than raw dsw concomitantly with production of reducing and fermentable sugars to check whether the sugar release was the main factor influencing yeast biomass production in dsw we tested yeast growth upon addition of external glucose as well as vitamins ph or salt deficiency results are presented in fig 3 the overall inhibition effect of the stillage was assessed by growing y lipolytica in dsw containing dissolved ypd powder i e dsw ypd in fig 3 biomass production under such conditions was higher than when cultured in standard ypd medium and even higher than the sum of the biomass obtained in separate dsw and ypd media this result suggests that the presence of recalcitrant compounds such as melanoidins phenols polyphenols tannic and humic acids caramels and furfurals in raw dsw do not generate inhibition of the y lipolytica growth in liquid medium with improved nutrients such as the one contained in ypd our results also demonstrated that the main factor affecting significantly the yeast biomass production on pre treated dsw was the addition of salts fig 3 namely when potassium phosphate and magnesium sulphate salts were added to a final concentration of 7 0 and 1 5 g l in pure dsw respectively these two salts were chosen because of the low concentration of phosphate and magnesium identified in the raw dsw composition additional file 1 surprisingly glucose addition dsw glucose 2 did not have a significant effect on biomass production showing that carbon sources naturally present in dsw are not the limiting factor for the growth of the yeast in dsw fig 3 this in turns has argued against the hypothesis of a fermentable carbon deficiency in dsw likewise addition of vitamins or ph adjustment at 7 0 in the raw dsw did not have a significant effect on yeast biomass production fig 3 in order to assess the effect of salt limitation we tested the impact of addition in raw dsw of potassium phosphate and magnesium sulphate salts on yeast biomass production the yeast biomass production was evaluated using surface response methodology for a combination of both salts fig 4 the potassium phosphate concentration was varied from 0 to 14 g l and the magnesium sulphate concentration from 0 to 3 g l under such conditions the maximum biomass production was found to be particularly impacted when potassium phosphate concentration was increased as compared to the other salt the maximum y lipolytica biomass production was set at 7 34 g l meaning a 70 increase in biomass production as compared to raw dsw table b2 when 7 0 and 1 5 g l of potassium phosphate and magnesium sulphate were added to the stillage respectively certainly y lipolytica doesn t need so high quantities of kh2po4 and mgso4 notwithstanding the supplementation of the effluent with adequate concentration of these two salts has a strong impact on the yeast growth one possibility is that these salts may create a buffered medium allowing yeast to grow after all it is known that in the de novo lipid accumulation citric acid is the donor of acetyl coa in the cytoplasm 38 39 for this reason the growth of oleaginous microorganisms like y lipolytica is often accompanied by the secretion of citric acid in the growth medium and after the depletion of the carbon source in the medium citric acid is re consumed 40 the flux of citric acid in the growth medium probably depends on the activity of atp cl therefore if the yeast growth in unbuffered media that can result from the lack of these salts in raw effluent was the main limiting factor for the yeast the growth should be strongly inhibited by the low ph due to citric acid secretion during fermentation however from the result of a previous experiment performed with y lipolytica in raw dsw by monitoring the ph of the broth in 2 l bioreactor fig a1 30 our results showed that no acidification of the broth i e no ph decrease was occurred during fermentation in dsw in fact the ph of the broth increases from initial value of 5 0 raw dsw may probably contain citric acid to the final ph 8 0 at 72 h probably due to consumption of other organic acids e g isocitric transaconitic acids present in the medium as previously reported 31 it was demonstrated that the ph of the broth still increased even after cell growth completed and stopped at about 24 h with a corresponding ph of the broth set at 5 5 therefore assessment of specific limiting factors for growth of the yeast in raw dsw revealed that phosphate salt but not carbon is probably the major limiting factor we already seen that the use of extra and intra cellular extracts from a niger on raw dsw led to similar biomass enhancement suggesting that phosphate compounds are probably released during the enzymatic treatment however phosphate concentration was low in the dsw supernatant hence phosphate may be present in solid fraction of sugarcane vinasse solid forms of phosphate known as apatite have low reactivity thus limiting their use for microbial growth numerous fungi belonging to penicillium species have showed their ability to solubilize these phosphate rocks 41 and a niger have demonstrated ability to solubilize fluorapatite in vinasse medium 42 from these results it can be hypothesized that solid fractions of dsw contain solid form of phosphate which can be solubilized and metabolised for growth of a niger and probably also caused the y lipolytica growth improvement observed using the extra intracellular extracts of a niger 3 3 lipid composition the effect of potassium phosphate kh2po4 on lipid composition of y lipolytica cells grown in pre treated vinasse was assessed through analysis of changes in total lipids composition evaluated by thin layer chromatography analysis and on fatty acid composition determined by gas chromatography analysis of the lipid transesterification products i e fatty acid methyl esters fame of the yeast cells grown on dsw with or without kh2po4 supplementation at 7 0 g l and the results are shown in table 2 addition of potassium phosphate to raw dsw yielded to a higher total lipid content of 9 15 in the yeast biomass as compared to raw vinasse which contained 7 28 of lipids the salt supplementation did not affected composition of the different lipids produced in the yeast cells indeed the lipid composition and the fatty acid profile did not differ from the lipid composition of the same biomass grown on raw dsw table 2 the major lipids were phospholipids near 34 of total lipids with or without kh2po4 supplementation whereas triacylglycerols tags and free fatty acids ffas represented from 34 to 38 of total lipids as phospholipids contain fatty acids the total saponifiable fraction of lipids in the yeast biomass reached up to 72 of total lipids the main fatty acids identified were linoleic acid c18 2 n 6 31 33 4 oleic acid c18 1 n 9 25 4 28 1 and palmitic acid c16 0 19 20 7 thus representing more than 80 of total fatty acids the fatty acid composition is similar to those from conventional microbial and plant oils 34 43 the low lipid content of the yeast biomass might be attributed to the low c n ratio equivalent to 24 5 of the dsw used in this study in fact lipids accumulation is usually triggered by nitrogen starvation with high c n ratio such as up to 70 20 22 44 however phosphate limitation has earlier been reported to favour lipid accumulation in some microorganisms 23 in this case we expected a higher lipid content in raw than in supplemented dsw further study of the dynamic of lipid accumulation in dsw should therefore be carried out to better understand the reasons of this lack of accumulation 4 conclusion distillery spent wash is a complex industrial effluent containing valuable nutritive resources the aim of this study was to develop a new engineering approach to improve the production of single cell oil from vinasse using the oleaginous yeast y lipolytica the yeast can be grown in dsw and an improvement of the biomass production was achieved using bulk treatment consisting of culture supernatant and intracellular enzymatic extracts from aspergillus niger the fungal extract treatments upgrade the digestibility of dsw furthermore a significant increase 70 of the yeast biomass was obtained in the culture medium by the addition of potassium phosphate in raw dsw composition of sco produced by the yeast on treated or supplemented dsw remained unchanged and the sco are mainly composed of saponifiable lipids suitable

13852,conventional direct current electrocoagulation dc ec suffers from issues of plate passivation large energy consumption and sludge weight which greatly restrict its application to wastewater treatment with cr vi in this study positive single pulse current electrocoagulation pspc ec and alternating pulse current electrocoagulation apc ec were used to solve the above problems the optimum removal efficiencies of cr vi obtained by dc ec pspc ec and apc ec were all over 99 the energy consumptions of dc ec pspc ec and apc ec were 3 8 10 3 4 0 10 4 and 7 6 10 4 kwh mgcr vi and the amounts of dry sludge produced were 1 8612 1 3024 and 1 1246 g l respectively among the three types of ec pspc ec consumed the least electrical energy and apc ec produced the least amount of sludge indicating their advantages over dc ec the flocs produced by pspc ec had a better spread performance than those of dc ec and apc ec which contributed to a larger surface area for adsorbing cr vi it should be noted that ec may generate magnetic flocs with easily available iron electrode our findings indicate it is possible to adjust the magnetic strength of the flocs simply by adjusting the pulse current on electrode which has not been reported in previous studies this exhibits the potential to avoid adding complicated synthetic magnetic coagulants in the water treatment construction and cut down

pulse current pc pulse current pspc positive single pulse current 1 introduction in recent years chromium cr has been widely utilized in the electroplating chemical and leather industries accordingly the past few decades have witnessed a noticeable amount of cr being discharged into water bodies with cr pollution incidents occasionally occurring such as in california and new jersey 1 2 such incidents are a significant threat to human health and may seriously impact social progress if not dealt with satisfactorily 3 hexavalent chromium cr vi is highly toxic to most organisms and can cause cancer in humans it also has high solubility and fluidity in water 4 however cr iii has low solubility and can be converted to cr oh 3 which precipitates readily and is far less toxic than cr vi 5 6 therefore the conversion of cr vi to cr iii is a key process in the removal of cr vi from wastewater at present the main treatment methods for the removal of cr vi from wastewater include chemical coagulation chemical reduction adsorption precipitation biological treatment and electrocoagulation ec 7 8 compared with conventional treatment technologies the ec method does not require added chemicals and causes no secondary pollution some wastewater treatment plants in japan remove phosphorus via the ec process reporting good removal efficiency 9 ec is also an effective and inexpensive method for removing heavy metals e g cadmium cobalt and copper from wastewater 10 11 the main principle of ec in wastewater treatment is as follows i under the action of an applied electric field a soluble anode iron or aluminum immersed in the solution generates a metal cation in situ oh and h2 are produced in cathode electrolysis and ii the metal cation combines with oh to form metal hydroxide flocs that can collect and settle the pollutant particles by electrostatic adsorption coordination and complexation 12 iron and aluminum electrodes are widely used in the ec process because of their good removal rate and low price 13 14 at present direct current dc is typically applied in the ec process 15 16 direct current electrocoagulation dc ec can be used to remove toxic metals from industrial wastewater and iron containing wastewater for which the total removal efficiency of heavy metals exceeds 90 17 18 however dc ec has some drawbacks in particular issues with plate passivation large energy consumption and produced sludge weight greatly restrict its application in water treatment 19 20 in order to address these problems a pulse current pc has been applied to the ec process 21 22 with a pc the current is periodically interrupted by a series of open circuits 23 for pc ec treatment the actual electrification time is far less than the total reaction time of the ec treatment which can greatly reduce energy consumption the pc is divided into the positive single pulse current pspc and alternating pulse current apc pspc is a pc that always runs in the forward direction in a pulse cycle originating on the positive side of the power supply apc is where the pspc is run for a period of time in a pulse cycle and then the direction of the pc is reversed the working mode of the apc supply is positive power on positive power off positive power on negative power on negative power off negative power on positive power on each working electrode has a working mode of alternating positive and negative directions during the working process previous studies have reported that the apc ec process can reduce the problem of plate passivation and energy consumption to remove heavy metals from wastewater with good efficiency 24 25 however there is little research on the optimal operating conditions energy consumption and floc formation for the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater by pspc ec 26 in this study a series of batch experiments using dc ec pspc ec and apc ec systems with a pair of fe electrodes were designed to explore the removal efficiency of cr vi from synthetic wastewater at the first stage some key operating conditions of dc ec pspc ec and apc ec were respectively studied to determine the optimal conditions including ph plate spacing conductivity current density peak voltage frequency duty ratio and ratio between forward pulse current fpc and negative pulse current npc at the second stage the floc characteristics of three types of ec were investigated to reveal the cr vi removal mechanisms as such this study lays the foundation for the application of pc ec in practical engineering 2 materials

3 results and discussions this study was divided into two parts in the first part we aimed to identify the optimal operating conditions of dc ec pspc ec and apc ec to remove cr vi in the second part we explored floc characteristics to further reveal the mechanism of cr vi removal in the ec process 3 1 optimum operating conditions of dc ec 3 1 1 effect of initial ph one of the most important parameters in the ec process is the initial ph which affects the properties of metal hydroxides and pollutants also the ph value can directly affect the dissolution of the anode electrode and the removal rate of cr vi 28 29 from fig 2 a the removal rate was highest at ph 2 in the first 30 min the flocs were almost invisible in the ec process and a large number of bubbles formed on the surface of the cathode this was due to the following main reactions occurring at the anode and cathode 4 anode fe s 2e fe2 5 4fe2 o2 4h 4fe3 2h2o 6 cathode 2h 2e h2 g at the beginning of the reaction little oh combined with fe2 or fe3 to form flocs and h gained electrons on the surface of the cathode to form h2 cr vi existed in an acidic solution in the form of cr2o7 2 and hcro4 the following main reactions occurred leading to the removal of cr vi in an acidic solution 30 7 2hcro4 6 fe oh 2 4h2o 2h 2 cr oh 3 6 fe oh 3 8 2hcro4 3fe 4h2o 2h 2 cr oh 3 3 fe oh 2 9 2hcro4 2fe 4h2o 2h 2 cr oh 3 2 fe oh 3 10 cr2o7 2 6 fe oh 2 5h2o 2h 2 cr oh 3 6 fe oh 3 11 cr2o7 2 3fe 5h2o 2h 2 cr oh 3 3 fe oh 2 12 cr2o7 2 2fe 5h2o 2h 2 cr oh 3 2 fe oh 3 13 cr2o7 2 6fe2 14h 2cr3 6fe3 7h2o where fe oh 2 and cr oh 3 represent the amorphous hydroxides formed during the reactions 31 as the reaction continued h was consistently consumed and the ph of the solution consistently increased after 30 min of treatment the removal efficiency of cr vi tended to become stable at initial ph 6 the removal efficiency was 99 9 as oh increased gradually and flocs were formed in solution the surface of the iron flocs was positively charged therefore the iron precipitate could adsorb the anions in solution 32 in this situation the decrease in cr vi mainly depended on cathode reduction and electrostatic gravitation adsorption cathode reduction 14 cr2o7 2 6e 7h2o 2cr3 14oh 15 cr3 3oh cr oh 3 electrostatic gravitation adsorption 16 2fe oh 2 cr2o7 2 fe oh 2 2 cr2o7 2 17 feoh2 cr2o7 2 feoh2 cr2o7 2 as the initial ph increased flocs were increasingly observed in solution at alkaline ph cr vi was mainly removed by co precipitation with flocs and the final removal efficiency barely changed most notably the optimum initial ph value was 6 therefore the following experiments were carried out under this condition 3 1 2 effect of conductivity the initial conductivity of the solution affects the ec efficiency via the electron transport and potential in the solution is therefore considered an important factor in the ec process sodium chloride was used as the supporting electrolyte to adjust solution conductivity the surface morphology of the electrode is shown in fig 3 a from which it can be seen that pits were formed on the surface when cl ions existed in the solution this was because the cl ions lost electrons at the anode to produce cl2 that dissolved in water to form strongly oxidation clo which attacked the passive film and attached to the pits this increased pitting corrosion density on the surface of the anode was the reason why the anode metal dissolved into the solution 33 34 the mechanism of cl damage to the passive film is shown in fig 3 b the influence of conductivity on the removal rate of cr vi is shown in fig 2b the removal efficiency increased from 95 7 99 0 as conductivity increased from 2 to 10 ms cm this was a result of increasing conductivity promoting faster ion migration in solution and accelerating the process of ec however at solution conductivities above 10 ms cm the removal efficiency gradually declined previous studies have proved that the high conductivity of the solution can limit the potential drop and solution resistance potential 35 with this lower voltage resulting in a reduction of the ec process in addition energy consumption decreased with increasing concentration of supporting electrolyte due to the potential decrease under constant current density 36 high solution conductivity caused both a reduction in removal efficiency and increased electrolyte dosage therefore controlling the conductivity in an appropriate range not only improved the removal efficiency but also decreased energy consumption under a constant cd 37 3 1 3 effect of plate spacing the influence of plate spacing on removal efficiency is shown in fig 2c the maximum value was reached when the plate spacing was 15 mm plate spacing had an effect on plate voltage in the ec process x chen 38 derived a formula for plate voltage in the ec process 18 u 0 e e q φ a a φ a c φ a p φ c a φ c c d k j where u0 is the plate voltage e e q is the plate equilibrium potential φ a a is the overpotential due to anodic electrochemical polarization φ a p is the overpotential due to anode concentration polarization φ a p is the overpotential due to anode resistance polarization φ c a is the overpotential due to electrochemical polarization of the cathode φ c c is the overpotential due to concentration polarization of the cathode d is the plate spacing k is the conductivity and j is the cd with constant conductivity and cd it was observed that plate voltage was positively correlated with plate spacing this was consistent with our experimental results a large plate voltage can cause plate passivation therefore the removal efficiency was gradually decreased 3 1 4 effect of initial concentration from fig 2d the removal efficiency was positively correlated with the reaction time in the early stage of the reaction the removal rate at the highest initial concentration was slower than that at the other concentrations at the same reaction time t 60 min the final removal rates of the 200 and 10 mg l treatments were 72 3 and 99 0 respectively it was observed that at the initial concentration of 200 mg l the final removal rate decreased markedly this can be explained by the fact that the amount of iron dissolved into the solution was constant under each experimental condition therefore the amount of dissolved iron was insufficient to react with cr vi at a higher initial concentration under these conditions cr vi could not be removed well the high initial concentration had a marked influence on the ec process 3 1 5 effect of current density with increased cd fig 4 a the reaction rate kept accelerating when the cd was 100 a m2 the removal rate reached 99 0 after 5 min following faraday s law eq 3 increasing cd resulted in the increase in the amount of dissolved iron during the ec process and the acceleration of the reaction rate although a higher cd can achieve the same removal rate in a shorter time than other cd levels the issue of energy consumption should be considered electrical energy consumption was calculated using the following formula 19 e u i t v c 0 c 60 where u is the voltage v i is the average current a t is the run time min c0 is the initial cr vi concentration mg l c is the concentration after treatment mg l and v is the volume of water l from fig 4b although cd 100 a m2 took the shortest time to achieve the same removal rate the electric energy consumption was the highest two reasons account for this result 1 voltage increased with the increase in cd and the plate was passivated at high voltage 39 and 2 concentration polarization occurred near the electrode 40 the relationship between cathode concentration polarization potential and cd can be described by the following equation 20 φ r t n f ln 1 i i m where φ is the cathode concentration polarization potential n is the number of electron transfers in the reaction f is the faraday s constant i is the cd im is the limiting cd and r is the gas constant it was observed that cathode concentration polarization voltage was positively correlated with cd which explains the higher electric energy consumption at high cd 41 recently pc has been applied to the process of ec pc includes pspc and apc compared with dc pc possesses significant advantages in terms of decreasing energy consumption while maintaining a similar efficiency and reducing plate polarization in the ec process 42 in this paper the optimal operating conditions for removing cr vi by pspc ec and apc ec were investigated 3 2 optimum operating conditions of pspc ec a schematic diagram of the pspc is shown in fig 5 a where ton ms is the working time at which the reaction starts toff ms is the end time at which the reaction stops pulse cycle t ms ton toff and the ratio of working time and pulse cycle is the duty ratio γ which was calculated as 21 γ t o n t 100 t o n t o n t o f f 100 the relationship between up and um is as follows 22 u m u p γ where up v is the peak voltage and um v is average voltage the relationship between pulse current frequency f hz and pulse cycle t ms can be described by the following formula 23 t 1 f f hz is the pulse current frequency and it represents the number of pulses per unit of time and determines the length of the pulse cycle t ms we mainly explored the optimal operating conditions of pspc removal of cr vi via the ec process in relation to these three parameters 3 2 1 effect of peak voltage when the current was switched on the peak current was at least several fold greater than the dc which would have accelerated dissolution of the anode the peak current was positively correlated with the peak voltage 43 from fig 6 a the highest rcr was 99 6 at up 25 v and the lowest rcr was 99 3 at up 5 v after treatment for 5 and 25 min respectively this was due to the increase in voltage which led to an increase in average current and an acceleration in the speed and amount of iron dissolution according to faraday s law eq 3 the energy consumption of pspc ec can be calculated by the following equation 24 e u m i m t γ 2 v 0 c 0 c 60 where e is the energy consumption kwh mgcr vi um is the average voltage v im is the peak current a t is the run time min γ is the duty ratio v is the volume of water l c0 is the initial cr vi concentration mg l and c is concentration after treatment mg l it was found that energy consumption was 0 0023 kw h mgcr vi at up 5 v which was much lower than the energy consumption at any other voltage this indicates that a high peak voltage can achieve a high removal efficiency however the plate could become passivated owing to the high voltage applied over a short time the electrode became more resistant and a large amount of electrical energy was consumed 3 2 2 effect of frequency to explore the effect of frequency on rcr we conducted several groups of experiments in fig 6b the rcr was between 98 9 and 99 3 and the highest removal rate was 99 3 at a frequency of 5000 hz with the exception of 100 hz the removal rate increased with the increase of frequency after 25 min of treatment the results of this experiment were similar to those of j shu 44 and can be explained by the fact that a high frequency can reduce the length of the pulse cycle and the passivation film cannot be formed within a short pulse cycle moreover the higher frequency current had stronger penetrability to puncture the passive film to help in generating more iron ions 45 3 2 3 effect of duty ratio from fig 6c energy consumption increased dramatically with values of 0 0023 0 0087 and 0 0209 kw h mgcr vi at duty ratios of 50 70 and 90 respectively according to eq 22 when the peak voltage was kept constant the average voltage decreased with the decreased duty ratio therefore a low duty ratio required an extended treatment time in order to achieve an rcr similar to that of a high duty ratio although treatment time was extended the energy consumption of a low duty ratio was less than that of a high duty ratio the energy consumption was calculated using eq 24 overall the optimum duty ratio of 30 was used in the following experiments the conditions of up 5 v f 5000 hz and γ 30 were optimal for pspc ec reducing plate passivation and yielding a high rcr under optimal operating conditions pspc ec showed a great advantage over dc ec in terms of energy consumption while achieving a similar rcr this suggests the potential for the large scale application of pspc ec 3 3 optimum operating conditions of apc ec the reversal of the pulse current in apc is shown in fig 5b where tn tn and t denote the forward pulse cycle negative pulse cycle and total pulse cycle respectively except for pulse current direction the npc was similar to fpc the electrochemical behavior of the fe electrode was explored using tafel curves in the apc ec process which are shown in fig 6d in the initial stage the tafel curves of the fe electrode passing a forward current for 20 and 30 min were measured in 50 mg l cr vi and recorded at 1 mv s 1 this revealed that the fe electrode corrosion voltage was between 0 65 and 0 59 v vs ag agcl under the experimental conditions with the forward energizing time of 20 min the corrosion current was computed using the tafel equation as 7 77 10 4 a with extension of the electrification time the corrosion current was reduced to 5 67 10 4 a this was because the surface of the fe electrode was continuously passivated during the energizing time with the same voltage energized in reverse for 30 min and the corrosion current increased to 2 25 10 3 a the passivation film on the fe electrode gradually disappeared it was further proved that the application of a reverse current can reduce the passivation film on the electrode therefore periodic reversal of the cathode and anode by applying apc can reduce the generation of a passivation film and realize a decrease in energy consumption 46 the number of fpc and npc events was adjusted from 1 to 10 and the energy consumption for fpc and npc was calculated using eq 24 from table 1 it is evident that the lowest removal efficiency was 7 23 and the highest energy consumption was 1 3 10 2 kwh mgcr vi when the fpc npc ratio was unity it is also apparent that the larger this ratio the higher the removal rate the highest removal rate was 99 2 and the lowest energy consumption was 5 8 10 4 kwh mgcr vi occurring when the fpc npc ratio was 10 moreover it was found that cd increased with the number of pulse current events the waveforms of the different combinations of fpc and npc are shown in fig 7 it can be seen in fig 7 that an increase in the number of pulse current events was equal to increasing the duty ratio in the total pulse cycle t according to eq 22 when the peak voltage remained constant the average voltage increased with the duty ratio in the total pulse cycle dc ec pspc ec and apc ec were compared based on a variety of factors table 2 to achieve a similar removal rate the pc ec required extension of the treatment time however pc ec saved energy and reduced sludge compared with dc ec this was a result of pc having a duty ratio that was beneficial to the diffusion of ions in the solution which can reduce concentration polarization thereby decreasing energy consumption and sludge weight 3 4 comparison of floc characteristics for different ec types 3 4 1 morphology magnetism and size distribution of flocs exploration of the floc characteristics can further reveal the mechanism of cr vi removal during the ec process for the treated water obtained from the three types of ec under optimal conditions table 2 floc morphology was observed under a microscope as shown in figs 8 a c it was observed that the flocs produced by pc ec had better spreadability than the dc ec flocs which contributed to a larger surface area for adsorbing cr vi the flocs were left to rest for 1 h after which it was found that the color of the dc ec flocs was darker than that of the other two kinds as shown in fig 8 d f moreover the flocs produced by dc ec were is easier to separate from the solution than that produced by pc ec by an external magnetic field this indicated that the structure of the flocs was mainly green rust i e as the anode current increased the green rust was transformed into γ feooh which played a major role in the pollutant removal process 47 during the dc ec process the anode keeps the current flowing thus producing a large amount of oxygen under such circumstance γ feooh is easily oxidized to magnetic α fe2o3 and γ fe2o3 48 consequently the magnetic component of flocs produced by dc ec is more than that of pc ec therefore pc generated flocs have weaker magnetism than dc generated flocs the size evolution of the three kinds of flocs over time was studied as shown in fig 9 and add 3 min of stirring to attain longer growth periods before the experiment for pspc flocs at 15 min accelerated floc growth was observed with 55 and 40 distributed at 1 103 and 5 103 nm respectively at 30 min 90 reached 7 5 103 nm this indicates that the flocs showed clear growth with accelerated growth occurring at 15 min over 85 of the apc flocs were distributed at 1 103 nm at 20 min 90 of the apc flocs were 7 5 103 nm and at longer time periods the flocs had little obvious growth the differences between the three kinds of flocs reveal that the flocs produced by pspc ec and apc ec form large particles more readily than do dc ec flocs this is convenient in terms of the separation of flocs from wastewater 3 4 2 sem eds and ftir analysis of flocs in fig 10 a c under magnification of 20 k these flocs possessed uniform shapes and had diameters of 1 μm the sem images showed that the blocky surface of dc ec flocs was overlapped and compact the flocs produced by pspc ec and apc ec had a loose structure and a large surface area fig 10 d f show the eds spectra for the three kinds of flocs indicating that all contained the elements cl na o fe and cr therefore it is evident that cr vi was adsorbed by the flocs fig 10d shows the eds spectra and elemental compositions of dc ec flocs indicating that the surface contained mostly na followed by cl the elements fe o and cr also existed on the surface of the flocs however cr only accounted for 2 3 of the total fig 10 e f show that the proportions of cr were 11 8 and 4 9 in the flocs produced by pspc ec and apc ec respectively this provides direct evidence that the adsorption of cr vi by pspc ec was greater than that by dc ec and apc ec fig 11 shows the ftir spectra of the flocs after treatment by dc ec pspc ec and apc ec the basic ftir bands of different functional group is shown in table 3 49 51 it can be seen that an absorption peak at 3376 74 cm 1 appeared in all three kinds of flocs which was caused by oh stretching vibration in the hydroxide precipitation structures the peak at 1621 84 cm 1 was due to hoh bending vibration the vibration peaks of the cro and feo γ fe2o3 and α fe2o3 bonds can be seen at 647 78 and 540 93 cm 1 respectively 52 this indicates that cr and fe hydroxide formed a cr fe hydroxide co precipitate to realize the removal of cr vi 4 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study investigating the comparison of cr vi removal by dc ec pspc ec and apc ec considering energy consumption and sludge yield for the pspc ec optimal conditions of peak voltage 5 v current frequency 5000 hz and duty ratio 30 the removal rate of cr vi was 99 5 and the energy consumption was 4 10 4 kwh mgcr vi for pspc ec after 35 min of treatment the experiments showed that the passivation film was not formed when using a short pulse cycle t ms in the pspc ec process on the basis of the pspc ec optimal conditions when the fpc npc ratio was 10 the removal rate of cr vi was 99 2 and the energy consumption was 7 6 10 4 kwh mgcr vi by apc ec after 60 min of treatment this indicates that pspc ec can save 89 energy and reduce sludge by 30 in comparison with dc ec apc ec can save 80 energy and reduce sludge by 39 in comparison with dc ec considering energy consumption pspc ec is the best choice for removing cr vi considering sludge reduction apc ec is the best choice for removing cr vi it was found that the flocs produced by apc ec had a larger surface to adsorb cr vi and formed larger particles as compared with dc ec the flocs produced by pspc ec had a better spread performance than those of others this finding indicates it is possible to avoid adding complicated synthetic magnetic coagulants in the water treatment construction and cut down the operation cost it should be noted that the consumption of the iron electrode in the process of ec needs to be further studied for more precise cost calculation the influences of operating conditions e g ph current property and aeration rate on the magnetic properties of the floc during the ec process needs further exploration as well the results in this paper provide a basis for treating heavy metal containing wastewater by pulse current electrocoagulation in practical industrial applications and indicate it is possible to promote the application of pulse current electrocoagulation based facilities in the water pollution remediation market declaration of competing interest the

13852,conventional direct current electrocoagulation dc ec suffers from issues of plate passivation large energy consumption and sludge weight which greatly restrict its application to wastewater treatment with cr vi in this study positive single pulse current electrocoagulation pspc ec and alternating pulse current electrocoagulation apc ec were used to solve the above problems the optimum removal efficiencies of cr vi obtained by dc ec pspc ec and apc ec were all over 99 the energy consumptions of dc ec pspc ec and apc ec were 3 8 10 3 4 0 10 4 and 7 6 10 4 kwh mgcr vi and the amounts of dry sludge produced were 1 8612 1 3024 and 1 1246 g l respectively among the three types of ec pspc ec consumed the least electrical energy and apc ec produced the least amount of sludge indicating their advantages over dc ec the flocs produced by pspc ec had a better spread performance than those of dc ec and apc ec which contributed to a larger surface area for adsorbing cr vi it should be noted that ec may generate magnetic flocs with easily available iron electrode our findings indicate it is possible to adjust the magnetic strength of the flocs simply by adjusting the pulse current on electrode which has not been reported in previous studies this exhibits the potential to avoid adding complicated synthetic magnetic coagulants in the water treatment construction and cut down chemical operation cost also it enlightens those dedicated to electrochemistry to develop magnetic floc generating electrodes for enhancing contaminant separation and water purification keywords cr vi

pulse current pc pulse current pspc positive single pulse current 1 introduction in recent years chromium cr has been widely utilized in the electroplating chemical and leather industries accordingly the past few decades have witnessed a noticeable amount of cr being discharged into water bodies with cr pollution incidents occasionally occurring such as in california and new jersey 1 2 such incidents are a significant threat to human health and may seriously impact social progress if not dealt with satisfactorily 3 hexavalent chromium cr vi is highly toxic to most organisms and can cause cancer in humans it also has high solubility and fluidity in water 4 however cr iii has low solubility and can be converted to cr oh 3 which precipitates readily and is far less toxic than cr vi 5 6 therefore the conversion of cr vi to cr iii is a key process in the removal of cr vi from wastewater at present the main treatment methods for the removal of cr vi from wastewater include chemical coagulation chemical reduction adsorption precipitation biological treatment and electrocoagulation ec 7 8 compared with conventional treatment technologies the ec method does not require added chemicals and causes no secondary pollution some wastewater treatment plants in japan remove phosphorus via the ec process reporting good removal efficiency 9 ec is also an effective and inexpensive method for removing heavy metals e g cadmium cobalt and copper from wastewater 10 11 the main principle of ec in wastewater treatment is as follows i under the action of an applied electric field a soluble anode iron or aluminum immersed in the solution generates a metal cation in situ oh and h2 are produced in cathode electrolysis and ii the metal cation combines with oh to form metal hydroxide flocs that can collect and settle the pollutant particles by electrostatic adsorption coordination and complexation 12 iron and aluminum electrodes are widely used in the ec process because of their good removal rate and low price 13 14 at present direct current dc is typically applied in the ec process 15 16 direct current electrocoagulation dc ec can be used to remove toxic metals from industrial wastewater and iron containing wastewater for which the total removal efficiency of heavy metals exceeds 90 17 18 however dc ec has some drawbacks in particular issues with plate passivation large energy consumption and produced sludge weight greatly restrict its application in water treatment 19 20 in order to address these problems a pulse current pc has been applied to the ec process 21 22 with a pc the current is periodically interrupted by a series of open circuits 23 for pc ec treatment the actual electrification time is far less than the total reaction time of the ec treatment which can greatly reduce energy consumption the pc is divided into the positive single pulse current pspc and alternating pulse current apc pspc is a pc that always runs in the forward direction in a pulse cycle originating on the positive side of the power supply apc is where the pspc is run for a period of time in a pulse cycle and then the direction of the pc is reversed the working mode of the apc supply is positive power on positive power off positive power on negative power on negative power off negative power on positive power on each working electrode has a working mode of alternating positive and negative directions during the working process previous studies have reported that the apc ec process can reduce the problem of plate passivation and energy consumption to remove heavy metals from wastewater with good efficiency 24 25 however there is little research on the optimal operating conditions energy consumption and floc formation for the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater by pspc ec 26 in this study a series of batch experiments using dc ec pspc ec and apc ec systems with a pair of fe electrodes were designed to explore the removal efficiency of cr vi from synthetic wastewater at the first stage some key operating conditions of dc ec pspc ec and apc ec were respectively studied to determine the optimal conditions including ph plate spacing conductivity current density peak voltage frequency duty ratio and ratio between forward pulse current fpc and negative pulse current npc at the second stage the floc characteristics of three types of ec were investigated to reveal the cr vi removal mechanisms as such this study lays the foundation for the application of pc ec in practical engineering 2 materials

conductivity was adjusted to 2 ms cm and the ph value was adjusted to 7 5 8 0 by using 1 m naoh and h2so4 solutions a stock solution of 200 mg l cr vi was prepared and other low concentration solutions were prepared by dilution with milli q water all chemicals were of analytical grade 2 2 experimental conditions all ec experiments were carried out in a 500 ml polymethylmethacrylate pmma

spacing could be adjusted from 5 to 25 mm all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 c 2 c with a constant stirring speed of 300 rpm to enhance mass transfer a schematic diagram of the ec reactor is shown in fig 1 2 3 analysis in this study ph was measured using a ph meter sx721 san xin china and conductivity was measured using a conductivity meter dds 307a inesa china the

3 results and discussions this study was divided into two parts in the first part we aimed to identify the optimal operating conditions of dc ec pspc ec and apc ec to remove cr vi in the second part we explored floc characteristics to further reveal the mechanism of cr vi removal in the ec process 3 1 optimum operating conditions of dc ec 3 1 1 effect of initial ph one of the most important parameters in the ec process is the initial ph which affects the properties of metal hydroxides and pollutants also the ph value can directly affect the dissolution of the anode electrode and the removal rate of cr vi 28 29 from fig 2 a the removal rate was highest at ph 2 in the first 30 min the flocs were almost invisible in the ec process and a large number of bubbles formed on the surface of the cathode this was due to the following main reactions occurring at the anode and cathode 4 anode fe s 2e fe2 5 4fe2 o2 4h 4fe3 2h2o 6 cathode 2h 2e h2 g at the beginning of the reaction little oh combined with fe2 or fe3 to form flocs and h gained electrons on the surface of the cathode to form h2 cr vi existed in an acidic solution in the form of cr2o7 2 and hcro4 the following main reactions occurred leading to the removal of cr vi in an acidic solution 30 7 2hcro4 6 fe oh 2 4h2o 2h 2 cr oh 3 6 fe oh 3 8 2hcro4 3fe 4h2o 2h 2 cr oh 3 3 fe oh 2 9 2hcro4 2fe 4h2o 2h 2 cr oh 3 2 fe

represent the amorphous hydroxides formed during the reactions 31 as the reaction continued h was consistently consumed and the ph of the solution consistently increased after 30 min of treatment the removal efficiency of cr vi tended to become stable at initial ph 6 the removal efficiency was 99 9 as oh increased gradually and flocs were formed in solution the surface of the iron flocs was positively charged therefore the iron precipitate could adsorb the anions in solution 32 in this situation the decrease in cr vi mainly depended on cathode reduction and electrostatic gravitation adsorption cathode reduction 14 cr2o7 2 6e 7h2o 2cr3 14oh 15 cr3 3oh cr oh 3 electrostatic gravitation adsorption 16 2fe oh 2 cr2o7 2 fe oh 2 2 cr2o7 2 17 feoh2 cr2o7 2 feoh2 cr2o7 2 as the initial ph increased flocs were increasingly observed in solution at alkaline ph cr vi was mainly removed by co precipitation with flocs and the final removal efficiency barely changed most notably the optimum initial ph value was 6 therefore the following experiments were carried out under this condition 3 1 2 effect of conductivity the initial conductivity of the solution affects the ec efficiency via the electron transport and potential in the solution is therefore considered an important factor in the ec process sodium chloride was used as the supporting electrolyte to adjust solution conductivity the surface morphology of the electrode is shown in fig 3 a from which it can be seen that pits were formed on the surface when cl ions existed in the solution this was because the cl ions lost electrons at the anode to produce cl2 that dissolved in water to form strongly oxidation clo which attacked the passive film and attached to the pits this increased pitting corrosion density on the surface of the anode was the reason why the anode metal dissolved into the solution 33 34 the mechanism of cl damage to the passive film is shown in fig 3 b the influence of conductivity on the removal rate of cr vi is shown in fig 2b the removal efficiency increased from 95 7 99 0 as conductivity increased from 2 to 10 ms cm this was a result of increasing conductivity promoting faster ion migration in solution and accelerating the process of ec however at solution conductivities above 10 ms cm the removal efficiency gradually declined previous studies have proved that the high conductivity of the solution can limit the potential drop and solution resistance potential 35 with this lower voltage resulting in a reduction of the ec process in addition energy consumption decreased with increasing concentration of supporting electrolyte due to the potential decrease under constant current density 36 high solution conductivity caused both a reduction in removal efficiency and increased electrolyte dosage therefore controlling the conductivity in an appropriate range not only improved the removal efficiency but also decreased energy consumption under a constant cd 37 3 1 3 effect of plate spacing the influence of plate spacing on removal efficiency is shown in fig 2c the maximum value was reached when the plate spacing was 15 mm plate spacing had an effect on plate voltage in the ec process x chen 38 derived a formula for plate voltage in the ec process 18 u 0 e e q φ a a φ a c φ a p φ c a φ c c d k j where u0 is the plate voltage e e q is the plate equilibrium potential φ a a is the overpotential due to anodic electrochemical polarization φ a p is the overpotential due to anode concentration polarization φ a p is the overpotential due to anode resistance polarization φ c a is the overpotential due to electrochemical polarization of the cathode φ c c is the overpotential due to concentration polarization of the cathode d is the plate spacing k is the conductivity and j is the cd with constant conductivity and cd it was observed that plate voltage was positively correlated with plate spacing this was consistent with our experimental results a large plate voltage can cause plate passivation therefore the removal efficiency was gradually decreased 3 1 4 effect of initial concentration from fig 2d the removal efficiency was positively correlated with the reaction time in the early stage of the reaction the removal rate at the highest initial concentration was slower than that at the other concentrations at the same reaction time t 60 min the final removal rates of the 200 and 10 mg l treatments were 72 3 and 99 0 respectively it was observed that at the initial concentration of 200 mg l the final removal rate decreased markedly this can be explained by the fact that the amount of iron dissolved into the solution was constant under each experimental condition therefore the amount of dissolved iron was insufficient to react with cr vi at a higher initial concentration under these conditions cr vi could not be removed well the high initial concentration had a marked influence on the ec process 3 1 5 effect of current density with increased cd fig 4 a the reaction rate kept accelerating when the cd was 100 a m2 the removal rate reached 99 0 after 5 min following faraday s law eq 3 increasing cd resulted in the increase in the amount of dissolved iron during the ec process and the acceleration of the reaction rate although a higher cd can achieve the same removal rate in a shorter time than other cd levels the issue of energy consumption should be considered electrical energy consumption was calculated using the following formula 19 e u i t v c 0 c 60 where u is the voltage v i is the average current a t is the run time min c0 is the initial cr vi concentration mg l c is the concentration after treatment mg l and v is the volume of water l from fig 4b although cd 100 a m2 took the shortest time to achieve the same removal rate the electric energy consumption was the highest two reasons account for this result 1 voltage increased with the increase in cd and the plate was passivated at high voltage 39 and 2 concentration polarization occurred near the electrode 40 the relationship between cathode concentration polarization potential and cd can be described by the following equation 20 φ r t n f ln 1 i i m where φ is the cathode concentration polarization potential n is the number of electron transfers in the reaction f is the faraday s constant i is the cd im is the limiting cd and r is the gas constant it was observed that cathode concentration polarization voltage was positively correlated with cd which explains the higher electric energy consumption at high cd 41 recently pc has been applied to the process of ec pc includes pspc and apc compared with dc pc possesses significant advantages in terms of decreasing energy consumption while maintaining a similar efficiency and reducing plate polarization in the ec process 42 in this paper the optimal operating conditions for removing cr vi by pspc ec and apc ec were investigated 3 2 optimum operating conditions of pspc ec a schematic diagram of the pspc is shown in fig 5 a where ton ms is the working time at which the reaction starts toff ms is the end time at which the reaction stops pulse cycle t ms ton toff and the ratio of working time and pulse cycle is the duty ratio γ which was calculated as 21 γ t o n t 100 t o n t o n t o f f 100 the relationship between up and um is as follows 22 u m u p γ where up v is the peak voltage and um v is average voltage the relationship between pulse current frequency f hz and pulse cycle t ms can be described by the following formula 23 t 1 f f hz is the pulse current frequency and it represents the number of pulses per unit of time and determines the length of the pulse cycle t ms we mainly explored the optimal operating conditions of pspc removal of cr vi via the ec process in relation to these three parameters 3 2 1 effect of peak voltage when the current was switched on the peak current was at least several fold greater than the dc which would have accelerated dissolution of the anode the peak current was positively correlated with the peak voltage 43 from fig 6 a the highest rcr was 99 6 at up 25 v and the lowest rcr was 99 3 at up 5 v after treatment for 5 and 25 min respectively this was due to the increase in voltage which led to an increase in average current and an acceleration in the speed and amount of iron dissolution according to faraday s law eq 3 the energy consumption of pspc ec can be calculated by the following equation 24 e u m i m t γ 2 v 0 c 0 c 60 where e is the energy consumption kwh mgcr vi um is the average voltage v im is the peak current a t is the run time min γ is the duty ratio v is the volume of water l c0 is the initial cr vi concentration mg l and c is concentration after treatment mg l it was found that energy consumption was 0 0023 kw h mgcr vi at up 5 v which was much lower than the energy consumption at any other voltage this indicates that a high peak voltage can achieve a high removal efficiency however the plate could become passivated owing to the high voltage applied over a short time the electrode became more resistant and a large amount of electrical energy was consumed 3 2 2 effect of frequency to explore the effect of frequency on rcr we conducted several groups of experiments in fig 6b the rcr was between 98 9 and 99 3 and the highest removal rate was 99 3 at a frequency of 5000 hz with the exception of 100 hz the removal rate increased with the increase of frequency after 25 min of treatment the results of this experiment were similar to those of j shu 44 and can be explained by the fact that a high frequency can reduce the length of the pulse cycle and the passivation film cannot be formed within a short pulse cycle moreover the higher frequency current had stronger penetrability to puncture the passive film to help in generating more iron ions 45 3 2 3 effect of duty ratio from fig 6c energy consumption increased dramatically with values of 0 0023 0 0087 and 0 0209 kw h mgcr vi at duty ratios of 50 70 and 90 respectively according to eq 22 when the peak voltage was kept constant the average voltage decreased with the decreased duty ratio therefore a low duty ratio required an extended treatment time in order to achieve an rcr similar to that of a high duty ratio although treatment time was extended the energy consumption of a low duty ratio was less than that of a high duty ratio the energy consumption was calculated using eq 24 overall the optimum duty ratio of 30 was used in the following experiments the conditions of up 5 v f 5000 hz and γ 30 were optimal for pspc ec reducing plate passivation and yielding a high rcr under optimal operating conditions pspc ec showed a great advantage over dc ec in terms of energy consumption while achieving a similar rcr this suggests the potential for the large scale application of pspc ec 3 3 optimum operating conditions of apc ec the reversal of the pulse current in apc is shown in fig 5b where tn tn and t denote the forward pulse cycle negative pulse cycle and total pulse cycle respectively except for pulse current direction the npc was similar to fpc the electrochemical behavior of the fe electrode was explored using tafel curves in the apc ec process which are shown in fig 6d in the initial stage the tafel curves of the fe electrode passing a forward current for 20 and 30 min were measured in 50 mg l cr vi and recorded at 1 mv s 1 this revealed that the fe electrode corrosion voltage was between 0 65 and 0 59 v vs ag agcl under the experimental conditions with the forward energizing time of 20 min the corrosion current was computed using the tafel equation as 7 77 10 4 a with extension of the electrification time the corrosion current was reduced to 5 67 10 4 a this was because the surface of the fe electrode was continuously passivated during the energizing time with the same voltage energized in reverse for 30 min and the corrosion current increased to 2 25 10 3 a the passivation film on the fe electrode gradually disappeared it was further proved that the application of a reverse current can reduce the passivation film on the electrode therefore periodic reversal of the cathode and anode by applying apc can reduce the generation of a passivation film and realize a decrease in energy consumption 46 the number of fpc and npc events was adjusted from 1 to 10 and the energy consumption for fpc and npc was calculated using eq 24 from table 1 it is evident that the lowest removal efficiency was 7 23 and the highest energy consumption was 1 3 10 2 kwh mgcr vi when the fpc npc ratio was unity it is also apparent that the larger this ratio the higher the removal rate the highest removal rate was 99 2 and the lowest energy consumption was 5 8 10 4 kwh mgcr vi occurring when the fpc npc ratio was 10 moreover it was found that cd increased with the number of pulse current events the waveforms of the different combinations of fpc and npc are shown in fig 7 it can be seen in fig 7 that an increase in the number of pulse current events was equal to increasing the duty ratio in the total pulse cycle t according to eq 22 when the peak voltage remained constant the average voltage increased with the duty ratio in the total pulse cycle dc ec pspc ec and apc ec were compared based on a variety of factors table 2 to achieve a similar removal rate the pc ec required extension of the treatment time however pc ec saved energy and reduced sludge compared with dc ec this was a result of pc having a duty ratio that was beneficial to the diffusion of ions in the solution which can reduce concentration polarization thereby decreasing energy consumption and sludge weight 3 4 comparison of floc characteristics for different ec types 3 4 1 morphology magnetism and size distribution of flocs exploration of the floc characteristics can further reveal the mechanism of cr vi removal during the ec process for the treated water obtained from the three types of ec under optimal conditions table 2 floc morphology was observed under a microscope as shown in figs 8 a c it was observed that the flocs produced by pc ec had better spreadability than the dc ec flocs which contributed to a larger surface area for adsorbing cr vi the flocs were left to rest for 1 h after which it was found that the color of the dc ec flocs was darker than that of the other two kinds as shown in fig 8 d f moreover the flocs produced by dc ec were is easier to separate from the solution than that produced by pc ec by an external magnetic field this indicated that the structure of the flocs was mainly green rust i e as the anode current increased the green rust was transformed into γ feooh which played a major role in the pollutant removal process 47 during the dc ec process the anode keeps the current flowing thus producing a large amount of oxygen under such circumstance γ feooh is easily oxidized to magnetic α fe2o3 and γ fe2o3 48 consequently the magnetic component of flocs produced by dc ec is more than that of pc ec therefore pc generated flocs have weaker magnetism than dc generated flocs the size evolution of the three kinds of flocs over time was studied as shown in fig 9 and add 3 min of stirring to attain longer growth periods before the experiment for pspc flocs at 15 min accelerated floc growth was observed with 55 and 40 distributed at 1 103 and 5 103 nm respectively at 30 min 90 reached 7 5 103 nm this indicates that the flocs showed clear growth with accelerated growth occurring at 15 min over 85 of the apc flocs were distributed at 1 103 nm at 20 min 90 of the apc flocs were 7 5 103 nm and at longer time periods the flocs had little obvious growth the differences between the three kinds of flocs reveal that the flocs produced by pspc ec and apc ec form large particles more readily than do dc ec flocs this is convenient in terms of the separation of flocs from wastewater 3 4 2 sem eds and ftir analysis of flocs in fig 10 a c under magnification of 20 k these flocs possessed uniform shapes and had diameters of 1 μm the sem images showed that the blocky surface of dc ec flocs was overlapped and compact the flocs produced by pspc ec and apc ec had a loose structure and a large surface area fig 10 d f show the eds spectra for the three kinds of flocs indicating that all contained the elements cl na o fe and cr therefore it is evident that cr vi was adsorbed by the flocs fig 10d shows the eds spectra and elemental compositions of dc ec flocs indicating that the surface contained mostly na followed by cl the elements fe o and cr also existed on the surface of the flocs however cr only accounted for 2 3 of the total fig 10 e f show that the proportions of cr were 11 8 and 4 9 in the flocs produced by pspc ec and apc ec respectively this provides direct evidence that the adsorption of cr vi by pspc ec was greater than that by dc ec and apc ec fig 11 shows the ftir spectra of the flocs after treatment by dc ec pspc ec and apc ec the basic ftir bands of different functional group is shown in table 3 49 51 it can be seen that an absorption peak at 3376 74 cm 1 appeared in all three kinds of flocs which was caused by oh stretching vibration in the hydroxide precipitation structures the peak at 1621 84 cm 1 was due to hoh bending vibration the vibration peaks of the cro and feo γ fe2o3 and α fe2o3 bonds can be seen at 647 78 and 540 93 cm 1 respectively 52 this indicates that cr and fe hydroxide formed a cr fe hydroxide co precipitate to realize the removal of cr vi 4 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study investigating the comparison of cr vi removal by dc ec pspc ec and apc ec considering energy consumption and sludge yield for the pspc ec optimal conditions of peak voltage 5 v current frequency 5000 hz and duty ratio 30 the removal rate of cr vi was 99 5 and the energy consumption was 4 10 4 kwh mgcr vi for pspc ec after 35 min of treatment the experiments showed that the passivation film was not formed when using a short pulse cycle t ms in the pspc ec process on the basis of the pspc ec optimal conditions when the fpc npc ratio was 10 the removal rate of cr vi was 99 2 and the energy consumption was 7 6 10 4 kwh mgcr vi by apc ec after 60 min of treatment this indicates that pspc ec can save 89 energy and reduce sludge by 30 in comparison with dc ec apc ec can save 80 energy and reduce sludge by 39 in comparison with dc ec considering energy consumption pspc ec is the best choice for removing cr vi considering sludge reduction apc ec is the best choice for removing cr vi it was found that the flocs produced by apc ec had a larger surface to adsorb cr vi and formed larger particles as compared with dc ec the flocs produced by pspc ec had a better spread performance than those of others this finding indicates it is possible to avoid adding complicated synthetic magnetic coagulants in the water treatment construction and cut down the operation cost it should be noted that the consumption of the iron electrode in the process of ec needs to be further studied for more precise cost calculation the influences of operating conditions e g ph current property and aeration rate on the magnetic properties of the floc during the ec process needs further exploration as well the results in this paper provide a basis for treating heavy metal containing wastewater by pulse current electrocoagulation in practical industrial applications and indicate it is possible to promote the application of pulse current electrocoagulation based facilities in the water pollution remediation market declaration of competing interest the

13853,in this work a statistical stability metric and novel hybrid statistical machine learning ammonia forecasting model are developed to improve the accuracy and precision of municipal wastewater treatment aeration for biological nutrient removal is typically the largest energy expense for municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp ammonia based aeration control abac is one approach designed to minimize excessive aeration by adjusting air blower output from online ammonia measurements rather than from a dissolved oxygen do sensor which is the conventional aeration control approach we propose a quantitative stability metric total sample variance to compare system wide variability of competing aeration control strategies using this metric the performance of traditional do and abac control strategies with varying setpoints and control parameters were compared in a medium sized wwtp and the most stable strategy was identified and implemented at the facility to further improve abac performance ammonia forecasting models were constructed using both statistical and machine learning to improve the accuracy of the aeration control system diurnal diurnal linear artificial neural network ann and hybrid diurnal linear ann forecasting models were trained on real time plant wide process data the diurnal linear and diurnal linear ann forecasts were found to most accurately forecast ammonia improving upon the existing ammonia measurement by up to 32 and 46 respectively whereas the ann model forecast was only able to improve by up to 8 this work demonstrates the ease and flexibility of integrating statistics and machine learning methods for developing new treatment models in conventional wwtp for features in full scale conventional activated sludge systems keywords ammonia based aeration control artificial neural network cascade control stability assessment 1 introduction one of the greatest threats to surface waterways in the united states is nutrient pollution 1 the removal of nitrogen specifically ammonia from domestic wastewaters at municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp is important to limiting nutrient loading into the environment and protecting aquatic life from toxic effects 2 as states regulatory agencies implement increasingly stringent nutrient discharge limits on wwtp the cost of wastewater treatment will substantially increase with the implementation of new treatment technologies to achieve higher nitrogen removal 3 the most widely used strategy for ammonia removal is nitrification which introduces dissolved oxygen do via industrial air blowers to facilitate microbial uptake and conversion of organic nitrogen and ammonia in wastewater to nitrate consequently aeration is one of the largest operating expenses for most wwtp 4 in conventional biological treatment air blower output is increased or decreased proportional to the difference between the measured concentration of do and a target do concentration using a proportional integral derivative pid controller the do concentration setpoint for nitrification is usually between 0 5 and 3 mg l but is contingent on site specific factors such as the maximum ammonia loading rate 5 while do control can achieve complete ammonia removal the strategy has multiple drawbacks most notably the do setpoint is a poor surrogate of the immediate process demand and thus air is often supplied in excess of what is required for ammonia removal to save energy and continuously achieve complete ammonia removal at wwtp a new aeration paradigm is needed ammonia based aeration control abac is a control strategy that adjusts air flow to meet an ammonia concentration setpoint 6 abac is typically implemented as feedforward feedback or hybrid systems feedforward abac utilizes microbial kinetic process models to calculate the aeration demand given a variety of operating parameters such as solids retention time and influent ammonia concentration 7 this approach can reduce aeration demand but is costly to implement requiring extensive sampling and specialized knowledge for accurate model calibration and implementation feedback abac does not require kinetic process models but instead adjusts aeration based on the measured ammonia concentration within the process using multiple nested pid controllers in a cascade control configuration in the case of abac cascade control an ammonia sensor and setpoint define the outer master control loop while inner slave control loops define control variables such as do air blower flow and air blower speed in feedback controller design actuator and sensor dynamics within a process and wear and tear on the equipment that controls the process are frequently ignored 8 for aeration at wwtp this can lead to a large delay between a change in demand and the aeration provided when the aeration required to treat ammonia is not immediately met the difference between the measured ammonia value and the setpoint becomes large and the air blower speed is increased proportional to the difference this can result in large and short lived air flow peaks causing blowers to ramp up and down excessively thereby contributing to peak energy demand as the daily peak energy demand is used to calculate a wwtp s electricity bill a reduction of these aeration peaks will ultimately reduce energy and operating costs hybrid control approaches combine elements of feedforward and feedback control however these approaches have two universal limitations ammonia sensors are generally prone to drifting noisy measurements and require frequent field calibration pid aeration control is inherently based on past measured process values due to the time delay between a measurement and a corrective control action the resulting measurement delay is unable to accurately anticipate current and future process conditions due to the highly dynamic nature of biological wastewater treatment processes to address both drawbacks this study 1 proposes a stability metric to measure abnormally varied conditions and to compare control strategies to specifically address the second drawback this study also 2 develops a forecasting model for ammonia that could be incorporated into a feedback abac system for the latter objective statistical and machine learning models were used to forecast ammonia concentrations which would replace real time ammonia measurements the advantage of forecasting using statistical and machine learning models is that no additional sampling microbiological analysis or proprietary software is required to build a process model additionally a forecast can overcome the delay of feedback control and easily replace the current measured value of ammonia in the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system of a wwtp to date there are only a small number of wwtp worldwide that have implemented full scale data driven control systems forecasting models have been developed for predicting influent quality 9 14 but few models exist that are designed to adjust downstream operating conditions for more efficient treatment additionally much of the modeling performed in the literature is limited to water quality inputs that require hours to measure and cannot be used for real time control 14 16 in contrast our work directly models the actual biological treatment response to influent water quality changes and can be done in real time furthermore model errors reported in the existing literature are too large to improve real time control 20 40 17 18 14 specific to ammonia and abac modeling ekster et al 19 developed a proprietary model driven abac system that relies on specific mechanistic air flow mass transfer do and mass loading models to calculate ammonia removal but requires site specific modeling and calibration in contrast the tools developed in this work are designed for full scale implementation that do not need such expertise and specifications vezzaro et al 20 developed a phenomenological model to forecast influent ammonia based on a diurnal model and historical flow and concentration measurements our approach further extends the diurnal model approach by 1 including more than two harmonic pairs 2 including a linear model of operational predictor variables and 3 pairing this diurnal linear forecast with a machine learning method to reduce error at longer forecast horizons because we forecast ammonia concentrations within the wwtp incorporating both changing influent quality and current operational conditions rather than solely forecasting influent water quality this represents an improvement upon previous water quality forecasting approaches another unique feature of this work is the small dataset used most machine learning approaches for water quality prediction have required 1 10 years of historical data 14 18 given that most wastewater facilities make domestic and industrial additions to their collection system and or upgrades to existing infrastructure historical data often do not accurately represent current conditions and some variables may be sparsely sampled e g intermittent sampling during optimization efforts other machine learning approaches use pilot scale data which were collected under steady state conditions and do not typically account for the variability experienced at full scale i e all possible environmental and operational conditions 18 our work also shows how machine and statistical learning can be applied to wwtps using smaller windows of time of 3 7 days that allow the models to adapt quickly to infrastructure and operational changes additionally previous machine learning modeling efforts have focused on amending artificial neural networks ann with a mechanistic approach e g the activated sludge model flow and mass balances 21 22 but the combination of machine learning and the mechanistic models fails to substantially improve prediction accuracy statistical machine learning hybrid models have been shown to capture the real time dynamics of an individual full scale wwtp better than a standard mechanistic model 23 zhang 24 presented a hybrid statistical autoregressive integrated moving average or arima ann model for timeseries data and similar models utilizing arima ann variations have also been proposed for large sets of lab or flow data ömer 21 25 lotfi et al 26 similarly proposed an arima ann variation that did not include operational parameters in their prediction influent and effluent biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand total dissolved solids and total suspended solids rather lotfi et al 26 utilized the values of water quality variables not actively used in an individual model construction to predict the response which is not ideal for real time forecasting by ignoring operational conditions in the forecasting models the applications are limited to offline analysis and manual operational changes the goal of this work is to incorporate operational and environmental conditions to adjust the forecast in real time using short training windows to quickly adapt to changes to the system so that this approach could be easily incorporated into conventional wwtp s existing control strategies the contributions of this work are 1 to quantify the stability of do control and abac strategies for the boulder water resource recovery facility bwrrf a medium sized wwtp located in boulder colorado usa and 2 to develop data driven methods of forecasting ammonia at bwrrf for the purpose of improving accuracy reducing energy consumption and reducing mechanical wear of aeration systems do and abac feedback aeration strategies were tested and compared at the bwrrf to identify the most stable aeration control scheme which requires a balance of reliably removing ammonia to a desired concentration while minimizing operational variability and energy use the manuscript is organized as follows a description of the bwrrf section 2 1 the method and approach for quantifying variation section 2 2 summary of statistical and machine learning methods used to build the ammonia forecasting models section 2 3 a comparison of the stability metric to actual control strategy performance section 3 1 and an assessment of the performance of the forecasting models section 3 2 additional guidance on full scale implication of this work including code is included in the supplementary information 2 materials and methods 2 1 the boulder water resource recovery facility the bwrrf is a 25 million gallon per day mgd municipal wwtp currently operating a four stage bardenpho biological nutrient removal bnr process at an average of 12 mgd given the high altitude of the facility 5115 ft above mean sea level and low daily ammonia discharge limits 1 9 mg l nh4 as n oxygen transfer efficiency is relatively low and results in high aeration demand 27 do control is currently implemented using a three layer pid cascade control strategy that frequently over aerates to ensure treatment during peak ammonia loading conditions on average 1 2 hours per day this approach is energy inefficient and causes high do concentrations in downstream and recycle anoxic zones which reduces total nitrogen removal i e inhibits denitrification consequently aeration accounts for 35 50 of bwrrf s energy consumption there are multiple aeration control methods programmed into bwrrf s scada system all of which rely on feedback cascade control airflow do and abac airflow setpoint control adjusts valve position at the inlet of the aeration grid to produce a desired volumetric flow of air regardless of oxygen demand do concentration setpoints adjust the airflow setpoint to achieve a do concentration and abac setpoints adjust do concentration setpoints to achieve an ammonia concentration setpoint fig 1 the process variables included in the control logic y stability analysis and forecasting model are located in one of bwrrf s three aeration basins fig 2 the do concentrations exiting zones 6 7 8 and 9 of the aeration basins are continuously monitored using endress hauser cos61d optical do sensors reinach switzerland in the aerated zones zones 4 8 air

proficy using a visual basic script processed using r and forecasts were exported to proficy using a second visual basic script for use within bwrrf s scada system see supplementary information for visual basic and r scripts the control strategies analyzed in this study are summarized in table 1 a conventional do aeration control method with do setpoints for zones 4 6 7 and 8 of 2 5 2 0 and 1 0 mg l respectively is considered the experimental control for abac if the measured concentration of ammonia exceeds the setpoint the do setpoint is incrementally increased up to 2 3 2 3 and 1 0 mg l for zones 4 6 7 and 8 respectively if the measured concentration of ammonia is below the setpoint the do setpoint is incrementally decreased to no less than 1 0 1 0 and 0 1 mg l for the respective zones three abac strategies were tested including 3 5 mg l and 4 0 mg l ammonia setpoints at the middle of the aeration basin zone 7 in fig 2 and 90 s and 300 s time delays between pid control actions bwrrf operators initially increased the time between control actions to allow time for the do and ammonia sensors to stabilize artificially low or high sensor measurements can be caused by noise or water quality changes that occur faster than the sensors can reliably measure incorrect sensor measurements cause a pid control loop to repeatedly change process conditions which further changes water quality and compounds the problem of sensor instability 2 2 stability assessment the goal of the stability assessment is to provide wwtp engineers and operators with a quantitative metric to decide between two control strategies on the basis of variability to measure the stability of each operating strategy holistically we investigated total sample variance tsv tsv is the trace of the variance covariance matrix of p variables trace σ σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ p 2 a large tsv is indicative of increased variability within the process and therefore less stability consequently the most stable operating condition has the relatively lowest tsv to demonstrate if one operating condition is more stable than another the difference and ratio of tsv between two conditions are compared to a mixed population of tsv s from both conditions i e monte carlo simulation of tsv metrics first data from the control and test condition are combined into a single dataset and then randomly split into two datasets i j this random split is repeated 1000 times for each random reassignment estimates of tsv are computed for each split dataset t s v i and t s v j then a distribution of the ratio or difference between t s v i and t s v j under the null hypothesis can be obtained and the following sets of hypotheses can be tested 1 h 0 d i j 0 versus h 1 d i j 0 where d i j t s v i t s v j 2 h 0 r i j 1 versus h 1 r i j 1 where r i j t s v i t s v j to test the null hypothesis the number of observations from the random reassignments whose calculated d i j or r i j are greater than the observed tsv metric is used to approximate the p value 3 p 1 1000 k 1 1000 i r k r i j where r k is the ratio of tsvs from the randomly selected subset of observations from individual control strategies r i j is the ratio of tsvs from the observed data and i is a function whose value is 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise thus eq 3 computes the proportion of tsv ratios from the random reassignments that exceed the observed tsv ratio a similar computation can be constructed for the difference in tsvs a sample conclusion would be as follows if t s v i t s v d o t s v j t s v t e s t and p 0 01 then the test control scheme is said to be significantly less variable and therefore more stable than the conventional do control 2 3 ammonia forecast to train and test an ammonia forecasting model observations are aligned to simulate real time prediction using past process data and current ammonia data for an original dataset with n observations ammonia measurement y process variables x 1 x 2 x p at the current time t and forecast horizon f an n f p 1 matrix for training and testing is created given that the shortest dataset provided by bwrrf was 7 4 days all datasets were truncated to only include 7 4 days of online process data models are built using 1 6 days of process data in intervals of 1 day or 288 observations and are tested on the remaining observations in sequence updating the model for each new observation while maintaining a constant training window size table 2 forecast horizons of 5 75 min 1 15 observations were evaluated in increments of 5 min 1 observation timeseries plots of all monitored process variables for the following analysis can be found in the supplementary information figures s1 s4 all variables were scaled to zero mean and unit variance using the training dataset for each iteration to quantify model fit and forecast accuracy the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean squared error rmse respectively are used r2 is a measure of how well the model fits the training data an r2 1 indicates that the model predicts the values used to train the model exactly while an r2 0 indicates that the model does not explain any linear variation in the training data model testing performance is evaluated using rmse which is a measure of average squared error between model forecasts and the observed values the better the model s forecasts the lower its rmse the existing feedback control strategy is effectively using the current ammonia value as the forecast and is named persistence a comparison of the forecasting models to persistence using rmses is calculated as 4 r m s e p e r s i s t e n c e r m s e m o d e l r m s e p e r s i s t e n c e 100 2 3 1 diurnal linear model variation of ammonia in bnr is affected by environmental and operational conditions the environmental component is determined by changes in the influent water quality which follows strong daily trends fig 3 to model this time dependent component a diurnal model is fit to forecasted ammonia the predictors are various degrees d 1 2 200 of sine and cosine pairs s i n d t c o s d t where t is the minute of the day expressed in radians from 0 to 2π to model the operational component of the ammonia forecast a multiple linear regression model is fit to ammonia such that the combined fitted diurnal linear model is 5 y ˆ t β ˆ 0 β ˆ 1 s i n t β ˆ 2 c o s t β ˆ 2 d 1 s i n d t β ˆ 2 d c o s d t β ˆ 2 d 1 y t f β ˆ 2 d 2 x 1 t f β ˆ 2 d p 1 x p t f where p is the number of process variables x p t f is the p t h process variable lagged back some forecast horizon f y t f is the ammonia at time t f and β ˆ i are estimated linear model coefficients for i 0 1 2d p 1 to eliminate noise and reduce variability the final diurnal linear model only includes the most pertinent process variables and the optimum number of degrees of sine cosine pairs by using a modified model fit method that simultaneously achieves variable selection and coefficient estimation the smallest d with the relatively largest r2 is selected as the optimum d from the 1 200 d s tested the most pertinent process variables are selected using a multivariate linear model fitting method called adaptive lasso 28 multiple linear regression models have historically been fit using ordinary least squares ols where model parameters are estimated such that the sum of squares of the residuals are minimized the bias of this approach is low but it is heavily reliant on the quality of the training dataset and can have high variance a small change in the training data can substantially change ols parameter estimates 29 thus an alternative fitting method is selected to reduce prediction variability and improve model interpretability lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator is one such regularization method that can decrease model complexity while maintaining or improving accuracy 30 in lasso the sum of squares of the residuals are minimized along with a loss function that additionally penalizes the size of model parameter estimates β ˆ j shrinking insignificant predictors coefficients to zero the shrinkage term responsible for driving the coefficients to zero is controlled by λ when λ 0 lasso returns the same linear model coefficients as ols the larger λ is the fewer predictors will be included in the model which decreases variance in the prediction however in some cases lasso estimates are known to be biased and inconsistent a solution proposed by zou 28 uses adaptive weights w j to overcome the limitation of traditional lasso called adaptive lasso the adaptive lasso loss function is included in the objective function which is minimized to identify the best parameter selection and estimates 6 β ˆ min β i 1 n y i j 1 2 d p 1 x i j β j 2 λ j 1 2 d p 1 w j β j where λ is a regularization parameter and w j are coefficient specific weights both the diurnal model and diurnal linear model were trained and tested using the glmnet package in r initially 10 fold cross validation is used to fit a generalized linear model using ridge regression to obtain an initial estimate of β this method shrinks the linear model parameters towards zero but not exactly zero then the ridge regression regularization parameter is selected such that the model has the smallest cross validation error the parameter estimates from this model β j are used to calculate the weights of the adaptive lasso penalty term so we set w j 1 β j this allows different predictors to be penalized differently based on their initial estimates and drives coefficients that are already small to zero even faster the final adaptive lasso model is selected with λ within 1 standard error of the minimum cross validation error the advantages of using adaptive lasso are two fold variance reduction and variable selection the goal of the model is to forecast ammonia concentrations under environmental and operating conditions that may not have been included in the training data reducing the variance in model predictions prevents overfitting the model variable selection is an additionally appealing trait of adaptive lasso that 1 gives engineers and operators a better understanding of the most important operating process variables within a system and 2 eliminates unnecessary or noisy predictor variables an investigation of the variables included in each forecasting model as a function of training window and forecast horizon provides further insight not available using traditional machine learning techniques like ann described below 2 3 2 neural networks in the event that an interpretable linear process model cannot forecast ammonia with the desired accuracy machine learning techniques may be a more effective substitute or addition conventional mechanistic models use complex formulations that are connected in mathematically simple ways for example a nutrient removal model based on microbial kinetics can be summed for a wwtp wide mass balance machine learning methods including ann use the converse approach simple mathematical expressions are connected by complex nonlinear functions the detriment and advantage of ann are that no prior knowledge is needed to predict a process output but correspondingly no information is produced about the underlying mechanisms defining the input output relationship 31 33 the most common ann configuration is a feedforward ann which uses an input layer representative of the process variables a single hidden layer of analyses and an output layer containing the response variable the hidden layer is comprised of nodes and at each node a sum of weighted values from the input layer is used by the node s activation function to produce an output weights for each input variable node connection are determined using backpropagation algorithms to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output the feedforward ann is one directional and not computationally intensive the lack of model memory means that the feedforward ann neglects causality and order of observations to consider temporally ordered observations recurrent neural networks rnn can be used however while rnn were initially explored for this work the computation time was not amenable to real time prediction so rnns were excluded from this study two ann models are constructed to forecast ammonia 1 using all lagged process variables as inputs referred to as the ann model and 2 using all lagged process variables and the diurnal linear forecast as inputs referred to as the diurnal linear ann model or hybrid model the ann training and forecasts are performed using the python based tensorflow package in r the first hidden layer includes 10 or 11 neurons 2 3 the number of inputs for the ann and diurnal linear ann respectively and the second hidden layer includes 15 or 16 neurons the number of inputs using a linear activation function for all nodes rmsprop gradient descent optimization algorithm 34 and mean squared error as the objective loss function for backpropagation the forecast accuracy of the ann approach is compared to the diurnal linear model to determine if there is a substantial improvement in using nonlinear machine learning in forecasting in lieu of the more straightforward and accessible statistical model the hybrid diurnal linear model with the ann model is also considered in order to maximize prediction accuracy however most work in the water quality prediction literature compares ann model predictions to linear model predictions rather than combining them or in the case of zhu et al 14 applies the ann and linear model in parallel rather than series additional work in the literature combining mechanistic and machine learning models have not yet performed better than a machine learning model alone 21 22 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability assessment the initial implementation of abac at bwrrf test condition 1 abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s experienced a wide range and high frequency of ammonia fluctuations as shown in fig 4 a follow up with bwrrf operations staff revealed that the ammonia sensor developed a thick biofilm between an initial cleaning and calibration on april 19 and a second cleaning and calibration on april 30 the biofilm growth could have prevented the transfer of ammonia ions away from the sensor at low concentrations which may explain why the ammonia values do not approach zero in abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s unlike the other test conditions once the sensor was serviced and the ammonia setpoint increased abac 4 0 mg l at 90 s demonstrated substantially more process stability when the pid update frequency was increased from 90 s to 300 s the tendency for the system to overreact was further reduced thus leading to the least variable operating condition correspondingly the tsv of abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s is larger than all other test conditions and serves as an indicator of imprecise instrumentation and control as illustrated in fig 5 tsv is found to decrease as the control strategies become more tuned and stable to determine if the tsv for the most qualitatively stable strategy abac 4 0 mg l at 300 s is significantly less than the other control strategies tested two metrics were examined the difference in tsv s eq 1 and the ratio of tsv s eq 2 as shown in fig 6 a monte carlo simulation approximated the distribution of a mixed population i e under the null hypothesis and from this population a p value was calculated eq 3 the histograms are approximately normally distributed so both the difference and ratio of tsv values are considered stable metrics in all cases except abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s the observed difference and ratio of tsv values are significantly smaller than the do control strategy the increased tsv for abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s is expected due to the ammonia sensor failure during that time the method utilized here calculating tsv of two control strategies and using a monte carlo simulation to determine if the difference is significant is not limited to aeration control or bnr and could be applied to a variety of wwtp unit processes such as anaerobic digestion and solids settling processes the development of such a tool to quantitatively assess performance will allow utilities to systematically approach system wide optimization rather than rely on visual interpretation of timeseries and single variable monitoring in this case the tool assisted operations at bwrrf in deciding which abac strategy to use namely abac 4 0 mg l 300 s additionally tsv could be used as a monitoring tool to detect increased variability due to sensor instability as shown in test condition 1 3 2 ammonia forecast to further improve the performance of abac forecasting models were designed such that the model forecast could be used as the input for the feedback cascade control system at bwrrf the diurnal linear model and ann models were fit tested and compared to determine which modeling approach would provide the greatest performance improvement over persistence for predicting future ammonia concentrations 3 2 1 diurnal linear model the diurnal component of wwtp influent flows and loads is a well known phenomenon fig 3 but is rarely accounted for in daily operation to begin modeling the diurnal variation an initial model fit used a single sine cosine pair however this approach did not capture all cyclic patterns visible in the timeseries and autocorrelation plots further testing evaluated model fit using between 1 and 200 sine cosine pairs to forecast zone 7 ammonia concentration fig 7 plots model fit as a function of the number of sine cosine pairs up to 10 pairs the best diurnal model was effectively achieved using a 6 degree diurnal model the relatively low r2 value of the abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s control configuration test condition 1 is likely due to the abnormal process variation caused by a sensor failure evident in the minimum and maximum ammonia values discussed in the previous section fig 4 the diurnal model is independent of the forecast horizon but dependent on the training window size to accurately forecast ammonia the environmental and operational variations not described by diurnal effects are modeled by multiple linear regression which is fit using adaptive lasso with the time dependent diurnal terms and monitored process variables fig 2 in fig 8 the multiple linear regression model fit is plotted versus time for each training window 1 6 days and illustrates multiple trends model fit is found to be a function of forecast horizon size of the training window and day of the week as the forecast horizon increases variation unaccounted for by the linear model emerges and the model fit deteriorates thus the diurnal linear model performs best with shorter forecast horizons highest r2 shorter training windows may also have comparatively higher training r2 than longer training windows because the model encompasses a smaller range of environmental and operating conditions a shorter training window may be needed when adapting to weekend conditions as opposed to weekdays which tend to exhibit more nonlinear patterns regarding time flow and load however shorter training windows produce model parameter estimates that may be unstable and exhibit poor forecast accuracy in the testing set i e parameter estimates may be unrepresentative this is examined next an analysis of model forecast errors on the withheld testing set i e model accuracy given data not used in fitting the model itself demonstrates a common trend in statistical learning a high training r2 does not always correlate to a low testing rmse fig 9 plots the average training r2 and testing rmse for the do and abac 4 0 90 s control strategies as a function of forecast horizon similar to fig 8 the shorter the training window the larger the r2 averaged across all testing days however the actual performance of the forecast in a control loop is measured by rmse rmse also appears to be a function of training window size but the direction of the relationship is entirely dependent on the control strategy for example shorter training windows performed best across all forecast horizons for the do control strategy but the converse is true for the abac strategies compared to persistence the diurnal linear model performs better than persistence for forecast horizons greater than 15 minutes to implement the diurnal linear model the variability of the control system within the training window will impact whether a long or short window of time is necessary additionally r2 alone should not be used as a selection criteria for such a forecasting model rmse or another metric of testing error see 29 should be used to identify the best choices to tune a model to demonstrate the potential impact of supplementing the diurnal linear model forecast in lieu of the current ammonia sensor value the percent improvement between the persistence forecast and the model forecast is calculated equation 4 only the 5 25 50 and 75 minute forecast horizons are shown in table 3 for brevity but all forecast horizons can be found in the supplementary information table s1 a forecast horizon should be selected based on the time required to trigger and implement a single cascade control action the delay is a function of hydraulic retention time hrt which is the travel time between the inlet to the basin and the sensor measurement for the master pid control loop depending on the required forecast horizon a training window can then be selected with the largest percent improvement i e reduction in error by rmse over persistence at bwrrf the average hrt between the beginning of the aeration basin and the ammonia sensor location is 25 min an additional 15 25 minutes is required for the ammonia ion selective electrodes and do sensors to stabilize so a forecast horizon of 50 min is needed across all control strategies listed in table 1 the 50 minute diurnal linear forecasts improved over persistence between 20 and 52 in general a short forecast horizon performs best when trained on short windows of time conversely large forecast horizons 15 25 min depending on the control strategy require larger training windows specifically for the abac 4 0 mg l at 300 s the abac configuration selected by bwrrf for implementation a 6 day training window can improve the 50 minute forecast performance by 30 functionally this means that the pid loop will be triggered 30 sooner than under the current control strategy for abac this additional treatment time will primarily address the daily morning peak flow event in which the influent flow increases from 12 mgd to 20 mgd over the course of 60 120 min the preemptive response with a forecasted ammonia pid control strategy will appropriately increase air flow to prevent exceeding the ammonia concentration setpoint additionally the 50 minute forecast will trigger a reduction in air flow when the peak event wanes however the current control strategy uses minimum air flow and do concentration setpoints to ensure treatment under all conditions which inevitably leads to over treatment and excessive energy use given the knowledge that the system will proactively adjust to peak flow conditions more precise process control with forecasted master control variables may provide bwrrf operations staff the flexibility to lower the minimum air flow and do concentration setpoints reduce over treatment and ultimately save energy further investigation into the structure of the diurnal linear models fit using adaptive lasso provides insight as to which process variables are most important in forecasting and controlling ammonia in the do and abac systems the absolute values of the model coefficients are averaged across each training window size and forecast horizon and are plotted in fig 10 variable selection for each model is also found to be a function of training window size and forecast horizon for most models the current values of influent ammonia zone 7 ammonia and zone 9 do are the most important process variables to forecast future zone 7 ammonia interestingly non ammonia process variables become more important as the forecast horizon increases while the importance of the current ammonia sensor measurement decreases this may suggest that the future value of ammonia is more dependent on the quality of the recirculated activated sludge i e zone 9 do zone 3 nitrate no3 this reinforces our premise that the current measured value of ammonia is not the best representation of future ammonia values and illustrates the potential for a forecasting model to substantially improve upon bwrrf s existing control strategy here the use of adaptive lasso for variable selection as opposed to knowledge based selection is found to be critical for example the conventional feedforward abac models only include influent ammonia to calculate air demand and would neglect the impact of oxygen bleed through into anoxic zones thereby preventing complete nitrogen removal from the system 3 2 2 neural networks the use of ann to forecast ammonia is intended to capture the nonlinear environmental and operational process relationships that cannot be represented in the simpler diurnal linear model a comparison of the diurnal diurnal linear ann and diurnal linear ann model forecasts for the abac 4 0 mg l at 300 s control strategy are shown in fig 11 the results demonstrate that the ann overfits to the training data and does not accurately forecast ammonia in the testing dataset producing forecasts that are worse than persistence the lack of variable selection in ann could contribute to the poor forecast accuracy by overtraining to noise present in the training dataset and missing the underlying patterns controlling ammonia concentration a more complex ann model may be required to forecast more accurately however the computation time required may make this approach impossible to integrate into the existing bwrrf control framework furthermore such black box models tend to be unappealing to process engineers because the important drivers of variation in ammonia cannot be identified nonlinearities in the system that are unaccounted for in the diurnal linear model begin to manifest themselves as the forecast horizon gets larger and this is when the diurnal linear ann model performs best by incorporating the diurnal linear forecasts as an input to the ann the testing accuracy improves over the diurnal linear model for larger forecast horizons 40 min however the nonlinear component captured by the ann does not result in a smooth real time forecast the high frequency variation in the forecasts could be viewed negatively if bulk metrics such as rmse are not used fig 12 nonlinearities may also be partially modeled by the diurnal component resulting in a high r2 but low rmse due to overfitting model performance is also affected by error in the training window which for full scale implementation is unavoidable thus a model should be tested on a large window of time to determine how well the model responds to sensor error or changing environmental or operational conditions by adjusting the number of sine cosine pairs and including the ann the forecast performance generally improves the full scale tuned model in fig 12 was achieved by iteratively adjusting the number of diurnal pairs training window length and observation frequency and comparing the rmsemodel to rmsepersistence overall the use of either the diurnal linear model or the diurnal linear ann model outperforms the current control strategy for all forecast horizons the best performing combination of method and training window size i e smallest rmse for the abac 4 0 mg l at 300 s control strategy is given in table 4 4 conclusion the ability to forecast peak flow and ammonia events at wwtp could allow for a proactive aeration response the current reactive control paradigm results in multiple short lived peak aeration events per day which is mechanically hard on individual blowers and requires the use of auxiliary blowers consequently the control strategy is energy intensive and inefficient in this work do and abac aeration control strategies are compared by their process stability using a tsv metric to assist in operator and engineer decision making to further improve aeration control the accuracy of a forecasted abac strategy was evaluated and shown to improve upon the current persistence forecast used in pid cascade control two data driven modeling approaches were compared statistical learning and machine learning and we found that the diurnal linear was able to more accurately forecast ammonia than a standard ann when the diurnal linear model was combined with ann model forecast accuracy was improved for larger forecast horizons 40 min which suggests ann are able to account for nonlinearities that are not consequential at shorter forecast horizons the hybrid diurnal linear ann forecast improvement over persistence is from 24 to 46 for the 40 to 75 minute forecast horizons for full scale implementation of the forecast tuning is required to determine the optimum number of diurnal pairs e g sine cosine pairs training window length observation frequency and forecast horizon additionally bulk metrics such as tsv and rmse should be used to compare process variation and error and to identify the best diurnal linear ann model configuration for a given forecasting horizon by using a forecasted value of ammonia in lieu of measured ammonia it may be possible to maintain a more stable effluent ammonia concentration for example when high ammonia loading is forecast aeration will increase to keep pace with demand and will limit aeration when low ammonia loading is forecast proactive aeration control strategies that use high quality forecasts could help small and medium sized wwtp reduce energy requirements while providing high quality effluent the computationally feasible statistical and machine learning models explored here can be easily

13853,in this work a statistical stability metric and novel hybrid statistical machine learning ammonia forecasting model are developed to improve the accuracy and precision of municipal wastewater treatment aeration for biological nutrient removal is typically the largest energy expense for municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp ammonia based aeration control abac is one approach designed to minimize excessive aeration by adjusting air blower output from online ammonia measurements rather than from a dissolved oxygen do sensor which is the conventional aeration control approach we propose a quantitative stability metric total sample variance to compare system wide variability of competing aeration control strategies using this metric the performance of traditional do and abac control strategies with varying setpoints and control parameters were compared in a medium sized wwtp and the most stable strategy was identified and implemented at the facility to further improve abac performance ammonia forecasting models were constructed using both statistical and machine learning to improve the accuracy of the aeration control system diurnal diurnal linear artificial neural network ann and hybrid diurnal linear ann forecasting models were trained on real time plant wide process data the diurnal linear and diurnal linear ann forecasts were found to most accurately forecast ammonia improving upon the existing ammonia measurement by up to 32 and 46 respectively whereas the ann model forecast was only able to improve by up to 8 this work demonstrates the ease and flexibility of integrating statistics and machine learning methods for developing new treatment models in conventional wwtp for features in full scale conventional activated sludge systems keywords ammonia based aeration control artificial neural network cascade control stability assessment 1 introduction one of the greatest threats to surface waterways in the united states is nutrient pollution 1 the removal of nitrogen specifically ammonia from domestic wastewaters at municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp is important to limiting nutrient loading into the environment and protecting aquatic life from toxic effects 2 as states regulatory agencies implement increasingly stringent nutrient discharge limits on wwtp the cost of wastewater treatment will substantially increase with the implementation of new treatment technologies to achieve higher nitrogen removal 3 the most widely used strategy for ammonia removal is nitrification which introduces dissolved oxygen do via industrial air blowers to facilitate microbial uptake and conversion of organic nitrogen and ammonia in wastewater to nitrate consequently aeration is one of the largest operating expenses for most wwtp 4 in conventional biological treatment air blower output is increased or decreased proportional to the difference between the measured concentration of do and a target do concentration using a proportional integral derivative pid controller the do concentration setpoint for nitrification is usually between 0 5 and 3 mg l but is contingent on site specific factors such as the maximum ammonia loading rate 5 while do control can achieve complete ammonia removal the strategy has multiple drawbacks most notably the do setpoint is a poor surrogate of the immediate process demand and thus air is often supplied in excess of what is required for ammonia removal to save energy and continuously achieve complete ammonia removal at wwtp a new aeration paradigm is needed ammonia based aeration control abac is a control strategy that adjusts air flow to meet an ammonia concentration setpoint 6 abac is typically implemented as feedforward feedback or hybrid systems feedforward abac utilizes microbial kinetic process models to calculate the aeration demand given a variety of operating parameters such as solids retention time and influent ammonia concentration 7 this approach can reduce aeration demand but is costly to implement requiring extensive sampling and specialized knowledge for accurate model calibration and implementation feedback abac does not require kinetic process models but instead adjusts aeration based on the measured ammonia concentration within the process using multiple nested pid controllers in a cascade control configuration in the case of abac cascade control an ammonia sensor and setpoint define the outer master control loop while inner slave control loops define control variables such as do air blower flow and air blower speed in feedback controller design actuator and sensor dynamics within a process and wear and tear on the equipment that controls the process are frequently ignored 8 for aeration at wwtp this can lead to a large delay between a change in demand and the aeration provided when the aeration required to treat ammonia is not immediately met the difference between the measured ammonia value and the setpoint becomes large and the air blower speed is increased proportional to the difference this can result in large and short lived air flow peaks causing blowers to ramp up and down excessively thereby contributing to peak energy demand as the daily peak energy demand is used to calculate a wwtp s electricity bill a reduction of these aeration peaks will ultimately reduce energy and operating costs hybrid control approaches combine elements of feedforward and feedback control however these approaches have two universal limitations ammonia sensors are generally prone to drifting noisy measurements and require frequent field calibration pid aeration control is inherently based on past measured process values due to the time delay between a measurement and a corrective control action the resulting measurement delay is unable to accurately anticipate current and future process conditions due to the highly dynamic nature of biological wastewater treatment processes to address both drawbacks this study 1 proposes a stability metric to measure abnormally varied conditions and to compare control strategies to specifically address the second drawback this study also 2 develops a forecasting model for ammonia that could be incorporated into a feedback abac system for the latter objective statistical and machine learning models were used to forecast ammonia concentrations which would replace real time ammonia measurements the advantage of forecasting using statistical and machine learning models is that no additional sampling microbiological analysis or proprietary software is required to build a process model additionally a forecast can overcome the delay of feedback control and easily replace the current measured value of ammonia in the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system of a wwtp to date there are only a small number of wwtp worldwide that have implemented full scale data driven control systems forecasting models have been developed for predicting influent quality 9 14 but few models exist that are designed to adjust downstream operating conditions for more efficient treatment additionally much of the modeling performed in the literature is limited to water quality inputs that require hours to measure and cannot be used for real time control 14 16 in contrast our work directly models the actual biological treatment response to influent water quality changes and can be done in real time furthermore model errors reported in the existing literature are too large to improve real time control 20 40 17 18 14 specific to ammonia and abac modeling ekster et al 19 developed a proprietary model driven abac system that relies on specific mechanistic air flow mass transfer do and mass loading models to calculate ammonia removal but requires site specific modeling and calibration in contrast the tools developed in this work are designed for full scale implementation that do not need such expertise and specifications vezzaro et al 20 developed a phenomenological model to forecast influent ammonia based on a diurnal model and historical flow and concentration measurements our approach further extends the diurnal model approach by 1 including more than two harmonic pairs 2 including a linear model of operational predictor variables and 3 pairing this diurnal linear forecast with a machine learning method to reduce error at longer forecast horizons because we forecast ammonia concentrations within the wwtp incorporating both changing influent quality and current operational conditions rather than solely forecasting influent water quality this represents an improvement upon previous water quality forecasting approaches another unique feature of this work is the small dataset used most machine learning approaches for water quality prediction have required 1 10 years of historical data 14 18 given that most wastewater facilities make domestic and industrial additions to their collection system and or upgrades to existing infrastructure historical data often do not accurately represent current conditions and some variables may be sparsely sampled e g intermittent sampling during optimization efforts other machine learning approaches use pilot scale data which were collected under steady state conditions and do not typically account for the variability experienced at full scale i e all possible environmental and operational conditions 18 our work also shows how machine and statistical learning can be applied to wwtps using smaller windows of time of 3 7 days that allow the models to adapt quickly to infrastructure and operational changes additionally previous machine learning modeling efforts have focused on amending artificial neural networks ann with a mechanistic approach e g the activated sludge model flow and mass balances 21 22 but the combination of machine learning and the mechanistic models fails to substantially improve prediction accuracy statistical machine learning hybrid models have been shown to capture the real time dynamics of an individual full scale wwtp better than a standard mechanistic model 23 zhang 24 presented a hybrid statistical autoregressive integrated moving average or arima ann model for timeseries data and similar models utilizing arima ann variations have also been proposed for large sets of lab or flow data ömer 21 25 lotfi et al 26 similarly proposed an arima ann variation that did not include operational parameters in their prediction influent and effluent biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand total dissolved solids and total suspended solids rather lotfi et al 26 utilized the values of water quality variables not actively used in an individual model construction to predict the response which is not ideal for real time forecasting by ignoring operational conditions in the forecasting models the applications are limited to offline analysis and manual operational changes the goal of this work is to incorporate operational and environmental conditions to adjust the forecast in real time using short training windows to quickly adapt to changes to the system so that this approach could be easily incorporated into conventional wwtp s existing control strategies the contributions of this work are 1 to quantify the stability of do control and abac strategies for the boulder water resource recovery facility bwrrf a medium sized wwtp located in boulder colorado usa and 2 to develop data driven methods of forecasting ammonia at bwrrf for the purpose of improving accuracy reducing energy consumption and reducing mechanical wear of aeration systems do and abac feedback aeration strategies were tested and compared at the bwrrf to identify the most stable aeration control scheme which requires a balance of

four stage bardenpho biological nutrient removal bnr process at an average of 12 mgd given the high altitude of the facility 5115 ft above mean sea level and low daily ammonia discharge limits 1 9 mg l nh4 as n oxygen transfer efficiency is relatively low and results in high aeration demand 27 do control is currently implemented using a three layer pid cascade control strategy that frequently over aerates to ensure treatment during peak ammonia loading conditions on average 1 2 hours per day this approach is energy inefficient and causes high do concentrations in downstream and recycle anoxic zones which reduces total nitrogen removal i e inhibits denitrification consequently aeration accounts for 35 50 of bwrrf s energy consumption there are multiple aeration control methods programmed

visual basic and r scripts the control strategies analyzed in this study are summarized in table 1 a conventional do aeration control method with do setpoints for zones 4 6 7 and 8 of 2 5 2 0 and 1 0 mg l respectively is considered the experimental control for abac if the measured concentration of ammonia exceeds the setpoint the do setpoint is incrementally increased up to 2 3 2 3 and 1 0 mg l for zones 4 6 7 and 8 respectively if the measured concentration of ammonia is below the setpoint the do setpoint is incrementally decreased to no less than 1 0 1 0 and 0 1 mg l for the respective zones three abac strategies were tested including 3 5 mg l and 4 0 mg l ammonia setpoints at the middle of the aeration basin zone 7 in fig 2 and 90 s and 300 s time delays between pid control actions bwrrf operators initially increased the time between control actions to allow time for the do and ammonia sensors to stabilize artificially low or high sensor measurements can be caused by noise or water quality changes that occur faster than the sensors can reliably measure incorrect sensor measurements cause a pid control loop to repeatedly change process conditions which further changes water quality and compounds the problem of sensor instability 2 2 stability assessment the goal of the stability assessment is to provide wwtp engineers and operators with a quantitative metric to decide between two control strategies on the basis of variability to measure the stability of each operating strategy holistically we investigated total sample variance tsv tsv is the trace of the variance covariance matrix of p variables trace σ σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ p 2 a large tsv is indicative of increased variability within the process and therefore less stability consequently the most stable operating condition has the relatively lowest tsv to demonstrate if one operating condition is more stable than another the difference and ratio of tsv between two conditions are compared to a mixed population of tsv s from both conditions i e monte carlo simulation of tsv metrics first data from the control and test condition are combined into a single dataset and then randomly split into two datasets i j this random split is repeated 1000 times for each random reassignment estimates of tsv are computed for each split dataset t s v i and t s v j then a distribution of the ratio or difference between t s v i and t s v j under the null hypothesis can be obtained and the following sets of hypotheses can be tested 1 h 0 d i j 0 versus h 1 d i j 0 where d i j t s v i t s v j 2 h 0 r i j 1 versus h 1 r i j 1 where r i j t s v i t s v j to test the null hypothesis the number of observations from the random reassignments whose calculated d i j or r i j are greater than the observed tsv metric is used to approximate the p value 3 p 1 1000 k 1 1000 i r k r i j where r k is the ratio of tsvs from the randomly selected subset of observations from individual control strategies r i j is the ratio of tsvs from the observed data and i is a function whose value is 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise thus eq 3 computes the proportion of tsv ratios from the random reassignments that exceed the observed tsv ratio a similar computation can be constructed for the difference in tsvs a sample conclusion would be as follows if t s v i t s v d o t s v j t s v t e s t and p 0 01 then the test control scheme is said to be significantly less variable and therefore more stable than the conventional do control 2 3 ammonia forecast to train and test an ammonia forecasting model observations are aligned to simulate real time prediction using past process data and current ammonia data for an original dataset with n observations ammonia measurement y process variables x 1 x 2 x p at the current time t and forecast horizon f an n f p 1 matrix for training and testing is created given that the shortest dataset provided by bwrrf was 7 4 days all datasets were truncated to only include 7 4 days of online process data models are built using 1 6 days of process data in intervals of 1 day or 288 observations and are tested on the remaining observations in sequence updating the model for each new observation while maintaining a constant training window size table 2 forecast horizons of 5 75 min 1 15 observations were evaluated in increments of 5 min 1 observation timeseries plots of all monitored process variables for the following analysis can be found in the supplementary information figures s1 s4 all variables were scaled to zero mean and unit variance using the training dataset for each iteration to quantify model fit and forecast accuracy the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean squared error rmse respectively are used r2 is a measure of how well the model fits the training data an r2 1 indicates that the model predicts the values used to train the model exactly while an r2 0 indicates that the model does not explain any linear variation in the training data model testing performance is evaluated using rmse which is a measure of average squared error between model forecasts and the observed values the better the model s forecasts the lower its rmse the existing feedback control strategy is effectively using the current ammonia value as the forecast and is named persistence a comparison of the forecasting models to persistence using rmses is calculated as 4 r m s e p e r s i s t e n c e r m s e m o d e l r m s e p e r s i s t e n c e 100 2 3 1 diurnal linear model variation of ammonia in bnr is affected by environmental and operational conditions the environmental component is determined by changes in the influent water quality which follows strong daily trends fig 3 to model this time dependent component a diurnal model is fit to forecasted ammonia the predictors are various degrees d 1 2 200 of sine and cosine pairs s i n d t c o s d t where t is the minute of the day expressed in radians from 0 to 2π to model the operational component of the ammonia forecast a multiple linear regression model is fit to ammonia such that the combined fitted diurnal linear model is 5 y ˆ t β ˆ 0 β ˆ 1 s i n t β ˆ 2 c o s t β ˆ 2 d 1 s i n d t β ˆ 2 d c o s d t β ˆ 2 d 1 y t f β ˆ 2 d 2 x 1 t f β ˆ 2 d p 1 x p t f where p is the number of process variables x p t f is the p t h process variable lagged back some forecast horizon f y t f is the ammonia at time t f and β ˆ i are estimated linear model coefficients for i 0 1 2d p 1 to eliminate noise and reduce variability the final diurnal linear model only includes the most pertinent process variables and the optimum number of degrees of sine cosine pairs by using a modified model fit method that simultaneously achieves variable selection and coefficient estimation the smallest d with the relatively largest r2 is selected as the optimum d from the 1 200 d s tested the most pertinent process variables are selected using a multivariate linear model fitting method called adaptive lasso 28 multiple linear regression models have historically been fit using ordinary least squares ols where model parameters are estimated such that the sum of squares of the residuals are minimized the bias of this approach is low but it is heavily reliant on the quality of the training dataset and can have high variance a small change in the training data can substantially change ols parameter estimates 29 thus an alternative fitting method is selected to reduce prediction variability and improve model interpretability lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator is one such regularization method that can decrease model complexity while maintaining or improving accuracy 30 in lasso the sum of squares of the residuals are minimized along with a loss function that additionally penalizes the size of model parameter estimates β ˆ j shrinking insignificant predictors coefficients to zero the shrinkage term responsible for driving the coefficients to zero is controlled by λ when λ 0 lasso returns the same linear model coefficients as ols the larger λ is the fewer predictors will be included in the model which decreases variance in the prediction however in some cases lasso estimates are known to be biased and inconsistent a solution proposed by zou 28 uses adaptive weights w j to overcome the limitation of traditional lasso called adaptive lasso the adaptive lasso loss function is included in the objective function which is minimized to identify the best parameter selection and estimates 6 β ˆ min β i 1 n y i j 1 2 d p 1 x i j β j 2 λ j 1 2 d p 1 w j β j where λ is a regularization parameter and w j are coefficient specific weights both the diurnal model and diurnal linear model were trained and tested using the glmnet package in r initially 10 fold cross validation is used to fit a generalized linear model using ridge regression to obtain an initial estimate of β this method shrinks the linear model parameters towards zero but not exactly zero then the ridge regression regularization parameter is selected such that the model has the smallest cross validation error the parameter estimates from this model β j are used to calculate the weights of the adaptive lasso penalty term so we set w j 1 β j this allows different predictors to be penalized differently based on their initial estimates and drives coefficients that are already small to zero even faster the final adaptive lasso model is selected with λ within 1 standard error of the minimum cross validation error the advantages of using adaptive lasso are two fold variance reduction and variable selection the goal of the model is to forecast ammonia concentrations under environmental and operating conditions that may not have been included in the training data reducing the variance in model predictions prevents overfitting the model variable selection is an additionally appealing trait of adaptive lasso that 1 gives engineers and operators a better understanding of the most important operating process variables within a system and 2 eliminates unnecessary or noisy predictor variables an investigation of the variables included in each forecasting model as a function of training window and forecast horizon provides further insight not available using traditional machine learning techniques like ann described below 2 3 2 neural networks in the event that an interpretable linear process model cannot forecast ammonia with the desired accuracy machine learning techniques may be a more effective substitute or addition conventional mechanistic models use complex formulations that are connected in mathematically simple ways for example a nutrient removal model based on microbial kinetics can be summed for a wwtp wide mass balance machine learning methods including ann use the converse approach simple mathematical expressions are connected by complex nonlinear functions the detriment and advantage of ann are that no prior knowledge is needed to predict a process output but correspondingly no information is produced about the underlying mechanisms defining the input output relationship 31 33 the most common ann configuration is a feedforward ann which uses an input layer representative of the process variables a single hidden layer of analyses and an output layer containing the response variable the hidden layer is comprised of nodes and at each node a sum of weighted values from the input layer is used by the node s activation function to produce an output weights for each input variable node connection are determined using backpropagation algorithms to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output the feedforward ann is one directional and not computationally intensive the lack of model memory means that the feedforward ann neglects causality and order of observations to consider temporally ordered observations recurrent neural networks rnn can be used however while rnn were initially explored for this work the computation time was not amenable to real time prediction so rnns were excluded from this study two ann models are constructed to forecast ammonia 1 using all lagged process variables as inputs referred to as the ann model and 2 using all lagged process variables and the diurnal linear forecast as inputs referred to as the diurnal linear ann model or hybrid model the ann training and forecasts are performed using the python based tensorflow package in r the first hidden layer includes 10 or 11 neurons 2 3 the number of inputs for the ann and diurnal linear ann respectively and the second hidden layer includes 15 or 16 neurons the number of inputs using a linear activation function for all nodes rmsprop gradient descent optimization algorithm 34 and mean squared error as the objective loss function for backpropagation the forecast accuracy of the ann approach is compared to the diurnal linear model to determine if there is a substantial improvement in using nonlinear machine learning in forecasting in lieu of the more straightforward and accessible statistical model the hybrid diurnal linear model with the ann model is also considered in order to maximize prediction accuracy however most work in the water quality prediction literature compares ann model predictions to linear model predictions rather than combining them or in the case of zhu et al 14 applies the ann and linear model in parallel rather than series additional work in the literature combining mechanistic and machine learning models have not yet performed better than a machine learning model alone 21 22 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability assessment the initial implementation of abac at bwrrf test condition 1 abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s experienced a wide range and high frequency of ammonia fluctuations as shown in fig 4 a follow up with bwrrf operations staff revealed that the ammonia sensor developed a thick biofilm between an initial cleaning and calibration on april 19 and a second cleaning and calibration on april 30 the biofilm growth could have prevented the transfer of ammonia ions away from the sensor at low concentrations which may explain why the ammonia values do not approach zero in abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s unlike the other test conditions once the sensor was serviced and the ammonia setpoint increased abac 4 0 mg l at 90 s demonstrated substantially more process stability when the pid update frequency was increased from 90 s to 300 s the tendency for the system to overreact was further reduced thus leading to the least variable operating condition correspondingly the tsv of abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s is larger than all other test conditions and serves as an indicator of imprecise instrumentation and control as illustrated in fig 5 tsv is found to decrease as the control strategies become more tuned and stable to determine if the tsv for the most qualitatively stable strategy abac 4 0 mg l at 300 s is significantly less than the other control strategies tested two metrics were examined the difference in tsv s eq 1 and the ratio of tsv s eq 2 as shown in fig 6 a monte carlo simulation approximated the distribution of a mixed population i e under the null hypothesis and from this population a p value was calculated eq 3 the histograms are approximately normally distributed so both the difference and ratio of tsv values are considered stable metrics in all cases except abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s the observed difference and ratio of tsv values are significantly smaller than the do control strategy the increased tsv for abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s is expected due to the ammonia sensor failure during that time the method utilized here calculating tsv of two control strategies and using a monte carlo simulation to determine if the difference is significant is not limited to aeration control or bnr and could be applied to a variety of wwtp unit processes such as anaerobic digestion and solids settling processes the development of such a tool to quantitatively assess performance will allow utilities to systematically approach system wide optimization rather than rely on visual interpretation of timeseries and single variable monitoring in this case the tool assisted operations at bwrrf in deciding which abac strategy to use namely abac 4 0 mg l 300 s additionally tsv could be used as a monitoring tool to detect increased variability due to sensor instability as shown in test condition 1 3 2 ammonia forecast to further improve the performance of abac forecasting models were designed such that the model forecast could be used as the input for the feedback cascade control system at bwrrf the diurnal linear model and ann models were fit tested and compared to determine which modeling approach would provide the greatest performance improvement over persistence for predicting future ammonia concentrations 3 2 1 diurnal linear model the diurnal component of wwtp influent flows and loads is a well known phenomenon fig 3 but is rarely accounted for in daily operation to begin modeling the diurnal variation an initial model fit used a single sine cosine pair however this approach did not capture all cyclic patterns visible in the timeseries and autocorrelation plots further testing evaluated model fit using between 1 and 200 sine cosine pairs to forecast zone 7 ammonia concentration fig 7 plots model fit as a function of the number of sine cosine pairs up to 10 pairs the best diurnal model was effectively achieved using a 6 degree diurnal model the relatively low r2 value of the abac 3 5 mg l at 90 s control configuration test condition 1 is likely due to the abnormal process variation caused by a sensor failure evident in the minimum and maximum ammonia values discussed in the previous section fig 4 the diurnal model is independent of the forecast horizon but dependent on the training window size to accurately forecast ammonia the environmental and operational variations not described by diurnal effects are modeled by multiple linear regression which is fit using adaptive lasso with the time dependent diurnal terms and monitored process variables fig 2 in fig 8 the multiple linear regression model fit is plotted versus time for each training window 1 6 days and illustrates multiple trends model fit is found to be a function of forecast horizon size of the training window and day of the week as the forecast horizon increases variation unaccounted for by the linear model emerges and the model fit deteriorates thus the diurnal linear model performs best with shorter forecast horizons highest r2 shorter training windows may also have comparatively higher training r2 than longer training windows because the model encompasses a smaller range of environmental and operating conditions a shorter training window may be needed when adapting to weekend conditions as opposed to weekdays which tend to exhibit more nonlinear patterns regarding time flow and load however shorter training windows produce model parameter estimates that may be unstable and exhibit poor forecast accuracy in the testing set i e parameter estimates may be unrepresentative this is examined next an analysis of model forecast errors on the withheld testing set i e model accuracy given data not used in fitting the model itself demonstrates a common trend in statistical learning a high training r2 does not always correlate to a low testing rmse fig 9 plots the average training r2 and testing rmse for the do and abac 4 0 90 s control strategies as a function of forecast horizon similar to fig 8 the shorter the training window the larger the r2 averaged across all testing days however the actual performance of the forecast in a control loop is measured by rmse rmse also appears to be a function of training window size but the direction of the relationship is entirely dependent on the control strategy for example shorter training windows performed best across all forecast horizons for the do control strategy but the converse is true for the abac strategies compared to persistence the diurnal linear model performs better than persistence for forecast horizons greater than 15 minutes to implement the diurnal linear model the variability of the control system within the training window will impact whether a long or short window of time is necessary additionally r2 alone should not be used as a selection criteria for such a forecasting model rmse or another metric of testing error see 29 should be used to identify the best choices to tune a model to demonstrate the potential impact of supplementing the diurnal linear model forecast in lieu of the current ammonia sensor value the percent improvement between the persistence forecast and the model forecast is calculated equation 4 only the 5 25 50 and 75 minute forecast horizons are shown in table 3 for brevity but all forecast horizons can be found in the supplementary information table s1 a forecast horizon should be selected based on the time required to trigger and implement a single cascade control action the delay is a function of hydraulic retention time hrt which is the travel time between the inlet to the basin and the sensor measurement for the master pid control loop depending on the required forecast horizon a training window can then be selected with the largest percent improvement i e reduction in error by rmse over persistence at bwrrf the average hrt between the beginning of the aeration basin and the ammonia sensor location is 25 min an additional 15 25 minutes is required for the ammonia ion selective electrodes and do sensors to stabilize so a forecast horizon of 50 min is needed across all control strategies listed in table 1 the 50 minute diurnal linear forecasts improved over persistence between 20 and 52 in general a short forecast horizon performs best when trained on short windows of time conversely large forecast horizons 15 25 min depending on the control strategy require larger training windows specifically for the abac 4 0 mg l at 300 s the abac configuration selected by bwrrf for implementation a 6 day training window can improve the 50 minute forecast performance by 30 functionally this means that the pid loop will be triggered 30 sooner than under the current control strategy for abac this additional treatment time will primarily address the daily morning peak flow event in which the influent flow increases from 12 mgd to 20 mgd over the course of 60 120 min the preemptive response with a forecasted ammonia pid control strategy will appropriately increase air flow to prevent exceeding the ammonia concentration setpoint additionally the 50 minute forecast will trigger a reduction in air flow when the peak event wanes however the current control strategy uses minimum air flow and do concentration setpoints to ensure treatment under all conditions which inevitably leads to over treatment and excessive energy use given the knowledge that the system will proactively adjust to peak flow conditions more precise process control with forecasted master control variables may provide bwrrf operations staff the flexibility to lower the minimum air flow and do concentration setpoints reduce over treatment and ultimately save energy further investigation into the structure of the diurnal linear models fit using adaptive lasso provides insight as to which process variables are most important in forecasting and controlling ammonia in the do and abac systems the absolute values of the model coefficients are averaged across each training window size and forecast horizon and are plotted in fig 10 variable selection for each model is also found to be a function of training window size and forecast horizon for most models the current values of influent ammonia zone 7 ammonia and zone 9 do are the most important process variables to forecast future zone 7 ammonia interestingly non ammonia process variables become more important as the forecast horizon increases while the importance of the current ammonia sensor measurement decreases this may suggest that the future value of ammonia is more dependent on the quality of the recirculated activated sludge i e zone 9 do zone 3 nitrate no3 this reinforces our premise that the current measured value of ammonia is not the best representation of future ammonia values and illustrates the potential for a forecasting model to substantially improve upon bwrrf s existing control strategy here the use of adaptive lasso for variable selection as opposed to knowledge based selection is found to be critical for example the conventional feedforward abac models only include influent ammonia to calculate air demand and would neglect the impact of oxygen bleed through into anoxic zones thereby preventing complete nitrogen removal from the system 3 2 2 neural networks the use of ann to forecast ammonia is intended to capture the nonlinear environmental and operational process relationships that cannot be represented in the simpler diurnal linear model a comparison of the diurnal diurnal linear ann and diurnal linear ann model forecasts for the abac 4 0 mg l at 300 s control strategy are shown in fig 11 the results demonstrate that the ann overfits to the training data and does not accurately forecast ammonia in the testing dataset producing forecasts that are worse than persistence the lack of variable selection in ann could contribute to the poor forecast accuracy by overtraining to noise present in the training dataset and missing the underlying patterns controlling ammonia concentration a more complex ann model may be required to forecast more accurately however the computation time required may make this approach impossible to integrate into the existing bwrrf control framework furthermore such black box models tend to be unappealing to process engineers because the important drivers of variation in ammonia cannot be identified nonlinearities in the system that are unaccounted for in the diurnal linear model begin to manifest themselves as the forecast horizon gets larger and this is when the diurnal linear ann model performs best by incorporating the diurnal linear forecasts as an input to the ann the testing accuracy improves over the diurnal linear model for larger forecast horizons 40 min however the nonlinear component captured by the ann does not result in a smooth real time forecast the high frequency variation in the forecasts could be viewed negatively if bulk metrics such as rmse are not used fig 12 nonlinearities may also be partially modeled by the diurnal component resulting in a high r2 but low rmse due to overfitting model performance is also affected by error in the training window which for full scale implementation is unavoidable thus a model should be tested on a large window of time to determine how well the model responds to sensor error or changing environmental or operational conditions by adjusting the number of sine cosine pairs and including the ann the forecast performance generally improves the full scale tuned model in fig 12 was achieved by iteratively adjusting the number of diurnal pairs training window length and observation frequency and comparing the rmsemodel to rmsepersistence overall the use of either the diurnal linear model or the diurnal linear ann model outperforms the current control strategy for all forecast horizons the best performing combination of method and training window size i e smallest rmse for the abac 4 0 mg l at 300 s control strategy is given in table 4 4 conclusion the ability to forecast peak flow and ammonia events at wwtp could allow for a proactive aeration response the current reactive control paradigm results in multiple short lived peak aeration events per day which is mechanically hard on individual blowers and requires the use of auxiliary blowers consequently the control strategy is energy intensive and inefficient in this work do and abac aeration control strategies are compared by their process stability using a tsv metric to assist in operator and engineer decision making to further improve aeration control the accuracy of a forecasted abac strategy was evaluated and shown to improve upon the current persistence forecast used in pid cascade control two data driven modeling approaches were compared statistical learning and machine learning and we found that the diurnal linear was able to more accurately forecast ammonia than a standard ann when the diurnal linear model was combined with ann model forecast accuracy was improved for larger forecast horizons 40 min which suggests ann are able to account for nonlinearities that are not consequential at shorter forecast horizons the hybrid diurnal linear ann forecast improvement over persistence is from 24 to 46 for the 40 to 75 minute forecast horizons for full scale implementation of the forecast tuning is required to determine the optimum number of diurnal pairs e g sine cosine pairs training window length observation frequency and forecast horizon additionally bulk metrics such as tsv and rmse should be used to compare process variation and error and to identify the best diurnal linear ann model configuration for a given forecasting horizon by using a forecasted value of ammonia in lieu of measured ammonia it may be possible to maintain a more stable effluent ammonia concentration for example when high ammonia loading is forecast aeration will increase to keep pace with demand and will limit aeration when low ammonia loading is forecast proactive aeration control strategies that use high quality forecasts could help small and medium sized wwtp reduce energy requirements while providing high quality effluent the computationally feasible statistical and machine learning models explored here can be easily

13854,flux increase occurs when a membrane is inverted from normal position of active layer al facing feed solution fs it was noticed at the very early stage of reverse osmosis ro membrane development but much attention has not been paid since then possibly because of severe internal concentration polarization that occurs in the porous sublayer in forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro when they are run in the preferred mode of al facing draw solution ds the water flow direction is from the porous sublayer to the al which is the same as the inverted position of ro hence it is interesting to know if a similar flux increase from the normal to the inverted position is also occurring in fo and pro the objective of this work is to confirm the effect of membrane inversion on the flux and separation of two ro membranes as well as to know if a similar increase in water flux is occurring in fo pro results showed that significant flux increase up to an order of magnitude takes place when the membrane is in the inverted position while exhibiting almost no selectivity as for the possibility of such a flux increase in fo pro it was denied by the multivariable regression analysis of the experimental fo pro data found in the literature keywords reverse osmosis forward osmosis pressure retarded osmosis inverted membrane concentration polarization 1 introduction sourirajan s experiments on the flow rate of an inverted cellulose acetate membrane are recorded in his book reverse osmosis published in 1970 1 he has flipped a reverse osmosis ro membrane to make the porous sublayer contact with the feed salt solution and noticed that the flux increased significantly from the normal position i e the selective layer was in contact with the feed solution when the feed pressure was increased the flux increased concaved up but when the pressure was decreased from its maximum the flux decreased linearly resulting in a hysteresis curve sourirajan explained this phenomenon by partial pore expansion by the water flow caused by the trans membrane pressure difference no thorough investigations have been made since then due likely to the potential severe concentration polarization in the porous layer that takes place when the salt is rejected by the selective layer causing an adverse effect on the flux and selectivity in the engineered osmosis membrane processes i e forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro there are two modes of operation one is called al active layer facing ds draw solution mode 2 3 where the porous sublayer of membrane is facing the feed solution fs during operation 4 since the osmotic flow is from fs to ds the flow direction is from porous sublayer to the active layer the other is called al facing fs 5 6 where the membrane is inverted from the al facing ds mode and the flow direction is from the active layer to the porous sublayer it is known that the flux is much higher when membrane is operated in al facing ds mode than in al facing fs mode owing to the reduced internal concentration polarization icp 7 9 fig 1 a illustrates the membrane in these two orientations during osmotically driven process typically the icp phenomenon is much more serious in al facing fs mode because the solutes of highly concentrated ds do not readily diffuse into the porous layer and the solute concentration at the al porous layer interface decreases significantly as a result 10 11 it should be noted that this explanation and the associated mathematical model for fo is based on the assumption that the membrane behaves in the same manner as in the normal mode of ro regardless of the mode in engineered osmosis process fig 1 b illustrates the membrane in the normal and inverted orientation during pressure driven process in view of this the objectives of this work are a to confirm the membrane water flux increase that takes place when the membrane is inverted from its normal to inverted position and b to examine if the large flux is taking place when the fo and pro are operated in al facing ds mode to this end ro separation experiments with nacl solution were conducted using two commercial thin film composite tfc membranes to generate ro transport parameters then the membranes were inverted to study both flux and solute selectivity 2 experimental 2 1 membranes in this study two commercial membranes supplied by different manufacturers in dry flat sheet form were used for performance evaluation the first membrane type is filmtec s sw30xle membrane 12 a tfc membrane developed for seawater desalination process hereinafter referred to as tfc1 the second type of membrane is newly developed tfc membrane by a membrane company using advanced polymeric and supporting materials for flux and mechanical property enhancement hereinafter referred to as tfc2 details of tfc2 membrane are not able to disclose as the company has a proprietary right to this membrane property all these two membranes were wetted in pure water for at least 1 day before being used for any assessment the morphologies of membrane surface top and bottom and cross section before and after testing were also examined using a tabletop scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm3000 for the membrane surface observation a small piece of each sample dimension 0 4 mm w 0 4 mm l was mounted on a specimen stub horizontally for cross sectional analysis a membrane sample was fractured in liquid nitrogen to obtain clear and smooth morphology before placing it on a specimen stub all samples were then sputter coated with gold before subjecting to sem analysis 2 2 filtration experiment all the filtration tests were performed using a 300 ml commercial filtration cell hp4750 manufactured by sterlitech 13 two different filtration modes i e normal and inverted were conducted on the tfc membranes the sequence of the experiments is as follows 1 evaluation of pure water flux pwf with a coupon taken from tfc1 under normal condition by varying the operating pressure from low pressure to high pressure and return to low pressure hereinafter referred to as low p high p low p 2 evaluation of pwf with a coupon taken from tfc1 under normal condition from high pressure to low pressure and return to high pressure hereinafter referred to as high p low p high p 3 evaluation of pwf with a coupon taken from tfc1 under inverted condition in a sequence low p high p low p 4 evaluation of pwf with a coupon taken from tfc1 under inverted condition in a sequence high p low p high p in each pwf evaluation different coupons were used the same sequence of pwf experiments was then repeated for tfc2 the pwf j l m2 h of membrane was determined using eq 1 1 j δ v a m δ t where am is the total effective area of membrane membrane testing area 14 6 10 4 m2 and δv is the volume of permeate collected over a specific time δt the salt rejection r of each membrane for different testing conditions was further evaluated by replacing the pure water in the filtration cell with 1000 ppm nacl obtained from sigma aldrich solution with the sequence of the experiments described above eq 2 was employed to calculate r 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf represent salt concentration of permeate and feed respectively the electrical conductance of salt solution in both feed and permeate were measured by using a bench scale conductivity meter jenway 4520 furthermore an additional experiment was performed to examine if inverted mode does alter the morphology of membrane and its performance from the normal mode the pwf and nacl rejection of tfc membranes were re evaluated under normal mode in a sequence high p low p high p after they were subjected to inverted testing at 10 bar for 45 min 2 3 fouling test to further study the impacts of membrane fouling a coupon from each membrane type was subjected to filtration of organic solution composed of 500 ppm sodium alginate sa sigma aldrich at a fixed pressure of 10 bar under normal and inverted mode for each filtration mode the water flux of each membrane was recorded as a function of filtration time for a period of 90 min and normalized flux was then calculated using eq 3 3 normalized flux j jo where j is the water flux of membrane measured at different time and jo is the pristine water flux of the membrane both j and jo were determined using eq 1 once the fouling experiment test was completed the membrane surface the side that contacted feed solution was rinsed with pure water by running water over its surface for 5 min the membrane was then re evaluated with respect to pure water flux at 10 bar the relative flux recovery rate frr of membrane was determined using eq 4 4 frr jt jo 100 where jt is the water flux of rinsed membrane at 10 bar and jo is the initial water flux of pristine membrane at 10 bar both jt and jo were determined using eq 1 2 4 regression analysis fo and pro experimental data in the literature were subjected to the multi variable regression analysis to obtain the best fit membrane characterization parameters the details of the method are shown in the results and discussion sections 4 1 and 4 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 pwf experiment fig 2 summarizes the pwf data of tfc1 membrane tested under different filtration mode in fig 2 a for the normal mode both low p high p low p and high p low p high p are represented by linear relationship with coefficients of determination of more than 0 92 although the slope of low p high p low p is slightly higher than high p low p high p it seems that there is no significant difference between these two straight lines considering that both experiments were performed using two different coupons the reproducibility of data is excellent in fig 2 b the same trend is observed as fig 2 a but high p low p high p showed slightly lower fluxes than low p high p low p probably due to membrane compaction that took place when a high pressure was applied in the beginning comparing between fig 2 a and b the membranes tested under inverted mode exhibited an order of magnitude higher pwp than normal mode e g for the low p high p low p series 11 fold at 2 bar to 24 fold at 15 bar confirming sourirajan s report 1 however no hysteresis could be observed it should be noted that sourirajan s experiments were conducted with integrally skinned asymmetric cellulose acetate membrane whereas those in this work were conducted with tfc polyamide membranes fig 3 shows the pwf of tfc2 membrane in normal and inverted mode the trends observed in fig 3 are the same as in fig 2 but the pwfs of tfc2 membrane are much higher than tfc1 membrane and the fluxes of the series high p low p high p were significantly lower than low p high p low p indicating more compaction of tfc2 membrane than tfc1 membrane nevertheless it must be noted that the pwf of tfc2 membranes are significantly higher than tfc1 membrane regarding of filtration mode and this could be attributed to the use of advanced materials for tfc2 membrane production 3 2 ro experiments table 1 summarizes the ro performance for tfc1 and tfc2 membrane in both normal and inverted position from the data for pwf and nacl separation r water permeation coefficient a l m2 h bar and solute permeation constant b l m2 h can be calculated by 5 a j δ p 6 1 r r b a δ p δ π where δp is the operating pressure and δπ is the osmotic pressure difference between the feed and permeate side of the membrane 14 using the osmotic pressure of 1000 ppm nacl solution equal to 0 7838 bar 15 as well as the average values of pwf and separation for tfc1 and tfc2 the transport parameters are a 0 50 l m2 h bar b 0 155 l m2 h and a 3 39 l m2 h bar and b 5 33 l m2 h respectively for tfc1 and tfc2 the parameters are lower and higher for tfc1 and tfc2 respectively than those reported by tang et al 14 a 2 2 10 12 m s pa 0 79 l m2 h bar b 1 7 10 7 m s 0 61 l m2 h these differences are ascribed to the difference in the membranes note that tang et al 14 used cellulose triacetate cta fo membrane manufactured by hydration technology innovations hti when the membrane was inverted much higher fluxes were observed similar to the pwf data the nacl selectivity decreased remarkably to less than 6 table 1 5th column therefore eqs 5 and 6 are no longer applicable since they were derived on the assumption that the selectivity is nearly equal to unity after the experiments in the inverted mode the membrane was flipped back to the normal position and ro experiments were performed and the results are shown in fig 4 the fluxes went back to those of the normal mode before the experiments in the inverted position the nacl rejections were 91 92 and 65 80 for tfc1 and tfc2 respectively which were lower than before the inverted mode operation but much higher than the inverted mode operation these results show that the membrane structure was practically unchanged by the experiments in the inverted position a plausible explanation of these results is the partial pore expansion that occurs when the water flows from the porous support side driven by the pressure applied on the porous support side whereas such pore expansion does not take place when the pressure is applied from the active layer side thus the membrane of an asymmetric structure acts as a membrane valve 3 3 fouling experiments finally fouling experiments were performed using 500 ppm sa as the solute fig 5 a shows that the flux of tfc1 membrane did not change during the 90 min operation when the membrane was in the normal position while it went down to about 10 of initial flux for the inverted position indicating severe membrane fouling due likely to the entrapment of organic foulants in the porous sublayer the frr of both membrane is shown in table 2 with respect to tfc1 membrane frr was more than 100 for the normal position while it was about 10 for the inverted position indicating irreversible fouling in the inverted position these results also imply that much severer concentration polarization will take place when the membrane is used in the inverted mode as expected as for tfc2 membrane severe flux decrease down to 55 of initial flux was noticed during the first 15 min of operation in the normal position due probably to the membrane compaction then the flux was stabilized the initial flux decrease was more severe down to 30 of the initial flux for the operation in the inverted position before the flux decrease became less severe this is because of the combined effects of compaction and fouling frr corresponds closely to the initial 15 min flux decrease indicating that the compaction could not be removed by simple membrane rinsing using water 3 4 scanning electron microscopy figs 6 and 7 show the sem images of tfc1 and tfc2 membrane respectively before and after the pwf experiments in the inverted position in both figures no notable change after the pwf experiments in the inverted position is observed at the top and bottom surface confirming the conclusions made by the nacl separation experiments as for the cross sectional images membrane compaction is noticed in both tfc1 and tfc2 membranes in particular in tfc2 membrane bending and compaction of the porous sublayer together with the top active layer are noticed above the fibers of the backing material 4 impact on fo and pro 4 1 fo in fo water flows from the feed solution fs of lower solute concentration to the draw solution ds of higher solute concentration through the active layer of the membrane due to the difference in osmotic pressures on both sides of the membrane the water flux is hence given by 7 j a a π d s π a l s l where j a l m2 h is the flux of a water from fs to ds π d s bar and π a l s l bar are the osmotic pressure of ds and the osmotic pressure of the solution at the active layer al support layer sl interface respectively the solute flux j b is given by 8 j b b c d s c a l s l where c d s and c a l s l are the solute concentration of ds and that of the solution at the al sl interface respectively there are 2 modes of fo depending on the membrane orientation as shown in fig 8 one is the al facing fs mode fig 8 a and the other is the al facing ds mode fig 8 b obviously the membrane orientation of al facing fs mode is the same as the normal position of ro and al facing ds is the same as the inverted position of ro it is known that the flux of al facing ds mode is higher than al facing fs mode and usually it is explained by the less severe icp of al facing ds mode as mentioned earlier it is interesting to know if the increase in the flux is indeed due to the less severe icp or it is caused by the flux increase due to the inverted membrane orientation therefore the discussion on the fo transport is now focused on the al facing ds mode as shown in fig 8 b c a l s l is higher than feed solute concentration c f s and accordingly π a l s l is higher than π f s assuming that the osmotic pressure is proportional to solute concentration with a proportionality constant of b c a l s l is given by 9 ln b c a l s l b a b c f s b a j a k m where k m is the mass transfer coefficient of salt in the support layer combining eqs 7 and 9 we obtain 10 j a k m ln a b c d s j a b a b c f s b and from eq 8 11 j b b a b j a tang et al 14 conducted ro experiments with the hti cta membrane in the normal position at the feed pressures between zero and 15 5 bar and the feed nacl concentration of 0 01 mol l applying eqs 5 and 6 they obtained a 2 2 10 12 m s pa 0 79 l m2 h bar and b 1 7 10 7 m s 0 61 l m2 h tang et al 14 also conducted fo experiments with the same hti cta membrane using nacl as the draw solute the nacl concentration was changed from zero to 4 mol l and the feed was salt free the experimental values they obtained for j a and j b are shown in fig 9 a and b respectively each as a function of c d s note that there are 8 j a c d s data sets and 4 j b c d s sets which allow to find the best fit parameters a b and km the solver excel add in program was used for the optimization with b 46 374 bar mol l resulting in the best fit parameters a 0 87 l m2 h bar b 0 75 l m2 h and the km 10 6 l m2 bar the a and b values obtained from the fo experiments are close to those obtained from the ro experimental data which allows us to conclude that the order of magnitude increase in water flux is not taking place in fo even when the membrane was used in the inverted position the agreement between the theoretical values lines and experimental values symbols is excellent as shown in fig 9 a and b with the coefficients of determination r2 of 0 989 and 0 993 respectively 4 2 fro in pro water also flows from fs to ds a pressure is applied on ds and the hydraulic energy i e water flow rate pressure is converted into mechanical or electrical energy by turbine hence water flux is given as 12 j a a π d s π a l s l δ p where δ p p d s p f s combining the equation for concentration polarization eq 9 with eq 12 with an assumption that the osmotic pressure is proportional to the solute concentration we obtain 13 j a k m ln a b c d s j a a δ p b a b c f s b eq 13 is the same as eq 10 of achilli et al 16 where the external concentration polarization is ignored even though it is given in a different form then the power density e is given by 14 e δ p j a δ p k m ln a b c d s j a a δ p b a b c f s b achilli et al 16 conducted ro experiments with an hti cta membrane in the normal position at the feed pressures between zero and 10 15 bar and the feed nacl concentration 34 2 10 3 mol l applying eqs 5 and 6 they obtained a 1 89 10 9 m s kpa 0 68 l m2 h bar and b 1 11 10 7 m s 0 40 l m2 h achilli et al 16 then conducted pro experiments with the same membrane at the various feed nacl concentrations 0 0 0428 and 0 0855 mol l the various draw nacl concentrations 0 599 and 1 069 mol l and the various pressures 0 2 6 and 10 bar the experimental values obtained for j a and e are shown in fig 10 thus there are 24 j a δ p data sets which allows us to find the best fit parameters a b and km the solver excel add in program was used for the optimization with b 46 374 bar mol l resulting in the best fit parameters of a 0 997 l m2 h bar b 3 627 l m2 h and the km 10 92 l m2 bar the agreement between the theoretical values lines and experimental values symbols is excellent as shown in fig 10 with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 938 and 0 990 for j a and e respectively again a obtained from the pro data is not significantly higher than that obtained from ro experiments denying the substantial increase of water flux from the normal orientation of ro to the inverted orientation of pro it should also be noted that the a b and km of tang et al 14 and those of achilli et al 16 are close to each other except for the larger values of b by achilli et al 16 although they are based on the results from two different experiments one from fo and the other from pro 5 conclusions based on the experimental findings and the regression analysis of the literature values the conclusions drawn by this work are as follows 1 an order of magnitude increase in pure water flux takes place when tfc ro membrane is inverted from the normal position where the active layer faces the feed solution the pure water flux in the inverted membrane position is found to increase linearly with operating pressure 2 the nacl separation becomes practically zero less than 6 when the membrane is in the inverted position and the membrane in this position is also severely fouled i e low frr 3 the initial ro membrane performance can be recovered when the membrane is inverted back to the normal position with slight decrease in nacl separation the sem images indicate practically no change of top and bottom surfaces but the membrane compaction is noticed in the cross sectional images 4 the increase in water flux observed in ro with the membrane in the inverted orientation does not take place when membrane is run in al facing ds mode in fo and pro declaration of competing interest the authors whose names are listed immediately below certify that

13854,flux increase occurs when a membrane is inverted from normal position of active layer al facing feed solution fs it was noticed at the very early stage of reverse osmosis ro membrane development but much attention has not been paid since then possibly because of severe internal concentration polarization that occurs in the porous sublayer in forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro when they are run in the preferred mode of al facing draw solution ds the water flow direction is from the porous sublayer to the al which is the same as the inverted position of ro hence it is interesting to know if a similar flux increase from the normal to the inverted position is also occurring in fo and pro the objective of this work is to confirm the effect of membrane inversion on the flux and separation of two ro membranes as well as to know if a similar increase in water flux is occurring in fo pro results showed that significant flux increase up to an order of magnitude takes place when the membrane is in the inverted position while exhibiting almost no selectivity as for the possibility of such a flux increase in fo pro it was denied by the multivariable regression analysis of the experimental fo pro data found in the literature keywords reverse osmosis forward osmosis pressure retarded osmosis inverted membrane concentration polarization 1 introduction sourirajan s experiments on the flow rate of an inverted cellulose acetate membrane are recorded in his book reverse osmosis published in 1970 1 he has flipped a reverse osmosis ro membrane to make the porous sublayer contact with the feed salt solution and noticed that the flux increased significantly from the normal position i e the selective layer was in contact with the feed solution when the feed pressure was increased the flux increased concaved up but when the pressure was decreased from its maximum the flux decreased linearly resulting in a hysteresis curve sourirajan explained this phenomenon by partial pore expansion by the water flow caused by the trans membrane pressure difference no thorough investigations have been made since then due likely to the potential severe concentration polarization in the porous layer that takes place when the salt is rejected by the selective layer causing an adverse effect on the flux and selectivity in the engineered osmosis membrane processes i e forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro there are two modes of operation one is called al active layer facing ds draw solution mode 2 3 where the porous sublayer of membrane is facing the feed solution fs during operation 4 since the osmotic flow is from fs to ds the flow direction is from porous sublayer to the active layer the other is called al facing fs 5 6 where the membrane is inverted from the al facing ds mode and the flow direction is from the active layer to the porous sublayer it is known that the flux is much higher when membrane is operated in al facing ds mode than in al facing fs mode owing to the reduced internal concentration polarization icp 7 9 fig 1 a illustrates the membrane in these two orientations during osmotically driven process typically the icp phenomenon is much more serious in al facing fs mode because the solutes of highly concentrated ds do not readily diffuse into the porous layer and the solute concentration at the al porous layer interface decreases significantly as a result 10 11 it should be noted that this explanation and the associated mathematical model for fo is based on the assumption that the membrane behaves in the same manner as in the normal mode of ro regardless of the mode in engineered osmosis process fig 1 b illustrates the membrane in the normal and inverted orientation during pressure driven process in view of this the objectives of this work are a to confirm the membrane water flux increase that takes place when the membrane is inverted from its normal to inverted position and b to examine if the large flux is taking place when the fo and pro are operated in al facing ds mode to this end ro separation experiments with nacl solution were conducted using two commercial thin film composite tfc membranes to generate ro transport parameters then the membranes were inverted to study both flux and solute selectivity 2 experimental 2 1 membranes in this study two commercial membranes supplied by different manufacturers in dry flat sheet form were used for performance evaluation the first membrane type is filmtec s sw30xle membrane 12 a tfc membrane developed for seawater desalination process hereinafter referred to as tfc1 the second type of membrane is newly developed tfc membrane by a membrane company using advanced polymeric and supporting materials for flux and mechanical property enhancement hereinafter referred to as tfc2 details of tfc2 membrane are not able to disclose as the company has a proprietary right to this membrane property all these two membranes were wetted in pure water for at least 1 day before being used for any assessment the morphologies of membrane surface top and bottom and cross section before and after testing were also examined using a tabletop scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm3000 for the membrane surface observation a small piece of each sample dimension 0 4 mm w 0 4 mm l was mounted on a specimen stub horizontally for cross sectional analysis a membrane sample was fractured in liquid nitrogen to obtain clear and smooth morphology before placing it on a specimen stub all samples were then sputter coated with gold before subjecting to sem analysis 2 2 filtration experiment all the filtration tests were performed using a 300 ml commercial filtration cell hp4750 manufactured by sterlitech 13 two different filtration modes i e normal and inverted were conducted on the tfc membranes the sequence of the experiments is as follows 1 evaluation of pure water flux pwf with a coupon taken from tfc1 under normal condition by varying the operating pressure from low pressure to high pressure and return to low pressure hereinafter referred to as low p high p low p 2

with a coupon taken from tfc1 under inverted condition in a sequence low p high p low p 4 evaluation of pwf with a coupon taken from tfc1 under inverted condition in a sequence high p low p high p in each pwf evaluation different coupons were used the same sequence of pwf experiments was then repeated for tfc2 the pwf j l m2 h of membrane was determined using eq 1 1 j δ v a m δ t where am is the total effective area of membrane membrane testing area 14 6 10 4 m2 and δv is the volume of permeate collected over a specific time δt the salt rejection r of each membrane for different testing conditions was further evaluated by replacing the pure water in the filtration cell with 1000 ppm nacl obtained from sigma aldrich solution with the sequence of the experiments described above eq 2 was employed to calculate r 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf represent salt concentration of permeate and feed respectively the electrical conductance of salt solution in both feed and permeate were measured by using a bench scale conductivity meter jenway 4520 furthermore an additional experiment was performed to examine if inverted mode does alter the morphology of membrane and its performance from the normal mode the pwf and nacl rejection of tfc membranes were re evaluated under normal mode in a sequence high p low p high p after they were subjected to inverted testing at 10 bar for 45 min 2 3 fouling test to further study the impacts of membrane fouling a coupon from each membrane type was subjected to filtration of organic solution composed of 500 ppm sodium alginate sa sigma aldrich at a fixed pressure of 10 bar under normal and inverted mode for each filtration mode the water flux of each membrane was recorded as a function of filtration time for a period of 90 min and normalized flux was then calculated using eq 3 3 normalized flux j jo where j is the water flux of membrane measured at different time and jo is the pristine water flux of the membrane both j and jo were determined using eq 1 once the fouling experiment test was completed the membrane surface the side that contacted feed solution was rinsed with pure water by running water over its surface for 5 min the membrane was then re evaluated with respect to pure water flux at 10 bar the relative flux recovery rate frr of membrane was determined using eq 4 4 frr jt jo 100 where jt is the water flux of rinsed membrane at 10 bar and jo is the initial water flux of pristine membrane at 10 bar both jt and jo were determined using eq 1 2 4 regression analysis fo and pro experimental data in the literature were subjected to the multi variable regression analysis to obtain the best fit membrane characterization parameters the details of the method are shown in the results and discussion

excellent in fig 2 b the same trend is observed as fig 2 a but high p low p high p showed slightly lower fluxes than low p high p low p probably due to membrane compaction that took place when a high

obtained from ro experiments denying the substantial increase of water flux from the normal orientation of ro to the inverted orientation of pro it should also be noted that the a b and km of tang et al 14 and those of achilli et al 16 are close to each other except for the larger values of b by achilli et al 16 although they are based on the results from two different experiments one from fo and the other from pro 5 conclusions based on the experimental findings and the regression analysis of the literature values the conclusions drawn by this work are as follows 1 an order of magnitude increase in pure water flux takes place when tfc ro membrane is inverted from the normal position where the active layer faces the feed solution the pure water flux in the inverted membrane position is found to increase linearly with operating pressure 2 the nacl separation becomes practically zero less than 6 when the membrane is in the inverted position and the membrane in this position is also severely fouled i e low frr 3 the initial ro membrane performance can be recovered when the membrane is inverted back to the normal position with slight decrease in nacl separation the sem images indicate practically no change of top and bottom surfaces but the membrane compaction is noticed in the cross sectional images 4 the increase in water flux observed in ro with the membrane in the inverted orientation does not take place when membrane is run in al facing ds mode in fo and pro declaration of competing interest the authors whose names are listed immediately below certify that
