15870,an improved understanding of bacterial inactivation mechanisms will provide useful insights for infectious disease control and prevention we evaluated bacterial response to several inactivation methods using surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers the results indicate that changes in the sers signal are highly related to cellular disruption and that cellular changes arising after cell inactivation cannot be ignored the membrane integrity of heat and the combination of uv254 and free chlorine uv254 chlorine treated pseudomonas syringae p syringae cells were severely disrupted leading to significantly increased peak intensities conversely ethanol treated bacteria exhibited intact cell morphologies and the sers spectra remained virtually unchanged on the basis of time dependent sers signals we extracted dominant sers patterns peaks related to nucleic acids accounted for the main changes observed during heat uv254 and uv254 chlorine treatment likely due to their outward diffusion from the cell cytoplasm for free chlorine treated p syringae carbohydrates and proteins on the cell membrane were denatured or lost resulting in a decrease in related peak intensities the nucleobases were likely oxidized when treated with uv254 and chlorine thus leading to shifts in the related peaks the generality of the method was verified using two additional bacterial strains escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis as well as in different water matrices the results suggest that sers spectral analysis is a promising means to examine bacterial stress response at the molecular level and has applicability in diverse environmental implementations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface enhanced raman spectroscopy bacteria inactivation multivariate analysis water 1 introduction bacterial infection is one of the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality pathogenic bacteria can interact with adult stem cells and manipulate or disturb cell functions and may lead to dysregulated tissue growth and the development of cancers o rourke and kempf 2019 bacteria can be transmitted through the water supply system and the food chain as such various strategies have been used to control bacterial proliferation for example disinfection e g chlorination uv irradiation ozonation is a critical process for both wastewater and drinking water treatment crittenden et al 2012 and sterilization e g steam autoclave dry heat sterilization is considered an effective pretreatment technique for food preservation li and farid 2016 when exposed to these severe conditions bacterial cells as well as other microorganisms are expected to be inactivated thus leading to a safer and heathier food and water supply knowledge of bacterial response to specific inactivation methods may provide useful insights that could improve the design of current methods or select the best process for a given scenario researchers have proposed comprehensive bacterial inactivation mechanisms including cell membrane disruption dna rna damage ribosome degradation protein denaturation etc michael kordatou et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 it is well recognized that for any specific method all of the proposed inactivation mechanisms have the potential to be involved thus giving rise to synergetic effects zhang et al 2020 consequently to figure out the underlying mechanisms a number of different analytical tools have been employed traditional culture based techniques such as plate counting and optical density measurements are often used to assess bacterial cell viability beal et al 2020 whereas cell integrity can be observed through microscopy based methods at the molecular level quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr or next generation sequencing ngs are used to monitor genome integrity while quantitative protein mass spectrometry is often employed for protein quantification al jassim et al 2017 ding et al 2019 wigginton et al 2012 the combination of these strategies enables broad understanding of bacterial inactivation but requires labor intensive pretreatment work vibrational spectroscopic techniques have been widely used to probe biological tissues balan et al 2019 harrison and berry 2017 zhang et al 2021 spectral alterations in vibrational peaks provide rapid nondestructive information that can be used to investigate bacterial response to stress stimuli at a molecular level for example hlaing et al utilized fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to evaluate bacterial cellular component i e protein lipid dna and fatty acid content changes following drying hlaing et al 2017 raman spectroscopic changes have also been successfully employed to investigate cellular response to diverse types of oxidative stress chemicals and nutrients escoriza et al 2007 li et al 2020 malyshev et al 2021 however the weak signal intensity of these techniques often hinders their application surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers which takes advantage of intrinsic raman information but with a much higher intensity due to the use of plasmonic nanostructures has been recently employed for biological sensing cialla may et al 2017 wang et al 2021a zong et al 2018 amplified cellular vibrational profiles are used for bacterial cell identification and the monitoring of metabolic activity bodelón et al 2017 plou et al 2020 prakash et al 2019 wang et al 2021b moreover by tracking changes in sers output researchers have been able to differentiate live and dead bacteria as well as to evaluate bacterial survival following antibiotic exposure premasiri et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 these studies collectively suggest that sers may be a promising tool to probe bacterial stress responses despite such progress however there has to date been no study examining how sers spectral alterations reveal bacterial inactivation mechanisms previous studies have focused on comparison of initial and final spectral status based on specific peaks from labels cells or metabolites as indicators following external stimuli gao et al 2020 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2015 as a consequence the wide range of biomolecular changes and dynamics that occur during stimulus may remain undiscovered in this study we monitored sers spectral alterations to evaluate molecular level response of bacteria to different inactivation methods we hypothesized that the bacterial structural and biochemical changes caused by different methods can be readily reflected by sers signals in this effort pseudomonas syringae was treated using five inactivation methods following treatment the sers spectra were recorded and we applied multivariate analysis to identify the major patterns in the sers spectra molecular level mechanisms were revealed by aligning the spectral variations to cellular components two additional bacterial strains escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis were treated similarly to verify our hypothesis that different bacteria might exhibit similar sers responses to a given inactivation method the results provide new insight and confirmation of bacterial inactivation mechanisms with shorter time and less labor 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial sample preparation gram negative bacterial stains p syringae pv phaseolicola and e coli k12 and gram positive b subtilis atcc6051 were used as targets throughout the study the detailed cultivation processes are listed in the supporting information the obtained bacterial suspensions were washed with 1 phosphate buffered saline pbs invitrogen three times at 1753 g for 15 min the concentration of the bacterial suspensions was obtained by counting colony forming units cfu and was maintained at 109 cfu ml for further proof of concept analysis to evaluate the effect of the water matrix 109 cfu ml of p syringae was spiked into tap water and wastewater samples which were collected from the virginia tech campus and the influent to a wastewater treatment plant in the hampton roads sanitation district hrsd virginia beach va respectively prior to use tap water was boiled for 15 min to remove residual chlorine 2 2 sers measurement sers spectra were recorded following our previously developed method based on concanavalin a modified bacterial cellulose nanocrystal bcnc decorated with aunps this method has the capacity to collect bacterial fingerprint spectra with a limit of detection of approximately 1 5 103 cfu ml rahman et al 2022 briefly 100 μl of pbs washed bacterial suspension was mixed with 500 μl of concanavalin a functionalized bcnc and agitated for 1 h concanavalin a is a legume sourced lectin that has high affinity to carbohydrate constituents on the bacterial surface kearns et al 2017 the bcnc bacteria mixture was centrifuged at 8720 g for 1 min and redispersed in a 200 μl aliquot of aunps the aunps preparation process is listed in the supporting information the negatively charged aunps can be easily immobilized onto the positively charged bcnc substrate rahman et al 2022 after mixing for another 5 min the bcnc bacteria aunp mixture was concentrated in 20 μl of di water a 5 μl aliquot of concentrated bcnc bacteria aunp mixture or treated samples was pipetted onto an aluminum foil coated glass slide and air dried in a fume hood raman spectra were recorded using a witec alpha500r raman spectrometer witec gmbh ulm germany spectral resolution 3 5 cm 1 with a 785 nm laser and a 10 confocal microscope objective the signal was collected using a peltier cooled charge coupled device with a 300 grooves per mm grating for each sample 100 spectra 10 10 x y were acquired across a 50 50 µm2 area with an on sample laser power of 3 mw and an integration time of 1 s for each point a silicon wafer was used for instrumental calibration before measurement 2 3 bacterial inactivation and characterization five inactivation methods including common and emerging disinfection strategies i e heat treatment uv254 treatment ethanol treatment free chlorine treatment and combined uv254 and chlorine treatment were tested the bcnc bacteria aunp mixture was treated to monitor the signal changes arising from the bacterial cells as well as potentially released biomolecules a 20 μl aliquot of the aforementioned concentrated mixture was heated to 100 in a water bath or exposed to uv light with an intensity of 10 mw cm2 for heat and uv254 treatment respectively all the samples were exposed to uv254 for 0 10 20 40 and 60 min which corresponds to uv254 fluences of 0 6 12 24 and 36 j cm2 for ethanol and free chlorine treatments 200 μl of bcnc bacteria aunp mixture was centrifuged and redispersed in 20 μl of 100 ethanol or 10 mm sodium hypochlorite naocl respectively for uv254 chlorine treatment 20 μl of bcnc bacteria aunp in 10 mm naocl was exposed to 10 mw cm2 uv254 light the high uv254 and chlorine doses in the experiment were used to ensure all of the bacterial cells were inactivated all the samples were treated for 1 h 20 μl of bcnc bacteria aunp mixture in di water without any treatment was put in the room temperature for 1 h as a control the relative viability the ratio of bacterial cfu after each treatment to its initial cfu was used to reflect the bacterial inactivation effect scanning electron microscope sem images were collected for visualization of cellular morphology 2 4 sers data analysis prior to multivariate analysis all of the spectral data were pre processed by instrument embedded software project five for cosmic ray removal savitzky golay smoothing and baseline subtraction subsequently the sers data were normalized by a localized intrinsic internal standard the pseudo peak at 77 cm 1 i 77 which reflects the surface enhanced elastic scattering signal to minimize variation arising from the spatial variability of the sers hot spots wei et al 2018 this normalization method has been previously applied for a wide range of applications nam et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the time dependent bacterial sers spectra for each treatment were subjected to principal component analysis pca using matlab 2020b a total of 339 raman wavenumbers from 450 to 1700 cm 1 were chosen as variables two principal components pc1 and pc2 were selected to best capture the characteristics of the raman spectra pc loadings were performed for multiple sets of the time dependent sers spectra data to obtain the dominant variables the statistical significance of these changes in the dominant peak intensities during each treatment was assessed by one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s test to provide enhanced visualization we converted each pc1 loading plot to a sers barcode such barcodes have recently been proposed as a tool to succinctly illustrate the relative intensities of all peaks in collected raman spectra luo et al 2019 wei and vikesland 2015 the positively contributed wavenumbers in pc1 are blue in the barcodes while the negatively contributed wavenumbers in pc1 are in red the color intensity reflects the pc contributions finally hierarchical clustering analysis hca was employed to explore the similarity and discrepancy arising from the different inactivation methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 biochemical origins of p syringae sers spectra we first examined the sers spectra of freshly prepared p syringae in pbs in our method pre decorated concanavalin a recognizes and binds to carbohydrate constituents e g glucosyl groups expressed on the bacterial surface kearns et al 2017 rahman et al 2022 thus enhancing the attachment of the bacteria to bcnc substrate subsequently added aunps aggregate on the bacterial surface upon droplet evaporation fig 1 a compared with bare bacterial cells the mixture of bcnc bacteria is expected to enhance aunp aggregation and generate dense sers hot spots fig s1a after forming the bcnc bacteria aunp structure we observed several distinct peaks in the region between 450 to 1700 cm 1 in the sers spectra of p syringae fig 1b well resolved and intense sers peaks at 488 650 733 997 1023 1240 1312 1467 and 1568 cm 1 were observed and correspond well with the prior literature cui et al 2019 ho et al 2019 prakash et al 2019 premasiri et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 the peaks of bcnc bacteria aunp appear at the same positions as those for bacteria aunps but with much higher intensities fig s1b this result indicates that bcnc improves the bacterial sers intensity without causing any changes in the measured spectral features the coefficient of variation of the normalized intensity at 733 cm 1 is 14 9 for an area scan a value comparable to those of other bacterial detection methods ciloglu et al 2020 liu et al 2017 thus indicating the uniformity of the acquired sers signals fig s1c the peaks at 650 ring breathing of guanine cui et al 2019 733 ring breathing of adenine cui et al 2019 1312 guanine talari et al 2015 and 1568 cm 1 adenine or guanine kamińska et al 2016 are contributed by nucleobases the peaks at 997 and 1023 cm 1 are assigned to the symmetric ring breathing mode and in plane c h bending mode of phenylalanine respectively fan et al 2011 the peak at 1240 cm 1 is assigned to amide iii cui et al 2019 these latter peaks collectively originate from protein components the peaks at 488 and 1467 cm 1 result from polysaccharides and saturated lipids respectively dina et al 2017 talari et al 2015 some minor peaks are also observed in the spectra the detailed assignments and potential biochemical origins of all the peaks are summarized in table s1 alternative assignments have been proposed for some peaks in previous reports for instance some researchers have suggested that the peak at 730 cm 1 is contributed by the vibrational glycosidic ring mode of n acetylglucosamine and the peak at 650 cm 1 should be assigned to phenylalanine bending of coo prakash et al 2019 such differences can be attributed to variations in the binding affinity of the molecules to different sers substrates and the fact that similar functional groups are present in different bacterial constituents in the absence of p syringae the bcnc aunp substrate exhibits several minor sers peaks some of the peak positions 488 997 and 1568 cm 1 are consistent with peaks also present in the p syringae sers spectra bcnc is a bacterial by product that contains abundant polysaccharides proteins and carbohydrates singhsa et al 2017 these original ingredients result in the appearance of such sers peaks fortunately however because the peak intensities of bcnc are much weaker than those arising from the bacteria bcnc can still be considered an excellent sers substrate for bacterial detection 3 2 sers spectral alterations during inactivation instead of inactivating bacteria prior to loading the sers substrate we treated the combined bacteria and substrate bcnc bacteria aunp so that we could monitor signal changes arising from the bacterial cells as well as those from molecules produced or released as a result of treatment the first panel in fig 2 a shows the sers spectra of bcnc p syringae aunp in di water without any additional treatment the sers spectra are virtually unchanged throughout the experiment thus indicating that the experimental conditions are sufficiently favorable for p syringae to maintain viability fig 2b these results indicate that neither bcnc nor the aunps adversely influence the p syringae cells during the measurements significant spectral changes arose after treatment by each inactivation method except for ethanol treatment fig 2 we observed that p syringae manifested notable increases in most peak regions after heat treatment especially the peaks at 658 733 960 1342 and 1455 cm 1 the peak intensities at 733 and 960 cm 1 moderately increased with uv254 radiation conversely the peak intensity at 1023 cm 1 decreased following uv254 treatment however after being treated with ethanol the sers spectra remained unchanged like that of the control sample for free chlorine treatment the most distinct changes were observed at 488 and 674 cm 1 the peak at 674 cm 1 gradually increased with time while the peak at 488 cm 1 disappeared at 10 min unlike uv254 alone and free chlorine alone the sers signals of p syringae when confronted with uv254 chlorine changed considerably the peaks at 680 and 733 cm 1 greatly increased with more subtle changes occurring at 960 and 1023 cm 1 despite such large spectral differences across the different inactivation methods viability measurements for p syringae suggest that 99 of the bacterial cells were inactivated within 10 min by all methods fig 2b these results indicate that the measured changes in the p syringae sers spectra reflect not only the inactivation process but also the cellular changes after inactivation such mechanisms require further interpretation to ensure that the changes reflected in fig 2a primarily arise from p syringae we examined how the substrate bcnc aunps alone was affected by each process for comparison as shown in fig s2a a strong peak develops at 548 cm 1 when the substrate was treated with free chlorine previous studies have shown that both molecular chlorine cl2 and hypochlorous acid hocl have raman responses in the region of 530 560 cm 1 aggarwal et al 2016 cherney et al 2006 and thus this peak reflects the presence of excess chlorinating agent in the system we further observed this peak in our samples containing bacteria when we increased the free chlorine concentration to 50 mm fig s2b in addition several minor peaks appear for bcnc after heat treatment with coincident peak positions 658 733 and 960 cm 1 to those of the bacteria samples but with lower intensities fig s2c collectively these results indicate that sers spectral changes arising from the substrate are minor when compared with those for the p syringae samples 3 3 sers spectral based bacterial cell responses following our demonstration that the sers signals of p syringae can be altered during inactivation we next evaluated biochemical changes based on the sers spectral alterations as mentioned previously the sers spectra of ethanol treated bacteria remained virtually unchanged sem images show that the morphology of ethanol treated p syringae remained the same as the control sample fig s3 we also collected sers signals of p syringae after treatment with different concentrations of ethanol and the results in fig s4 show that all of the spectra remain virtually unchanged regardless of inactivation efficiency prior studies have established that the permeability of the cell envelope increases in the presence of ethanol due to a reduction in peptidoglycan cross linking and the decreased lipid to protein ratio of the membrane dombek and ingram 1984 haft et al 2014 our sers based approach could not detect such changes therefore we excluded ethanol treated bacteria in the following spectral analysis we applied pca to identify key spectral features within the spectral range of 450 to 1700 cm 1 following heat uv254 free chlorine and uv254 chlorine treatments pca is a linear unsupervised visualization technique used for analyzing and reducing the dimensionality of numerical data sets in a multivariate problem li et al 2018 pc loadings can be used to identify the contributions of each variable that is the contribution of each wavenumber johnson et al 2014 shin et al 2018 fig 3 presents the pc score plots of bacterial sers spectra when exposed to different methods as a function of time it is clearly shown that the heat uv254 and uv254 chlorine processes cause the sers spectra to be shifted to the right on the pc1 axis a notable separation can also be seen between non treated and treated bacteria for free chlorine treatment based solely on the pc1 score accordingly we evaluated the dominant features contributing to the pc1 loading data fig 4 to provide enhanced visualization we converted each loading plot to a barcode luo et al 2019 wei and vikesland 2015 the ten most contributing peaks were extracted from each loading plot and are listed in table 1 the loading data of pc1 reveal the spectral variation contributed by the cellular components 3 3 1 heat treatment previous studies have shown that nearly all bacterial cellular components are affected when exposed to high temperatures cebrián et al 2017 russell 2003 the structures of the outer membrane the peptidoglycan wall and the cytoplasmic membrane are damaged resulting in the release of lipopolysaccharides the denaturation of proteins and the loss of intra cytoplasmic materials russell 2003 ribosomes and dna rna can also be damaged during heat inactivation fig 4 and table 1 reveal that each of the 10 extracted featured peaks for heat treatment positively contribute thus implying that the intensities of all of the peaks increased with time fig s5 we observed a similar increase but with a lower peak intensity when treated at a lower temperature 80 fig s6 more importantly peaks arising from nucleic acids i e 658 733 960 1319 1342 and 1455 cm 1 significantly contribute to pc1 followed by peaks associated with proteins i e 619 1226 1265 and 1392 cm 1 sem images fig s3 indicate that the membrane integrity of the p syringae cells was severely disrupted thus leading to completely lysed or seriously damaged cells the increase in the intensity of all of the featured peaks possibly resulted from the release of intra cytoplasmic nucleic acids and proteins following disruption of the highly ordered membrane structure the increased contribution of nucleic acid related peaks following heat exposure can be attributed to the fact that purine molecules are more sers responsive than other components proteins carbohydrates or peptidoglycan constituents premasiri et al 2016 however more advanced techniques are needed to further diagnose the metabolic source of such purine molecules while we successfully observed a distinctive increase in the featured peaks some other researchers have reported different sers raman spectral changes for heat treated bacteria alula et al 2017 escoriza et al 2007 wang et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 for example wang et al observed a considerable sers signal decrease in the main spectral peaks of autoclaved staphylococcus aureus and e coli due to the release of carbohydrates wang et al 2010 similarly escoriza et al saw a decrease in normal raman intensity for peaks around 1600 cm 1 and in the region of 700 to 800 cm 1 for heat treated staphylococcus epidermidis and e coli escoriza et al 2007 they also observed the appearance of a new band at 1560 cm 1 following heat treatment conversely zhou et al found that almost no sers signals were detected for heat killed e coli cells zhou et al 2015 alula et al reported that there was a blue shift in the primary peaks of heat killed mycobacterium tuberculosis alula et al 2017 we hypothesize that such differences in the spectra can be attributed to the discrepancy of methods in the aforementioned studies bacteria were usually killed in advance and then introduced to sers substrates however in our method bacteria were mixed with the substrate prior to treatment as such we have the capacity to monitor signal changes arising not only from the bacterial cells but also from biomolecules produced or released as a result of treatment 3 3 2 uv254 treatment it has been reported that uv light inactivates microorganisms mainly by damaging their dna through the dimerization of thymine bases witkowska et al 2019 accordingly sers raman spectral features of nucleobases or bacteria at the region of 1300 1700 cm 1 decrease li et al 2019 nagpal et al 2021 witkowska et al 2019 as shown in fig s7 the peak at 1375 cm 1 vibrational bands of purines slightly declines which is consistent with the trend for uv irradiated bacteria as reported nagpal et al 2021 however 1375 cm 1 was not the dominant feature altered by uv radiation herein instead by tracking the 10 most contributed peaks of pc1 we found that nucleic acid related peaks i e 678 730 960 and 1229 cm 1 positively contributed while negatively contributed peaks i e 481 823 866 919 1023 cm 1 reflect proteins and carbohydrates the sem images in fig s3 show that the integrity of p syringae cells were slightly damaged following uv254 treatment leading to holes in the cell membrane proteins and carbohydrates on the cell membrane are expected to be denatured or lost kristo et al 2012 resulting in a decrease in sers intensity the protein and carbohydrate peaks declined sharply within the first 20 min and later flattened fig s8 further illustrating that the loss of such substances occurs most likely at the cell surface the steady increase in nucleic acid based peaks is likely due to the outward diffusion of intracellular nucleic acids through the disrupted cell membrane compared with heat treated bacteria uv254 treated bacteria had smaller increases in such peak intensities because of the slighter cell membrane damage the lower the uv irradiation power intensities the slighter the increase in sers peak observed fig s9 another obvious difference displayed in the barcodes is that the featured peak at 658 cm 1 for heat treatment shifted to 678 cm 1 for uv254 treatment this shift can be attributed to the oxidation of guanine to its derivative 8 oxoguanine in the presence of oxidative radicals ibañez et al 2015 3 3 3 free chlorine treatment in contrast to heat and uv254 treatment the most featured peak for free chlorine treatment is negatively contributed and appears at 488 cm 1 and reflects carbohydrates other carbohydrate protein related peaks 835 1215 1240 and 1364 cm 1 also declined following reaction these results are coincident with the fact that proteins lipids and polysaccharides on the cell wall play significant roles in the interaction with chlorine disinfectants malyshev et al 2021 xue et al 2013 fig s3 suggests that the bacterial cell membrane after free chlorine treatment was mildly affected possibly leading to the outward diffusion of nucleic acids and a slight increase in the intensity of the purine related peaks e g 674 and 741 cm 1 however such peaks exhibit a shift compared with their original position 658 and 733 cm 1 previous studies have reported that the c8 position of purine molecules can be substituted by chlorine or other halogens and results in vibrational frequency shifts chen et al 2016 xiang et al 2019 the shift in our work probably arises from the substitution of a chlorine atom another interesting trend for free chlorine treatment is that the pc1 score increased from 0 to 10 min and was then remained virtually unchanged the high reactivity of free chlorine and the high concentration used in our system collectively contribute to the rapid reaction kinetics for the dominant peak 488 cm 1 fig 2 and s10 we can also see from fig s10 that the protein related peaks initially decreased with time that was followed by an increased period which are possibly resulted from the initially loss of proteins on the cell membrane and the following outward diffusion of the intracellular substances respectively 3 3 4 uv254 chlorine treatment uv254 chlorine can generate hydroxyl radical oh and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 thus rendering it an efficient advanced oxidation process guo et al 2022 wang et al 2020 compared with uv254 radiation or chlorination alone uv254 chlorine treated p syringae exhibits an apparent increase in the sers signal fig 2 thus indicating that uv254 chlorine exhibits differential inactivation performance relative to uv254 or free chlorine alone table 1 and fig s11 show that apart from 1023 cm 1 all of the other featured peaks positively contribute to pc1 with 678 and 730 cm 1 being the prominent features uv254 chlorine treated p syringae cells exhibit a roughened morphologic appearance due to the high oxidative damage of rcs compared to cells exposed to uv254 alone or chlorine alone fig s3 during uv254 chlorine inactivation ho is nonselective and will be rapidly consumed while rcs selectively reacts with compounds containing electron donating groups such as amino acids pyrimidines and purines guo et al 2022 the disruption of the cell membrane possibly leads to the release of intra cytoplasmic molecules that interact with the aunps and results in the increase in the intensities of most peaks compared with other treatments the peak of 678 cm 1 contributes more as described previously the shift of this peak 658 to 678 cm 1 arises from the oxidation of guanine guanine has a lower oxidation potential when compared with adenine ibañez et al 2015 leading to greater increase in sers intensity under a high oxidative condition all these inactivation mechanisms give rise to a unique sers barcode for uv254 chlorine that can be easily differentiated from the other treatments 3 4 application of sers spectral analysis to the inactivation of other bacterial species in addition to p syringae we also investigated the sers spectral variations of two other bacterial species e coli and b subtilis the sers spectra and pc plots of e coli when confronted with four inactivation methods as a function of time are illustrated in figs s12 and s13 respectively e coli displayed remarkable increases for most of the peaks in the regions of 450 to 1700 cm 1 following heat and uv254 chlorine treatment in contrast the spectral intensity changes were less obvious for cells treated with the other two methods the results are very similar to that of p syringae figs s14 and s15 show the results for b subtilis compared with p syringae and e coli b subtilis exhibited a slightly different spectral change following free chlorine treatment especially in the region between 1200 and 1400 cm 1 where proteins carbohydrates and nucleic acids have distinctive peaks the differences are readily visualized in the pc1 loading barcodes in fig 5 a and suggest a different inactivation mechanism as a gram positive bacterium b subtilis lacks an outer membrane but has a thicker peptidoglycan layer silhavy et al 2010 in the presence of free chlorine the highly crosslinked peptidoglycan cortex can be degraded to less crosslinked subunits young and setlow 2003 the main subunits i e sugars and amino acids are more accessible to the sers substrate and result in higher sers intensity the continuous degradation of thick peptidoglycan of gram positive b subtilis also led to a steady increase in the pc1 score within 60 min fig s15 hca was performed based on the pc1 loadings of all the three bacteria to further explore the similarities of the inactivation mechanisms as demonstrated in fig 5b the discriminatory sers peaks are able to accurately cluster samples according to their respective treatment groups except for free chlorine treated b subtilis in accordance with the hca dendrogram we can see that heat treatment and uv254 treatment are close to each other reflecting similar inactivation mechanisms the hca dendrogram also shows uv254 chlorine treatment shows greater similarity to uv254 treatment than free chlorine treatment the results collectively indicate that sers spectral analysis is highly effective and feasible for revealing bacterial inactivation mechanisms at the biomolecular level 3 5 effect of different water matrices on sers intensity the utility of using sers spectral variations to monitor bacterial inactivation was tested in tap water and wastewater matrices and then compared to that in pbs the parameters for each water sample are listed in table s2 although wastewater contained bacterial cells 103 cfu ml the concentration was much lower than that of the spiked p syringae 109 cfu ml and would cause negligible effect on our results fig 6 shows the temporal variation of the normalized sers intensity of the most contributed featured peaks for each inactivation method i e i73 3 i77 for heat treatment i73 0 i77 for uv254 treatment i488 i77 for free chlorine treatment and i678 i77 for uv254 chlorine treatment in the different water matrices we can see from the results that the sers intensity alterations of p syringae in both tap water and wastewater are similar to that in pbs to have a better understanding of the reaction kinetics a first order model was applied to fit the data the equation is described as i t i e a e k t it and ie are normalized intensity at time t and equilibrium k is the sers intensity change rate constant a is the parameter which reflects the discrepancy between final and initial intensities a is positive when the sers intensity increases with time i e heat uv254 and uv254 chlorine treatment in our case and negative for i488 i77 for free chlorine treatment the fitting parameters are listed in table s3 as revealed in fig 6 and table s3 the free chlorine treatment has the highest sers intensity change rate constant k 0 256 0 727 min 1 for all scenarios which is consistent with our previous interpretation that the reaction for chlorine treatment mainly occurred on the cell membrane the high reactivity of chlorine and the high concentration used in our system contribute to the rapid reaction kinetics it is worth noting that the rate constant k determined herein reflects the intensity changes in the bacterial cellular signals and not the loss of bacterial viability for example heat treatment induces a more rapid decline in bacterial viability loss than free chlorine fig 2b but has a smaller rate constant for the change in sers intensity these results indicate that sers signals arising from bacterial cellular components can still change even after cellular inactivation by heat treatment besides ktw and kww are compatible to kpbs for heat and uv254 chlorine treatments ktw and kww declined for uv254 treatment and free chlorine treatment as discussed previously uv254 treatment and free chlorine treatment could cause less damage to bacterial cells than heat and uv254 chlorine treatments which may be more greatly affected by the organic constituents and alkalinity of such waters 4 conclusions the present study applied sers to reveal bacterial cellular composition and its alterations during inactivation with the help of multivariate analysis we are able to identify the dominant spectral features arising from the biomarkers for each treatment the results indicate that sers spectral changes are highly related to cellular disruption and consequently the released nucleic acids dominate the spectral alterations observed for most of the treatments the loss of carbohydrates and proteins from the cell membrane the release of intracytoplasmic protein related constituents and even the oxidation of some biomolecules could be clearly detected within the time dependent sers results and are well reflected in the barcodes the sers barcodes and hca results suggest sers responses of different bacterial strains are in accordance with inactivation methods when applied to real water matrices we observe similar

15870,an improved understanding of bacterial inactivation mechanisms will provide useful insights for infectious disease control and prevention we evaluated bacterial response to several inactivation methods using surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers the results indicate that changes in the sers signal are highly related to cellular disruption and that cellular changes arising after cell inactivation cannot be ignored the membrane integrity of heat and the combination of uv254 and free chlorine uv254 chlorine treated pseudomonas syringae p syringae cells were severely disrupted leading to significantly increased peak intensities conversely ethanol treated bacteria exhibited intact cell morphologies and the sers spectra remained virtually unchanged on the basis of time dependent sers signals we extracted dominant sers patterns peaks related to nucleic acids accounted for the main changes observed during heat uv254 and uv254 chlorine treatment likely due to their outward diffusion from the cell cytoplasm for free chlorine treated p syringae carbohydrates and proteins on the cell membrane were denatured or lost resulting in a decrease in related peak intensities the nucleobases were likely oxidized when treated with uv254 and chlorine thus leading to shifts in the related peaks the generality of the method was verified using two additional bacterial strains escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis as well as in different water matrices the results suggest that sers spectral analysis is a promising means to examine bacterial stress response at the molecular level and has applicability in diverse environmental implementations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface enhanced raman spectroscopy bacteria inactivation multivariate analysis water 1 introduction bacterial infection is one of the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality pathogenic bacteria can interact with adult stem cells and manipulate or disturb cell functions and may lead to dysregulated tissue growth and the development of cancers o rourke and kempf 2019 bacteria can be transmitted through the water supply system and the food chain as such various strategies have been used to control bacterial proliferation for example disinfection e g chlorination uv irradiation ozonation is a critical process for both wastewater and drinking water treatment crittenden et al 2012 and sterilization e g steam autoclave dry heat sterilization is considered an effective pretreatment technique for food preservation li and farid 2016 when exposed to these severe conditions bacterial cells as well as other microorganisms are expected to be inactivated thus leading to a safer and heathier food and water supply knowledge of bacterial response to specific inactivation methods may provide useful insights that could improve the design of current methods or select the best process for a given scenario researchers have proposed comprehensive bacterial inactivation mechanisms including cell membrane disruption dna rna damage ribosome degradation protein denaturation etc michael kordatou et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 it is well recognized that for any specific method all of the proposed inactivation mechanisms have the potential to be involved thus giving rise to synergetic effects zhang et al 2020 consequently to figure out the underlying mechanisms a number of different analytical tools have been employed traditional culture based techniques such as plate counting and optical density measurements are often used to assess bacterial cell viability beal et al 2020 whereas cell integrity can be observed through microscopy based methods at the molecular level quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr or next generation sequencing ngs are used to monitor genome integrity while quantitative protein mass spectrometry is often employed for protein quantification al jassim et al 2017 ding et al 2019 wigginton et al 2012 the combination of these strategies enables broad understanding of bacterial inactivation but requires labor intensive pretreatment work vibrational spectroscopic techniques have been widely used to probe biological tissues balan et al 2019 harrison and berry 2017 zhang et al 2021 spectral alterations in vibrational peaks provide rapid nondestructive information that can be used to investigate bacterial response to stress stimuli at a molecular level for example hlaing et al utilized fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to evaluate bacterial cellular component i e protein lipid dna and fatty acid content changes following drying hlaing et al 2017 raman spectroscopic changes have also been successfully employed to investigate cellular response to diverse types of oxidative stress chemicals and nutrients escoriza et al 2007 li et al 2020 malyshev et al 2021 however the weak signal intensity of these techniques often hinders their application surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers which takes advantage of intrinsic raman information but with a much higher intensity due to the use of plasmonic nanostructures has been recently employed for biological sensing cialla may et al 2017 wang et al 2021a zong et al 2018 amplified cellular vibrational profiles are used for bacterial cell identification and the monitoring of metabolic activity bodelón et al 2017 plou et al 2020 prakash et al 2019 wang et al 2021b moreover by tracking changes in sers output researchers have been able to differentiate live and dead bacteria as well as to evaluate bacterial survival following antibiotic exposure premasiri et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 these studies collectively suggest that sers may be a promising tool to probe bacterial stress responses despite such progress however there has to date been no study examining how sers spectral alterations reveal bacterial inactivation mechanisms previous studies have focused on comparison of initial and final spectral status based on specific peaks from labels cells or metabolites as indicators following external stimuli gao et al 2020 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2015 as a consequence the wide range of biomolecular changes and dynamics that occur during stimulus may remain undiscovered in this study we monitored sers spectral alterations to evaluate molecular level response of bacteria to different inactivation methods we hypothesized that the bacterial structural and biochemical changes caused by different methods can be readily reflected by sers signals in this effort pseudomonas syringae was treated using five inactivation methods following treatment the sers spectra were recorded and we applied multivariate analysis to identify the major patterns in the sers spectra molecular level mechanisms were revealed by aligning the spectral variations to cellular components two additional bacterial strains escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis were treated similarly to verify our hypothesis that different bacteria might exhibit similar sers responses to a given inactivation method the results provide new insight and confirmation of bacterial inactivation mechanisms with shorter time and less labor 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial sample preparation gram negative bacterial stains p syringae pv phaseolicola and e coli k12 and gram positive b subtilis atcc6051 were used as targets throughout the study the detailed cultivation processes are listed in the supporting information the obtained bacterial suspensions were washed with 1 phosphate buffered saline pbs invitrogen three times at 1753 g for 15 min the concentration of the bacterial suspensions was obtained by counting colony forming units cfu and was maintained at 109 cfu ml for further proof of concept analysis to evaluate the effect of the water matrix 109 cfu ml of p syringae was spiked into tap water and wastewater samples which were collected from the virginia tech campus and the influent to a wastewater treatment plant in the hampton roads sanitation district hrsd virginia beach va respectively prior to use tap water was boiled for 15 min to remove residual chlorine 2 2 sers measurement sers spectra were recorded following our previously developed method based on concanavalin a modified bacterial cellulose nanocrystal bcnc decorated with aunps this method has the capacity to collect bacterial fingerprint spectra with a limit of detection of approximately 1 5 103 cfu ml rahman et al 2022 briefly 100 μl of pbs washed bacterial suspension was mixed with 500 μl of concanavalin a functionalized bcnc and agitated for 1 h concanavalin a is a legume sourced lectin that has high affinity to carbohydrate constituents on the bacterial surface kearns et al 2017 the bcnc bacteria mixture was centrifuged at 8720 g for 1 min and redispersed in a 200 μl aliquot of aunps the aunps preparation process is listed in the supporting information the negatively charged aunps can be easily immobilized onto the positively charged bcnc substrate rahman et al 2022 after mixing for another 5 min the bcnc bacteria aunp mixture was concentrated in 20 μl of di water a 5 μl aliquot of concentrated bcnc bacteria aunp mixture or treated samples was pipetted onto an aluminum foil coated glass slide and air dried in a fume hood raman spectra were recorded using a witec alpha500r raman spectrometer witec gmbh ulm germany spectral resolution 3 5 cm 1 with a 785 nm laser and a 10 confocal microscope objective the signal was collected using a peltier cooled charge coupled device with a 300 grooves per mm grating for each sample 100 spectra 10 10 x y were acquired across a 50 50 µm2 area with an on sample laser power of 3 mw and an integration time of 1 s for each point a silicon wafer was used for instrumental calibration before measurement 2 3 bacterial inactivation and characterization five inactivation methods including common and emerging disinfection strategies i e heat treatment uv254 treatment ethanol treatment free chlorine treatment and combined uv254 and chlorine treatment were tested the bcnc bacteria aunp mixture was treated to monitor the signal changes arising from the bacterial cells as well as potentially released biomolecules a 20 μl aliquot of the aforementioned concentrated mixture was heated to 100 in a water bath or exposed to uv light with an intensity of 10 mw cm2 for heat and uv254 treatment respectively all the samples were exposed to uv254 for 0 10 20 40 and 60 min which corresponds to uv254 fluences of 0 6 12 24 and 36 j cm2 for ethanol and free chlorine treatments 200 μl of bcnc bacteria aunp mixture was centrifuged and redispersed in 20 μl of 100 ethanol or 10 mm sodium hypochlorite naocl respectively for uv254 chlorine treatment 20 μl of bcnc bacteria aunp in 10 mm naocl was exposed to 10 mw cm2 uv254 light the high uv254 and chlorine doses in the experiment were used to ensure all of the bacterial cells were inactivated all the samples were treated for 1 h 20 μl of bcnc bacteria aunp mixture in di water without any treatment was put in the room temperature for 1 h as a control the relative viability the ratio of bacterial cfu after each treatment to its initial cfu was used to reflect the bacterial inactivation effect scanning electron microscope sem images were collected for visualization of cellular morphology 2 4 sers data analysis prior to multivariate analysis all of the spectral data were pre processed by instrument embedded software project five for cosmic ray removal savitzky golay smoothing and baseline subtraction subsequently the sers data were normalized by a localized intrinsic internal standard the pseudo peak at 77 cm 1 i 77 which reflects the surface enhanced elastic scattering signal to minimize variation arising from the spatial variability of the sers hot spots wei et al 2018 this normalization method has been previously applied for a wide range of applications nam et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the time dependent bacterial sers spectra for each treatment were subjected to principal component analysis pca using matlab 2020b a total of 339 raman wavenumbers from 450 to 1700 cm 1 were chosen as variables two principal components pc1 and pc2 were selected to best capture the characteristics of the raman spectra pc loadings were performed for multiple sets of the time dependent sers spectra data to obtain the dominant variables the statistical significance of these changes in the dominant peak intensities during each treatment was assessed by one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s test to provide enhanced visualization we converted each pc1 loading plot to a sers barcode such barcodes have recently been proposed as a tool to succinctly illustrate the relative intensities of all peaks in collected raman spectra luo et al 2019 wei and vikesland 2015 the positively contributed wavenumbers in pc1 are blue in the barcodes while the negatively contributed wavenumbers in pc1 are in red the color intensity reflects the pc contributions finally hierarchical clustering analysis hca was employed to explore the similarity and discrepancy arising from the different inactivation methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 biochemical origins of p syringae sers spectra we first examined the sers spectra of freshly prepared p syringae in pbs in our method pre decorated concanavalin a recognizes and binds to carbohydrate constituents e g glucosyl groups expressed on the bacterial surface kearns et al 2017 rahman et al 2022 thus enhancing the attachment of the bacteria to bcnc substrate subsequently added aunps aggregate on the bacterial surface upon droplet evaporation fig 1 a compared with bare bacterial cells the mixture of bcnc bacteria is expected to enhance aunp aggregation and generate dense sers hot spots fig s1a after forming the bcnc bacteria aunp structure we observed several distinct peaks in the region between 450 to 1700 cm 1 in the sers spectra of p syringae fig 1b well resolved and intense sers peaks at 488 650 733 997 1023 1240 1312 1467 and 1568 cm 1 were observed and correspond well with the prior literature cui et al 2019 ho et al 2019 prakash et al 2019 premasiri et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 the peaks of bcnc bacteria aunp appear at the same positions as those for bacteria aunps but with much higher intensities fig s1b this result indicates that bcnc improves the bacterial sers intensity without causing any changes in the measured spectral features the coefficient of variation of the normalized intensity at 733 cm 1 is 14 9 for an area scan a value comparable to those of other bacterial detection methods ciloglu et al 2020 liu et al 2017 thus indicating the uniformity of the acquired sers signals fig s1c the peaks at 650 ring breathing of guanine cui et al 2019 733 ring breathing of adenine cui et al 2019 1312 guanine talari et al 2015 and 1568 cm 1 adenine or guanine kamińska et al 2016 are contributed by nucleobases the peaks at 997 and 1023 cm 1 are assigned to the symmetric ring breathing mode and in plane c h bending mode of phenylalanine respectively fan et al 2011 the peak at 1240 cm 1 is assigned to amide iii cui et al 2019 these latter peaks collectively originate from protein components the peaks at 488 and 1467 cm 1 result from polysaccharides and saturated lipids respectively dina et al 2017 talari et al 2015 some minor peaks are also observed in the spectra the detailed assignments and potential biochemical origins of all the peaks are summarized in table s1 alternative assignments have been proposed for some peaks in previous reports for instance some researchers have suggested that the peak at 730 cm 1 is contributed by the vibrational glycosidic ring mode of n acetylglucosamine and the peak at 650 cm 1 should be assigned to phenylalanine bending of coo prakash et al 2019 such differences can be attributed to variations in the binding affinity of the molecules to different sers substrates and the fact that similar functional groups are present in different bacterial constituents in the absence of p syringae the bcnc aunp substrate exhibits several minor sers peaks some of the peak positions 488 997 and 1568 cm 1 are consistent with peaks also present in the p syringae sers spectra bcnc is a bacterial by product that contains abundant polysaccharides proteins and carbohydrates singhsa et al 2017 these original ingredients result in the appearance of such sers peaks fortunately however because the peak intensities of bcnc are much weaker than those arising from the bacteria bcnc can still be considered an excellent sers substrate for bacterial detection 3 2 sers spectral alterations during inactivation instead of inactivating bacteria prior to loading the sers substrate we treated the combined bacteria and substrate bcnc bacteria aunp so that we could monitor signal changes arising from the bacterial cells as well as those from molecules produced or released as a result of treatment the first panel in fig 2 a shows the sers spectra of bcnc p syringae aunp in di water without any additional treatment the sers spectra are virtually unchanged throughout the experiment thus indicating that the experimental conditions are sufficiently favorable for p syringae to maintain viability fig 2b these results indicate that neither bcnc nor the aunps adversely influence the p syringae cells during the measurements significant spectral changes arose after treatment by each inactivation method except for ethanol treatment fig 2 we observed that p syringae manifested notable increases in most peak regions after heat treatment especially the peaks at 658 733 960 1342 and 1455 cm 1 the peak intensities at 733 and 960 cm 1 moderately increased with uv254 radiation conversely the peak intensity at 1023 cm 1 decreased following uv254 treatment however after being treated with ethanol the sers spectra remained unchanged like that of the control sample for free chlorine treatment the most distinct changes were observed at 488 and 674 cm 1 the peak at 674 cm 1 gradually increased with time while the peak at 488 cm 1 disappeared at 10 min unlike uv254 alone and free chlorine alone the sers signals of p syringae when confronted with uv254 chlorine changed considerably the peaks at 680 and 733 cm 1 greatly increased with more subtle changes occurring at 960 and 1023 cm 1 despite such large spectral differences across the different inactivation methods viability measurements for p syringae suggest that 99 of the bacterial cells were inactivated within 10 min by all methods fig 2b these results indicate that the measured changes in the p syringae sers spectra reflect not only the inactivation process but also the cellular changes after inactivation such mechanisms require further interpretation to ensure that the changes reflected in fig 2a primarily arise from p syringae we examined how the substrate bcnc aunps alone was affected by each process for comparison as shown in fig s2a a strong peak develops at 548 cm 1 when the substrate was treated with free chlorine previous studies have shown that both molecular chlorine cl2 and hypochlorous acid hocl have raman responses in the region of 530 560 cm 1 aggarwal et al 2016 cherney et al 2006 and thus this peak reflects the presence of excess chlorinating agent in the system we further observed this peak in our samples containing bacteria when we increased the free chlorine concentration to 50 mm fig s2b in addition several minor peaks appear for bcnc after heat treatment with coincident peak positions 658 733 and 960 cm 1 to those of the bacteria samples but with lower intensities fig s2c collectively these results indicate that sers spectral changes arising from the substrate are minor when compared with those for the p syringae samples 3 3 sers spectral based bacterial cell responses following our demonstration that the sers signals of p syringae can be altered during inactivation we next evaluated biochemical changes based on the sers spectral alterations as mentioned previously the sers spectra of ethanol treated bacteria remained virtually unchanged sem images show that the morphology of ethanol treated p syringae remained the same as the control sample fig s3 we also collected sers signals of p syringae after treatment with different concentrations of ethanol and the results in fig s4 show that all of the spectra remain virtually unchanged regardless of inactivation efficiency prior studies have established that the permeability of the cell envelope increases in the presence of ethanol due to a reduction in peptidoglycan cross linking and the decreased lipid to protein ratio of the membrane dombek and ingram 1984 haft et al 2014 our sers based approach could not detect such changes therefore we excluded ethanol treated bacteria in the following spectral analysis we applied pca to identify key spectral features within the spectral range of 450 to 1700 cm 1 following heat uv254 free chlorine and uv254 chlorine treatments pca is a linear unsupervised visualization technique used for analyzing and reducing the dimensionality of numerical data sets in a multivariate problem li et al 2018 pc loadings can be used to identify the contributions of each variable that is the contribution of each wavenumber johnson et al 2014 shin et al 2018 fig 3 presents the pc score plots of bacterial sers spectra when exposed to different methods as a function of time it is clearly shown that the heat uv254 and uv254 chlorine processes cause the sers spectra to be shifted to the right on the pc1 axis a notable separation can also be seen between non treated and treated bacteria for free chlorine treatment based solely on the pc1 score accordingly we evaluated the dominant features contributing to the pc1 loading data fig 4 to provide enhanced visualization we converted each loading plot to a barcode luo et al 2019 wei and vikesland 2015 the ten most contributing peaks were extracted from each loading plot and are listed in table 1 the loading data of pc1 reveal the spectral variation contributed by the cellular components 3 3 1 heat treatment previous studies have shown that nearly all bacterial cellular components are affected when exposed to high temperatures cebrián et al 2017 russell 2003 the structures of the outer membrane the peptidoglycan wall and the cytoplasmic membrane are damaged resulting in the release of lipopolysaccharides the denaturation of proteins and the loss of intra cytoplasmic materials russell 2003 ribosomes and dna rna can also be damaged during heat inactivation fig 4 and table 1 reveal that each of the 10 extracted featured peaks for heat treatment positively contribute thus implying that the intensities of all of the peaks increased with time fig s5 we observed a similar increase but with a lower peak intensity when treated at a lower temperature 80 fig s6 more importantly peaks arising from nucleic acids i e 658 733 960 1319 1342 and 1455 cm 1 significantly contribute to pc1 followed by peaks associated with proteins i e 619 1226 1265 and 1392 cm 1 sem images fig s3 indicate that the membrane integrity of the p syringae cells was severely disrupted thus leading to completely lysed or seriously damaged cells the increase in the intensity of all of the featured peaks possibly resulted from the release of intra cytoplasmic nucleic acids and proteins following disruption of the highly ordered membrane structure the increased contribution of nucleic acid related peaks following heat exposure can be attributed to the fact that purine molecules are more sers responsive than other components proteins carbohydrates or peptidoglycan constituents premasiri et al 2016 however more advanced techniques are needed to further diagnose the metabolic source of such purine molecules while we successfully observed a distinctive increase in the featured peaks some other researchers have reported different sers raman spectral changes for heat treated bacteria alula et al 2017 escoriza et al 2007 wang et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 for example wang et al observed a considerable sers signal decrease in the main spectral peaks of autoclaved staphylococcus aureus and e coli due to the release of carbohydrates wang et al 2010 similarly escoriza et al saw a decrease in normal raman intensity for peaks around 1600 cm 1 and in the region of 700 to 800 cm 1 for heat treated staphylococcus epidermidis and e coli escoriza et al 2007 they also observed the appearance of a new band at 1560 cm 1 following heat treatment conversely zhou et al found that almost no sers signals were detected for heat killed e coli cells zhou et al 2015 alula et al reported that there was a blue shift in the primary peaks of heat killed mycobacterium tuberculosis alula et al 2017 we hypothesize that such differences in the spectra can be attributed to the discrepancy of methods in the aforementioned studies bacteria were usually killed in advance and then introduced to sers substrates however in our method bacteria were mixed with the substrate prior to treatment as such we have the capacity to monitor signal changes arising not only from the bacterial cells but also from biomolecules produced or released as a result of treatment 3 3 2 uv254 treatment it has been reported that uv light inactivates microorganisms mainly by damaging their dna through the dimerization of thymine bases witkowska et al 2019 accordingly sers raman spectral features of nucleobases or bacteria at the region of 1300 1700 cm 1 decrease li et al 2019 nagpal et al 2021 witkowska et al 2019 as shown in fig s7 the peak at 1375 cm 1 vibrational bands of purines slightly declines which is consistent with the trend for uv irradiated bacteria as reported nagpal et al 2021 however 1375 cm 1 was not the dominant feature altered by uv radiation herein instead by tracking the 10 most contributed peaks of pc1 we found that nucleic acid related peaks i e 678 730 960 and 1229 cm 1 positively contributed while negatively contributed peaks i e 481 823 866 919 1023 cm 1 reflect proteins and carbohydrates the sem images in fig s3 show that the integrity of p syringae cells were slightly damaged following uv254 treatment leading to holes in the cell membrane proteins and carbohydrates on the cell membrane are expected to be denatured or lost kristo et al 2012 resulting in a decrease in sers intensity the protein and carbohydrate peaks declined sharply within the first 20 min and later flattened fig s8 further illustrating that the loss of such substances occurs most likely at the cell surface the steady increase in nucleic acid based peaks is likely due to the outward diffusion of intracellular nucleic acids through the disrupted cell membrane compared with heat treated bacteria uv254 treated bacteria had smaller increases in such peak intensities because of the slighter cell membrane damage the lower the uv irradiation power intensities the slighter the increase in sers peak observed fig s9 another obvious difference displayed in the barcodes is that the featured peak at 658 cm 1 for heat treatment shifted to 678 cm 1 for uv254 treatment this shift can be attributed to the oxidation of guanine to its derivative 8 oxoguanine in the presence of oxidative radicals ibañez et al 2015 3 3 3 free chlorine treatment in contrast to heat and uv254 treatment the most featured peak for free chlorine treatment is negatively contributed and appears at 488 cm 1 and reflects carbohydrates other carbohydrate protein related peaks 835 1215 1240 and 1364 cm 1 also declined following reaction these results are coincident with the fact that proteins lipids and polysaccharides on the cell wall play significant roles in the interaction with chlorine disinfectants malyshev et al 2021 xue et al 2013 fig s3 suggests that the bacterial cell membrane after free chlorine treatment was mildly affected possibly leading to the outward diffusion of nucleic acids and a slight increase in the intensity of the purine related peaks e g 674 and 741 cm 1 however such peaks exhibit a shift compared with their original position 658 and 733 cm 1 previous studies have reported that the c8 position of purine molecules can be substituted by chlorine or other halogens and results in vibrational frequency shifts chen et al 2016 xiang et al 2019 the shift in our work probably arises from the substitution of a chlorine atom another interesting trend for free chlorine treatment is that the pc1 score increased from 0 to 10 min and was then remained virtually unchanged the high reactivity of free chlorine and the high concentration used in our system collectively contribute to the rapid reaction kinetics for the dominant peak 488 cm 1 fig 2 and s10 we can also see from fig s10 that the protein related peaks initially decreased with time that was followed by an increased period which are possibly resulted from the initially loss of proteins on the cell membrane and the following outward diffusion of the intracellular substances respectively 3 3 4 uv254 chlorine treatment uv254 chlorine can generate hydroxyl radical oh and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 thus rendering it an efficient advanced oxidation process guo et al 2022 wang et al 2020 compared with uv254 radiation or chlorination alone uv254 chlorine treated p syringae exhibits an apparent increase in the sers signal fig 2 thus indicating that uv254 chlorine exhibits differential inactivation performance relative to uv254 or free chlorine alone table 1 and fig s11 show that apart from 1023 cm 1 all of the other featured peaks positively contribute to pc1 with 678 and 730 cm 1 being the prominent features uv254 chlorine treated p syringae cells exhibit a roughened morphologic appearance due to the high oxidative damage of rcs compared to cells exposed to uv254 alone or chlorine alone fig s3 during uv254 chlorine inactivation ho is nonselective and will be rapidly consumed while rcs selectively reacts with compounds containing electron donating groups such as amino acids pyrimidines and purines guo et al 2022 the disruption of the cell membrane possibly leads to the release of intra cytoplasmic molecules that interact with the aunps and results in the increase in the intensities of most peaks compared with other treatments the peak of 678 cm 1 contributes more as described previously the shift of this peak 658 to 678 cm 1 arises from the oxidation of guanine guanine has a lower oxidation potential when compared with adenine ibañez et al 2015 leading to greater increase in sers intensity under a high oxidative condition all these inactivation mechanisms give rise to a unique sers barcode for uv254 chlorine that can be easily differentiated from the other treatments 3 4 application of sers spectral analysis to the inactivation of other bacterial species in addition to p syringae we also investigated the sers spectral variations of two other bacterial species e coli and b subtilis the sers spectra and pc plots of e coli when confronted with four inactivation methods as a function of time are illustrated in figs s12 and s13 respectively e coli displayed remarkable increases for most of the peaks in the regions of 450 to 1700 cm 1 following heat and uv254 chlorine treatment in contrast the spectral intensity changes were less obvious for cells treated with the other two methods the results are very similar to that of p syringae figs s14 and s15 show the results for b subtilis compared with p syringae and e coli b subtilis exhibited a slightly different spectral change following free chlorine treatment especially in the region between 1200 and 1400 cm 1 where proteins carbohydrates and nucleic acids have distinctive peaks the differences are readily visualized in the pc1 loading barcodes in fig 5 a and suggest a different inactivation mechanism as a gram positive bacterium b subtilis lacks an outer membrane but has a thicker peptidoglycan layer silhavy et al 2010 in the presence of free chlorine the highly crosslinked peptidoglycan cortex can be degraded to less crosslinked subunits young and setlow 2003 the main subunits i e sugars and amino acids are more accessible to the sers substrate and result in higher sers intensity the continuous degradation of thick peptidoglycan of gram positive b subtilis also led to a steady increase in the pc1 score within 60 min fig s15 hca was performed based on the pc1 loadings of all the three bacteria to further explore the similarities of the inactivation mechanisms as demonstrated in fig 5b the discriminatory sers peaks are able to accurately cluster samples according to their respective treatment groups except for free chlorine treated b subtilis in accordance with the hca dendrogram we can see that heat treatment and uv254 treatment are close to each other reflecting similar inactivation mechanisms the hca dendrogram also shows uv254 chlorine treatment shows greater similarity to uv254 treatment than free chlorine treatment the results collectively indicate that sers spectral analysis is highly effective and feasible for revealing bacterial inactivation mechanisms at the biomolecular level 3 5 effect of different water matrices on sers intensity the utility of using sers spectral variations to monitor bacterial inactivation was tested in tap water and wastewater matrices and then compared to that in pbs the parameters for each water sample are listed in table s2 although wastewater contained bacterial cells 103 cfu ml the concentration was much lower than that of the spiked p syringae 109 cfu ml and would cause negligible effect on our results fig 6 shows the temporal variation of the normalized sers intensity of the most contributed featured peaks for each inactivation method i e i73 3 i77 for heat treatment i73 0 i77 for uv254 treatment i488 i77 for free chlorine treatment and i678 i77 for uv254 chlorine treatment in the different water matrices we can see from the results that the sers intensity alterations of p syringae in both tap water and wastewater are similar to that in pbs to have a better understanding of the reaction kinetics a first order model was applied to fit the data the equation is described as i t i e a e k t it and ie are normalized intensity at time t and equilibrium k is the sers intensity change rate constant a is the parameter which reflects the discrepancy between final and initial intensities a is positive when the sers intensity increases with time i e heat uv254 and uv254 chlorine treatment in our case and negative for i488 i77 for free chlorine treatment the fitting parameters are listed in table s3 as revealed in fig 6 and table s3 the free chlorine treatment has the highest sers intensity change rate constant k 0 256 0 727 min 1 for all scenarios which is consistent with our previous interpretation that the reaction for chlorine treatment mainly occurred on the cell membrane the high reactivity of chlorine and the high concentration used in our system contribute to the rapid reaction kinetics it is worth noting that the rate constant k determined herein reflects the intensity changes in the bacterial cellular signals and not the loss of bacterial viability for example heat treatment induces a more rapid decline in bacterial viability loss than free chlorine fig 2b but has a smaller rate constant for the change in sers intensity these results indicate that sers signals arising from bacterial cellular components can still change even after cellular inactivation by heat treatment besides ktw and kww are compatible to kpbs for heat and uv254 chlorine treatments ktw and kww declined for uv254 treatment and free chlorine treatment as discussed previously uv254 treatment and free chlorine treatment could cause less damage to bacterial cells than heat and uv254 chlorine treatments which may be more greatly affected by the organic constituents and alkalinity of such waters 4 conclusions the present study applied sers to reveal bacterial cellular composition and its alterations during inactivation with the help of multivariate analysis we are able to identify the dominant spectral features arising from the biomarkers for each treatment the results indicate that sers spectral changes are highly related to cellular disruption and consequently the released nucleic acids dominate the spectral alterations observed for most of the treatments the loss of carbohydrates and proteins from the cell membrane the release of intracytoplasmic protein related constituents and even the oxidation of some biomolecules could be clearly detected within the time dependent sers results and are well reflected in the barcodes the sers barcodes and hca results suggest sers responses of different bacterial strains are in accordance with inactivation methods when applied to real water matrices we observe similar biochemical changes for the same treatment but different rate constants due to the complexity of real water samples these results collectively suggest that sers spectral analysis is a promising means to reveal bacterial stress responses at the molecular level and offers potential for diverse environmental implementation declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial

15871,inactivation kinetics of enterovirus by disinfection is often studied using a single laboratory strain of a given genotype environmental variants of enterovirus are genetically distinct from the corresponding laboratory strain yet it is poorly understood how these genetic differences affect inactivation here we evaluated the inactivation kinetics of nine coxsackievirus b3 cvb3 ten coxsackievirus b4 cvb4 and two echovirus 11 e11 variants by free chlorine and ultraviolet irradiation uv the inactivation kinetics by free chlorine were genotype i e susceptibility cvb5 cvb3 cvb4 e11 and genogroup dependent and exhibited up to 15 fold difference among the tested viruses in contrast only minor up to 1 3 fold differences were observed in the uv inactivation kinetics the differences in variability between the two disinfectants could be rationalized by their respective inactivation mechanisms inactivation by uv mainly depends on the genomic size and composition which was similar for all viruses tested whereas free chlorine targets the viral capsid protein which exhibited critical differences between genogroups and genotypes finally we integrated the observed variability in inactivation rate constants into an expanded chick watson model to estimate the overall inactivation of an enterovirus consortium the results highlight that the distribution of inactivation rate constants and the abundance of each genotype are essential parameters to accurately predict the overall inactivation of an enterovirus population by free chlorine we conclude that predictions based on inactivation data of a single variant or reference pathogen alone likely overestimate the true disinfection efficiency of free chlorine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords virus disinfection free chlorine ultraviolet irradiation inactivation water treatment 1 introduction enterovirus is a non enveloped positive single stranded ss rna virus with a diameter of approximately 30 nm the genus enterovirus consists of more than 100 genotypes infecting humans and causing a broad spectrum of serious illnesses including meningitis myocarditis and hand foot mouth disease bubba et al 2020 because they are enteric pathogens infected individuals shed them into the sewage system and are frequently detected in wastewater and surface waters haramoto et al 2018 enterovirus is therefore one of the microbial contaminants in draft contaminant candidate list 5 published by the u s environmental protection agency usepa their abundance and reduction inactivation in water systems has been investigated and analyzed boehm et al 2019 morrison et al 2022 pecson et al 2022 and often adopted as a reference pathogen in quantitative microbial risk assessment lodder et al 2015 poma et al 2019 schijven et al 2011 water and wastewater treatment are generally expected to reduce infectious virus concentrations to a large extent e g 4 log reduction of viruses for surface water treatment usepa 1989 the conventional physical unit processes such as coagulation sedimentation membrane filtration and sand filtration have a limited capacity to remove viruses asami et al 2016 canh et al 2019 kato

disinfectants were investigated by using laboratory strains black et al 2009 cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2020 sobsey et al 1988 wati et al 2018 while environmental variants have only rarely been tested e g payment et al 1985 rodríguez et al 2022 as a ssrna virus enterovirus has a high mutation rate sanjuan et al 2010 suggesting that the amino acid composition of the viral capsid can be diverse even within the same genotype in light of this our studies investigated environmental variants of one of the genotypes of enterovirus coxsackievirus b5 cvb5 for their inactivation kinetics and observed up to 5 fold variability in free chlorine and up to 1 3 fold variability in uv susceptibility among cvb5 variants meister et al 2018 torii et al 2021 wolf et al 2018 to estimate the disinfection efficiency of water and wastewater treatment processes not only kinetic data for laboratory strains but also for environmental variants should be considered we previously proposed an expanded chick watson model that accounts for kinetic variability among variants to estimate the overall inactivation of a heterogeneous virus consortium we found that required disinfectant dose to achieve 6 log inactivation of heterogeneous consortium of cvb5 variants was up to 4 2 fold in free chlorine and up to 1 2 fold larger in uv than that of laboratory strain torii et al 2021 however the model was applied only to a single genotype although cvb5 is reported to be one of the most prevalent genotypes in wastewater bisseux et al 2020 larivé et al 2021 other genotypes can be dominant depending on the epidemiological situation in the catchment for example cvb3 was most frequently isolated in italian wastewater surveillance pennino et al 2018 coxsackievirus b4 cvb4 and echovirus 11 e11 were reported as the second and third most prevalent genotypes in wastewater respectively larivé et al 2021 therefore inactivation kinetics of such genotypes are essential to predict the overall inactivation of enterovirus by disinfection processes the goal of this work was to evaluate the susceptibility of different variants of cvb3 cvb4 and e11 to common water disinfectants specifically we measured the inactivation kinetics of nine cvb3 ten cvb4 and two e11 variants during inactivation by free chlorine and uv and we identified genetic features that may contribute to altered disinfection susceptibilities finally we modeled the inactivation efficiency of a hypothetical enterovirus consortium as a proof of concept to demonstrate how the disinfection data on environmental isolates can be utilized to estimate the overall inactivation of an enterovirus population 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental isolates and laboratory strains of enterovirus a total of nine variants of cvb3 eight environmental isolates cvb3 1 cvb3 3 cvb3 5 cvb3 9 and one laboratory strain cvb3 nancy ten variants of cvb4 nine environmental isolates cvb4 1 cvb4

isolates were derived from wastewater or a river in toyama prefecture japan iwai et al 2006 matsuura et al 1984 from september 2002 to november 2017 all environmental isolates were sequenced as described previously torii et al 2021 near full length genomes were deposited in genbank database under the accession number mw015027 to mw015034 mw015036 to mw015044 and mw015059 the information date of isolation and genbank accession number on each environmental isolate is presented in table s1 of the supporting information si 2 2 virus propagation purification and enumeration both laboratory strain and environmental isolates were propagated on buffalo green monkey kidney bgmk cells to prepare crude virus stocks environmental isolates were passaged only once to obtain a sufficiently high concentration to enable kinetic experiments while minimizing adaptation to laboratory conditions the crude stocks were purified by cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation followed by desalting using amiconultra 100 kda merck millipore as previously described torii et al 2020 this purification method was chosen to minimize virus aggregation dika et al 2013 and chlorine demand dunkin et al 2017 in the viral stock solution the purified virus stocks were stored at 4 c until disinfection experiments the number of the infective viruses was enumerated by the most probable number mpn assay using bgmk cells on 96 well plates meister et al 2018 the samples were serially diluted 10 fold by eagle s minimum essential medium nissui pharmaceutical tokyo japan supplemented with 1 fetal bovine serum thermofisher scientific ma usa a 150 μl of the diluted sample was inoculated on the bgmk cells with five replicates per one dilution series after incubation at 37 c with 5 co2 for six days the presence of a cytopathic effect in each well was checked by microscopy the number of positive wells of each dilution series was counted and converted to mpn using r package mpn ferguson and ihrie 2019 2 3 genotyping and phylogenetic analysis genotyping was performed by rivm enterovirus genotyping tool version 1 0 which was classified based on the sequence of the entire vp1 region kroneman et al 2011 note that the result of the genotype was consistent with that of the serological assay data not shown multiple alignments of the vp1 region position 2451 to 3380 at cvb3 nancy strain m16572 position 2445 to 3299 at cvb4 j v b strain x05690 or position 2459 to 3334 at e11 gregory strain x80059 were constructed by muscle edgar 2004 using the default gap parameters bootstrapped neighbor joining kimura two parameter model phylogenetic trees were constructed with pairwise deletion and with 1000 replicates using mega x version 10 1 6 kumar et al 2018 2 4 modeling of viral capsid protein the structural accessibility of cvb4 capsid residues was assessed using pdb structure 6czk cvb4 strain e2 flatt et al 2021 the visualization of the capsid as well as the identification of accessible amino acids was performed under chimerax version 1 3 2 5 disinfection experiments disinfection experiments were run in duplicate or triplicate for each pair of viruses and disinfectants a total of four time series samples including the sample at time zero were taken in each run all experiments were conducted in disinfectant demand free ddf water at 22 1 c ddf water was buffered to 10 mm and brought to ph 7 0 by adding na2hpo4 and kh2po4 fujifilm wako tokyo japan into milliq water 2 5 1 free chlorine the free chlorine disinfection experiment was conducted in a batch system a free chlorine working solution was prepared by diluting sodium hypochlorite fujifilm wako in ddf water at ph 7 0 the dominant species of free chlorine is hypochlorous acid 77 the final free chlorine concentration in the working solution ranged from 0 27 to 0 35 mg l 1 the free chlorine concentration was measured by n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method using a colorimetric methodology with a dr890 colorimeter hach company loveland co prior to each run glass beakers were soaked with 50 mg l 1 of sodium hypochlorite overnight to quench residual chlorine demand the beakers were rinsed twice with the working solution then 30 μl of virus stock solution was spiked into a 20 ml working solution under constant stirring resulting in an initial virus concentration ranging from 103 to 5 104 mpn ml 1 a 1 ml aliquot was collected every 8 45 s depending on variants and mixed with 10 μl of 5000 mg l 1 of sodium thiosulfate fujifilm wako to quench the residual free chlorine the initial virus concentration was sampled from 20 ml of buffered ddf water without free chlorine spiked with the same amount i e 30 μl of virus stock the 1 ml aliquots were stored at 4 c until virus enumeration the free chlorine concentration was measured at the beginning and the end of each run the decay in free chlorine concentration was less than 21 throughout each run the chlorine dose for each sample expressed as the ct value was determined by integration of the time dependent disinfectant concentration over exposure time assuming the first order decay in free chlorine concentration between time 0 s and the end of the run 2 5 2 uv uv irradiation was performed in batch in a collimated beam low pressure uv lpuv system the uv system comprised a 15 w lpuv lamp gl15 toshiba japan emitting a peak wavelength of 254 nm a shutter and an auto time controller a 10 ml aliquot of ddf water spiked with 30 μl of virus stock was irradiated in a 5 5 cm diameter petri dish 1 3 cm depth with quiescent stirring the increase in uv254 absorbance after spiking purified virus stocks to the ddf water was less than 0 002 cm 1 a 300 μl aliquot was harvested at 0 s 15 s 30 s and 45 s the harvested samples were stored at 4 c until virus enumeration the fluence rate μw cm 2 was given by multiplying the readings of a radiometer uvr2 ud25 topcon by the water factor 0 99 and reflection factor 0 975 bolton and linden 2003 and ranged from 423 to 540 μw cm 2 the uv dose mj cm 2 for each sample was determined as a product of the fluence rate and the corresponding exposure time 2 6 estimation of inactivation rate constants for each variant inactivation rate constants k of each variant were estimated by fitting the models shown in eqs 1 and 2 in table 1 to the data of the disinfection experiments eqs 1 and 2 are the chick watson model where pseudo first order kinetics of virus inactivation was assumed with respect to disinfectant dose the k value of each variant was determined based on the pooled data from all replicates as the slope of ln n n0 versus disinfectant dose by linear least squares regression 2 7 overall inactivation of each genotype of enterovirus overall inactivation of cvb3 and cvb4 were modeled by an expanded chick watson model as described previously torii et al 2021 first the distribution of k values of the variants of each genotype was determined to this end the parameters and akaike information criterion aic of gamma and lognormal distribution of k were estimated by maximum likelihood estimation using the r package fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 if the gamma distribution was selected based on aic the overall inactivation of the given genotype was modeled as eq 3 hereafter named gamma model 3 n n 0 1 1 β d α where α is the shape parameter β is the rate parameter d is the disinfectant dose i e either ct value or uv dose if the lognormal distribution was selected the overall inactivation of the given genotype was modeled as eq 4 hereafter named lognormal model 4 n n 0 1 1 w e μ σ 2 d exp w e μ σ 2 d 2 2 w e μ σ 2 d 2 σ 2 where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the lognormal distribution and w is the lambert w function which is defined as the solution of the w x e w x x the lambert function was calculated in r using lamw adler 2015 overall inactivation of the hypothetical enterovirus consortium was given by the arithmetic mean of the inactivation efficiency weighted by the abundance of each genotype 2 8 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were implemented in r 3 6 0 r core team 2019 linear least squares regression was performed with lm function to estimate inactivation rate constants from the disinfection experiments tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test was used to perform the inter genotype comparison of the log transformed k welch two sample t test was performed to compare the log transformed k between the two genogroups of cvb4 f test was performed to test the homogeneity of variance between log transformed k fc and k uv comparisons with a p value 0 05 were considered significantly different 3 results 3 1 phylogenetic analyses to genetically overview all the tested variants of cvb3 cvb4 and e11 a phylogenetic tree was constructed as shown in fig 1 the nucleotide identities within cvb3 cvb4 and e11 variants in vp1 region ranged from 71 6 to 99 5 from 75 9 to 98 9 and 70 3 respectively see table s2 the environmental cvb3 cvb4 and e11 variants shared only 76 7 83 4 and 70 3 of nucleotide identities with the corresponding laboratory strain all of which were isolated in the 1950s table s1 these results highlight that the laboratory strains are not genetically representative of currently circulating environmental enterovirus for further analysis cvb4 variants were divided into two groups genogroup a including cvb4 4 cvb4 5 cvb4 1 and cvb4 j v b and genogroup b cvb4 6 cvb4 8 cvb4 9 cvb4 7 cvb4 2 and cvb4 3 this classification is similar to a previous phylogenetical study of cvb4 tian et al 2014 genogroup a defined in this study is corresponding to genotypes i and v while genogroup b includes genotypes ii iii iv tian et al 2014 3 2 kinetics of inactivation by free chlorine and uv fig 2 top panels shows the inactivation rate constants estimated for each variant from experimental inactivation data shown in figs s1 and s2 also shown are the inactivation rate constants previously measured for cvb5 variants under the same experimental conditions torii et al 2021 the lower panels of fig 2 show the free chlorine ct values or uv dose required for 4 log inactivation of each variant these ct values or uv doses were extrapolated using the chick watson model namely given by 4 klog10 e table s3 shows the data on inactivation rate constants and required ct value or dose for 4 log inactivation of each variant all inactivation data were provided in a supporting spreadsheet the inactivation rate constants by free chlorine k fc ranged from 8 55 to 15 4 from 6 87 to 19 8 and from 32 6 to 57 7 mg 1 min 1 l for cvb3 cvb4 and e11 respectively correspondingly the predicted ct values for 4 log inactivation ranged from 0 60 to 1 08 from 0 46 to 1 34 and from 0 16 to 0 28 mg min l 1 for cvb3 cvb4 and e11 respectively significant differences in free chlorine susceptibility were observed among genotypes with the following order cvb5 cvb3 cvb4 e11 interestingly a significant difference in free chlorine susceptibility was also observed between the two genogroups of cvb4 genogroup b exhibited lower susceptibility than genogroup a to which cvb4 j v b strain belonged p 0 05 see table s3 these results suggest that the free chlorine susceptibility of enterovirus depends on the genogroup or genotype classified based on the similarity of the genomic sequence coding capsid proteins the inactivation rate constants k uv ranged from 0 31 to 0 39 from 0 29 to 0 39 from 0 307 to 0 311 mj 1 cm2 in cvb3 cvb4 and e11 respectively correspondingly the predicted uv dose for 4 log inactivation ranged from 24 to 30 from 24 to 32 and from 29 6 to 30 0 mj cm 2 no significant differences were observed among the variants or genogroups the predicted uv dose for 4 log inactivation of cvb3 nancy i e 27 6 mj cm 2 nd e11 gregory strain i e 30 mj cm 2 was comparable with previous reports i e 32 5 and 26 6 mj cm 2 for cvb3 nancy and e11 gregory respectively gerba et al 2002 meister et al 2018 the predicted uv doses for 4 log inactivation of cvb4 environmental isolates were also comparable with two variants tested in previous work i e 24 5 and 26 1 mj cm 2 meister et al 2018 no significant inter genotype difference in uv susceptibility was observed among genotypes cvb3 cvb4 cvb5 e11 in summary the variance of k fc was significantly larger than that of k uv in all the genotypes free chlorine susceptibilities differed by up to 15 fold within investigated enterovirus and were variable even within the same genotype in contrast uv susceptibility remained within a factor of 1 3 for all viruses tested no significant difference in uv susceptibility was observed even among genotypes 4 discussion 4 1 underlying causes of genotype genogroup dependent kinetics of inactivation by free chlorine and uv for enterovirus to be infective it should be capable of i binding to receptors expressed on the host cells ii uncoating virions and releasing viral genomic rna into the cytoplasm and iii replicating in the host cells all these functionalities must be intact to fulfill a viral life cycle wigginton et al 2012 in light of this the genotype genogroup dependent difference in inactivation kinetics can be attributable to the difference in the integrity of one or several of the functionalities 4 1 1 free chlorine several studies have attempted to unravel the inactivation mechanism of enterovirus by free chlorine alvarez and o brien 1982 nuanualsuwan and cliver 2003 most of them revealed the main contribution of capsid damage to the inactivation torrey et al observed that loss of viral rna functionality i e replication in the host cell defined as iii in the above paragraph contributed 38 to the overall inactivation rate of e11 gregory strain torrey et al 2019 indicating that the remaining can be explained by the other two functionality losses another functionality test of e11 gregory strain showed that loss of binding capacity contributed 70 to the overall inactivation rate zhong et al 2017 a difference in free chlorine susceptibility among variants may thus be attributable to the difference in the integrity of the binding and uncoating functionalities group b coxsackievirus generally infects host cells by attaching to coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor car and inducing conformational changes in the viral capsid and mediating uncoating bergelson et al 1997 structural analyses showed that the car binds at the surface depression canyon present in each icosahedral 5 fold vortex muckelbauer et al 1995a verdaguer et al 2003 for example the binding of car to cvb1 is mediated by five hydrogen bonds and several van der waals contacts between car and the vp1 bce ef gh loops vp2 ef loop and vp3 gh loop from two adjacent protomers xu et al 2021 inter genogroup differences in free chlorine susceptibility observed in cvb4 can be explained by the amino acid substitutions around these attachment sites common amino acid substitutions between genogroup a and b of cvb4 are shown in table 2 s154q at vp2 and m93k t at vp3 are substitutions of chlorine reactive by stable amino acids pattison and davies 2001 a capsid model of cvb4 reveals that these two residues are surface exposed and accessible to disinfectant figure s3 s154q at vp2 is located on the ef loop which is putatively related to car binding xu et al 2021 m93k t at vp3 is located on the knob which is putatively related to other cell binding sites i e decay accelerating factor gullberg et al 2010 interestingly our previous data indicate that more chlorine susceptible cvb5 variants have substitutions from m to l s t at the same position of the vp3 knob torii et al 2021 we speculate that these substitutions reduce the chlorine reactivity of attachment sites leading to a slower decay of the binding functionality of viruses of cvb4 genogroup b compared to genogroup a and hence to an enhanced chlorine tolerance further studies are needed to confirm the effect of specific amino acid substitutions and receptor usage on free chlorine susceptibility a mechanism of genotype dependent susceptibilities may be also explained by the amino acid substitutions around attachment and uncoating site although a specific site could not be identified due to a large number of common amino acid substitutions among genotypes 4 1 2 uv inactivation of enterovirus by uv has been reported to occur mainly by the damage of viral rna inhibiting replication in the host cells rockey et al 2020 young et al 2019 previous studies reported that uv induces photochemical reactions at pyrimidine bases qiao and wigginton 2016 recently a total number of reactive bases e g number of cytosines c uracil u uracil doublets uu and uracil triplets uuu rockey et al 2021 was reported as an indicator for uv susceptibility of single stranded rna viruses cheng et al 2021 qiao et al 2018 rockey et al 2021 ye et al 2018 in light of this all the tested cvb3 and cvb4 variants were examined for total reactive bases i e the number of u c uu and uuu see table s4 the ratio of reactive to total bases was comparable among all viruses tested ranging from 0 55 to 0 56 these comparable uv reactivities of the genome can explain the enteroviruses similar susceptibilities to uv 4 2 prediction of overall inactivation efficiency and changes in population composition most estimates of overall inactivation efficiency have been based on a single or a few data of a certain variant in the reference pathogen for example chlorination efficiency of overall norovirus inactivation was estimated by literature data on the susceptibility of a single variant of calicivirus murine norovirus 1 sokolova et al 2015 the result of the present study highlights the importance of investigating the inactivation kinetics of different variants and genotypes of a given reference pathogen measurement of the inactivation kinetics of environmental variants allows for predicting the overall disinfection efficiency of enterovirus populations and for assessing the change in population composition during disinfection to further demonstrate this we simulated the inactivation and composition of a hypothetical enterovirus consortium consisting of variants of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 as a function of disinfectant dose fig 3 herein the hypothetical enterovirus consortium was assumed according to previous wastewater surveillance reporting that cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 were detected at the ratio of 0 406 0 156 0 438 in wastewater influent battistone et al 2014 note that e11 was removed from this analysis because of limited data on variant disinfection kinetics for parameter estimation based on the aic comparisons see table s5 gamma models were selected for representing the inactivation of cvb4 by free chlorine and that of all the genotypes by uv while lognormal models were applied for depicting inactivation of cvb3 and cvb5 by free chlorine fig 3a b shows the computed inactivation curves of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 by free chlorine and uv respectively the corresponding model parameters are presented in table s6 free chlorine inactivation of cvb3 and cvb4 was faster than that of cvb5 the predicted ct values for 4 log inactivation of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 were 0 91 1 01 and 2 20 mg min l 1 respectively the ct values for 4 log overall inactivation of the enterovirus consortium were predicted as 1 92 mg min l 1 which is smaller than usepa guidance manual ct values to achieve 4 log inactivation at 22 c at ph 6 9 i e 2 6 mg min l 1 usepa 2002 the guidance values to achieve 4 log inactivation thus remain protective though the protectiveness can be lowered if the chlorination is performed at higher ph than ph 7 and or to achieve higher inactivation than 4 log an interesting point of this modeling is the difference in the shape of inactivation curve between cvb3 and cvb4 based on the disinfection experiments the mean k fc of cvb4 is slightly larger than that of cvb3 correspondingly at lower ct i e 0 61 mg min l 1 cvb4 is predicted to inactivate with higher efficiency than cvb3 however the trend changes at ct of 0 61 mg min l 1 and the inactivation efficiency of cvb4 diminishes below that of cvb3 this is because of the larger variance of k fc of cvb4 higher variability causes a more pronounced tailing of inactivation curve for the prediction of virus reduction through water treatment a mean or minimum reduction value of a given pathogen is typically of central importance schmidt et al 2020 the difference in cvb3 and cvb4 inactivation alarms such a trend and highlights the importance of investigating the variance of k within a given reference pathogen uv inactivations of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 were comparable the doses for 4 log inactivation of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 were 27 28 and 28 mj cm 2 respectively accordingly the predicted dose for 4 log overall inactivation of the enterovirus consortium was similar 28 mj cm 2 the data on the inactivation kinetics of each genotype is also useful to assess the change in the abundance of different genotypes fig 3c d indicates the change in population composition during the disinfection compared with the initial population i e cvb3 cvb4 cvb5 0 406 0 156 0 438 the proportion of cvb3 and cvb4 decreased and that of cvb5 became dominant as the free chlorine dose increased for example at 4 log overall inactivation cvb3 cvb4 cvb5 is estimated to be present at a ratio of 1 1 10 4 1 5 10 3 0 998 on the other hand the composition of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 stayed relatively stable during uv disinfection due to their comparable inactivation kinetics it should be noted that there is some room for improvement in the simulation for example the simulation could integrate more data on the abundance of each genotype and the inactivation kinetics recent advancements in next generation sequencing could add information on the abundance of more genotypes of enterovirus in wastewater bisseux et al 2020 brinkman et al 2017 the inactivation kinetics of different genotypes can be further tested by using environmental isolates as was done in this study moreover the model should be generalized to be applicable under other physicochemical conditions than those used herein for instance a previous study reported that the inactivation by free chlorine proceeds slower as the ph increases from 6 to 8 due to the shift in speciation between hypochlorous acid which has a high virucidal efficiency and the less efficient hypochlorite ion sobsey et al 1988 inactivation may proceed more slowly than expected due to shielding exerted by the matrix e g turbidity templeton et al 2005 wati et al 2018 in particular in wastewater incorporation of these effects into the model allows for a more accurate prediction of the enterovirus inactivation 4 3 implications for the prediction of virus inactivation by disinfection this study assessed the variability in inactivation kinetics of enterovirus variants by free chlorine and uv and observed different variability between the two disinfectants the finding provides implications for a more accurate prediction of virus inactivation during disinfection processes prediction of the enterovirus inactivation by uv is relatively robust to biological variability recent studies showed that the inactivation kinetics of ssrna virus was predictable with high accuracy by a multiple linear regression model taking the number of several pyrimidine based sequence combinations as predictors cheng et al 2021 rockey et al 2021 moreover several studies reported similar inactivation kinetics among variants of several enterovirus genotypes gerba et al 2002 meister et al 2018 given that enterovirus generally has a similar genomic length with similar gc contents the uv susceptibility seems to be comparable among variants of enterovirus the prediction of enterovirus inactivation by uv is likely to be robust to the change in the population of enterovirus in the source water contrary to uv free chlorine susceptibility differed among genotypes genogroups and even variants this casts doubt on the suitability of the current prediction scheme inactivation of a certain viral pathogen is predicted based on the inactivation data of a single or a limited number of variants free chlorine is one of the most common disinfectants for water and wastewater treatment yet its efficiency against the viruses that have not been tested is difficult to predict qiao et al 2022 further studies need to confirm the relationship between capsid oxidation and functional loss of cvb5 from structural and functional viewpoints wigginton and kohn 2012 this finding deepens the understanding of the inactivation mechanism by free chlorine and the relationship between capsid composition structure and disinfection susceptibilities further research should address biological variability in disinfection and explain the genotype dependent difference in inactivation kinetics by free chlorine concurrence of amino acid substitutions among genotypes observed in this study made it difficult to specify key amino acids associated with chlorine tolerance a detailed investigation of this field supports the rationale of using the expanded chick watson model to predict the overall inactivation of a given type of virus 5 conclusions the disinfection susceptibilities among enterovirus were genotype i e susceptibility cvb5 cvb3 cvb4 e11 genogroup and variant dependent in free chlorine i e up to 15 fold difference within tested variants while they were relatively comparable in uv i e up to 1 3 fold difference within tested variants the differences in variability among disinfectants were assumingly due to those in the inactivation mechanism kinetics of enterovirus inactivation by uv mainly depends on the genomic composition whereas that by free chlorine depends on the capsid structure a large dataset of the genotype abundance and the inactivation kinetics of each enterovirus genotype i e distribution of k value allows for predicting the overall inactivation more accurately associated information supporting figures and tables were supplied as supporting information all inactivation data were provided in a supporting spreadsheet declaration of

15871,inactivation kinetics of enterovirus by disinfection is often studied using a single laboratory strain of a given genotype environmental variants of enterovirus are genetically distinct from the corresponding laboratory strain yet it is poorly understood how these genetic differences affect inactivation here we evaluated the inactivation kinetics of nine coxsackievirus b3 cvb3 ten coxsackievirus b4 cvb4 and two echovirus 11 e11 variants by free chlorine and ultraviolet irradiation uv the inactivation kinetics by free chlorine were genotype i e susceptibility cvb5 cvb3 cvb4 e11 and genogroup dependent and exhibited up to 15 fold difference among the tested viruses in contrast only minor up to 1 3 fold differences were observed in the uv inactivation kinetics the differences in variability between the two disinfectants could be rationalized by their respective inactivation mechanisms inactivation by uv mainly depends on the genomic size and composition which was similar for all viruses tested whereas free chlorine targets the viral capsid protein which exhibited critical differences between genogroups and genotypes finally we integrated the observed variability in inactivation rate constants into an expanded chick watson model to estimate the overall inactivation of an enterovirus consortium the results highlight that the distribution of inactivation rate constants and the abundance of each genotype are essential parameters to accurately predict the overall inactivation of an enterovirus population by free chlorine we conclude that predictions based on inactivation data of a single variant or reference pathogen alone likely overestimate the true disinfection efficiency of free chlorine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords virus disinfection free chlorine ultraviolet irradiation inactivation water treatment 1 introduction enterovirus is a non enveloped positive single stranded ss rna virus with a diameter of approximately 30 nm the genus enterovirus consists of more than 100 genotypes infecting humans and causing a broad spectrum of serious illnesses including meningitis myocarditis and hand foot mouth disease bubba et al 2020 because they are enteric pathogens infected individuals shed them into the sewage system and are frequently detected in wastewater and surface waters haramoto et al 2018 enterovirus is therefore one of the microbial contaminants in draft contaminant candidate list 5 published by the u s environmental protection agency usepa their abundance and reduction inactivation in water systems has been investigated and analyzed boehm et al 2019 morrison et al 2022 pecson et al 2022 and often adopted as a reference pathogen in quantitative microbial risk assessment lodder et al 2015 poma et al 2019 schijven et al 2011 water and wastewater treatment are generally expected to reduce infectious virus concentrations to a large extent e g 4 log reduction of viruses for surface water treatment usepa 1989 the conventional physical unit processes such as coagulation sedimentation membrane filtration and sand filtration have a limited capacity to remove viruses asami et al 2016 canh et al 2019 kato et al 2018 yasui et al 2021 instead current treatment trains heavily rely on disinfection e g free chlorine and ultraviolet uv irradiation for virus reduction to date virucidal efficacy of disinfectants were investigated by using laboratory strains black et al 2009 cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2020 sobsey et al 1988 wati et al 2018 while environmental variants have only rarely been tested e g payment et al 1985 rodríguez et al 2022 as a ssrna virus enterovirus has a high mutation rate sanjuan et al 2010 suggesting that the amino acid composition of the viral capsid can be diverse even within the same genotype in light of this our studies investigated environmental variants of one of the genotypes of enterovirus coxsackievirus b5 cvb5 for their inactivation kinetics and observed up to 5 fold variability in free chlorine and up to 1 3 fold variability in uv susceptibility among cvb5 variants meister et al 2018 torii et al 2021 wolf et al 2018 to estimate the disinfection efficiency of water and wastewater treatment processes not only kinetic data for laboratory strains but also for environmental variants should be considered we previously proposed an expanded chick watson model that accounts for kinetic variability among variants to estimate the overall inactivation of a heterogeneous virus consortium we found that required disinfectant dose to achieve 6 log inactivation of heterogeneous consortium of cvb5 variants was up to 4 2 fold in free chlorine and up to 1 2 fold larger in uv than that of laboratory strain torii et al 2021 however the model was applied only to a single genotype although cvb5 is reported to be one of the most prevalent genotypes in wastewater bisseux et al 2020 larivé et al 2021 other genotypes can be dominant depending on the epidemiological situation in the catchment for example cvb3 was most frequently isolated in italian wastewater surveillance pennino et al 2018 coxsackievirus b4 cvb4 and echovirus 11 e11 were reported as the second and third most prevalent genotypes in wastewater respectively larivé et al 2021 therefore inactivation kinetics of such genotypes are essential to predict the overall inactivation of enterovirus by disinfection processes the goal of this work was to evaluate the susceptibility of different variants of cvb3 cvb4 and e11 to common water disinfectants specifically we measured the inactivation kinetics of nine cvb3 ten cvb4 and two e11 variants during inactivation by free chlorine and uv and we identified genetic features that may contribute to altered disinfection susceptibilities finally we modeled the inactivation efficiency of a hypothetical enterovirus consortium as a proof of concept to demonstrate how the disinfection data on environmental isolates can be utilized to estimate the overall inactivation of an enterovirus population 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental isolates and laboratory strains of enterovirus a total of nine variants of cvb3 eight environmental isolates cvb3 1 cvb3 3 cvb3 5 cvb3 9 and one laboratory strain cvb3 nancy ten variants of cvb4 nine environmental isolates cvb4 1 cvb4

isolates were derived from wastewater or a river in toyama prefecture japan iwai et al 2006 matsuura et al 1984 from september 2002 to november 2017 all environmental isolates were sequenced as described previously torii et al 2021 near full length genomes were deposited in genbank database under the accession number mw015027 to mw015034 mw015036 to mw015044 and mw015059 the information date of isolation and genbank accession number on each environmental isolate is presented in table s1 of the supporting information si 2 2 virus propagation purification and enumeration both laboratory strain and environmental isolates were propagated on buffalo green monkey kidney bgmk cells to prepare crude virus stocks environmental isolates were passaged only once to obtain a sufficiently high concentration to enable kinetic experiments while minimizing adaptation to laboratory conditions the crude stocks were purified by cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation followed by desalting using amiconultra 100 kda merck millipore as previously described torii et al 2020 this purification method was chosen to minimize virus aggregation dika et al 2013 and chlorine demand dunkin et al 2017 in the viral stock solution the purified virus stocks were stored at 4 c until disinfection experiments the number of the infective viruses was enumerated by the most probable number mpn assay using bgmk cells on 96 well plates meister et al 2018 the samples were serially diluted 10 fold by eagle s minimum essential medium nissui pharmaceutical tokyo japan supplemented with 1 fetal bovine serum thermofisher scientific ma usa a 150 μl of the diluted sample was inoculated on the bgmk cells with five replicates per one dilution series after incubation at 37 c with 5 co2 for six days the presence of a cytopathic effect in each well was checked by microscopy the number of positive wells of each dilution series was counted and converted to mpn using r package mpn ferguson and ihrie 2019 2 3 genotyping and phylogenetic analysis genotyping was performed by rivm enterovirus genotyping tool version 1 0 which was classified based on the sequence of the entire vp1 region kroneman et al 2011 note that the result of the genotype was consistent with that of the serological assay data not shown multiple alignments of the vp1 region position 2451 to 3380 at cvb3 nancy strain m16572 position 2445 to 3299 at cvb4 j v b strain x05690 or position 2459 to 3334 at e11 gregory strain x80059 were constructed by muscle edgar 2004 using the default gap parameters bootstrapped neighbor joining kimura two parameter model phylogenetic trees were constructed with pairwise deletion and with 1000 replicates using mega x version 10 1 6 kumar et al 2018 2 4 modeling of viral capsid protein the structural accessibility of cvb4 capsid residues was assessed using pdb structure 6czk cvb4 strain e2 flatt et al 2021 the visualization of the capsid as well as the identification of accessible amino acids was performed under chimerax version 1 3 2 5 disinfection experiments disinfection experiments were run in duplicate or triplicate for each pair of viruses and disinfectants a total of four time series samples including the sample at time zero were taken in each run all experiments were conducted in disinfectant demand free ddf water at 22 1 c ddf water was buffered to 10 mm and brought to ph 7 0 by adding na2hpo4 and kh2po4 fujifilm wako tokyo japan into milliq water 2 5 1 free chlorine the free chlorine disinfection experiment was conducted in a batch system a free chlorine working solution was prepared by diluting sodium hypochlorite fujifilm wako in ddf water at ph 7 0 the dominant species of free chlorine is hypochlorous acid 77 the final free chlorine concentration in the working solution ranged from 0 27 to 0 35 mg l 1 the free chlorine concentration was measured by n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method using a colorimetric methodology with a dr890 colorimeter hach company loveland co prior to each run glass beakers were soaked with 50 mg l 1 of sodium hypochlorite overnight to quench residual chlorine demand the beakers were rinsed twice with the working solution then 30 μl of virus stock solution was spiked into a 20 ml working solution under constant stirring resulting in an initial virus concentration ranging from 103 to 5 104 mpn ml 1 a 1 ml aliquot was collected every 8 45 s depending on variants and mixed with 10 μl of 5000 mg l 1 of sodium thiosulfate fujifilm wako to quench the residual free chlorine the initial virus concentration was sampled from 20 ml of buffered ddf water without free chlorine spiked with the same amount i e 30 μl of virus stock the 1 ml aliquots were stored at 4 c until virus enumeration the free chlorine concentration was measured at the beginning and the end of each run the decay in free chlorine concentration was less than 21 throughout each run the chlorine dose for each sample expressed as the ct value was determined by integration of the time dependent disinfectant concentration over exposure time assuming the first order decay in free chlorine concentration between time 0 s and the end of the run 2 5 2 uv uv irradiation was performed in batch in a collimated beam low pressure uv lpuv system the uv system comprised a 15 w lpuv lamp gl15 toshiba japan emitting a peak wavelength of 254 nm a shutter and an auto time controller a 10 ml aliquot of ddf water spiked with 30 μl of virus stock was irradiated in a 5 5 cm diameter petri dish 1 3 cm depth with quiescent stirring the increase in uv254 absorbance after spiking purified virus stocks to the ddf water was less than 0 002 cm 1 a 300 μl aliquot was harvested at 0 s 15 s 30 s and 45 s the harvested samples were stored at 4 c until virus enumeration the fluence rate μw cm 2 was given by multiplying the readings of a radiometer uvr2 ud25 topcon by the water factor 0 99 and reflection factor 0 975 bolton and linden 2003 and ranged from 423 to 540 μw cm 2 the uv dose mj cm 2 for each sample was determined as a product of the fluence rate and the corresponding exposure time 2 6 estimation of inactivation rate constants for each variant inactivation rate constants k of each variant were estimated by fitting the models shown in eqs 1 and 2 in table 1 to the data of the disinfection experiments eqs 1 and 2 are the chick watson model where pseudo first order kinetics of virus inactivation was assumed with respect to disinfectant dose the k value of each variant was determined based on the pooled data from all replicates as the slope of ln n n0 versus disinfectant dose by linear least squares regression 2 7 overall inactivation of each genotype of enterovirus overall inactivation of cvb3 and cvb4 were modeled by an expanded chick watson model as described previously torii et al 2021 first the distribution of k values of the variants of each genotype was determined to this end the parameters and akaike information criterion aic of gamma and lognormal distribution of k were estimated by maximum likelihood estimation using the r package fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 if the gamma distribution was selected based on aic the overall inactivation of the given genotype was modeled as eq 3 hereafter named gamma model 3 n n 0 1 1 β d α where α is the shape parameter β is the rate parameter d is the disinfectant dose i e either ct value or uv dose if the lognormal distribution was selected the overall inactivation of the given genotype was modeled as eq 4 hereafter named lognormal model 4 n n 0 1 1 w e μ σ 2 d exp w e μ σ 2 d 2 2 w e μ σ 2 d 2 σ 2 where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the lognormal distribution and w is the lambert w function which is defined as the solution of the w x e w x x the lambert function was calculated in r using lamw adler 2015 overall inactivation of the hypothetical enterovirus consortium was given by the arithmetic mean of the inactivation efficiency weighted by the abundance of each genotype 2 8 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were implemented in r 3 6 0 r core team 2019 linear least squares regression was performed with lm function to estimate inactivation rate constants from the disinfection experiments tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test was used to perform the inter genotype comparison of the log transformed k welch two sample t test was performed to compare the log transformed k between the two genogroups of cvb4 f test was performed to test the homogeneity of variance between log transformed k fc and k uv comparisons with a p value 0 05 were considered significantly different 3 results 3 1 phylogenetic analyses to genetically overview all the tested variants of cvb3 cvb4 and e11 a phylogenetic tree was constructed as shown in fig 1 the nucleotide identities within cvb3 cvb4 and e11 variants in vp1 region ranged from 71 6 to 99 5 from 75 9 to 98 9 and 70 3 respectively see table s2 the environmental cvb3 cvb4 and e11 variants shared only 76 7 83 4 and 70 3 of nucleotide identities with the corresponding laboratory strain all of which were isolated in the 1950s table s1 these results highlight that the laboratory strains are not genetically representative of currently circulating environmental enterovirus for further analysis cvb4 variants were divided into two groups genogroup a including cvb4 4 cvb4 5 cvb4 1 and cvb4 j v b and genogroup b cvb4 6 cvb4 8 cvb4 9 cvb4 7 cvb4 2 and cvb4 3 this classification is similar to a previous phylogenetical study of cvb4 tian et al 2014 genogroup a defined in this study is corresponding to genotypes i and v while genogroup b includes genotypes ii iii iv tian et al 2014 3 2 kinetics of inactivation by free chlorine and uv fig 2 top panels shows the inactivation rate constants estimated for each variant from experimental inactivation data shown in figs s1 and s2 also shown are the inactivation rate constants previously measured for cvb5 variants under the same experimental conditions torii et al 2021 the lower panels of fig 2 show the free chlorine ct values or uv dose required for 4 log inactivation of each variant these ct values or uv doses were extrapolated using the chick watson model namely given by 4 klog10 e table s3 shows the data on inactivation rate constants and required ct value or dose for 4 log inactivation of each variant all inactivation data were provided in a supporting spreadsheet the inactivation rate constants by free chlorine k fc ranged from 8 55 to 15 4 from 6 87 to 19 8 and from 32 6 to 57 7 mg 1 min 1 l for cvb3 cvb4 and e11 respectively correspondingly the predicted ct values for 4 log inactivation ranged from 0 60 to 1 08 from 0 46 to 1 34 and from 0 16 to 0 28 mg min l 1 for cvb3 cvb4 and e11 respectively significant differences in free chlorine susceptibility were observed among genotypes with the following order cvb5 cvb3 cvb4 e11 interestingly a significant difference in free chlorine susceptibility was also observed between the two genogroups of cvb4 genogroup b exhibited lower susceptibility than genogroup a to which cvb4 j v b strain belonged p 0 05 see table s3 these results suggest that the free chlorine susceptibility of enterovirus depends on the genogroup or genotype classified based on the similarity of the genomic sequence coding capsid proteins the inactivation rate constants k uv ranged from 0 31 to 0 39 from 0 29 to 0 39 from 0 307 to 0 311 mj 1 cm2 in cvb3 cvb4 and e11 respectively correspondingly the predicted uv dose for 4 log inactivation ranged from 24 to 30 from 24 to 32 and from 29 6 to 30 0 mj cm 2 no significant differences were observed among the variants or genogroups the predicted uv dose for 4 log inactivation of cvb3 nancy i e 27 6 mj cm 2 nd e11 gregory strain i e 30 mj cm 2 was comparable with previous reports i e 32 5 and 26 6 mj cm 2 for cvb3 nancy and e11 gregory respectively gerba et al 2002 meister et al 2018 the predicted uv doses for 4 log inactivation of cvb4 environmental isolates were also comparable with two variants tested in previous work i e 24 5 and 26 1 mj cm 2 meister et al 2018 no significant inter genotype difference in uv susceptibility was observed among genotypes cvb3 cvb4 cvb5 e11 in summary the variance of k fc was significantly larger than that of k uv in all the genotypes free chlorine susceptibilities differed by up to 15 fold within investigated enterovirus and were variable even within the same genotype in contrast uv susceptibility remained within a factor of 1 3 for all viruses tested no significant difference in uv susceptibility was observed even among genotypes 4 discussion 4 1 underlying causes of genotype genogroup dependent kinetics of inactivation by free chlorine and uv for enterovirus to be infective it should be capable of i binding to receptors expressed on the host cells ii uncoating virions and releasing viral genomic rna into the cytoplasm and iii replicating in the host cells all these functionalities must be intact to fulfill a viral life cycle wigginton et al 2012 in light of this the genotype genogroup dependent difference in inactivation kinetics can be attributable to the difference in the integrity of one or several of the functionalities 4 1 1 free chlorine several studies have attempted to unravel the inactivation mechanism of enterovirus by free chlorine alvarez and o brien 1982 nuanualsuwan and cliver 2003 most of them revealed the main contribution of capsid damage to the inactivation torrey et al observed that loss of viral rna functionality i e replication in the host cell defined as iii in the above paragraph contributed 38 to the overall inactivation rate of e11 gregory strain torrey et al 2019 indicating that the remaining can be explained by the other two functionality losses another functionality test of e11 gregory strain showed that loss of binding capacity contributed 70 to the overall inactivation rate zhong et al 2017 a difference in free chlorine susceptibility among variants may thus be attributable to the difference in the integrity of the binding and uncoating functionalities group b coxsackievirus generally infects host cells by attaching to coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor car and inducing conformational changes in the viral capsid and mediating uncoating bergelson et al 1997 structural analyses showed that the car binds at the surface depression canyon present in each icosahedral 5 fold vortex muckelbauer et al 1995a verdaguer et al 2003 for example the binding of car to cvb1 is mediated by five hydrogen bonds and several van der waals contacts between car and the vp1 bce ef gh loops vp2 ef loop and vp3 gh loop from two adjacent protomers xu et al 2021 inter genogroup differences in free chlorine susceptibility observed in cvb4 can be explained by the amino acid substitutions around these attachment sites common amino acid substitutions between genogroup a and b of cvb4 are shown in table 2 s154q at vp2 and m93k t at vp3 are substitutions of chlorine reactive by stable amino acids pattison and davies 2001 a capsid model of cvb4 reveals that these two residues are surface exposed and accessible to disinfectant figure s3 s154q at vp2 is located on the ef loop which is putatively related to car binding xu et al 2021 m93k t at vp3 is located on the knob which is putatively related to other cell binding sites i e decay accelerating factor gullberg et al 2010 interestingly our previous data indicate that more chlorine susceptible cvb5 variants have substitutions from m to l s t at the same position of the vp3 knob torii et al 2021 we speculate that these substitutions reduce the chlorine reactivity of attachment sites leading to a slower decay of the binding functionality of viruses of cvb4 genogroup b compared to genogroup a and hence to an enhanced chlorine tolerance further studies are needed to confirm the effect of specific amino acid substitutions and receptor usage on free chlorine susceptibility a mechanism of genotype dependent susceptibilities may be also explained by the amino acid substitutions around attachment and uncoating site although a specific site could not be identified due to a large number of common amino acid substitutions among genotypes 4 1 2 uv inactivation of enterovirus by uv has been reported to occur mainly by the damage of viral rna inhibiting replication in the host cells rockey et al 2020 young et al 2019 previous studies reported that uv induces photochemical reactions at pyrimidine bases qiao and wigginton 2016 recently a total number of reactive bases e g number of cytosines c uracil u uracil doublets uu and uracil triplets uuu rockey et al 2021 was reported as an indicator for uv susceptibility of single stranded rna viruses cheng et al 2021 qiao et al 2018 rockey et al 2021 ye et al 2018 in light of this all the tested cvb3 and cvb4 variants were examined for total reactive bases i e the number of u c uu and uuu see table s4 the ratio of reactive to total bases was comparable among all viruses tested ranging from 0 55 to 0 56 these comparable uv reactivities of the genome can explain the enteroviruses similar susceptibilities to uv 4 2 prediction of overall inactivation efficiency and changes in population composition most estimates of overall inactivation efficiency have been based on a single or a few data of a certain variant in the reference pathogen for example chlorination efficiency of overall norovirus inactivation was estimated by literature data on the susceptibility of a single variant of calicivirus murine norovirus 1 sokolova et al 2015 the result of the present study highlights the importance of investigating the inactivation kinetics of different variants and genotypes of a given reference pathogen measurement of the inactivation kinetics of environmental variants allows for predicting the overall disinfection efficiency of enterovirus populations and for assessing the change in population composition during disinfection to further demonstrate this we simulated the inactivation and composition of a hypothetical enterovirus consortium consisting of variants of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 as a function of disinfectant dose fig 3 herein the hypothetical enterovirus consortium was assumed according to previous wastewater surveillance reporting that cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 were detected at the ratio of 0 406 0 156 0 438 in wastewater influent battistone et al 2014 note that e11 was removed from this analysis because of limited data on variant disinfection kinetics for parameter estimation based on the aic comparisons see table s5 gamma models were selected for representing the inactivation of cvb4 by free chlorine and that of all the genotypes by uv while lognormal models were applied for depicting inactivation of cvb3 and cvb5 by free chlorine fig 3a b shows the computed inactivation curves of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 by free chlorine and uv respectively the corresponding model parameters are presented in table s6 free chlorine inactivation of cvb3 and cvb4 was faster than that of cvb5 the predicted ct values for 4 log inactivation of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 were 0 91 1 01 and 2 20 mg min l 1 respectively the ct values for 4 log overall inactivation of the enterovirus consortium were predicted as 1 92 mg min l 1 which is smaller than usepa guidance manual ct values to achieve 4 log inactivation at 22 c at ph 6 9 i e 2 6 mg min l 1 usepa 2002 the guidance values to achieve 4 log inactivation thus remain protective though the protectiveness can be lowered if the chlorination is performed at higher ph than ph 7 and or to achieve higher inactivation than 4 log an interesting point of this modeling is the difference in the shape of inactivation curve between cvb3 and cvb4 based on the disinfection experiments the mean k fc of cvb4 is slightly larger than that of cvb3 correspondingly at lower ct i e 0 61 mg min l 1 cvb4 is predicted to inactivate with higher efficiency than cvb3 however the trend changes at ct of 0 61 mg min l 1 and the inactivation efficiency of cvb4 diminishes below that of cvb3 this is because of the larger variance of k fc of cvb4 higher variability causes a more pronounced tailing of inactivation curve for the prediction of virus reduction through water treatment a mean or minimum reduction value of a given pathogen is typically of central importance schmidt et al 2020 the difference in cvb3 and cvb4 inactivation alarms such a trend and highlights the importance of investigating the variance of k within a given reference pathogen uv inactivations of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 were comparable the doses for 4 log inactivation of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 were 27 28 and 28 mj cm 2 respectively accordingly the predicted dose for 4 log overall inactivation of the enterovirus consortium was similar 28 mj cm 2 the data on the inactivation kinetics of each genotype is also useful to assess the change in the abundance of different genotypes fig 3c d indicates the change in population composition during the disinfection compared with the initial population i e cvb3 cvb4 cvb5 0 406 0 156 0 438 the proportion of cvb3 and cvb4 decreased and that of cvb5 became dominant as the free chlorine dose increased for example at 4 log overall inactivation cvb3 cvb4 cvb5 is estimated to be present at a ratio of 1 1 10 4 1 5 10 3 0 998 on the other hand the composition of cvb3 cvb4 and cvb5 stayed relatively stable during uv disinfection due to their comparable inactivation kinetics it should be noted that there is some room for improvement in the simulation for example the simulation could integrate more data on the abundance of each genotype and the inactivation kinetics recent advancements in next generation sequencing could add information on the abundance of more genotypes of enterovirus in wastewater bisseux et al 2020 brinkman et al 2017 the inactivation kinetics of different genotypes can be further tested by using environmental isolates as was done in this study moreover the model should be generalized to be applicable under other physicochemical conditions than those used herein for instance a previous study reported that the inactivation by free chlorine proceeds slower as the ph increases from 6 to 8 due to the shift in speciation between hypochlorous acid which has a high virucidal efficiency and the less efficient hypochlorite ion sobsey et al 1988 inactivation may proceed more slowly than expected due to shielding exerted by the matrix e g turbidity templeton et al 2005 wati et al 2018 in particular in wastewater incorporation of these effects into the model allows for a more accurate prediction of the enterovirus inactivation 4 3 implications for the prediction of virus inactivation by disinfection this study assessed the variability in inactivation kinetics of enterovirus variants by free chlorine and uv and observed different variability between the two disinfectants the finding provides implications for a more accurate prediction of virus inactivation during disinfection processes prediction of the enterovirus inactivation by uv is relatively robust to biological variability recent studies showed that the inactivation kinetics of ssrna virus was predictable with high accuracy by a multiple linear regression model taking the number of several pyrimidine based sequence combinations as predictors cheng et al 2021 rockey et al 2021 moreover several studies reported similar inactivation kinetics among variants of several enterovirus genotypes gerba et al 2002 meister et al 2018 given that enterovirus generally has a similar genomic length with similar gc contents the uv susceptibility seems to be comparable among variants of enterovirus the prediction of enterovirus inactivation by uv is likely to be robust to the change in the population of enterovirus in the source water contrary to uv free chlorine susceptibility differed among genotypes genogroups and even variants this casts doubt on the suitability of the current prediction scheme inactivation of a certain viral pathogen is predicted based on the inactivation data of a single or a limited number of variants free chlorine is one of the most common disinfectants for water and wastewater treatment yet its efficiency against the viruses that have not been tested is difficult to predict qiao et al 2022 further studies need to confirm the relationship between capsid oxidation and functional loss of cvb5 from structural and functional viewpoints wigginton and kohn 2012 this finding deepens the understanding of the inactivation mechanism by free chlorine and the relationship between capsid composition structure and disinfection susceptibilities further research should address biological variability in disinfection and explain the genotype dependent difference in inactivation kinetics by free chlorine concurrence of amino acid substitutions among genotypes observed in this study made it difficult to specify key amino acids associated with chlorine tolerance a detailed investigation of this field supports the rationale of using the expanded chick watson model to predict the overall inactivation of a given type of virus 5 conclusions the disinfection susceptibilities among enterovirus were genotype i e susceptibility cvb5 cvb3 cvb4 e11 genogroup and variant dependent in free chlorine i e up to 15 fold difference within tested variants while they were relatively comparable in uv i e up to 1 3 fold difference within tested variants the differences in variability among disinfectants were assumingly due to those in the inactivation mechanism kinetics of enterovirus inactivation by uv mainly depends on the genomic composition whereas that by free chlorine depends on the capsid structure a large dataset of the genotype abundance and the inactivation kinetics of each enterovirus genotype i e distribution of k value allows for predicting the overall inactivation more accurately associated information supporting figures and tables were supplied as supporting information all inactivation data were provided in a supporting spreadsheet declaration of

15872,organic micropollutants omps are contaminants of global concern and have garnered increasing attention in africa particularly in urban and urbanizing areas of sub saharan africa ssa in this work we coupled suspect screening enabled by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms with multivariate analysis to characterize omps in wastewater surface water and groundwater samples collected from kampala the capital and largest city of uganda suspect screening prioritized and confirmed 157 omps in kampala samples for target quantification many omps detected in kampala

consumption patterns and waste management practices among regions collectively these earlier investigations establish a sound knowledge base regarding the types and levels of omps commonly found in african waters and advocate for collaborative research initiatives and capacity building to inform mitigation strategies in regions at risk to date the majority of omp occurrence studies in africa have focused their efforts on the application of target analysis to quantify a preselected set or specific groups of omps informed by local monitoring priorities and available historical data very few studies have incorporated database driven screening approaches enabled by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms to broaden the analytical coverage for a more holistic assessment of omp contamination status in african aquatic systems to the best of our knowledge k oreje and colleagues k oreje et al 2012 were among the first to combine drug consumption data with liquid chromatography hrms lc hrms for suspect screening of pharmaceuticals in water samples collected from the nairobi river basin of kenya more recently kandie et al 2020 madikizela et al 2022 applied suspect screening using self curated compound lists to complement their target quantification of omps in water samples collected from the lake victoria south basin in kenya and the klip river catchment in south africa respectively wood et al 2017 hu et al 2021 huff chester et al 2022 on the other hand leveraged vendor supplied compound databases to pursue suspect or nontarget screening of omps in water samples from south africa nigeria and ghana respectively such studies shed light on the potential of hrms screening for prioritization and identification of less targeted omps in the african environment beyond those routinely flagged for target analysis however only a handful of suspect or nontarget omps identified in these studies were ultimately quantified by authentic reference standards thus preventing further evaluation of their environmental impacts this work aims to combine suspect screening enabled by lc hrms with multivariate analysis to support source identification and risk assessment of omps in the aquatic environment of a representative ssa urban center kampala uganda like other cities in the african great lakes region kampala has witnessed fast population growth and significant urban expansion forget et al 2021 richmond et al 2018 and is facing complex environmental challenges that are further exacerbated by socioeconomic disparities and climate variability li et al 2021 twinomuhangi et al 2021 for example only a small fraction of the population in kampala is served by sewage treatment plants whereas the remaining population relies on onsite sanitation facilities such as septic tanks and pit latrines or open drainage channels for domestic waste disposal mcconville et al 2019 o brien et al 2017 furthermore the population in high income neighborhoods typically has access to piped water supply but the population residing in informal settlements has a high reliance on groundwater from springs or harvested rainwater for domestic e g drinking and cooking and other

nm and the maximum fluorescence intensity of four fluorescent organic matter components extracted by deconvoluting the excitation emission matrices of samples with parallel factor analysis as the predictor variables to rank their predictive power for σ omps multiple linear regression was performed by stepwise variable selection to identify a subset of plsr prioritized water quality parameters that could best predict σ omps with minimal multicollinearity two screening level risk assessment methods were applied to evaluate potential for biological effects associated with omps exposure

patterns of omps in kampala samples overall 157 omps prioritized by suspect screening were confirmed and quantified in kampala water samples with concentrations spanning the range of 10 to 27 300 ng l table s10 of the 157 omps quantified herein 85 can be broadly classified as pharmaceuticals 28 as pesticides 20 as household chemicals and industrial additives and 24 as tps one hundred of these omps occurred in both wastewater and drainage channel water samples among which 26 were also detected at least once in nearshore lake water and groundwater samples indicating the near ubiquity of these omps in different aquatic compartments of kampala on average the cumulative detections of omps in wastewater n 96 15 and drainage channel water samples n 70 15 were markedly higher than those in lake water n 33 7 and groundwater samples n 12 6 similarly the median σ omps in wastewater 102 000 ng l and drainage channel water samples 27 600 ng l were at least one to two orders of magnitude higher than those measured in lake water 3540 ng l and groundwater samples 534 ng l lastly the sample specific cumulative detection of omps ranging from 5 to 124 with a median count of 52 exhibited a strong correlation spearman s ρ 0 959 p 0 0001 with σ omps ranging from 211 to 171 000 ng l with a median value of 20 600 ng l which supports the relevance of both metrics for assessing the magnitude of omp contamination furthermore the concentrations of the six most frequently detected omps i e caffeine carbamazepine efavirenz fluconazole nevirapine and sulfamethoxazole all showed strong positive correlations spearman s ρ 0 901 0 965 p 0 0001 with σ omps and may serve as an abbreviated list of indicator compounds to infer the extent of omp occurrence in kampala samples to further explore the co occurrence profiles of omps in relation to their potential sources hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the z score standardized median quantifiable concentrations of 157 omps fig 2 which revealed three clusters of omps based on euclidean distance with ward s method cluster a contains 29 omps that occurred at comparatively high median concentrations in drainage channel water samples among which 21 are agricultural and mixed use pesticides such as chloroacetanilides e g dimethachlor and metolachlor phenylureas e g isoproturon and monuron s triazines e g atrazine and prometryn organophosphates e g dichlorvos and malathion and plant growth regulators e g abscisic acid and indole 3 butyric acid eight remaining cluster a omps were pesticide tps derived from chloroacetanilides and s triazines e g atrazine 2 hydroxy and metolachlor oxanilic acid carbendazim i e 2 aminobenzimidazole and amitraz i e n 2 4 dimethylphenyl formamide of the 29 cluster a omps atrazine featured the highest detection frequency i e 73 and occurred at a median concentration i e 27 ng l similar to that of atrazine 2 hydroxy i e 30 ng l a tp with the second highest detection frequency i e 64 atrazine and atrazine 2 hydroxy were detected in all sample matrices however other cluster a pesticides and pesticide tps only occurred at varying concentrations in drainage channel water samples indicating that these omps primarily originated from diffuse sources within the catchments of kampala drainage networks cluster b contains 70 omps that occurred at the highest median concentrations in wastewater samples fifty four cluster b omps were various pharmaceuticals such as analgesics e g antipyrine and detomidine anesthetics e g lidocaine and ketamine antiallergics e g cetirizine and fexofenadine antibacterials e g sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim antidepressants e g desvenlafaxine and fluoxetine antidiabetics e g metformin and sitagliptin antiepileptics e g carbamazepine and phenytoin antifungals e g fluconazole and griseofulvin antihypertensives e g losartan and irbesartan anti inflammatories e g diclofenac and naproxen antivirals e g nevirapine and efavirenz and immunosuppressants e g cyclophosphamide and mycophenolic acid fifteen of these pharmaceuticals i e carbamazepine cetirizine desvenlafaxine efavirenz fluconazole griseofulvin irbesartan lidocaine losartan metformin metronidazole nevirapine sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and zidovudine had a relatively high detection frequency i e 79 14 and occurred at a wide range of median concentrations i e 19 930 ng l seven other cluster b omps were pharmaceutical tps including four i e 10 11 dihydro 10 hydroxy carbamazepine 4 formylamino antipyrine α hydroxy trimethoprim and n4 acetylsulfamethoxazole that co occurred with their parent compounds at lower concentrations nine remaining cluster b omps were industrial additives i e benzotriazole benzothiazole phthalates and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate and household chemicals i e sucralose galaxolidone a tp of galaxolide and propylparaben that occurred at median concentrations i e 29 880 ng l with a detection frequency i e 79 7 comparable to those measured for the 15 most frequently detected cluster b pharmaceuticals thirty cluster b pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical tps only occurred in wastewater samples suggesting that they were exclusively derived from wastewater other 40 cluster b omps also occurred in drainage channel water lake water and or groundwater samples corroborating the high variability in omp mixture composition among sample matrices and the contribution of both point and non point source wastewater discharges in kampala to omp occurrence in receiving aquatic compartments cluster c contains 58 omps that occurred at higher median concentrations in wastewater and drainage channel water samples than in lake water and groundwater samples thirty one cluster c omps were pharmaceuticals such as analgesics e g levorphanol and acetaminophen anthelmintics e g albendazole and levamisole antibacterials e g clarithromycin and sulfadoxine antiepileptics e g lamotrigine and levetiracetam antiparasitics e g pyrimethamine and quinine antivirals e g atazanavir and darunavir bronchodilators e g theophylline and albuterol contraceptives e g levonorgestrel and medroxyprogesterone and stimulants e g methamphetamine and caffeine eight other cluster c omps were pharmaceutical tps derived from anthelmintics e g albendazole caffeine cocaine and nicotine including four i e 1 methylxanthine paraxanthine albendazole sulfoxide and albendazole 2 aminosulfone that co occurred with their parent compounds nineteen remaining cluster c omps were seven pesticides i e neonicotinoids 2 4 d carbaryl carbendazim and diuron that are widely applied in urban and agricultural settings eight industrial additives such as tire derived chemicals e g 1 3 diphenylguanidine caprolactam n cyclohexyl n methylcyclohexanamine n cyclohexyl n phenylurea insect repellents i e deet icaridin and ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate and benzophenone eleven cluster c omps i e caffeine methamphetamine theophylline cotinine acetamiprid imidacloprid 2 4 d diuron 1 3 diphenylguanidine methyl 1h benzotriazole and deet featured a comparatively high detection frequency i e 73 9 and occurred at median concentrations varying over an order of magnitude i e 23 1510 ng l five of these omps i e caffeine acetamiprid imidacloprid 2 4 d and deet occurred in all sample matrices whereas the remaining six omps were not detected in groundwater samples other less frequently detected cluster c omps occurred in wastewater and drainage channel water samples over a narrower range of median concentrations such heterogenous occurrence patterns further support the hypothesis that a large portion of omps enters the aquatic environment of kampala from mixed sources such as wastewater discharges urban development and agricultural activities 3 2 comparative evaluation of omp occurrence in kampala and ssa over the past decade the environmental occurrence data of omps have become increasingly available for ssa countries including those historically underrepresented in omp research k oreje et al 2020 wilkinson et al 2022 to place results from this work in the context of existing literature the geometric mean concentrations of omps quantified in kampala samples were evaluated against data curated from prior studies reporting omp occurrence in ssa wastewater surface waters and groundwater only data from studies that quantified omp concentrations in aquatic matrices using liquid or gas chromatography mass spectrometry were selected for comparison studies that extracted sludge sediment or biota samples deployed passive sampling devices or applied non mass spectrometric methods for omp analysis were excluded from further consideration with these criteria the mean concentrations of omps reported by 68 studies published up to march 2022 were compiled resulting in a total of 1912 data entries table s11 to our knowledge this is by far the most comprehensive omp occurrence database ever assembled for aquatic samples from ssa seven of these 68 studies reported omp concentrations in ugandan samples while the remaining collected data from 23 other ssa countries together these 68 studies documented the occurrence of 349 unique omps in various types of environmental water samples e g wastewater influent and effluent river and stream water lake and reservoir water estuarine and coastal water groundwater and drinking water from ssa among which 91 were also detected in samples from kampala and the ugandan waters of lake victoria arinaitwe et al 2021 dalahmeh et al 2020 dalahmeh et al 2018 nantaba et al 2020 2021 twinomucunguzi et al 2021 over 90 of the data entries were mean concentrations reported for wastewater and surface waters figure s5 suggesting that the occurrence of omps in ssa groundwater only received limited attention comparing the spectrum of omps quantified in this work to those reported in previous studies reveals that 69 of the 157 omps i e 42 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical tps 15 pesticides and pesticide tps 9 industrial additives and 3 household chemicals have never been quantified in environmental water samples from ssa some of these omps have been widely e g oxcarbazepine isoproturon sucralose benzothiazole melamine methyl 1h benzotriazole or increasingly e g tire derived chemicals detected in wide scope screening studies conducted on other continents angeles et al 2021 carpenter and helbling 2018 emadian et al 2021 fabregat safont et al 2021 peter et al 2018 whereas several are rarely studied compounds e g benazepril detomidine maprotiline albendazole sulfoxide albendazole 2 aminosulfone mebendazole amine with potentially high environmental relevance belew et al 2021 petrovic 2014 sixty one additional omps i e 39 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical tps 18 pesticides and pesticide tps 2 industrial additives and 2 household chemicals have been detected at least once in other regions of ssa but not in uganda on average the cumulative concentration of omps never quantified in ugandan and or ssa studies constituted 20 71 of σ omps measured in kampala wastewater surface water and groundwater samples again demonstrating the added value of suspect screening for capturing less frequently detected or previously overlooked omps of the 157 omps quantified in kampala samples 51 68 and 11 overlapped with those previously detected in ssa wastewater surface water and groundwater samples respectively fig 3 many of the overlapping omps occurred in kampala samples at concentrations similar to those found in prior studies for example the geometric mean concentrations of 30 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical tps i e from 31 ng l for lamotrigine to 6820 ng l for sulfamethoxazole benzotriazole i e 649 ng l and propylparaben i e 3840 ng l detected in 100 kampala wastewater samples fell within the mean concentration ranges multiple t tests p 0 537 0 591 of these 32 omps measured in ssa wastewater i e 25 6150 ng l likewise the geometric mean concentrations of 12 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical tps i e from 24 ng l for lidocaine to 1650 ng l for caffeine 2 4 d i e 240 ng l acetamiprid i e 68 ng l and 3 phthalates i e 43 1380 ng l detected in 100 drainage channel and nearshore lake water samples from kampala also overlapped with the mean concentration ranges of these 17 omps reported for ssa surface waters i e 10 1980 ng l lastly the geometric mean concentrations of carbamazepine i e 26 ng l and sulfamethoxazole i e 60 ng l the two omps detected in 100 kampala groundwater samples were not statistically different multiple t tests p 0 537 0 591 from the mean concentrations observed in ssa groundwater i e 18 42 ng l considering the spatiotemporal extent of studies compiled for evaluation the similarity in concentration ranges indicates some consistency in omp recurrence patterns throughout the aquatic environment of ssa of the remaining overlapping omps detected in 100 kampala samples several occurred at concentrations above those measured in similar ssa sample matrices while others occurred at lower levels for example the geometric mean concentrations of medroxyprogesterone i e 42 ng l and sulfapyridine i e 247 ng l in kampala wastewater samples far exceeded the mean concentrations measured in ssa wastewater i e 3 5 ng l however the geometric mean concentrations of emtricitabine i e 543 ng l lopinavir i e 194 ng l and sulfamethazine i e 51 ng l were at least one order of magnitude lower than the mean concentrations detected in ssa wastewater i e 1080 33 500 ng l furthermore the geometric mean concentrations of deet i e 411 ng l and propylparaben i e 810 ng l in kampala surface water samples were substantially higher than those reported for ssa surface waters i e 20 77 ng l whereas the geometric mean concentration of tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate i e 40 ng l was 10 times lower than the mean concentration observed in ssa surface waters i e 419 ng l such heterogeneous profiles reflect the mixture complexity of omps across regions and reinforce the necessity of establishing statistically robust baseline levels to support adaptive omp monitoring in ssa 3 3 water quality variables as predictors for omp occurrence measuring water quality parameters provides complementary metrics for assessing site specific omp contamination status at the time of sample collection for example previous work characterizing the spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals in the ugandan waters of lake victoria observed strong associations between pharmaceutical levels and water quality indicators such as turbidity nantaba et al 2021 to evaluate the strength of water quality variables for predicting omp occurrence in kampala samples plsr analysis was performed using the sample specific cumulative concentrations of cluster a b and c omps i e σ omps cluster a σ omps cluster b and σ omps cluster c as the response variables and 11 physicochemical and optical properties of water samples as the predictor variables overall the strength of explained variation i e 95 4 1 9 and the goodness of cross validated prediction i e 92 9 2 9 for the plsr model were high suggesting that the predictor variables adequately captured the inter sample variability in σ omps on the basis of the variable importance in the projection scores figure s6 the concentration of nitrate i e no3 and the maximum fluorescence intensity of a protein like fluorescent organic matter component i e c4 with excitation emission maxima around 280 330 nm figures s3 s4 commonly present in wastewater or wastewater impacted aquatic systems hudson et al 2007 were ranked as the two variables with the highest explanatory power recognizing the multicollinearity among predictor variables stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was further performed to identify the most parsimonious models for predicting σ omps specifically no3 and c4 were single variables that could effectively predict σ omps cluster a and σ omps cluster b respectively whereas c4 and no3 served as the best combination of predictors for σ omps cluster c fig 4 furthermore the inclusion of additional predictor variables for σ omps did not significantly improve model consistency with measured data the fact that c4 emerged as a strong predictor for σ omps cluster b and σ omps cluster c reaffirms the vulnerability of kampala surface waters and groundwater to omp contamination associated with wastewater inputs interestingly an earlier study assessing the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the nairobi river catchment in kenya also attributed elevated pharmaceutical concentrations in surface waters to wastewater influence based on the concurrent measurements of protein like organic matter content using fluorescence spectroscopy although no direct quantitative relationships were identified bagnis et al 2020 on the other hand nitrate has long been viewed as a continental scale diffuse source contaminant in africa with a high potential to pollute surface waters and infiltrate shallow groundwater lapworth et al 2017 ouedraogo and vanclooster 2016 thus the strong correlation between σ omps cluster a and no3 implies that the prevalence of omps in kampala surface waters and groundwater was also linked to upstream diffuse pollution such as those originating from urban and agricultural sources together these analyses constitute compelling additional support for the hypothesized importance of wastewater discharges and diffuse runoff as drivers for omp entry into the aquatic environment of kampala 3 4 potential for biological effects associated with omps two screening level risk assessments were performed in parallel to gain exploratory insights into possible ecologically relevant effects of omps measured in kampala samples on aquatic life to this end the ear approach was implemented to screen for the potential for in vitro vertebrate centric sublethal effects associated with single omps or omp mixtures based on exposure response metrics derived from molecular bioassay endpoints blackwell et al 2017 of the 157 omps 136 including their free and salt forms had matched entries in the toxcast high throughput screening database u s environmental protection agency s center for computational toxicology and exposure 2021 twelve of these omps had a median ear above the precautionary effects screening threshold of 0 001 corsi et al 2019 under mean exposure conditions five cluster b omps i e carbamazepine propylparaben benzothiazole fluconazole and griseofulvin and 7 cluster c omps i e caffeine 2 4 d 1 3 diphenylguanidine diuron theophylline deet and carbaryl showed a threshold exceedance in over 50 of the samples carbamazepine featured the highest frequency of exceedance i e 100 followed by caffeine i e 92 2 4 d i e 83 and propylparaben i e 80 respectively consistent with the pattern observed for σ omps the median σears for wastewater and drainage channel water samples i e 43 4 and 21 9 respectively were two orders of magnitude higher than those for nearshore lake water and groundwater samples i e 0 06 and 0 02 respectively figure s7 two contraceptives i e levonorgestrel and medroxyprogesterone carbamazepine caffeine 2 4 d and propylparaben constituted the mixture of omps that dominated σears i e 90 11 but the relative contribution of individual omps to σears varied across sample matrices for example levonorgestrel alone contributed to 94 2 of σears for wastewater samples whereas levonorgestrel caffeine medroxyprogesterone and carbamazepine collectively explained 88 18 of σears for drainage channel water samples carbamazepine caffeine 2 4 d and propylparaben jointly accounted for 84 14 of σears for lake water and groundwater samples with carbamazepine serving as the top contributing compound in the mixture of omps to complement ear screening pafs and mspafs were calculated to assess the potential for in vivo lethal effects on aquatic species assemblages associated with single omps or omp mixtures based on log normal species sensitivity distributions constructed from acute ec50 data posthuma et al 2019 of the 157 omps quantified in kampala samples 125 had full species sensitivity distribution data available posthuma et al 2019 but only 1 cluster b omp i e sulfamethoxazole and 2 cluster c omps i e acetamiprid and imidacloprid had a median paf of above 0 1 indicating low predicted acute toxic pressure posed by individual omps like σears the median mspafs for wastewater and drainage channel water samples i e 4 6 and 3 8 respectively were higher than those for nearshore lake water and groundwater samples i e 0 84 and 0 01 respectively figure s8 although the dominating mixture of omps for mspafs did not overlap with that for σears notably 40 of wastewater and drainage channel water samples featured high mspafs i e 5 3 30 6 that exceeded the generally accepted effect threshold of 5 smetanová et al 2014 suggesting that over 5 of the sensitive aquatic species at sites could potentially be affected by exposure to the mixture of omps together with norepinephrine and dichlorvos sulfamethoxazole and two neonicotinoids i e acetamiprid and imidacloprid explained 84 11 of mspafs for wastewater and drainage channel water samples sulfamethoxazole and the two neonicotinoids also accounted for 99 1 and 88 33 of mspafs for lake water and groundwater samples respectively further underlining their role as potential drivers for the acute toxic pressure posed by the mixture of omps on average the fractional contribution of σears and mspafs for omps never quantified in environmental water samples from uganda or ssa to those calculated for omps quantified in kampala samples ranged from 1 to 99 and 1 to 88 respectively thus restricting the calculations of σears and mspafs for only omps reported in prior work may lead to varying degrees of bias in both indices particularly when assessing wastewater and drainage channel water samples fig 5 taken together the ear and the mspaf calculations provide qualitative evidence for probabilities of sublethal and acutely toxic effects associated with both frequently detected e g carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole imidacloprid and less targeted omps e g levonorgestrel norepinephrine dichlorvos which underscores the benefit of applying suspect screening to improve risk based prioritization of omps 4 conclusions our study combines lc hrms based suspect screening with multivariate analysis to comprehensively characterize the occurrence patterns of omps and accompanying potential for biological effects in the aquatic environment of kampala an urban center in ssa our suspect screening approach prioritized and confirmed 157 omps including 24 tps in various water samples collected from kampala many of these omps have never or rarely been investigated in environmental water samples from ssa most omps occurred in kampala samples at concentrations broadly comparable to the ranges reported in prior ssa studies while others occurred at levels substantially higher or lower than those measured in similar ssa sample matrices highlighting commonalities and differences in omp occurrence patterns and the need for concerted omp monitoring in ssa moreover the omp concentration database compiled for ssa including data from this work can facilitate quantitative comparisons of omp levels in aquatic systems across continents when supplemented with relevant datasets our multivariate analysis established the co occurrence profiles of major omp clusters and identified the concentration of nitrate and the abundance of a wastewater derived fluorescent organic matter component as two strong predictors for the sample specific cumulative concentration of omps which pointed to wastewater discharges and diffuse runoff as potentially important drivers of omp prevalence in the aquatic environment of kampala measurements of these two water quality parameters can be adapted in resource limited settings for inference of omp contamination status but should not be misconstrued as a substitute for omp analysis lastly our screening level calculations of ears and mspafs supported risk based prioritization of omp mixtures exhibiting heightened potential for vertebrate centric molecular effects and acute toxic pressure however no direct extrapolations of these values to ecologically relevant effects on sensitive aquatic species can be made in that the chemical space investigated in this work was limited to polar and semi polar omps amenable to our spe lc hrms method our work is inherently restricted to grab sampling with low spatiotemporal resolution in one ssa urban center due to logistical constraints but it offers a promising methodological framework for addressing data gaps required for the regional impact assessment of omps in other similar settings we envision growing applications of complementary sampling e g automated or passive sampling screening e g nontarget screening and biomonitoring techniques to guide data driven omp monitoring and evidence based ecotoxicological studies in ssa through

15872,organic micropollutants omps are contaminants of global concern and have garnered increasing attention in africa particularly in urban and urbanizing areas of sub saharan africa ssa in this work we coupled suspect screening enabled by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms with multivariate analysis to characterize omps in wastewater surface water and groundwater samples collected from kampala the capital and largest city of uganda suspect screening prioritized and confirmed 157 omps in kampala samples for target quantification many omps detected in kampala samples occurred within concentration ranges similar to those documented in previous studies reporting omp occurrence in ssa but some have never or rarely been quantified in environmental water samples from ssa hierarchical cluster analysis established the source related co occurrence profiles of omps partial least squares regression and multiple linear regression analyses further pinpointed the concentration of nitrate and the content of a fluorescent organic matter component with excitation emission maxima around 280 330 nm as predictors for the sample specific cumulative concentrations of omps suggesting the likely contribution of diffuse runoff and wastewater discharges to omp occurrence in the aquatic environment of kampala parallel calculations of exposure activity ratios and multi substance potentially affected fractions provided insights into the potential for biological effects associated with omps and highlighted the importance of expanded analytical coverage for screening level risk assessments overall our study demonstrates a versatile database driven screening and data analysis methodology for the multipronged characterization of omp contamination in a

industrial additives and their transformation products tps that typically occur at ng l to μg l levels in aquatic systems escher and fenner 2011 schwarzenbach et al 2006 globally the widespread occurrence of omps presents an ongoing challenge to water resources management due to concerns over their adverse impacts on environmental and human health aus der beek et al 2016 lukač reberski et al 2022 malaj et al 2014 stehle and schulz 2015 wilkinson et al 2022 such concerns have become increasingly relevant in regions experiencing rapid population growth along with intensification of chemical production and use weiss et al 2016 such as urban and urbanizing areas of sub saharan africa ssa over the past decade a growing number of studies have sought to characterize the occurrence sources and ecotoxicological risks of omps in africa fekadu et al 2019 gwenzi and chaukura 2018 k oreje et al 2020 madikizela et al 2017 ssebugere et al 2020 many omps identified in the african aquatic environment occur at concentrations comparable to those reported in north america europe and asia pacific k oreje et al 2020 but certain categories of omps e g antivirals anthelmintics antimalarials estrogens have been detected at elevated levels adeola and forbes 2022 belew et al 2021 fekadu et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2022 due to differences in the prevailing public health conditions substance consumption patterns and waste management practices among regions collectively these earlier investigations establish a sound knowledge base regarding the types and levels of omps commonly found in african waters and advocate for collaborative research initiatives and capacity building to inform mitigation strategies in regions at risk to date the majority of omp occurrence studies in africa have focused their efforts on the application of target analysis to quantify a preselected set or specific groups of omps informed by local monitoring priorities and available historical data very few studies have incorporated database driven screening approaches enabled by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms to broaden the analytical coverage for a more holistic assessment of omp contamination status in african aquatic systems to the best of our knowledge k oreje and colleagues k oreje et al 2012 were among the first to combine drug consumption data with liquid chromatography hrms lc hrms for suspect screening of pharmaceuticals in water samples collected from the nairobi river basin of kenya more recently kandie et al 2020 madikizela et al 2022 applied suspect screening using self curated compound lists to complement their target quantification of omps in water samples collected from the lake victoria south basin in kenya and the klip river catchment in south africa respectively wood et al 2017 hu et al 2021 huff chester et al 2022 on the other hand leveraged vendor supplied compound databases to pursue suspect or nontarget screening of omps in water samples from south africa nigeria and ghana respectively such studies shed light on the potential of hrms screening for prioritization and identification of less targeted omps in the african environment beyond those routinely flagged for target analysis however only a handful of suspect or nontarget omps identified in these studies were ultimately quantified by authentic reference standards thus preventing further evaluation of their environmental impacts this work aims to combine suspect screening enabled by lc hrms with multivariate analysis to support source identification and risk assessment of omps in the aquatic environment of a representative ssa urban center kampala uganda like other cities in the african great lakes region kampala has witnessed fast population growth and significant urban expansion forget et al 2021 richmond et al 2018 and is facing complex environmental challenges that are further exacerbated by socioeconomic disparities and climate variability li et al 2021 twinomuhangi et al 2021 for example only a small fraction of the population in kampala is served by sewage treatment plants whereas the remaining population relies on onsite sanitation facilities such as septic tanks and pit latrines or open drainage channels for domestic waste disposal mcconville et al 2019 o brien et al 2017 furthermore the population in high income neighborhoods typically has access to piped water supply but the population residing in informal settlements has a high reliance on groundwater from springs or harvested rainwater for domestic e g drinking and cooking and other uses byrne et al 2021 nayebare et al 2014 several recent studies have documented the occurrence of perfluoroalkyl substances arinaitwe et al 2021 dalahmeh et al 2018 pharmaceuticals dalahmeh et al

although the number of omps quantified in each study was limited our specific objectives of this study were i to perform suspect screening and target quantification of omps in wastewater surface water and groundwater samples collected from kampala ii to compare the concentration ranges of omps measured in kampala samples to those previously reported for ssa iii to explore the strength of water quality variables as predictors for the overall level of omps and iv to evaluate the potential for biological effects associated with omps using two screening level risk assessments 2 materials and

chromatograph interfaced with a thermo scientific ltq xl hybrid ion trap orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer for omp analysis table s4 chromatographic separation of omps was performed on a

match factor of 70 n 285 table s8 were selected for further evaluation against authentic reference standards among which 157 were confirmed by verification of their chromatographic retention times and dd ms2 spectra target quantification of 157 confirmed omps in samples was performed retrospectively using 12 point calibration curves twelve calibration standards i e prepared in triplicate using 500 ml of ultrapure water spiked with the mixture of 157 omps at concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 3000 ng l followed by the mixture of ilis at 200 ng l were extracted and analyzed following the same spe lc hrms method described above calibration curves r 2 0 995 0 005 n 157 table s9 were constructed in tracefinder by the non weighted linear least squares regression algorithm concentrations of omps

quantification of omps hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the complexheatmap package gu et al 2016 in r 4 0 3 to visualize the source related clustering patterns of omps based on their z score standardized median quantifiable concentrations partial least squares regression plsr analysis was performed with simca 17 0 2 umetrics using the sample specific cumulative concentrations of omps σ omps as the response variables and a suite of water quality parameters i e the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon nitrate chloride bromide and fluoride the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm and the maximum fluorescence intensity of four fluorescent organic matter components extracted by deconvoluting the excitation emission matrices of samples with parallel factor analysis as the predictor variables to rank their predictive power for σ omps multiple linear regression was performed by stepwise variable selection to identify a subset of plsr prioritized water quality parameters that could best predict σ omps with minimal multicollinearity two screening level risk assessment methods were applied to evaluate potential for biological effects associated with omps exposure activity ratios ears were calculated for single omps with reliable exposure effects relation data in the toxcast database u s environmental protection agency s center for computational toxicology and exposure 2021 using the toxeval package de cicco et al 2020 in r potentially affected fractions pafs of species for single omps were calculated by the species sensitivity distributions approach de zwart and posthuma 2005 based on the log transformed acute median toxicity ec50 values for multiple species and omp combinations posthuma et al 2019 for each sample the sample specific cumulative ears σears and multi substance potentially affected fraction mspaf for the mixture of omps were calculated by assuming concentration addition backhaus and faust 2012 blackwell et al 2017 and response

patterns of omps in kampala samples overall 157 omps prioritized by suspect screening were confirmed and quantified in kampala water samples with concentrations spanning the range of 10 to 27 300 ng l table s10 of the 157 omps quantified herein 85 can be broadly classified as pharmaceuticals 28 as pesticides 20 as household chemicals and industrial additives and 24 as tps one hundred of these omps occurred in both wastewater and drainage channel water samples among which 26 were also detected at least once in nearshore lake water and groundwater samples indicating the near ubiquity of these omps in different aquatic compartments of kampala on average the cumulative detections of omps in wastewater n 96 15 and drainage channel water samples n 70 15 were markedly higher than those in lake water n 33 7 and groundwater samples n 12 6 similarly the median σ omps in wastewater 102 000 ng l and drainage channel water samples 27 600 ng l were at least one to two orders of magnitude higher than those measured in lake water 3540 ng l and groundwater samples 534 ng l lastly the sample specific cumulative detection of omps ranging from 5 to 124 with a median count of 52 exhibited a strong correlation spearman s ρ 0 959 p 0 0001 with σ omps ranging from 211 to 171 000 ng l with a median value of 20 600 ng l which supports the relevance of both metrics for assessing the magnitude of omp contamination furthermore the concentrations of the six most frequently detected omps i e caffeine carbamazepine efavirenz fluconazole nevirapine and sulfamethoxazole all showed strong positive correlations spearman s ρ 0 901 0 965 p 0 0001 with σ omps and may serve as an abbreviated list of indicator compounds to infer the extent of omp occurrence in kampala samples to further explore the co occurrence profiles of omps in relation to their potential sources hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the z score standardized median quantifiable concentrations of 157 omps fig 2 which revealed three clusters of omps based on euclidean distance with ward s method cluster a contains 29 omps that occurred at comparatively high median concentrations in drainage channel water samples among which 21 are agricultural and mixed use pesticides such as chloroacetanilides e g dimethachlor and metolachlor phenylureas e g isoproturon and monuron s triazines e g atrazine and prometryn organophosphates e g dichlorvos and malathion and plant growth regulators e g abscisic acid and indole 3 butyric acid eight remaining cluster a omps were pesticide tps derived from chloroacetanilides and s triazines e g atrazine 2 hydroxy and metolachlor oxanilic acid carbendazim i e 2 aminobenzimidazole and amitraz i e n 2 4 dimethylphenyl formamide of the 29 cluster a omps atrazine featured the highest detection frequency i e 73 and occurred at a median concentration i e 27 ng l similar to that of atrazine 2 hydroxy i e 30 ng l a tp with the second highest detection frequency i e 64 atrazine and atrazine 2 hydroxy were detected in all sample matrices however other cluster a pesticides and pesticide tps only occurred at varying concentrations in drainage channel water samples indicating that these omps primarily originated from diffuse sources within the catchments of kampala drainage networks cluster b contains 70 omps that occurred at the highest median concentrations in wastewater samples fifty four cluster b omps were various pharmaceuticals such as analgesics e g antipyrine and detomidine anesthetics e g lidocaine and ketamine antiallergics e g cetirizine and fexofenadine antibacterials e g sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim antidepressants e g desvenlafaxine and fluoxetine antidiabetics e g metformin and sitagliptin antiepileptics e g carbamazepine and phenytoin antifungals e g fluconazole and griseofulvin antihypertensives e g losartan and irbesartan anti inflammatories e g diclofenac and naproxen antivirals e g nevirapine and efavirenz and immunosuppressants e g cyclophosphamide and mycophenolic acid fifteen of these pharmaceuticals i e carbamazepine cetirizine desvenlafaxine efavirenz fluconazole griseofulvin irbesartan lidocaine losartan metformin metronidazole nevirapine sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and zidovudine had a relatively high detection frequency i e 79 14 and occurred at a wide range of median concentrations i e 19 930 ng l seven other cluster b omps were pharmaceutical tps including four i e 10 11 dihydro 10 hydroxy carbamazepine 4 formylamino antipyrine α hydroxy trimethoprim and n4 acetylsulfamethoxazole that co occurred with their parent compounds at lower concentrations nine remaining cluster b omps were industrial additives i e benzotriazole benzothiazole phthalates and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate and household chemicals i e sucralose galaxolidone a tp of galaxolide and propylparaben that occurred at median concentrations i e 29 880 ng l with a detection frequency i e 79 7 comparable to those measured for the 15 most frequently detected cluster b pharmaceuticals thirty cluster b pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical tps only occurred in wastewater samples suggesting that they were exclusively derived from wastewater other 40 cluster b omps also occurred in drainage channel water lake water and or groundwater samples corroborating the high variability in omp mixture composition among sample matrices and the contribution of both point and non point source wastewater discharges in kampala to omp occurrence in receiving aquatic compartments cluster c contains 58 omps that occurred at higher median concentrations in wastewater and drainage channel water samples than in lake water and groundwater samples thirty one cluster c omps were pharmaceuticals such as analgesics e g levorphanol and acetaminophen anthelmintics e g albendazole and levamisole antibacterials e g clarithromycin and sulfadoxine antiepileptics e g lamotrigine and levetiracetam antiparasitics e g pyrimethamine and quinine antivirals e g atazanavir and darunavir bronchodilators e g theophylline and albuterol contraceptives e g levonorgestrel and medroxyprogesterone and stimulants e g methamphetamine and caffeine eight other cluster c omps were pharmaceutical tps derived from anthelmintics e g albendazole caffeine cocaine and nicotine including four i e 1 methylxanthine paraxanthine albendazole sulfoxide and albendazole 2 aminosulfone that co occurred with their parent compounds nineteen remaining cluster c omps were seven pesticides i e neonicotinoids 2 4 d carbaryl carbendazim and diuron that are widely applied in urban and agricultural settings eight industrial additives such as tire derived chemicals e g 1 3 diphenylguanidine caprolactam n cyclohexyl n methylcyclohexanamine n cyclohexyl n phenylurea insect repellents i e deet icaridin and ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate and benzophenone eleven cluster c omps i e caffeine methamphetamine theophylline cotinine acetamiprid imidacloprid 2 4 d diuron 1 3 diphenylguanidine methyl 1h benzotriazole and deet featured a comparatively high detection frequency i e 73 9 and occurred at median concentrations varying over an order of magnitude i e 23 1510 ng l five of these omps i e caffeine acetamiprid imidacloprid 2 4 d and deet occurred in all sample matrices whereas the remaining six omps were not detected in groundwater samples other less frequently detected cluster c omps occurred in wastewater and drainage channel water samples over a narrower range of median concentrations such heterogenous occurrence patterns further support the hypothesis that a large portion of omps enters the aquatic environment of kampala from mixed sources such as wastewater discharges urban development and agricultural activities 3 2 comparative evaluation of omp occurrence in kampala and ssa over the past decade the environmental occurrence data of omps have become increasingly available for ssa countries including those historically underrepresented in omp research k oreje et al 2020 wilkinson et al 2022 to place results from this work in the context of existing literature the geometric mean concentrations of omps quantified in kampala samples were evaluated against data curated from prior studies reporting omp occurrence in ssa wastewater surface waters and groundwater only data from studies that quantified omp concentrations in aquatic matrices using liquid or gas chromatography mass spectrometry were selected for comparison studies that extracted sludge sediment or biota samples deployed passive sampling devices or applied non mass spectrometric methods for omp analysis were excluded from further consideration with these criteria the mean concentrations of omps reported by 68 studies published up to march 2022 were compiled resulting in a total of 1912 data entries table s11 to our knowledge this is by far the most comprehensive omp occurrence database ever assembled for aquatic samples from ssa seven of these 68 studies reported omp concentrations in ugandan samples while the remaining collected data from 23 other ssa countries together these 68 studies documented the occurrence of 349 unique omps in various types of environmental water samples e g wastewater influent and effluent river and stream water lake and reservoir water estuarine and coastal water groundwater and drinking water from ssa among which 91 were also detected in samples from kampala and the ugandan waters of lake victoria arinaitwe et al 2021 dalahmeh et al 2020 dalahmeh et al 2018 nantaba et al 2020 2021 twinomucunguzi et al 2021 over 90 of the data entries were mean concentrations reported for wastewater and surface waters figure s5 suggesting that the occurrence of omps in ssa groundwater only received limited attention comparing the spectrum of omps quantified in this work to those reported in previous studies reveals that 69 of the 157 omps i e 42 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical tps 15 pesticides and pesticide tps 9 industrial additives and 3 household chemicals have never been quantified in environmental water samples from ssa some of these omps have been widely e g oxcarbazepine isoproturon sucralose benzothiazole melamine methyl 1h benzotriazole or increasingly e g tire derived chemicals detected in wide scope screening studies conducted on other continents angeles et al 2021 carpenter and helbling 2018 emadian et al 2021 fabregat safont et al 2021 peter et al 2018 whereas several are rarely studied compounds e g benazepril detomidine maprotiline albendazole sulfoxide albendazole 2 aminosulfone mebendazole amine with potentially high environmental relevance belew et al 2021 petrovic 2014 sixty one additional omps i e 39 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical tps 18 pesticides and pesticide tps 2 industrial additives and 2 household chemicals have been detected at least once in other regions of ssa but not in uganda on average the cumulative concentration of omps never quantified in ugandan and or ssa studies constituted 20 71 of σ omps measured in kampala wastewater surface water and groundwater samples again demonstrating the added value of suspect screening for capturing less frequently detected or previously overlooked omps of the 157 omps quantified in kampala samples 51 68 and 11 overlapped with those previously detected in ssa wastewater surface water and groundwater samples respectively fig 3 many of the overlapping omps occurred in kampala samples at concentrations similar to those found in prior studies for example the geometric mean concentrations of 30 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical tps i e from 31 ng l for lamotrigine to 6820 ng l for sulfamethoxazole benzotriazole i e 649 ng l and propylparaben i e 3840 ng l detected in 100 kampala wastewater samples fell within the mean concentration ranges multiple t tests p 0 537 0 591 of these 32 omps measured in ssa wastewater i e 25 6150 ng l likewise the geometric mean concentrations of 12 pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical tps i e from 24 ng l for lidocaine to 1650 ng l for caffeine 2 4 d i e 240 ng l acetamiprid i e 68 ng l and 3 phthalates i e 43 1380 ng l detected in 100 drainage channel and nearshore lake water samples from kampala also overlapped with the mean concentration ranges of these 17 omps reported for ssa surface waters i e 10 1980 ng l lastly the geometric mean concentrations of carbamazepine i e 26 ng l and sulfamethoxazole i e 60 ng l the two omps detected in 100 kampala groundwater samples were not statistically different multiple t tests p 0 537 0 591 from the mean concentrations observed in ssa groundwater i e 18 42 ng l considering the spatiotemporal extent of studies compiled for evaluation the similarity in concentration ranges indicates some consistency in omp recurrence patterns throughout the aquatic environment of ssa of the remaining overlapping omps detected in 100 kampala samples several occurred at concentrations above those measured in similar ssa sample matrices while others occurred at lower levels for example the geometric mean concentrations of medroxyprogesterone i e 42 ng l and sulfapyridine i e 247 ng l in kampala wastewater samples far exceeded the mean concentrations measured in ssa wastewater i e 3 5 ng l however the geometric mean concentrations of emtricitabine i e 543 ng l lopinavir i e 194 ng l and sulfamethazine i e 51 ng l were at least one order of magnitude lower than the mean concentrations detected in ssa wastewater i e 1080 33 500 ng l furthermore the geometric mean concentrations of deet i e 411 ng l and propylparaben i e 810 ng l in kampala surface water samples were substantially higher than those reported for ssa surface waters i e 20 77 ng l whereas the geometric mean concentration of tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate i e 40 ng l was 10 times lower than the mean concentration observed in ssa surface waters i e 419 ng l such heterogeneous profiles reflect the mixture complexity of omps across regions and reinforce the necessity of establishing statistically robust baseline levels to support adaptive omp monitoring in ssa 3 3 water quality variables as predictors for omp occurrence measuring water quality parameters provides complementary metrics for assessing site specific omp contamination status at the time of sample collection for example previous work characterizing the spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals in the ugandan waters of lake victoria observed strong associations between pharmaceutical levels and water quality indicators such as turbidity nantaba et al 2021 to evaluate the strength of water quality variables for predicting omp occurrence in kampala samples plsr analysis was performed using the sample specific cumulative concentrations of cluster a b and c omps i e σ omps cluster a σ omps cluster b and σ omps cluster c as the response variables and 11 physicochemical and optical properties of water samples as the predictor variables overall the strength of explained variation i e 95 4 1 9 and the goodness of cross validated prediction i e 92 9 2 9 for the plsr model were high suggesting that the predictor variables adequately captured the inter sample variability in σ omps on the basis of the variable importance in the projection scores figure s6 the concentration of nitrate i e no3 and the maximum fluorescence intensity of a protein like fluorescent organic matter component i e c4 with excitation emission maxima around 280 330 nm figures s3 s4 commonly present in wastewater or wastewater impacted aquatic systems hudson et al 2007 were ranked as the two variables with the highest explanatory power recognizing the multicollinearity among predictor variables stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was further performed to identify the most parsimonious models for predicting σ omps specifically no3 and c4 were single variables that could effectively predict σ omps cluster a and σ omps cluster b respectively whereas c4 and no3 served as the best combination of predictors for σ omps cluster c fig 4 furthermore the inclusion of additional predictor variables for σ omps did not significantly improve model consistency with measured data the fact that c4 emerged as a strong predictor for σ omps cluster b and σ omps cluster c reaffirms the vulnerability of kampala surface waters and groundwater to omp contamination associated with wastewater inputs interestingly an earlier study assessing the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the nairobi river catchment in kenya also attributed elevated pharmaceutical concentrations in surface waters to wastewater influence based on the concurrent measurements of protein like organic matter content using fluorescence spectroscopy although no direct quantitative relationships were identified bagnis et al 2020 on the other hand nitrate has long been viewed as a continental scale diffuse source contaminant in africa with a high potential to pollute surface waters and infiltrate shallow groundwater lapworth et al 2017 ouedraogo and vanclooster 2016 thus the strong correlation between σ omps cluster a and no3 implies that the prevalence of omps in kampala surface waters and groundwater was also linked to upstream diffuse pollution such as those originating from urban and agricultural sources together these analyses constitute compelling additional support for the hypothesized importance of wastewater discharges and diffuse runoff as drivers for omp entry into the aquatic environment of kampala 3 4 potential for biological effects associated with omps two screening level risk assessments were performed in parallel to gain exploratory insights into possible ecologically relevant effects of omps measured in kampala samples on aquatic life to this end the ear approach was implemented to screen for the potential for in vitro vertebrate centric sublethal effects associated with single omps or omp mixtures based on exposure response metrics derived from molecular bioassay endpoints blackwell et al 2017 of the 157 omps 136 including their free and salt forms had matched entries in the toxcast high throughput screening database u s environmental protection agency s center for computational toxicology and exposure 2021 twelve of these omps had a median ear above the precautionary effects screening threshold of 0 001 corsi et al 2019 under mean exposure conditions five cluster b omps i e carbamazepine propylparaben benzothiazole fluconazole and griseofulvin and 7 cluster c omps i e caffeine 2 4 d 1 3 diphenylguanidine diuron theophylline deet and carbaryl showed a threshold exceedance in over 50 of the samples carbamazepine featured the highest frequency of exceedance i e 100 followed by caffeine i e 92 2 4 d i e 83 and propylparaben i e 80 respectively consistent with the pattern observed for σ omps the median σears for wastewater and drainage channel water samples i e 43 4 and 21 9 respectively were two orders of magnitude higher than those for nearshore lake water and groundwater samples i e 0 06 and 0 02 respectively figure s7 two contraceptives i e levonorgestrel and medroxyprogesterone carbamazepine caffeine 2 4 d and propylparaben constituted the mixture of omps that dominated σears i e 90 11 but the relative contribution of individual omps to σears varied across sample matrices for example levonorgestrel alone contributed to 94 2 of σears for wastewater samples whereas levonorgestrel caffeine medroxyprogesterone and carbamazepine collectively explained 88 18 of σears for drainage channel water samples carbamazepine caffeine 2 4 d and propylparaben jointly accounted for 84 14 of σears for lake water and groundwater samples with carbamazepine serving as the top contributing compound in the mixture of omps to complement ear screening pafs and mspafs were calculated to assess the potential for in vivo lethal effects on aquatic species assemblages associated with single omps or omp mixtures based on log normal species sensitivity distributions constructed from acute ec50 data posthuma et al 2019 of the 157 omps quantified in kampala samples 125 had full species sensitivity distribution data available posthuma et al 2019 but only 1 cluster b omp i e sulfamethoxazole and 2 cluster c omps i e acetamiprid and imidacloprid had a median paf of above 0 1 indicating low predicted acute toxic pressure posed by individual omps like σears the median mspafs for wastewater and drainage channel water samples i e 4 6 and 3 8 respectively were higher than those for nearshore lake water and groundwater samples i e 0 84 and 0 01 respectively figure s8 although the dominating mixture of omps for mspafs did not overlap with that for σears notably 40 of wastewater and drainage channel water samples featured high mspafs i e 5 3 30 6 that exceeded the generally accepted effect threshold of 5 smetanová et al 2014 suggesting that over 5 of the sensitive aquatic species at sites could potentially be affected by exposure to the mixture of omps together with norepinephrine and dichlorvos sulfamethoxazole and two neonicotinoids i e acetamiprid and imidacloprid explained 84 11 of mspafs for wastewater and drainage channel water samples sulfamethoxazole and the two neonicotinoids also accounted for 99 1 and 88 33 of mspafs for lake water and groundwater samples respectively further underlining their role as potential drivers for the acute toxic pressure posed by the mixture of omps on average the fractional contribution of σears and mspafs for omps never quantified in environmental water samples from uganda or ssa to those calculated for omps quantified in kampala samples ranged from 1 to 99 and 1 to 88 respectively thus restricting the calculations of σears and mspafs for only omps reported in prior work may lead to varying degrees of bias in both indices particularly when assessing wastewater and drainage channel water samples fig 5 taken together the ear and the mspaf calculations provide qualitative evidence for probabilities of sublethal and acutely toxic effects associated with both frequently detected e g carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole imidacloprid and less targeted omps e g levonorgestrel norepinephrine dichlorvos which underscores the benefit of applying suspect screening to improve risk based prioritization of omps 4 conclusions our study combines lc hrms based suspect screening with multivariate analysis to comprehensively characterize the occurrence patterns of omps and accompanying potential for biological effects in the aquatic environment of kampala an urban center in ssa our suspect screening approach prioritized and confirmed 157 omps including 24 tps in various water samples collected from kampala many of these omps have never or rarely been investigated in environmental water samples from ssa most omps occurred in kampala samples at concentrations broadly comparable to the ranges reported in prior ssa studies while others occurred at levels substantially higher or lower than those measured in similar ssa sample matrices highlighting commonalities and differences in omp occurrence patterns and the need for concerted omp monitoring in ssa moreover the omp concentration database compiled for ssa including data from this work can facilitate quantitative comparisons of omp levels in aquatic systems across continents when supplemented with relevant datasets our multivariate analysis established the co occurrence profiles of major omp clusters and identified the concentration of nitrate and the abundance of a wastewater derived fluorescent organic matter component as two strong predictors for the sample specific cumulative concentration of omps which pointed to wastewater discharges and diffuse runoff as potentially important drivers of omp prevalence in the aquatic environment of kampala measurements of these two water quality parameters can be adapted in resource limited settings for inference of omp contamination status but should not be misconstrued as a substitute for omp analysis lastly our screening level calculations of ears and mspafs supported risk based prioritization of omp mixtures exhibiting heightened potential for vertebrate centric molecular effects and acute toxic pressure however no direct extrapolations of these values to ecologically relevant effects on sensitive aquatic species can be made in that the chemical space investigated in this work was limited to polar and semi polar omps amenable to our spe lc hrms method our work is inherently restricted to grab sampling with low spatiotemporal resolution in one ssa urban center due to logistical constraints but it offers a promising methodological framework for addressing data gaps required for the regional impact assessment of omps in other similar settings we envision growing applications of complementary sampling e g automated or passive sampling screening e g nontarget screening and biomonitoring techniques to guide data driven omp monitoring and evidence based ecotoxicological studies in ssa through

15873,microbiologically influenced corrosion mic constantly occurs in water wastewater systems especially in marine water mic contributes to billions of dollars in damage to marine industry each year yet the physiological mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood pseudomonas aeruginosa is a representative marine electro active bacterium which has been confirmed to cause severe mic on carbon steel through extracellular electron transfer eet however little is known about how p aeruginosa causes corrosion on stainless steel in this study the corrosivity of wild type strain phzh knockout phzh complemented and phzh overexpression p aeruginosa mutants were evaluated to explore the underlying mic mechanism we found the accelerated mic on 2205 duplex stainless steel dss was due to the secretion of phenazine 1 carboxamide pcn which was regulated by the phzh gene surface analysis mott schottky test and h2o2 measurement results showed that pcn damaged the passive film by forming h2o2 to oxidize chromium oxide to soluble hexavalent chromium leading to more severe pitting corrosion the normalized corrosion rate per cell followed the same order as the general corrosion rate obtained under each experimental condition eliminating the influence of the total amount of sessile cells on corrosion these findings provide new insight and are meaningful for the investigation of mic mechanisms on stainless steel the understanding of mic can improve the sustainability and resilience of infrastructure leading to huge environmental and economic benefits graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbiologically influenced corrosion pseudomonas aeruginosa phenazine 1 carboxamide pcn passive film duplex stainless steel dss 1 introduction the ocean accounts for about 71 of the earth s total area and is extremely rich in resources li and ning 2019 the development and utilization of the ocean are essential to the society stainless steel is one type of the most widely used materials in the marine industry however stainless steel materials suffer from serious corrosion due to the harsh marine environment especially with the presence of various corrosive microorganisms microbiologically influenced corrosion mic caused by corrosive marine microorganisms lead to the economic loss of billions of dollars each year lekbach et al 2021 ma et al 2020 the extracellular electron transfer eet between electro active microorganisms and metal surface has been reported to play a critical role in mic blackwood 2018 palacios et al 2019 philips et al 2018 shi et al 2016 tang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 commonly eet mic can be categorized into direct electron transfer mic det mic and mediated electron transfer mic met mic gu et al 2019 jia et al 2019 li et al 2018 the det can be performed via the outer membrane proteins such as a c type cytochrome and conductive pilus holmes et al 2019 reguera et al 2005 tang et al 2019 whereas met relies on self excreted molecules that function as diffusive electron shuttles jin et al 2019 turick et al 2002 canstein et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 in both det mic and met mic the formation of biofilms on the metal surface is the critical step for their occurrence liu et al 2000 xu et al 2017 when electroactive biofilms formed on metallic surfaces sessile cells located in the bottom layers can uptake electrons from fe 0 for their metabolism gu et al 2015 gu et al 2009 2014 demonstrated that biofilms under severe carbon starvation conditions induced remarkably higher corrosion of metals compared to biofilms under moderate carbon starvation conditions jia et al 2017b verified that pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm contributed to mic on carbon steel under a carbon starvation environment as they reported fe 0 was the only electron donor and p aeruginosa biofilm could only receive electrons from fe 0 and transport them through the cell wall to the cytoplasm of sessile cells and finally catalyze nitrate reduction this type of eet process which biofilms can take electrons from a metal is also called inward eet tang et al 2019 gong et al 2020 p aeruginosa a typical marine electroactive strain carries several genes encoding various electron meditators such as pyocyanin pyo and phenazine 1 carboxamide pcn huang et al 2020 p aeruginosa has been confirmed to be corrosive on stainless steel carbon steel and nickel copper alloys however the fundamental mechanism for corrosion is still unclear jia et al 2017a li et al 2016 san et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 to design effective corrosion protection and prevention strategies it is essential to study the mic mechanism of p aeruginosa especially explore the inward eet between bacteria and the material huang et al 2020 proved that the phzm and phzs genes regulated the production of electron mediator pyo and then influenced eet mic of carbon steel our previous short communication paper found that phzh the encoding gene for pcn production possibly regulated inward eet mic huang et al 2018 however these papers just showed that there was a correlation between electron meditators and mic there is no solid evidence to clarify how p aeruginosa destroys the passive film of stainless steel leading to inward eet mic besides the biofilm forming ability of different bacterial strains on metal surfaces especially the genetic engineered mutants are neglected which may also influence the corrosivity of the biofilm all these problems need proper genetic mutants to clarify the underlying mic mechanism of stainless steels stainless steel can form a protective oxide film to prevent corrosion little is known about how p aeruginosa destroys the passive film of stainless steel and then causes inward eet mic li et al found that s oneidensis could get electrons from fe 0 and transfer electrons to iron oxide in the passive film and the elemental cr in stainless steel may not directly participate in this eet reaction li et al 2021a however it is unknown whether bacteria can destroy the cr rich inner layer like cr2o3 in the passivation film 2205 dss is a commonly used material in marine environment because of its excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical properties this study aims to delineate the role of the endogenous electron mediator pcn regulated by phzh gene in p aeruginosa on mic of stainless steel in marine water through systematically investigating the corrosion behavior of different genetic mutants including phzh knockout phzh phzh complemented phzh comp and phzh overexpression phzh over strains after the genetic modification their abilities to form biofilms were also analyzed moreover interdisciplinary approaches including electrochemical methods and surface analysis techniques were used to elucidate the mechanism of eet mic on 2205 duplex stainless steel dss by p aeruginosa 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of materials the marine p aeruginosa mccc 1a00099 bought from the marine culture of china mccc xiamen china was used as wild type wt strain in this work the p aeruginosa mutants with phzh knockout phzh and phzh complemented phzh comp were constructed followed by previous report huang et al 2018 the phzh overexpression mutant strain phzh over was constructed by transforming the shuttle plasmid pherd20t containing the entire phzh operon into the wt strain to increase the phzh gene expression in the wt strain finally the δphzh phzh comp and phzh over mutants were confirmed by colony pcr and sequencing the antibiotics with carbenicillin 300 μg ml and ampicillin 100 μg ml were added in the phzh comp and phzh over mutants during all tests carbenicillin 300 μg ml was added to select p aeruginosa single recombinants merodiploid contained the intact phzh and the deleted operons while solution with ampicillin 100 μg ml was used to maintain the shuttle plasmid pherd20t containing the entire phzh operon in the phzh complemented and phzh overexpression mutants the coupons 2205

121 c for 15 min before using all the initial inoculation concentrations of p aeruginosa strains including wt phzh phzh comp and phzh over mutants were controlled at approximately 106 cells ml after 14 days of immersion at 30 c the field emission scanning electron microscope fesem ultra plus zeiss jena germany and confocal laser scanning microscope clsm c2 plus nikon tokyo japan were used to observe biofilm morphologies distribution thickness and bacterial viability on the 2205 dss coupon surfaces in laboratory scale mic test 14 days is always a choice to balance the duration and maintenance of microbes guo et al 2022 kalnaowakul et al 2020 li et al 2021a qin et al 2022 prior to fesem observation all coupons were taken out and rinsed gently with phosphate buffer saline pbs solution then the biofilms were fixed with 2 5 v v glutaric dialdehyde for 8 h followed by a series of ethanol solutions 50 70 90 95 100 by volume for 10 min each before clsm observation a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen eugene or usa was used to dye the adherent sessile bacteria in a dark room then the 3d scanning mode was used to measure the biofilm thickness and sessile cells attached to the coupon surfaces were counted by imagej software national institutes of health bethesda md usa xia et al 2015 for each test three parallel coupons were measured to further determine whether these strains caused pitting corrosion the surface morphologies of 2205 dss coupons were imaged with clsm after removing biofilms and corrosion products a confocal laser scanning microscope lsm 710 zeiss jena germany was used to measure pit depths on 2205 dss coupon surface after 14 days of immersion the maximum and average pit depths were counted from totally ten random regions with the area of 0 1 mm2 on three coupons a field of view with the size of 624 7 µm 501 2 µm was chosen to observe the number of pits totally ten random regions of each tested environment were examined on three coupons to investigate the corrosion influence of different strains on the structure of passivation film an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo vg scientific ma usa was performed with a monochromatic al k α x ray c 1 s peak at 284 6 ev was used to correct the charge shifts all tests were conducted three times to guarantee the reproducibility 2 3 electrochemical tests a gamry electrochemical workstation reference 600 gamry instruments pa usa was used to measure the mic behavior of each p aeruginosa strain the traditional three electrode system containing the working electrode 2205 dss coupons the counter electrode platinum sheet and the reference electrode saturated calomel electrode was performed as reported previously zhao et al 2018 open circuit potential ocp linear polarization resistance lpr electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and potentiodynamic polarization curves were conducted in sequence daily the potential of lpr measurement was swept from 15 mv to 15 mv vs e ocp with a scan rate of 0 125 mv s eis was performed at a frequency from 105 hz to 10 2 hz by an ac voltage signal of 5 mv at the e ocp the zsimpwin software was used to fit appropriate equivalent circuits ecs at the end of the 14th day the potentiodynamic polarization curves were measured with a constant scan rate of 0 166 mv s the mott schottky tests after the coupons immersion in the sterile medium and various bacteria containing media for 14 days were also conducted by the applied potentials from 200 mv to 600 mv vs sce each electrochemical test was repeated at least three times and three coupons were tested simultaneously each time 2 4 quantification of phenazine 1 carboxamide hexavalent chromium and h2o2 pcn produced by each strain was measured by high performance liquid chromatography ultimate 3000 thermo scientific ma usa cultures were filtered with membrane filters with a pore size of 0 22 μm and then an equal volume of chloroform was used to extract pcn after concentration and evaporation the residue was dissolved in acetonitrile and determined by a reverse phase column c18 bonna agela technologies tianjin china acetonitrile solvent a and 25 mm ammonium acetate solvent b were used as the mobile phase pcn was separated with a linear gradient at a flow rate of 350 μl min using the following method 8 acetonitrile for 2 min followed by a linear gradient to 100 solvent b for 25 min and finally a linear gradient to 0 solvent b for 15 min the concentrations of hexavalent chromium after 14 days of immersion with and without strains were also measured by using diphenylcarbazide spectrophotometric method zhou et al 2018 h2o2 concentrations underneath the biofilms and in the bulk were obtained by using a h2o2 quantitative assay kit sangon biotech shanghai china the coupons after 14 days of immersion in the inoculated medium and 1 ml inoculated culture medium were added into 5 ml centrifuge tubes and then shaken by a vortex mixer the measurement of h2o2 concentrations was according to the manufacturer s instructions all tests were repeated thrice 3 results 3 1 characterization of biofilm and pitting morphology to evaluate if phzh gene of p aeruginosa affects the bacterial biofilm forming activity we first observed the adhesion morphologies of wild type wt p aeruginosa and its three mutants phzh phzh comp and phzh over mutants on 2205 dss coupon surfaces of aerobic incubation in 2216e culture medium at 30 c after 14 days through the observation via fesem fig 1 a d and clsm fig 1e h we found that the sessile cells of wt strain formed a dense biofilm fig 1a and 1e the maximum wt biofilm thickness reached 75 0 μm and the average standard deviation sd biofilm thickness was 71 0 2 9 μm fig 2 a and b however the biofilm formed by phzh mutant was not as uniform as the wt and the maximum thickness reduced to 61 2 μm and the average sd thickness reduced to 52 8 7 7 μm after complementing or overexpressing the phzh gene the average sd biofilm thicknesses of phzh comp and phzh over mutants were 62 4 4 7 μm and 76 5 5 6 μm respectively the total sessile cell number of phzh mutant on the whole coupon was approximately 36 7 1 8 106 cells which was less than that of the wt 62 6 3 0 106 cells the phzh comp 56 4 11 9 106 cells and the phzh over 67 6 2 7 106 cells strains fig 2b the coupon surface morphology prior to corrosion test was shown in fig 3 a there was almost no observable pit on the coupon surface fig 3b f shows the maximum depths of pits on 2205 dss coupon surfaces after 14 days of immersion fig 3g shows the box chart of pit depths which were obtained by counting ten deepest pits from ten different fields as the abiotic control the 2205 dss surfaces were relatively smooth with the deepest pit of only 2 6 μm fig 3b and the average sd pit depth of 1 9 0 5 μm fig 3g the wt strain and phzh comp mutant accelerated pitting corrosion and the average pit depths reached 3 7 0 7 μm and 3 3 0 8 μm respectively fig 3g the mutant with phzh overexpression led to the deepest pits 4 2 1 1 μm among all strains tested while phzh mutant caused the smallest pits 2 1 0 7 μm fig 3h shows the total number of pits on each coupon which was estimated based on 10 randomly chosen fields one of which was shown in supplementary fig s1 the phzh over mutant produced the largest number of pits which could be up to 2981 753 pits on each coupon 10 mm 10 mm there were 2555 522 and 2023 543 pits for wt strain and phzh comp mutant respectively the number of pits was greatly reduced in the presence of phzh mutant 1331 429 which was just slightly higher than the abiotic control 1065 439 3 2 electrochemical measurements eis is a powerful tool to evaluate the electrode interface structure and dynamics information from the bode diagrams as shown in supplementary fig s2a e the impedance value in the low frequency region significantly decreased with the presence of wt strain phzh comp mutant and phzh over mutant indicating the increased corrosion rate the phase angle of these strains changed from one peak to at least two peaks supplementary fig s2b d e while the phase angle change of phzh mutant during 7 days of immersion supplementary fig s2c was not obvious the nyquist diagrams also showed that the order of impedance was phzh over wt phzh comp phzh abiotic one supplementary fig s2a e supplementary fig s3 shows two different electrical circuit models to fit the abiotic and biotic eis data according to the fitting results the reciprocal of charge transfer resistance 1 r ct on day one five ten and fourteen are shown in fig 4 a representing the ability to promote electron transfer between the biofilm and the coupon surface zhou et al 2018 over the entire exposure period the order of 1 r ct was phzh over wt phzh comp phzh abiotic one lpr is another classical electrochemical measurement with a fast response which is suitable for monitoring the corrosion environment where corrosion rates may change rapidly kannan et al 2018 fig 4b shows the variation of the reciprocal polarization resistance 1 r p values representing the instantaneous corrosion rate of 2205 dss within 14 days of immersion the surface electrochemical reaction of the coupons in the media containing abiotic and phzh mutant changed slightly while the other strains varied continuously due to the adhesion of biofilms after soaking for 14 days 1 r p of the abiotic control was the lowest with the value of 0 5 0 1 μs cm 2 when inoculating with wt strain 1 r p value increased by one order of magnitude to 3 7 0 2 μs cm 2 indicating that 2205 dss coupon was not resistant to mic by p aeruginosa after the deletion of phzh gene 1 r p value decreased significantly to 1 0 0 1 μs cm 2 which was slightly higher than the value measured in the abiotic environment indicating that the deletion of phzh gene could inhibit mic in addition in the biotic solution with phzh gene reconstructed mutant 1 r p value reached 2 0 0 5 μs cm 2 confirming the vital role of phzh in the mic process for the phzh gene overexpressed mutant 1 r p value reached 4 2 0 2 μs cm 2 even higher than wt strain demonstrating that enhanced corrosivity by overexpression of phzh gene the r p data supported the r ct data in addition potentiodynamic polarization curves were also measured to obtain the corrosion potential e corr corrosion current density i corr and pitting potential e pit as shown in fig 4c we found that e corr shifted negatively and i corr moved to higher values in the presence of wt strain by tafel fitting analysis the corresponding electrochemical parameters i corr and e corr were obtained and shown in fig 5 a we found that i corr of wt strain reached 137 4 na cm 2 which was approximately twice more than that of the abiotic control 59 4 na cm 2 suggesting the accelerated corrosion however the deletion of phzh gene reduced the corrosivity of p aeruginosa as i corr value reduced to 71 3 na cm 2 after reconstructing the phzh gene the i corr 121 18 na cm 2 recovered to the wt level the i corr value of phzh over mutant was triple more than that of the abiotic control and reached 189 20 na cm 2 indicating the enhanced corrosivity the variations of e pit were not significant among the tested strains which might be related to the excellent pitting corrosion resistance of 2205 dss coupon supplementary table s1 as shown in fig 2b while wt strain and mutants with phzh knockout phzh complemented and phzh overexpression differed significantly in corrosion rate sessile cell counts cells cm2 were also different thus the number of sessile cells must be taken into account when assessing the ability for eet mic therefore 1 r ct 1 r p and i corr values were normalized against the number of sessile cells on the working electrode coupon surface 1 cm2 surface as observed in fig 5b the normalized values did not alter the trends for 1 r ct 1 r p and i corr eliminating the possibility that enhanced eet ability was due to increased sessile cell coverage on the working electrode 3 3 analysis of corrosion products the corrosion products were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps after 14 days of immersion fig 6 shows the cr 2p3 2 core level spectra of the coupon surface the binding energy be values and corresponding compounds of cr 2p3 2 peaks are shown in supplementary table s2 after incubation with phzh mutant cr 2p3 2 spectrum was divided into two peaks similar as the abiotic one the binding energies were 574 4 and 576 8 ev corresponding to cr and cr2o3 however the corrosion products changed while the coupons were incubated with wt strain and phzh comp mutant the main components of the corrosion products were cr cr2o3 and cro3 and the binding energies were 574 4 576 8 and 578 9 ev respectively after incubation with phzh overexpression mutant the main components of the product layer were cr cr2o3 cro3 and crn and the binding energies were 574 4 576 8 578 9 and 575 6 ev respectively fig 6f shows the relative abundance of each component in the corrosion products compared with the sterile control the percentage of cr2o3 decreased and the percentage of cro3 increased in the presence of wt phzh comp and phzh over mutants indicating that the passive film was possibly thinned and destroyed while the components of the passive film in the presence of phzh mutant were almost unchanged to further estimate the influence of different strains on the passive film of 2205 dss mott schottky tests were conducted to detect the semiconducting property of the passive film generally the passive film formed on stainless steel contained outer n type semiconductive iron oxides with positive slope and inner p type semiconductive chromium oxides with negative slope fig 7 a the inner p type semiconductive chromium oxides mainly cr2o3 were considered as the dominant factor to prevent corrosion li et al 2021a therefore to verify the change of corrosion products under different corrosion media fig 7 b shows the acceptor density n a and donor density n d by fitting the curves in fig 7 a obviously the defect density of the passive film with the presence of wt strain was higher than the sterile control indicating that the film of chromium oxides and iron oxides were damaged when inoculated with phzh mutant the defect density decreased indicating a more integrated passive film than the presence of wt when phzh gene of p aeruginosa was complemented or overexpressed the passive film especially chromium oxides became more flawed 3 4 detection of hexavalent chromium pcn and h2o2 fig 8 a shows the released cr6 concentrations after 14 days of immersion in different solutions it was noted that the released cr6 concentration in the abiotic medium is below the detection limit i e less than 0 05 mg l with the presence of strains more cr6 concentration was released the order of the cr6 concentrations were phzh over wt phzh comp phzh abiotic one the result was consistent with pcn concentrations secreted by each strain fig 8 b fig 8 c shows the contents of h2o2 underneath the biofilms after 14 days of immersion in different solutions the rank order of h2o2 concentrations also corresponded to the concentrations of cr6 and pcn the h2o2 concentration in the inoculated bulk medium was under the detection limit 1 100 μm 4 discussion marine p aeruginosa has been previously proved to regulate mic on various metal materials jia et al 2017a li et al 2016 saleem khan et al 2019 xia et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 more and more evidences indicated that the accelerated mic by p aeruginosa was dominant by eet rounts huang et al 2020 2018 liu et al 2021 various phenazines including phenazine 1 carboxylate pca 1 oh phenazine 1 oh phz pyo and pcn were produced by p aeruginosa to act as electron meditators among them pcn and pyo could bind extracellular dna underneath the biofilm facilitating electronic exchange saunders et al 2020 many studies indicated that the secreted phenazine concentration would affect biofilm formation ramos et al 2010 as shown in our tests the phzh overexpression mutant produced more pcn fig 8 b leading to a denser biofilm and more sessile bacteria attached to the 2205 dss coupon surface fig 1 it should be noted that the decreased sessile cell number of phzh mutant was not due to the addition of antibiotics as the antibiotics were only used for selection of the phzh comp and phzh over mutants meanwhile the antibiotics showed little side effect on the biofilm formation of the phzh comp and phzh over mutants it was also observed that the largest pitting depth of 2205 dss coupon was caused by phzh overexpression mutant the wt strain and phzh complemented mutant were the second and third following by the phzh knockout mutant and abiotic one fig 3 electrochemical test results in supplementary fig s3 and fig 4 also showed the same trend ph measurements showed that all the biotic media after 14 days reached 8 2 supplementary fig s4 indicating that the organic or inorganic acids should not be the culprit of corrosion in order to confirm the enhanced mic was due to increased eet ability of the cell rather than the increased amount of biofilms the number of adherent sessile cells were used to obtain the normalized corrosion rate for assessing the eet ability of each strain we found that the order of the normalized corrosion rate did not change the corrosivity trend the normalized corrosion rate of each strain still followed the same order calculated by the 1 r ct 1 r p and i corr values which is phzh over wt phzh comp phzh the result demonstrated that the increased corrosion rate was due to the increased production of the eet mediator pcn rather than the number of bacterial sessile cells since the phzh gene regulates the production of pcn we confirmed its critical role in the eet mic caused by p aeruginosa the self excreted molecules by electrogenic microbes could be functioned as diffusive electron shuttles to uptake electrons from fe 0 or transfer electrons to iron oxide li et al 2021b however whether and how could these self excreted molecules destroy the passive film especially cr2o3 formed on 2205 dss was unknown to further study the influence of pcn secreted by p aeruginosa on mic the corrosion products were analyzed with xps as shown in fig 6 the hexavalent chromium was detected on 2205 dss coupon surfaces after immersion in the wt phzh comp and phzh over mutants containing culture medium while there was no cro3 detected under the abiotic and phzh knockout conditions the generated cro3 is easy to dissolve in the solution resulting in the chromium depleted zone of the passivation film antony et al 2010 yao et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 typically the corrosion resistance of stainless steel depends on the stability of the passive film which is related to the compactness of the chromium oxide layer mott schottky experiments further confirmed the change of passive film structures in the presence of different strains the intactness and quality of chromium oxide layer of 2205 dss coupon inoculated with phzh mutant was the best among three tested p aeruginosa mutant strains when phzh gene was overexpressed the chromium oxide layer became more defected than the wt fig 7 meanwhile the measurement of cr6 concentrations in the culture media also indicated that the abiotic medium would not oxidize cr3 to cr6 and the phzh mutant produced less cr6 in the solution fig 8 a the order of the corrosion ability is phzh over wt phzh comp phzh the abiotic medium which was consistent with their performance on damaging the passive film and pcn production venkataraman et al once reported that the phenazines secreted by p aeruginosa can transfer electrons to oxygen to form superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide hassett et al 1992 venkataraman et al 2010 confirming the possibility of the oxidation route from cr3 to cr6 in the presence of biofilm as shown in fig 8 b phzh gene regulated pcn secretion which resulted in the change of h2o2 concentrations under different biofilms fig 8 c the result in this study seemed that trivalent chromium was easier to be oxidized to hexavalent chromium underneath the biofilm with more secretion of pcn the mechanism of mic caused by p aeruginosa biofilm is shown in fig 9 the enzyme encoded by phzh gene was responsible for converting pca to pcn huang et al 2018 during the electron transport process the reduced pcn may transfer electrons to the oxygen and produce superoxide radical or hydrogen peroxide leading to the destruction of the passive film in the broken area of the passive film pcn might be more susceptible to obtain electrons from the iron matrix and we have already confirmed the increased amount of pcn secreted by p aeruginosa facilitated the eet and enhanced the mic thus we believe that pcn induced the damage of the passive film and make it easier to obtain electrons from the matrix and then caused more severe corrosion our findings demonstrated that pcn encoded by phzh was the important electron shuttle which regulated the eet mic process thus pcn can be a marker for mic detection and monitoring in addition to p aeruginosa pseudomonas chlororaphis pcl1391 can secret pcn serving as an electron shuttle to promote microbial mineral reduction phenazine can also be utilized by shewanella oneidensis mr1 to stimulate mineral reduction hernandez et al 2004 besides pcn produced by pseudomonas sp accelerated eet process of brevibacillus sp pth1 pham et al 2008 thus we suggest that phenazines like pcn can promote eet mic by microbial consortia in water seawater environments a measurable pcn concentration in a field scenario indicates a high potential risk of eet mic accelerated by pcn serving as a mic detection and monitoring marker and a sign for the application of antimicrobial strategies like biocide treatment 5 conclusion this study investigated mic behavior caused by electro active marine p aeruginosa and successfully elucidated the underlying eet mic pathway we have demonstrated that phzh gene of p aeruginosa could regulate pcn expression and then regulate the occurrence of mic a mutant strain with over producing pcn led to increased rates of mic by accelerating electron uptake from 2205 dss by biofilms conversely deleting the phzh gene in p aeruginosa resulted in decreased mic by comparing the normalized corrosion rate per cell we confirmed that the accelerated and decelerated mic was due to the increased or reduced eet ability of the biofilm rather than the increased sessile cell quantity on the metal surface the more pcn secreted the higher concentration of released cr6 and higher defect density of the passive film were observed these findings first prove that both pcn mediated eet and passivation film damage mechanisms are responsible for mic by p aeruginosa which provides new insights into the understanding of eet mic mechanism and guides the detection monitoring and mitigation of mic of industrial

15873,microbiologically influenced corrosion mic constantly occurs in water wastewater systems especially in marine water mic contributes to billions of dollars in damage to marine industry each year yet the physiological mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood pseudomonas aeruginosa is a representative marine electro active bacterium which has been confirmed to cause severe mic on carbon steel through extracellular electron transfer eet however little is known about how p aeruginosa causes corrosion on stainless steel in this study the corrosivity of wild type strain phzh knockout phzh complemented and phzh overexpression p aeruginosa mutants were evaluated to explore the underlying mic mechanism we found the accelerated mic on 2205 duplex stainless steel dss was due to the secretion of phenazine 1 carboxamide pcn which was regulated by the phzh gene surface analysis mott schottky test and h2o2 measurement results showed that pcn damaged the passive film by forming h2o2 to oxidize chromium oxide to soluble hexavalent chromium leading to more severe pitting corrosion the normalized corrosion rate per cell followed the same order as the general corrosion rate obtained under each experimental condition eliminating the influence of the total amount of sessile cells on corrosion these findings provide new insight and are meaningful for the investigation of mic mechanisms on stainless steel the understanding of mic can improve the sustainability and resilience of infrastructure leading to huge environmental and economic benefits graphical abstract

for about 71 of the earth s total area and is extremely rich in resources li and ning 2019 the development and utilization of the ocean are essential to the society stainless steel is one type of the most widely used materials in the marine industry however stainless steel materials suffer from serious corrosion due to the harsh marine environment especially with the presence of various corrosive microorganisms microbiologically influenced corrosion mic caused by corrosive marine microorganisms lead to the economic loss of billions of dollars each year lekbach et al 2021 ma et al 2020 the extracellular electron transfer eet between electro active microorganisms and metal surface has been reported to play a critical role in mic blackwood 2018 palacios et al 2019 philips et al 2018 shi et al 2016 tang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 commonly eet mic can be categorized into direct electron transfer mic det mic and mediated electron transfer mic met mic gu et al 2019 jia et al 2019 li et al 2018 the det can be performed via the outer membrane proteins such as a c type cytochrome and conductive pilus holmes et al 2019 reguera et al 2005 tang et al 2019 whereas met relies on self excreted molecules that function as diffusive electron shuttles jin et al 2019 turick et al 2002 canstein et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 in both det mic and met mic the formation of biofilms on the metal surface is the critical step for their occurrence liu et al 2000 xu et al 2017 when electroactive biofilms formed on metallic surfaces sessile cells located in the bottom layers can uptake electrons from fe 0 for their metabolism gu et al 2015 gu et al 2009 2014 demonstrated that biofilms under severe carbon starvation conditions induced remarkably higher corrosion of metals compared to biofilms under moderate carbon starvation conditions jia et al 2017b verified that pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm contributed to mic on carbon steel under a carbon starvation environment as they reported fe 0 was the only electron donor and p aeruginosa biofilm could only receive electrons from fe 0 and transport them through the cell wall to the cytoplasm of sessile cells and finally catalyze nitrate reduction this type of eet process which biofilms can take electrons from a metal is also called inward eet tang et al 2019 gong et al 2020 p aeruginosa a typical marine electroactive strain carries several genes encoding various electron meditators such as pyocyanin pyo and phenazine 1 carboxamide pcn huang et al 2020 p aeruginosa has been confirmed to be corrosive on stainless steel carbon steel and nickel copper alloys however the fundamental mechanism for corrosion is still unclear jia et al 2017a li et al 2016 san et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 to design effective corrosion protection and prevention strategies it is essential to study the mic mechanism of p aeruginosa especially explore the inward eet between bacteria and the material huang et al 2020 proved that the phzm and phzs genes regulated the production of electron mediator pyo and then influenced eet mic of carbon steel our previous short communication paper found that phzh the encoding gene for pcn production possibly regulated inward eet mic huang et al 2018 however these papers just showed that there was a correlation between electron meditators and mic there is no solid evidence to clarify how p aeruginosa destroys the passive film of stainless steel leading to inward eet mic besides the biofilm forming ability of different bacterial strains on metal surfaces especially the genetic engineered mutants are neglected which may also influence the corrosivity of the biofilm all these problems need proper genetic mutants to clarify the underlying mic mechanism of stainless steels stainless steel can form a protective oxide film to prevent corrosion little is known about how p aeruginosa destroys the passive film of stainless steel and then causes inward eet mic li et al found that s oneidensis could get electrons from fe 0 and transfer electrons to iron oxide in the passive film and the elemental cr in stainless steel may not directly participate in this eet reaction li et al 2021a however it is unknown whether bacteria can destroy the cr rich inner layer like cr2o3 in the passivation film 2205 dss is a commonly used material in marine environment because of its excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical properties this study aims to delineate the role of the endogenous electron mediator pcn regulated by phzh gene in p aeruginosa on mic of stainless steel in marine water through systematically investigating the corrosion behavior of different genetic mutants including phzh knockout phzh phzh complemented phzh comp and phzh overexpression phzh over strains after the genetic modification their abilities to form biofilms were also analyzed moreover interdisciplinary approaches including electrochemical methods and surface analysis techniques were used to elucidate the mechanism of eet mic on 2205 duplex stainless steel dss by p aeruginosa 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of materials the marine p aeruginosa mccc 1a00099 bought from the marine culture of china mccc xiamen china was used as wild type wt strain in this work the p aeruginosa mutants with phzh knockout phzh and phzh complemented phzh comp were constructed followed by previous report huang et al 2018 the phzh overexpression mutant strain phzh over was constructed by transforming the shuttle plasmid pherd20t containing the entire phzh operon into the wt strain to increase the phzh gene expression in the wt strain finally the δphzh phzh comp and phzh over mutants were confirmed by colony pcr and sequencing the antibiotics with carbenicillin 300 μg ml and ampicillin 100 μg ml were added in the phzh comp and phzh over mutants during all tests carbenicillin 300 μg ml was added to select p aeruginosa single recombinants merodiploid contained the intact phzh and the deleted operons while solution with ampicillin 100 μg ml was used to maintain the shuttle plasmid pherd20t containing the entire phzh operon in the phzh complemented and phzh overexpression mutants the coupons 2205

121 c for 15 min before using all the initial inoculation concentrations of p aeruginosa strains including wt phzh phzh comp and phzh over mutants were controlled at approximately 106 cells ml after 14 days of immersion at 30 c the field emission scanning electron microscope fesem ultra plus zeiss jena germany and confocal laser scanning microscope clsm c2 plus nikon tokyo japan were used to observe biofilm morphologies distribution thickness and bacterial viability on the 2205 dss coupon surfaces in laboratory scale mic test 14 days is always a choice to balance the duration and maintenance of microbes guo et al 2022 kalnaowakul et al 2020 li et al 2021a qin et al 2022 prior to fesem observation all coupons were taken out and rinsed gently with phosphate buffer saline pbs solution then the biofilms were fixed with 2 5 v v glutaric dialdehyde for 8 h followed by a series of ethanol solutions 50 70 90 95 100 by volume for 10 min each before clsm observation a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen eugene or usa was used to dye the adherent sessile bacteria in a dark room then the 3d scanning mode was used to measure the biofilm thickness and sessile cells attached to the coupon surfaces were counted by imagej software national institutes of health bethesda md usa xia et al 2015 for each test three parallel coupons were measured to further determine whether these strains caused pitting corrosion the surface morphologies of 2205 dss coupons were imaged with clsm after removing biofilms and corrosion products a confocal laser scanning microscope lsm 710 zeiss jena germany was used to measure pit depths on 2205 dss coupon surface after 14 days of immersion the maximum and average pit depths were counted from totally ten random regions with the area of 0 1 mm2 on three coupons a field of view with the size of 624 7 µm 501 2 µm was chosen to observe the number of pits totally ten random regions of each tested environment were examined on three coupons to investigate the corrosion influence of different strains on the structure of passivation film an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo vg scientific ma usa was performed with a monochromatic al k α x ray c 1 s peak at 284 6 ev was used to correct the charge shifts all tests were conducted three times to guarantee the reproducibility 2 3 electrochemical tests a gamry electrochemical workstation reference 600 gamry instruments pa usa was used to measure the mic behavior of each p aeruginosa strain the traditional three electrode system containing the working electrode 2205 dss coupons the counter electrode platinum sheet and the reference electrode saturated calomel electrode was performed as reported previously zhao et al 2018 open circuit potential ocp linear polarization resistance lpr electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and potentiodynamic polarization curves were conducted in sequence daily the potential of lpr measurement was swept from 15 mv to 15 mv vs e ocp with a scan rate of 0 125 mv s eis was performed at a frequency from 105 hz to 10 2 hz by an ac voltage signal of 5 mv at the e ocp the zsimpwin software was used to fit appropriate equivalent circuits ecs at the end of the 14th day the potentiodynamic polarization curves were measured with a constant scan rate of 0 166 mv s the mott schottky tests after the coupons immersion in the sterile medium and various bacteria containing media for 14 days were also conducted by the applied potentials from 200 mv to 600 mv vs sce each electrochemical test was repeated at least three times and three coupons were tested simultaneously each time 2 4 quantification of phenazine 1 carboxamide hexavalent chromium and h2o2 pcn produced by each strain was measured by high performance liquid chromatography ultimate 3000 thermo scientific ma usa cultures were filtered with membrane filters with a pore size of 0 22 μm and then an equal volume of chloroform was used to extract pcn after concentration and evaporation the residue was dissolved in acetonitrile and determined by a reverse phase column c18 bonna agela technologies tianjin china acetonitrile solvent a and 25 mm ammonium acetate solvent b were used as the mobile phase pcn was separated with a linear gradient at a flow rate of 350 μl min using the following method 8 acetonitrile for 2 min followed by a linear gradient to 100 solvent b for 25 min and finally a linear gradient to 0 solvent b for 15 min the concentrations of hexavalent chromium after 14 days of immersion with and without strains were also measured by using diphenylcarbazide spectrophotometric method zhou et al 2018 h2o2 concentrations underneath the biofilms and in the bulk were obtained by using a h2o2 quantitative assay kit sangon biotech shanghai china the coupons after 14 days of immersion in the inoculated medium and 1 ml inoculated culture medium were added into 5 ml centrifuge tubes and then shaken by a vortex mixer the measurement of h2o2 concentrations was according to the manufacturer s instructions all tests were repeated thrice 3 results 3 1 characterization of biofilm and pitting morphology to evaluate if phzh gene of p aeruginosa affects the bacterial biofilm forming activity we first observed the adhesion morphologies of wild type wt p aeruginosa and its three mutants phzh phzh comp and phzh over mutants on 2205 dss coupon surfaces of aerobic incubation in 2216e culture medium at 30 c after 14 days through the observation via fesem fig 1 a d and clsm fig 1e h we found that the sessile cells of wt strain formed a dense biofilm fig 1a and 1e the maximum wt biofilm thickness reached 75 0 μm and the average standard deviation sd biofilm thickness was 71 0 2 9 μm fig 2 a and b however the biofilm formed by phzh mutant was not as uniform as the wt and the maximum thickness reduced to 61 2 μm and the average sd thickness reduced to 52 8 7 7 μm after complementing or overexpressing the phzh gene the average sd biofilm thicknesses of phzh comp and phzh over mutants were 62 4 4 7 μm and 76 5 5 6 μm respectively the total sessile cell number of phzh mutant on the whole coupon was approximately 36 7 1 8 106 cells which was less than that of the wt 62 6 3 0 106 cells the phzh comp 56 4 11 9 106 cells and the phzh over 67 6 2 7 106 cells strains fig 2b the coupon surface morphology prior to corrosion test was shown in fig 3 a there was almost no observable pit on the coupon surface fig 3b f shows the maximum depths of pits on 2205 dss coupon surfaces after 14 days of immersion fig 3g shows the box chart of pit depths which were obtained by counting ten deepest pits from ten different fields as the abiotic control the 2205 dss surfaces were relatively smooth with the deepest pit of only 2 6 μm fig 3b and the average sd pit depth of 1 9 0 5 μm fig 3g the wt strain and phzh comp mutant accelerated pitting corrosion and the average pit depths reached 3 7 0 7 μm and 3 3 0 8 μm respectively fig 3g the mutant with phzh overexpression led to the deepest pits 4 2 1 1 μm among all strains tested while phzh mutant caused the smallest pits 2 1 0 7 μm fig 3h shows the total number of pits on each coupon which was estimated based on 10 randomly chosen fields one of which was shown in supplementary fig s1 the phzh over mutant produced the largest number of pits which could be up to 2981 753 pits on each coupon 10 mm 10 mm there were 2555 522 and 2023 543 pits for wt strain and phzh comp mutant respectively the number of pits was greatly reduced in the presence of phzh mutant 1331 429 which was just slightly higher than the abiotic control 1065 439 3 2 electrochemical measurements eis is a powerful tool to evaluate the electrode interface structure and dynamics information from the bode diagrams as shown in supplementary fig s2a e the impedance value in the low frequency region significantly decreased with the presence of wt strain phzh comp mutant and phzh over mutant indicating the increased corrosion rate the phase angle of these strains changed from one peak to at least two peaks supplementary fig s2b d e while the phase angle change of phzh mutant during 7 days of immersion supplementary fig s2c was not obvious the nyquist diagrams also showed that the order of impedance was phzh over wt phzh comp phzh abiotic one supplementary fig s2a e supplementary fig s3 shows two different electrical circuit models to fit the abiotic and biotic eis data according to the fitting results the reciprocal of charge transfer resistance 1 r ct on day one five ten and fourteen are shown in fig 4 a representing the ability to promote electron transfer between the biofilm and the coupon surface zhou et al 2018 over the entire exposure period the order of 1 r ct was phzh over wt phzh comp phzh abiotic one lpr is another classical electrochemical measurement with a fast response which is suitable for monitoring the corrosion environment where corrosion rates may change rapidly kannan et al 2018 fig 4b shows the variation of the reciprocal polarization resistance 1 r p values representing the instantaneous corrosion rate of 2205 dss within 14 days of immersion the surface electrochemical reaction of the coupons in the media containing abiotic and phzh mutant changed slightly while the other strains varied continuously due to the adhesion of biofilms after soaking for 14 days 1 r p of the abiotic control was the lowest with the value of 0 5 0 1 μs cm 2 when inoculating with wt strain 1 r p value increased by one order of magnitude to 3 7 0 2 μs cm 2 indicating that 2205 dss coupon was not resistant to mic by p aeruginosa after the deletion of phzh gene 1 r p value decreased significantly to 1 0 0 1 μs cm 2 which was slightly higher than the value measured in the abiotic environment indicating that the deletion of phzh gene could inhibit mic in addition in the biotic solution with phzh gene reconstructed mutant 1 r p value reached 2 0 0 5 μs cm 2 confirming the vital role of phzh in the mic process for the phzh gene overexpressed mutant 1 r p value reached 4 2 0 2 μs cm 2 even higher than wt strain demonstrating that enhanced corrosivity by overexpression of phzh gene the r p data supported the r ct data in addition potentiodynamic polarization curves were also measured to obtain the corrosion potential e corr corrosion current density i corr and pitting potential e pit as shown in fig 4c we found that e corr shifted negatively and i corr moved to higher values in the presence of wt strain by tafel fitting analysis the corresponding electrochemical parameters i corr and e corr were obtained and shown in fig 5 a we found that i corr of wt strain reached 137 4 na cm 2 which was approximately twice more than that of the abiotic control 59 4 na cm 2 suggesting the accelerated corrosion however the deletion of phzh gene reduced the corrosivity of p aeruginosa as i corr value reduced to 71 3 na cm 2 after reconstructing the phzh gene the i corr 121 18 na cm 2 recovered to the wt level the i corr value of phzh over mutant was triple more than that of the abiotic control and reached 189 20 na cm 2 indicating the enhanced corrosivity the variations of e pit were not significant among the tested strains which might be related to the excellent pitting corrosion resistance of 2205 dss coupon supplementary table s1 as shown in fig 2b while wt strain and mutants with phzh knockout phzh complemented and phzh overexpression differed significantly in corrosion rate sessile cell counts cells cm2 were also different thus the number of sessile cells must be taken into account when assessing the ability for eet mic therefore 1 r ct 1 r p and i corr values were normalized against the number of sessile cells on the working electrode coupon surface 1 cm2 surface as observed in fig 5b the normalized values did not alter the trends for 1 r ct 1 r p and i corr eliminating the possibility that enhanced eet ability was due to increased sessile cell coverage on the working electrode 3 3 analysis of corrosion products the corrosion products were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps after 14 days of immersion fig 6 shows the cr 2p3 2 core level spectra of the coupon surface the binding energy be values and corresponding compounds of cr 2p3 2 peaks are shown in supplementary table s2 after incubation with phzh mutant cr 2p3 2 spectrum was divided into two peaks similar as the abiotic one the binding energies were 574 4 and 576 8 ev corresponding to cr and cr2o3 however the corrosion products changed while the coupons were incubated with wt strain and phzh comp mutant the main components of the corrosion products were cr cr2o3 and cro3 and the binding energies were 574 4 576 8 and 578 9 ev respectively after incubation with phzh overexpression mutant the main components of the product layer were cr cr2o3 cro3 and crn and the binding energies were 574 4 576 8 578 9 and 575 6 ev respectively fig 6f shows the relative abundance of each component in the corrosion products compared with the sterile control the percentage of cr2o3 decreased and the percentage of cro3 increased in the presence of wt phzh comp and phzh over mutants indicating that the passive film was possibly thinned and destroyed while the components of the passive film in the presence of phzh mutant were almost unchanged to further estimate the influence of different strains on the passive film of 2205 dss mott schottky tests were conducted to detect the semiconducting property of the passive film generally the passive film formed on stainless steel contained outer n type semiconductive iron oxides with positive slope and inner p type semiconductive chromium oxides with negative slope fig 7 a the inner p type semiconductive chromium oxides mainly cr2o3 were considered as the dominant factor to prevent corrosion li et al 2021a therefore to verify the change of corrosion products under different corrosion media fig 7 b shows the acceptor density n a and donor density n d by fitting the curves in fig 7 a obviously the defect density of the passive film with the presence of wt strain was higher than the sterile control indicating that the film of chromium oxides and iron oxides were damaged when inoculated with phzh mutant the defect density decreased indicating a more integrated passive film than the presence of wt when phzh gene of p aeruginosa was complemented or overexpressed the passive film especially chromium oxides became more flawed 3 4 detection of hexavalent chromium pcn and h2o2 fig 8 a shows the released cr6 concentrations after 14 days of immersion in different solutions it was noted that the released cr6 concentration in the abiotic medium is below the detection limit i e less than 0 05 mg l with the presence of strains more cr6 concentration was released the order of the cr6 concentrations were phzh over wt phzh comp phzh abiotic one the result was consistent with pcn concentrations secreted by each strain fig 8 b fig 8 c shows the contents of h2o2 underneath the biofilms after 14 days of immersion in different solutions the rank order of h2o2 concentrations also corresponded to the concentrations of cr6 and pcn the h2o2 concentration in the inoculated bulk medium was under the detection limit 1 100 μm 4 discussion marine p aeruginosa has been previously proved to regulate mic on various metal materials jia et al 2017a li et al 2016 saleem khan et al 2019 xia et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 more and more evidences indicated that the accelerated mic by p aeruginosa was dominant by eet rounts huang et al 2020 2018 liu et al 2021 various phenazines including phenazine 1 carboxylate pca 1 oh phenazine 1 oh phz pyo and pcn were produced by p aeruginosa to act as electron meditators among them pcn and pyo could bind extracellular dna underneath the biofilm facilitating electronic exchange saunders et al 2020 many studies indicated that the secreted phenazine concentration would affect biofilm formation ramos et al 2010 as shown in our tests the phzh overexpression mutant produced more pcn fig 8 b leading to a denser biofilm and more sessile bacteria attached to the 2205 dss coupon surface fig 1 it should be noted that the decreased sessile cell number of phzh mutant was not due to the addition of antibiotics as the antibiotics were only used for selection of the phzh comp and phzh over mutants meanwhile the antibiotics showed little side effect on the biofilm formation of the phzh comp and phzh over mutants it was also observed that the largest pitting depth of 2205 dss coupon was caused by phzh overexpression mutant the wt strain and phzh complemented mutant were the second and third following by the phzh knockout mutant and abiotic one fig 3 electrochemical test results in supplementary fig s3 and fig 4 also showed the same trend ph measurements showed that all the biotic media after 14 days reached 8 2 supplementary fig s4 indicating that the organic or inorganic acids should not be the culprit of corrosion in order to confirm the enhanced mic was due to increased eet ability of the cell rather than the increased amount of biofilms the number of adherent sessile cells were used to obtain the normalized corrosion rate for assessing the eet ability of each strain we found that the order of the normalized corrosion rate did not change the corrosivity trend the normalized corrosion rate of each strain still followed the same order calculated by the 1 r ct 1 r p and i corr values which is phzh over wt phzh comp phzh the result demonstrated that the increased corrosion rate was due to the increased production of the eet mediator pcn rather than the number of bacterial sessile cells since the phzh gene regulates the production of pcn we confirmed its critical role in the eet mic caused by p aeruginosa the self excreted molecules by electrogenic microbes could be functioned as diffusive electron shuttles to uptake electrons from fe 0 or transfer electrons to iron oxide li et al 2021b however whether and how could these self excreted molecules destroy the passive film especially cr2o3 formed on 2205 dss was unknown to further study the influence of pcn secreted by p aeruginosa on mic the corrosion products were analyzed with xps as shown in fig 6 the hexavalent chromium was detected on 2205 dss coupon surfaces after immersion in the wt phzh comp and phzh over mutants containing culture medium while there was no cro3 detected under the abiotic and phzh knockout conditions the generated cro3 is easy to dissolve in the solution resulting in the chromium depleted zone of the passivation film antony et al 2010 yao et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 typically the corrosion resistance of stainless steel depends on the stability of the passive film which is related to the compactness of the chromium oxide layer mott schottky experiments further confirmed the change of passive film structures in the presence of different strains the intactness and quality of chromium oxide layer of 2205 dss coupon inoculated with phzh mutant was the best among three tested p aeruginosa mutant strains when phzh gene was overexpressed the chromium oxide layer became more defected than the wt fig 7 meanwhile the measurement of cr6 concentrations in the culture media also indicated that the abiotic medium would not oxidize cr3 to cr6 and the phzh mutant produced less cr6 in the solution fig 8 a the order of the corrosion ability is phzh over wt phzh comp phzh the abiotic medium which was consistent with their performance on damaging the passive film and pcn production venkataraman et al once reported that the phenazines secreted by p aeruginosa can transfer electrons to oxygen to form superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide hassett et al 1992 venkataraman et al 2010 confirming the possibility of the oxidation route from cr3 to cr6 in the presence of biofilm as shown in fig 8 b phzh gene regulated pcn secretion which resulted in the change of h2o2 concentrations under different biofilms fig 8 c the result in this study seemed that trivalent chromium was easier to be oxidized to hexavalent chromium underneath the biofilm with more secretion of pcn the mechanism of mic caused by p aeruginosa biofilm is shown in fig 9 the enzyme encoded by phzh gene was responsible for converting pca to pcn huang et al 2018 during the electron transport process the reduced pcn may transfer electrons to the oxygen and produce superoxide radical or hydrogen peroxide leading to the destruction of the passive film in the broken area of the passive film pcn might be more susceptible to obtain electrons from the iron matrix and we have already confirmed the increased amount of pcn secreted by p aeruginosa facilitated the eet and enhanced the mic thus we believe that pcn induced the damage of the passive film and make it easier to obtain electrons from the matrix and then caused more severe corrosion our findings demonstrated that pcn encoded by phzh was the important electron shuttle which regulated the eet mic process thus pcn can be a marker for mic detection and monitoring in addition to p aeruginosa pseudomonas chlororaphis pcl1391 can secret pcn serving as an electron shuttle to promote microbial mineral reduction phenazine can also be utilized by shewanella oneidensis mr1 to stimulate mineral reduction hernandez et al 2004 besides pcn produced by pseudomonas sp accelerated eet process of brevibacillus sp pth1 pham et al 2008 thus we suggest that phenazines like pcn can promote eet mic by microbial consortia in water seawater environments a measurable pcn concentration in a field scenario indicates a high potential risk of eet mic accelerated by pcn serving as a mic detection and monitoring marker and a sign for the application of antimicrobial strategies like biocide treatment 5 conclusion this study investigated mic behavior caused by electro active marine p aeruginosa and successfully elucidated the underlying eet mic pathway we have demonstrated that phzh gene of p aeruginosa could regulate pcn expression and then regulate the occurrence of mic a mutant strain with over producing pcn led to increased rates of mic by accelerating electron uptake from 2205 dss by biofilms conversely deleting the phzh gene in p aeruginosa resulted in decreased mic by comparing the normalized corrosion rate per cell we confirmed that the accelerated and decelerated mic was due to the increased or reduced eet ability of the biofilm rather than the increased sessile cell quantity on the metal surface the more pcn secreted the higher concentration of released cr6 and higher defect density of the passive film were observed these findings first prove that both pcn mediated eet and passivation film damage mechanisms are responsible for mic by p aeruginosa which provides new insights into the understanding of eet mic mechanism and guides the detection monitoring and mitigation of mic of industrial

15874,irrigation with surface water carrying plant pathogens poses a risk for agriculture managed aquifer recharge enhances fresh water availability while simultaneously it may reduce the risk of plant diseases by removal of pathogens during aquifer passage we compared the transport of three plant pathogenic bacteria with escherichia coli wr1 as reference strain in saturated laboratory column experiments filled with quartz sand or sandy aquifer sediments e coli showed the highest removal followed by pectobacterium carotovorum dickeya solani and ralstonia solanacearum bacterial and non reactive tracer breakthrough curves were fitted with hydrus 1d and compared with colloid filtration theory cft bacterial attachment to fine and medium aquifer sand under anoxic conditions was highest with attachment rates of max katt1 765 day 1 and 355 day 1 respectively attachment was the least to quartz sand under oxic conditions katt1 61 day 1 in cft sticking efficiencies were higher in aquifer than in quartz sand but there was no differentiation between fine and medium aquifer sand overall removal ranged between 6 8 log10 m 1 in quartz and up to 40 log10 m 1 in fine aquifer sand oxygenation of the anoxic aquifer sediments for two weeks with oxic influent water decreased the removal the results highlight the potential of natural sand filtration to sufficiently remove plant pathogenic

filtration 1 introduction fresh water availability is decreasing as consequence of overuse and extreme weather events with agriculture being the biggest water consumer claiming about 70 of the total fresh water it relies heavily on the advancement of water management practices un water 2021 one strategy to tackle fresh water availability in agricultural settings is managed aquifer recharge mar which includes riverbank filtration infiltration ponds or aquifer storage and recovery dillon 2005 the goal is to replenish aquifers and improve water quality as microbial pathogens are removed during soil filtration removal is crucial because surface waters used for mar may contain pathogenic organisms their number should decline to safe levels prior to irrigation to avoid the spread of plant diseases hong and moorman 2005 chemical biological and physical processes occurring at the soil water interphase during mar can remove pathogens ginn et al 2002 this includes physical straining die off in the water phase ir reversible attachment to sediment grains die off at the grain surface and die off through predation and competition with other microorganisms bradford et al 2013 several studies analyzed the removal efficiency of mar systems focusing on human pathogens and related human health risks after irrigation of crops or recreational areas e g ayuso gabella et al 2011 page et al 2010 toze 2004 in contrast no study investigated the removal of plant pathogens during mar although mar treated water is often intended for irrigation and related consequences for plant health have high ecological and economic value hong and moorman 2005 savary et al 2019 for example surface water near potato or tomato growing fields must be tested for the presence of r solanacearum and an irrigation ban is imposed in areas with contaminated surface water anonymous 1998 water treatment of potentially contaminated surface water via mar is currently not considered in legislations to provide safe irrigation water legislations that regulate water reuse account for microbiological water quality but focus currently only on human health risks and neglect plant pathogens and related plant health anonymous 2020 council 2009 risk management is an essential component of a successful water reuse scheme but requires quantitative information on pathogen removal to analyze microbiological water quality this information is currently lacking for plant pathogens to our knowledge only two studies investigated the fate of plant pathogens in saturated porous media liu et al 2008 showed that biofilm coated glass beads increased the removal of the bacterium erwinia chrysanthemi jeon et al 2016 demonstrated a higher retention of zoospores of the oomycete phytophthora capsici in iron oxide coated saturated quartz sand in comparison to uncoated sand both studies used fabricated homogenous sediment to study principal transport processes natural sediments are heterogeneous in their lithological and chemical composition they usually contain positively charged metal oxide coatings that increase the number of favorable attachment sites and enhance the removal of the negatively charged microorganisms bradford et al 2013 johnson et al 1996 moreover mar usually results in oxygenation of aquifers and may lead to formation of additional iron oxides studies on transport of microbial plant pathogens in natural sediments are only available within the context of slow sand filtration ssf e g ferreira et al 2012 lee and oki 2013 which show a high efficiency to remove pathogens from greenhouse irrigation waters for example a horizontal slow sand filter with a length of 27 6 m removed 99 5 of fusarium propagules prenafeta boldú et al 2017 however ssf and mar differ in hydrological and geochemical conditions in terms of lithology water saturation redox conditions and biological activity which makes a comparison of both systems difficult the aim of our study was to analyze the removal of the following three economically and ecologically important plant pathogenic bacteria during transport in laboratory columns filled with aquifer sediments or quartz for the first time ralstonia solanacearum brown rot and the soft rot pectobacteriaceae srp dickeya solani and pectobacterium carotovorum these bacteria all cause high crop losses to a broad variety of crops including potato and tomato but also can affect ornamental flower production hayward 1991 ma et al 2007 tjou tam sin et al 2016 van der wolf and de boer 2007 we compare their transport with escherichia coli wr1 which has been used in previous field schijven et al 2000 and column studies with natural sand hijnen et al 2005 hijnen et al 2004 but not in quartz sand the aquifer sediments were obtained from a mar site used to produce and store irrigation water we hypothesize that a higher removal is achieved in natural sediment as these contain more favorable attachment sites in comparison to clean quartz sand furthermore the effect of oxygenation of the naturally anoxic sediments on removal rates was tested as this could lead to the formation of additional positively charged iron oxides the resulting breakthrough curves btc of the column experiments were modelled in hydrus 1d using the advection dispersion equation extended with a 1 or 2 site kinetic attachment detachment model schijven et al 2002 schijven and šimůnek 2002 log removals per meter were calculated to estimate removal under field conditions and for comparison with other studies pang 2009 2 material and methods 2 1 porous media and aqueous solutions fine to medium grained silica quartz sand d50 260 µm with a 99 5 sio2 content m32 sibelco belgium was used in the quartz sand experiments to remove any metal oxides the sand was acid washed chu et al 2001 which we describe in the supplement s1 for experiments with aquifer sand sediment was obtained during the drilling operation of a mar site in

sediment samples were obtained from the boreholes using a 2 m sonic drill aqualock system with a core catcher the sand cores were confined on both ends and stored in closed pvc tubes at 4 c for one month before they were opened for sand sample collection after opening the samples were exposed to air but handled rapidly to avoid oxidation two soil samples from different depths were collected with a disinfected 70 etoh spoon for the column experiments i fine aquifer sand from 12 14 m depth with d50 192 µm and ii medium aquifer sand of d50 305 µm from 24 m depth the coefficient of uniformity cu d60 d10 is 1 6 for quartz sand 2 0 for fine and 2 3 for medium mar sand a cu 2 refers to uniform soils a grain size distribution chart is shown in fig s1 and table s1 together with a chemical soil analysis in table s2 both soil samples are representative for the aquifer which consists to over 80 of fine to medium coarse sand 125 500 µm the soil samples were placed in a zip locked plastic bag of which excess air was removed before closure and stored in a gas tight container initially flushed with n2 gas together with two anaerobic gas generation sachets oxoid anaerogen 2 5 l thermo fisher scientific the container was stored at 10 c in the dark until further use all three sand types quartz fine and medium aquifer were extracted for total iron using the citrate dithionite extraction method after claff et al 2010 and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes an artificial groundwater agw solution was prepared in autoclaved containers after bolster et al 2001 and is described in s1 the agw was selected to exclude variations in bacteria attachment resulting from variations in solution chemistry it is not identical to the mar groundwater but contains the major ions and has low ionic strength of about 3 mm which does not favor attachment foppen and schijven 2006 for the non reactive salt tracer solution 1 g l 1 sodium chloride was added to the agw for all anoxic experiments the agw or tracer solution were made anoxic by flushing about 2 l with nitrogen gas for 1 h 2 2 column setup recommendations by gilbert et al 2014 were followed for the dimensioning of the column and selection of materials in the experimental setup setup shown in fig s2 we used a pvc column with a length of 23 cm and an inner diameter of 3 6 cm therefore the representative elementary volume rev calculated by dividing the column diameter by the grain diameter results in a rev of 128 for quartz 168 for fine mar and 105 for medium mar sand these values are all higher than the minimum rev of 40 for microbiological experiments the column was wet packed by pouring the sand material into the column and applying a slow flow rate 0 5 ml min 1 of anoxic agw with bottom up flux to avoid air entrapment additionally the column was continuously tapped while filling to remove air bubbles which required specific attention with natural sand a metal mesh 100 µm pore size was placed at the top and bottom of the column to retain the sand and was reinforced by a perforated metal plate 1 mm thick 2 mm wide holes column packing was executed under aerobic conditions while flushing with n2 at the column headspace and pumping anoxic agw from bottom up the tubing polyurethane was used with appropriate connectors festo b v the netherlands and all materials were autoclaved prior to use the column was rinsed carefully with 70 etoh prior to use a peristaltic pump watson marlow 205u uk maintained a constant pump rate of 2 5 ml min 1 0 1 ml min

between infiltration and abstraction well considering only radial horizontal water flow in the most permeable layer of the aquifer the velocity is higher next to the infiltration point and decreases with distance towards the extraction well located at 6 m distance an oxygen flow through cell presens germany at the column in and outlet monitored the oxygen concentrations automatically additionally a flow through ec sensor at the outlet measured the ec in the effluent with a datalogger wtw xylem analytics germany to monitor the breakthrough curves of the non reactive salt tracer we conducted three experiments with different saturated porous media which are summarized in table 1 e1 clean quartz sand under oxic conditions serving as worst case scenario and reference experiment conducted with all bacteria e2 fine aquifer sand under both anoxic and oxygenated conditions with p carotovorum e3a medium aquifer sand under anoxic conditions done with r solanacearum e coli and p carotovorum and e3b oxygenated medium aquifer sand with p carotovorum experiments with quartz sand were conducted in duplicates and with freshly packed columns while the experiments with fine aquifer sand were only done once per condition but using the same column to subsequently test oxygenation the experiments with medium aquifer sand were performed in triplicates using the same column but were freshly packed for each bacterium the transport of p carotovorum in medium mar sand was first studied under anoxic conditions followed by oxygenation of the same column to study the transport under oxic conditions thereby only one parameter namely the influence of oxygen was changed in between the replicate experiments the column was flushed 1 5 ml min 1 with anoxic deionized water over night to remove attached bacteria before the column was equilibrated again with agw at the beginning of the bacterial breakthrough experiments an effluent sample was taken shortly after the start of the pathogen loading when bacterial breakthrough was not yet expected the effluent sample was analyzed for the presence of the selected pathogen by dilution plating oxygenation of the column with fine aquifer sand e2 was executed by flushing 1 5 ml min 1 the column for two days with oxic agw until the effluent o2 concentration remained stable this flushing was extended to two weeks in experiments with medium aquifer sand e3b to achieve more extensive oxidation of the sediments and potentially more formation of reactive surface metal oxide coatings all experiments were performed in a cooling chamber at 10 c 1 5 except for experiments with r solanacearum which had to be performed within a laminar flow cabinet at room temperature due to the bacteria s quarantine status the column was operated in upflow direction at a pump rate of 2 5 ml min 1 to ensure saturated conditions each experiment was setup as following 1 filling of the column with sand material and equilibration with about 13 pore volumes pvs agw 2 breakthrough experiments with the non reactive salt tracer solutions there the sodium chloride solution was pumped for 85 min ca 2 4 pvs followed by switching back to the agw solution until the initial ec was measured 3 bacterial breakthrough experiments where the bacterial suspension containing ca 106 cfu ml 1 was also pumped for 85 min followed by switching back to the agw solution effluent samples of ca 0 5 ml were collected manually in reaction tubes at adequate time points and evaluated by dilution plating 2 3 inoculation solution r solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 phylotype ii strain ipo 1828 d solani ipo 2266 and p carotovorum ipo 1990 are plant pathogenic bacteria present in surface waters and were used in this study their transport was compared with escherichia coli wr1 nctc 13167 the selected bacteria are all gram negative rod shaped flagellated and have a similar size of 1 2 2 5 µm in length and 0 4 1 µm in width zeta potentials have been obtained from literature and they show that all pathogens are negatively charged 9 85 mv for p carotovorum gutierrez pacheco et al 2018 22 mv for e coli wr1 schijven et al 2008 21 3 mv for r solanacearum yan et al 2004 and 25 03 mv for dickeya spp formerly named erwinia chrysanthemi liu et al 2008 bacterial suspensions were prepared by incubating the respective bacteria in oxic liquid medium overnight for 15 h at 28 c e coli 12 h at 37 c on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm therefore the bacteria were harvested during the late log and early stationary growth phase details on bacteria and culture media preparation can be found in the supplement s2 the grown cultures were harvested by centrifugation 3500 x g 20 min at room temperature followed by washing and resuspending the pellet in a quarter strength ringer s solution sigma aldrich st louis usa this pelleting and washing step was repeated twice to remove any excess broth the bacterial suspension was then diluted to reach an optical density of 0 1 at 600 nm representing a concentration of 108 cfu ml 1 and was used to inoculate 250 ml of anoxic agw to reach a final concentration of 106 cfu ml 1 the concentration of the inoculation suspension c0 and the inoculated agw before and at the end of the breakthrough experiment and enumeration of the bacterial effluent concentrations were confirmed by dilution plating using selective media s2 elphinstone et al 1998 hélias et al 2012 furthermore bacterial hydrophobicity was analyzed using the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon math test as described by gargiulo et al 2008 2 4 data analysis and modeling breakthrough curves of the non reactive salt tracer and bacteria were analyzed with hydrus 1d simunek et al 2005 solute transport of the non reactive tracer is described by the advection dispersion equation under steady state flow conditions and a constant head 1 c t d 2 c x 2 ν c x where c is the solute concentration in the liquid phase m l 3 t is time t d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t x is distance l and ν the average interstitial water velocity l t 1 bacterial transport is modeled by an extended form of the advection dispersion equation

two different kinetic sites in hydrus 1d normalized c c0 values were used as input values and to model the tailing of the btc log transformation of c c0 was applied to overcome the great difference between maximum and minimum bacterial effluent concentrations schijven and šimůnek 2002 porosity θ and longitudinal dispersivity α l l α l d υ were both determined from salt tracer experiments and used as input values to model bacterial btc growth or die off of the bacteria was not considered within the time span of the experiments about 9 h as we have shown in batch experiments that die off in the water phase took only place after more than 24 h eisfeld et al 2021 hydrus 1d allows to compare the fit of a 1 or 2 site kinetic model by evaluating the coefficient of determination r2 and the akaike information criterion aic as output data from hydrus 1d the aic considers both the goodness of fit and parsimony of the models for our experiments the model with the smallest aic value was therefore chosen as best model the advection dispersion eq 2 accounts for reversibility of the bacterial attachment we compare these results with the cft that assumes a single grain size with perfect sphericity and smoothness where bacteria attach irreversibly we used the equations described by tufenkji and elimelech 2004 to calculate the single collector contact efficiency η0 and sticking

values α l and katt1 from the salt and bacterial breakthrough experiments respectively finally the c c0 is used to estimate microbial log removal per meter expressed by λ log10 l 1 pang 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 chloride tracer btc the non reactive salt tracer allowed to determine the physical water flow characteristics of the column the normalized btcs of the chloride ec effluent concentrations c c0 were fitted in hydrus 1d to obtain longitudinal dispersivity α l and porosity θ as shown in table s3 in quartz sand these parameters were evaluated for each experiment individually and the porosity was 0 37 0 40 with α l of 0 038 0 045 cm the same parameters were obtained in the aquifer sand experiments by combining the data of the chloride btcs of the replicate experiments per bacterium for r solanacearum in medium aquifer sand only two salt tracer tests were executed the porosity in fine and medium aquifer sand was lower 0 31 0 34 than in the quartz sand experiments whereas α l was considerably higher ranging between 0 28 1 5 cm α l of medium aquifer sand used for experiments with e coli was 1 51 cm thereby similar to the columns filled with fine sand 1 46 cm differences in porosity and longitudinal dispersivity may arise from combining data of the tracer btcs of the aquifer sand but also from column packing or variation in grain size distribution of the natural aquifer sand fig s1 these variations in dispersivity have also been reported by other authors oudega et al 2021 schijven et al 2002 but have little influence on the fitting and adsorption parameters 3 2 bacterial transport in quartz sand the bacterial btcs are shown in figs 1 and 2 the modified advection dispersion eq 2 for bacterial transport implemented in hydrus 1d was applied to fit the bacterial btcs table 2 shows the attachment and detachment parameters for a 1 or 2 site kinetic model in most cases the 2 site kinetic model showed a better fit when comparing the r2 and aic table s5 all btcs of quartz and natural mar sand were analyzed for blocking by fitting the blocking parameter smax1 e g hornstra et al 2018 in hydrus 1d in blocking available grain surfaces get occluded by for example attached bacteria which decreases the retention of other bacteria as less favorable sites are available ryan and elimelech 1996 adding the blocking parameter did not improve model fit considering the aic in all experiments the bacterial btcs coincided with the tracer btcs but the bacterial btcs showed a lower c c0 as consequence of bacterial attachment which we describe as removal fig 1 presents the results of the duplicate bacterial btcs in quartz sand additionally fig s3a compares the btcs of the four bacteria where c c0 is presented linearly while fig s3b displays the same results using log transformed c c0 values which allowed to identify the tails of the btcs caused by detachment e coli had the highest removal in quartz sand followed by p carotovorum and d solani r solanacearum was least removed reflected by a high c c0 of 0 85 in replicate 1 and a low katt1 of 6 day 1 in comparison katt1 was ten times higher for e coli 61 day 1 replicate 1 and the c c0 peak was 0 18 the bacterial btc of e coli was best fitted with the 1 site kinetic model and therefore removal is solely guided by kinetic site 1 the btc of the plant pathogenic bacteria were best fitted with the 2 site kinetic model but a comparison of the aics often showed little difference indicating that the 1 site model would also be an adequate fit at kinetic site 2 attachment occurred to a lesser extent than at site 1 katt2 1 4 day 1 while kinetic site 1 showed little detachment kdet1 0 03 2 2 day 1 detachment at site 2 was very high ranging from 11 112 day 1 note that katt1 of d solani and r solanacearum and all kdet2 rate coefficients show a very high standard deviation its implication will be discussed in the section of parameter evaluation overall the plant pathogenic bacteria were removed to a lesser extent than e coli and their btc peak had a higher c c0 value reported bacterial characteristics such as cell size surface charge or growth stage are similar for the selected bacteria moreover the results of the hydrophobicity test table s4 indicate that all bacteria are hydrophilic with little difference 2 1 8 9 in partitioning into the hydrophobic phase therefore other bacterial characteristics like the specific surface structure e g lipopolysaccharides may cause the different transport behaviors gilbert et al 1991 ginn et al 2002 nevertheless these were not further analyzed and should be addressed in future studies 3 3 bacterial transport in aquifer sand bacterial btcs in medium aquifer sand are shown in fig 2 a d the replicate experiments for each bacterium show a higher variability in aquifer than in quartz sand as a result of the greater heterogeneity of the sand material represented by a higher cu in some experiments retained bacteria from a previous replicate experiment detached and were measured in the effluent before the actual bacterial breakthrough was expected yet these concentrations were low 102 and once 103 cfu ml and were in the range or lower than the tail concentrations caused by detachment the peak breakthrough of the bacteria and the overall removal was not influenced for example during the transport of e coli in anoxic medium mar sand replicate 2 and 3 about 102 cfu ml were detected in the first sample taken after 1 min however katt1 as well as the overall removal were higher in replicate 2 and 3 in comparison to replicate 1 which did not yet contain attached bacteria in anoxic medium aquifer sand the c c0 values were at least three orders of magnitude lower than in the quartz sand differences in attachment to quartz and natural mar sand can also be explained by the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory derjaguin and landau 1993 verwey et al 1948 it describes the repulsive and attractive forces between the bacterial cell and grain surface clean quartz sand has a negative surface charge negative zeta potential that repulses negatively charged bacteria elimelech et al 2000 unfavorable attachment can occur when the distance between grain surface and bacterial cells gets small enough and the attractive van der waals forces dominate over the repulsive double layer favorable attachment occurs in natural sediments where metal oxides depict favorable attachment sites that attract negatively charged bacteria fine and medium mar sand had the same amount of fe and al metal oxides table s2 although the total extractable iron was higher in medium aquifer 21 0 6 mg l 1 than in fine aquifer sand 6 8 0 7 mg l 1 table s6 grain size played an important role in the retention of the bacteria as the mar sand has a larger fraction of fine sands compared to quartz providing a greater total surface area for attachment likewise the retention in fine mar sand has been greater than in medium mar sand they varied in the fraction of fine sands smaller than 250 µm which was about 77 in fine and 30 in medium mar sand these fractions of very fine sands silt and clay 32 µm 4 7 in fine and 3 2 in medium mar sand reduce the pore space which can result in a retention of the bacteria by size exclusion or a longer travel distance through the column this increases contact time and the chance of attachment of bacteria to the sand material murphy and ginn 2000 as observed in the quartz sand experiments e coli showed higher removal than the plant pathogenic bacteria comparing the btcs where the peak c c0 is on average 2 3 10 3 for e coli and 1 9 10 2 for p carotovorum and 1 4 10 2 for r solanacearum moreover katt1 coefficients were about ten times higher in medium aquifer sand ranging from 129 551 day 1 detachment at site 1 is negligible as values are small 1 day 1 similar to the quartz sand experiments the highest removal was achieved in fine aquifer sand under anoxic and oxygenated conditions where p carotovorum had a katt1 of 765 day 1 and 515 day 1 respectively the peak c c0 values in fine aquifer sand were very low 1 0 10 4 under anoxic and 8 1 10 4 under oxygenated conditions and effluent concentrations were at the limit of detection fig 2c d as a result of the high removal the breakthrough peak in fine sand columns was less pronounced in comparison to the shape of the btcs in quartz and medium aquifer sand experiments the effluent concentrations in the experiment with oxygenated fine sand were scattered and resulted in a poor model fit r2 0 21 although the data of the anoxic fine sand experiments were also scattered a reasonable fit using the 1 site kinetic model was achieved r2 0 81 here the initial breakthrough of the bacteria was noticeable which has a greater influence on r2 overall all btcs of p carotovorum in aquifer sand were better fitted with the 1 site kinetic model while the transport of e coli and r solanacearum in medium aquifer sand showed a better fit applying the 2 site kinetic model the katt2 and kdet2 values were in a similar range for r solanacearum about 25 day 1 while for e coli katt2 was higher 75 132 day 1 than kdet2 0 4 79 day 1 the results agree with the observations by schijven et al 2002 that site 1 is characterized by relatively fast attachment and slow detachment while site 2 is characterized by relatively fast attachment and fast detachment implying that attachment to site 1 mostly determines removal 3 4 parameter evaluation the 1 and 2 site kinetic models and associated parameter estimates resulted in a good fit of the bacterial breakthrough data as confirmed by aic and r2 yet we often found little differences between the 1 and 2 site kinetic models in terms of goodness of fit aic and r2 table s5 indicating both models would be a reasonable choice and that kinetic site 2 is less relevant e g e coli in quartz sand the rate coefficients of kinetic site 2 influenced the shape of the btc and improved model fit as for example the btc of p carotovorum replicate 2 in anoxic medium aquifer sand fig 2c there the 2 site kinetic model allowed a smooth transition from the declining limb towards the tail of the btc governed by katt2 and kdet2 schijven et al 2000 in contrast the 1 site kinetic model replicate 1 and 3 failed to model a smooth transition from the peak to the decline of the btc and the curve shape of the tail nevertheless fig 2c shows that the 1 site model represents sufficiently the curve shape of the btcs consequently site 2 was less important for the removal of the pathogens which was also represented by the high standard deviations of the parameters at site 2 e g kdet2 49 39 day 1 p carotovorum in quartz sand the peak c c0 was mainly determined by katt1 which was confirmed by calculating c c0 using only katt1 as input value using eq 5 the calculated c c0 and modeled c c0 by hydrus 1d were in the same range kdet1 determined the height of the tail and the values of c c0 at the tail are magnitudes lower than at the peak breakthrough in all experiments in the aquifer sand experiments the tail was about three orders of magnitude lower than the peak c c0 and in all experiment the tail could only be visualized using the semi log scale see fig s3 therefore the removal mechanism can be simplified and only described by irreversible attachment that neglects detachment we compared results of the reversible attachment detachment model with cft to evaluate katt1 in cft the removal of colloids bacteria is described with the single collector contact efficiency η0 and the sticking efficiency α from which an irreversible deposition rate can be calculated pang et al 2021 the results of η0 and α are shown in table 2 η0 was similar in quartz and aquifer sand 0 009 0 014 α values were low in quartz sand 0 018 0 176 reflecting little attachment while higher collision frequencies were represented by high α in aquifer sand 0 182 0 725 previously reported hijnen et al 2005 sticking efficiencies for e coli wr1 in column experiments with finer natural sandy soil d50 180 µm were 0 341 at 0 5 m day 1 and 0 424 at 0 9 m day 1 therefore lower than our results for e coli in medium aquifer sand α 0 540 0 725 at 3 6 m day 1 moreover cft predicts that finer sand results in higher sticking efficiencies yet in our results sticking efficiencies of p carotovorum in medium aquifer sand were similar or higher than in fine sand cft does not consider heterogeneities of the porous medium such as metal oxides that pose favorable attachment sites nor physiological bacterial characteristics like hydrophobicity or surface charge the attachment detachment model accounts for these heterogeneities which is reflected in higher katt1 comparing transport of p carotovorum in anoxic fine 765 day 1 and medium aquifer sand e g rep 1 184 day 1 finally although katt1 mostly governs removal detachment has to be taken into account as detached microorganisms re contaminate the water source and might pose a risk to the end user results of knappett et al 2014 pointed out detachment should not be ignored at the field scale 3 5 microbial removal rates to evaluate our results on a larger scale we analyzed log10 removal per meter that only takes into account irreversible attachment to site 1 these ranged between 0 42 for r solanacearum and 6 8 log10 m 1 for e coli in quartz sand a similar removal 4 69 log m 1 in quartz sand columns d50 250 µm were obtained for e coli j6 2 by weaver et al 2013 our quartz sand experiments allowed to investigate bacterial transport under very controlled conditions as the sand has a defined grain size and no favorable attachment sites there were no physicochemical differences between the quartz experiments except that the experiment with r solanacearum was done at room temperature previous research showed that temperature had little effect on bacterial deposition kim et al 2009 but it did influence the retention of viruses sasidharan et al 2017 consequently differences in transport are due to the nature of the bacterial species and their metabolic state which influences cell characteristics like hydrophobicity and surface charge bradford et al 2013 murphy and ginn 2000 compared to quartz sand the removal in anoxic medium aquifer sand was much higher for r solanacearum 18 log10 m 1 and p carotovorum 19 log10 m 1 and even 28 log10 m 1 for e coli similar removal of about 20 log m 1 were presented by oudega et al 2021 using column experiments with natural heterogeneous gravel material and the bacterium bacillus subtilis and a bacteriophage yet the authors found a much lower removal in the field 0 2 log m 1 which they explained by preferential flow paths that may occur in their studied aquifer and enhance the bacterial transport these large discrepancies between column and field studies have also been summarized by pang 2009 and need to be considered in risk assessments the highest removal 40 log10 m 1 was observed in oxic fine aquifer sand for p carotovorum this highlights the importance to know about the geological structure of a site although the aquifer sands used in our study had a similar d50 of 192 µm fine and 305 µm medium their removal capacity differed greatly this may be caused amongst others by the very fine fraction 125 µm which was 10 in fine sand and only 3 in medium aquifer sand table s1 therefore a detailed geological description of a mar site is very useful to predict removal of pathogens and field tests should be included if feasible 3 6 influence of oxygenation in this research the influence of oxygenation of the aquifer sand material and effects on the transport of p carotovorum was investigated the column filled with medium aquifer sand was first operated under anoxic conditions followed by flushing the column with oxic agw to simulate infiltration of oxic water into an anoxic aquifer oxygen levels in the column influent and effluent remained below 0 1 mg l 1 during anoxic experiments during the flushing the influent o2 concentration was about 12 mg l 1 while the effluent o2 levels were on average 1 4 mg l 1 lower than the influent indicating o2 consumption by chemical and or biological reactions within the column reactive transport modelling has shown that the injection of oxic water into an anoxic aquifer will modify the biological and geochemical properties of the aquifer and thereby could affect the microbial transport over time kruisdijk and van breukelen 2021 ferrous iron e g from minerals like pyrite is oxidized and results in formation of positively charged iron oxide coatings which can increase bacterial attachment due to their negative surface charge johnson et al 1996 for example virus attachment was reduced under anoxic conditions in field experiments schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 while sub oxic conditions increased virus removal due to positively charged metal oxides hornstra et al 2018 in contrast our results unexpectedly show that removal of p carotovorum decreased under oxygenated conditions compared to prior anoxic conditions the average removal was 19 1 3 log10 m 1 under anoxic and 13 4 log10 m 1 under oxic conditions the transport in oxygenated fine aquifer sand also resulted in lower removal although the flushing with oxygen rich water was done for a shorter time 2 days here the removal was 40 log10 m 1 under anoxic and 31 log10 m 1 under oxic conditions on the one hand lower retention during oxic experiments may have been a result of fewer available attachment sites due to retained cells of p carotovorum during the anoxic medium mar experiments on the other hand we expect that most the bacteria died off during the two weeks flushing with oxic agw eisfeld et al 2021 or detached during flushing with deionized water which changed the ionic strength foppen et al 2007 moreover the retention of p carotovorum in oxic medium mar sand in replicate 2 was just as high katt1 215 day 1 as during the anoxic experiments katt1 129 202 day 1 which indicates that there were still sufficient attachment sites available the two other replicate experiments 1 3 under oxic conditions showed less removal under oxic conditions calculated sticking efficiencies that were lower in oxic compared to the anoxic experiments in medium and fine aquifer sand as stated earlier oxygen rich water modifies the geochemistry of an anoxic aquifer but also acts as an environmental signal for microorganisms that may trigger metabolic changes which consequently modifies attachment as response to anoxic conditions microorganism can modify their gene expression which may lead to the production of different surface structures e g lipopolysaccharides and alterations in surface charge as shown for e coli landini and zehnder 2002 castro and tufenkji 2008 analyzed the transport of e coli o157 h7 and yersinia enterocolitica under low and high oxygen concentrations while e coli had a higher sticking efficiency under oxic conditions attachment of y enterocolitica was increased under anoxic conditions the authors assumed that growing the bacteria either aerobically or anaerobically resulted in differences in the cell surface structure and surface charge similarly the plant pathogenic bacteria have adaptation strategies that changes their transcriptional response and surface properties in response to environmental changes lisicka et al 2018 to conclude expected improvement in removal due to oxygenation was not observed as the duration of the oxygenation may have been insufficient to increase the presence of iron oxides future research is needed to further investigate the effects of oxygenation on the porous media and its effects on the pathogens and natural microbiota to evaluate it overall effects on pathogen transport 3 7 applicability to mar systems column experiments are an important tool in the assessment of bacterial transport because environmental conditions can be better controlled than in the field nevertheless upscaling of these results to field scale needs to be done with caution as results may overestimate the actual removal in the field particularly when the variation in grain size distribution with depth is poorly characterized oudega et al 2021 pang 2009 the quality of the water used for injection should also be considered in translating column results to the field scale in our study high inoculation concentrations 106 cfu ml 1 were used to enable measuring the breakthrough over a longer period but this does not represent concentrations of plant pathogenic bacteria found in surface waters which are about 0 1 103 cfu ml 1 wenneker et al 1999 moreover the applied flow velocity of 3 6 m day 1 represents high groundwater flow during constant injection under realistic conditions water will be injected during rain events but recovered at a different time point and the velocity in the aquifer will be lower especially during periods without infiltration lower velocity results in higher contact time of the pathogens with the grain surface which favors attachment and residence time is an essential factor in mar operation hendry et al 1999 massmann et al 2008 field experiments with pathogenic organisms are often prohibited therefore we included e coli wr1 as reference organism for future field experiments yet e coli wr1 had the highest removal in quartz and aquifer sand in comparison to the plant pathogenic bacteria which makes it unsuitable for direct comparison to these pathogens in a future study an alternative surrogate for field experiments should be tested in column experiments beforehand to evaluate the comparability with the plant pathogens nevertheless the results showed that the aquifer sands were an effective filter to remove bacterial pathogens future work will combine the results of this study on filtration processes with those of die off experiments with the same plant pathogens eisfeld et al 2021 in a quantitative microbial risk assessment model to aid the design e g minimal travel distances and residence times of mar systems 4 conclusions plant pathogenic bacteria are a threat to global agricultural production and dissemination of plant diseases via contaminated irrigation water has often been observed irrigation water availability is under pressure due to water scarcity and the deterioration of surface water quality we studied if aquifer storage and recovery as solution for water scarcity could deliver safe irrigation water by means of plant pathogen removal during transport in natural sediments in laboratory column experiments we showed the effective removal of three plant pathogenic bacteria in natural sediments from a mar site and compared the transport with the human pathogen e coli wr1 removal parameters were obtained by modeling the results in hydrus 1d the heterogeneous natural aquifer sands had a higher up to several log10 pathogen removal capacity than quartz sand oxygenation of the anoxic aquifer sands did not increase removal contrary to our expectations tailing caused by detachment has been observed in all btcs but was several magnitudes lower than the peak c c0 suggesting that it may be neglected however detachment has to be considered as trace levels of highly infectious pathogens may still be present after soil treatment the quartz sand experiments represent non favorable conditions for attachment and results may be used as worst case scenario in risk assessments in conclusion our study confirms the potential of mar as a natural water treatment technology in agricultural settings to store and supply both fresh and bacterially safe irrigation

15874,irrigation with surface water carrying plant pathogens poses a risk for agriculture managed aquifer recharge enhances fresh water availability while simultaneously it may reduce the risk of plant diseases by removal of pathogens during aquifer passage we compared the transport of three plant pathogenic bacteria with escherichia coli wr1 as reference strain in saturated laboratory column experiments filled with quartz sand or sandy aquifer sediments e coli showed the highest removal followed by pectobacterium carotovorum dickeya solani and ralstonia solanacearum bacterial and non reactive tracer breakthrough curves were fitted with hydrus 1d and compared with colloid filtration theory cft bacterial attachment to fine and medium aquifer sand under anoxic conditions was highest with attachment rates of max katt1 765 day 1 and 355 day 1 respectively attachment was the least to quartz sand under oxic conditions katt1 61 day 1 in cft sticking efficiencies were higher in aquifer than in quartz sand but there was no differentiation between fine and medium aquifer sand overall removal ranged between 6 8 log10 m 1 in quartz and up to 40 log10 m 1 in fine aquifer sand oxygenation of the anoxic aquifer sediments for two weeks with oxic influent water decreased the removal the results highlight the potential of natural sand filtration to sufficiently remove plant pathogenic

filtration 1 introduction fresh water availability is decreasing as consequence of overuse and extreme weather events with agriculture being the biggest water consumer claiming about 70 of the total fresh water it relies heavily on the advancement of water management practices un water 2021 one strategy to tackle fresh water availability in agricultural settings is managed aquifer recharge mar which includes riverbank filtration infiltration ponds or aquifer storage and recovery dillon 2005 the goal is to replenish aquifers and improve water quality as microbial pathogens are removed during soil filtration removal is crucial because surface waters used for mar may contain pathogenic organisms their number should decline to safe levels prior to irrigation to avoid the spread of plant diseases hong and moorman 2005 chemical biological and physical processes occurring at the soil water interphase during mar can remove pathogens ginn et al 2002 this includes physical straining die off in the water phase ir reversible attachment to sediment grains die off at the grain surface and die off through predation and competition with other microorganisms bradford et al 2013 several studies analyzed the removal efficiency of mar systems focusing on human pathogens and related human health risks after irrigation of crops or recreational areas e g ayuso gabella et al 2011 page et al 2010 toze 2004 in contrast no study investigated the removal of plant pathogens during mar although mar treated water is often intended for irrigation and related consequences for plant health have high ecological and economic value hong and moorman 2005 savary et al 2019 for example surface water near potato or tomato growing fields must be tested for the presence of r solanacearum and an irrigation ban is imposed in areas with contaminated surface water anonymous 1998 water treatment of potentially contaminated surface water via mar is currently not considered in legislations to provide safe irrigation water legislations that regulate water reuse account for microbiological water quality but focus currently only on human health risks and neglect plant pathogens and related plant health anonymous 2020 council 2009 risk management is an essential component of a successful water reuse scheme but requires quantitative information on pathogen removal to analyze microbiological water quality this information is currently lacking for plant pathogens to our knowledge only two studies investigated the fate of plant pathogens in saturated porous media liu et al 2008 showed that biofilm coated glass beads increased the removal of the bacterium erwinia chrysanthemi jeon et al 2016 demonstrated a higher retention of zoospores of the oomycete phytophthora capsici in iron oxide coated saturated quartz sand in comparison to uncoated sand both studies used fabricated homogenous sediment to study principal transport processes natural sediments are heterogeneous in their lithological and chemical composition they usually contain positively charged metal oxide coatings that increase the number of favorable attachment sites and enhance the removal of the negatively charged microorganisms bradford et al 2013 johnson et al 1996 moreover mar usually results in oxygenation of aquifers and may lead to formation of additional iron oxides studies on transport of microbial plant pathogens in natural sediments are only available within the context of slow sand filtration ssf e g ferreira et al 2012 lee and oki 2013 which show a high efficiency to remove pathogens from greenhouse irrigation waters for example a horizontal slow sand filter with a length of 27 6 m removed 99 5 of fusarium propagules prenafeta boldú et al 2017 however ssf and mar differ in hydrological and geochemical conditions in terms of lithology water saturation redox conditions and biological activity which makes a comparison of both systems difficult the aim of our study was to analyze the removal of the following three economically and ecologically important plant pathogenic bacteria during transport in laboratory columns filled with aquifer sediments or quartz for the first time ralstonia solanacearum brown rot and the soft rot pectobacteriaceae srp dickeya solani and pectobacterium carotovorum these bacteria all cause high crop losses to a broad variety of crops including potato and tomato but also can affect ornamental flower production hayward 1991 ma et al 2007 tjou tam sin et al 2016 van der wolf and de boer 2007 we compare their transport with escherichia coli wr1 which has been used in previous field schijven et al 2000 and column studies with natural sand hijnen et al 2005 hijnen et al 2004 but not in quartz sand the aquifer sediments were obtained from a mar site used to produce and store irrigation water we hypothesize that a higher removal is achieved in natural sediment as these contain more favorable attachment sites in comparison to clean quartz sand furthermore the effect of oxygenation of the naturally anoxic sediments on removal rates was tested as this could lead to the formation of additional positively charged iron oxides the resulting breakthrough curves btc of the column experiments were modelled in hydrus 1d using the advection dispersion equation extended with a 1 or 2 site kinetic attachment detachment model schijven et al 2002 schijven and šimůnek 2002 log removals per meter were calculated to estimate removal under field conditions and for comparison with other studies pang 2009 2 material and methods 2 1 porous media and aqueous solutions fine to medium grained silica quartz sand d50 260 µm with a 99 5 sio2 content m32 sibelco belgium was used in the quartz sand experiments to remove any metal oxides the sand was acid washed chu et al 2001 which we describe in the supplement s1 for experiments with aquifer sand sediment was obtained during the drilling operation of a mar site in

sediment samples were obtained from the boreholes using a 2 m sonic drill aqualock system with a core catcher the sand cores were confined on both ends and stored in closed pvc tubes at 4 c for one month before they were opened for sand sample collection after opening the samples were exposed to air but handled rapidly to avoid oxidation two soil samples from different depths were collected with a disinfected 70 etoh spoon for the column experiments i fine aquifer sand from 12 14 m depth with d50 192 µm and ii medium aquifer sand of d50 305 µm from 24 m depth the coefficient of uniformity cu d60 d10 is 1 6 for quartz sand 2 0 for fine and 2 3 for medium mar sand a cu 2 refers to uniform soils a grain size distribution chart is shown in fig s1 and table s1 together with a chemical soil analysis in table s2 both soil samples are representative for the aquifer which consists to over 80 of fine to medium coarse sand 125 500 µm the soil samples were placed in a zip locked plastic bag of which excess air was removed before closure and stored in a gas tight container initially flushed with n2 gas together with two anaerobic gas generation sachets oxoid anaerogen 2 5 l thermo fisher scientific the container was stored at 10 c in the dark until further use all three sand types quartz fine and medium aquifer were extracted for total iron using the citrate dithionite extraction method after claff et al 2010 and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes an artificial groundwater agw solution was prepared in autoclaved containers after bolster et al 2001 and is described in s1 the agw was selected to exclude variations in bacteria attachment resulting from variations in solution chemistry it is not identical to the mar groundwater but contains the major ions and has low ionic strength of about 3 mm which does not favor attachment foppen and schijven 2006 for the non reactive salt tracer solution 1 g l 1 sodium chloride was added to the agw for all anoxic experiments the agw or tracer solution were made anoxic by flushing about 2 l with nitrogen gas for 1 h 2 2 column setup recommendations by gilbert et al 2014 were followed for the dimensioning of the column and selection of materials in the experimental setup setup shown in fig s2 we used a pvc column with a length of 23 cm and an inner diameter of 3 6 cm therefore the representative elementary volume rev calculated by dividing the column diameter by the grain diameter results in a rev of 128 for quartz 168 for fine mar and 105 for medium mar sand these values are all higher than the minimum rev of 40 for microbiological experiments the column was wet packed by pouring the sand material into the column and applying a slow flow rate 0 5 ml min 1 of anoxic agw with bottom up flux to avoid air entrapment additionally the column was continuously tapped while filling to remove air bubbles which required specific attention with natural sand a metal mesh 100 µm pore size was placed at the top and bottom of the column to retain the sand and was reinforced by a perforated metal plate 1 mm thick 2 mm wide holes column packing was executed under aerobic conditions while flushing with n2 at the column headspace and pumping anoxic agw from bottom up the tubing polyurethane was used with appropriate connectors festo b v the netherlands and all materials were autoclaved prior to use the column was rinsed carefully with 70 etoh prior to use a peristaltic pump watson marlow 205u uk maintained a constant pump rate of 2 5 ml min 1 0 1 ml min

between infiltration and abstraction well considering only radial horizontal water flow in the most permeable layer of the aquifer the velocity is higher next to the infiltration point and decreases with distance towards the extraction well located at 6 m distance an oxygen flow through cell presens germany at the column in and outlet monitored the oxygen concentrations automatically additionally a flow through ec sensor at the outlet measured the ec in the effluent with a datalogger wtw xylem analytics germany to monitor the breakthrough curves of the non reactive salt tracer we conducted three experiments with different saturated porous media which are summarized in table 1 e1 clean quartz sand under oxic conditions serving as worst case scenario and reference experiment conducted with all bacteria e2 fine aquifer sand under both anoxic and oxygenated conditions with p carotovorum e3a medium aquifer sand under anoxic conditions done with r solanacearum e coli and p carotovorum and e3b oxygenated medium aquifer sand with p carotovorum experiments with quartz sand were conducted in duplicates and with freshly packed columns while the experiments with fine aquifer sand were only done once per condition but using the same column to subsequently test oxygenation the experiments with medium aquifer sand were performed in triplicates using the same column but were freshly packed for each bacterium the transport of p carotovorum in medium mar sand was first studied under anoxic conditions followed by oxygenation of the same column to study the transport under oxic conditions thereby only one parameter namely the influence of oxygen was changed in between the replicate experiments the column was flushed 1 5 ml min 1 with anoxic deionized water over night to remove attached bacteria before the column was equilibrated again with agw at the beginning of the bacterial breakthrough experiments an effluent sample was taken shortly after the start of the pathogen loading when bacterial breakthrough was not yet expected the effluent sample was analyzed for the presence of the selected pathogen by dilution plating oxygenation of the column with fine aquifer sand e2 was executed by flushing 1 5 ml min 1 the column for two days with oxic agw until the effluent o2 concentration remained stable this flushing was extended to two weeks in experiments with medium aquifer sand e3b to achieve more extensive oxidation of the sediments and potentially more formation of reactive surface metal oxide coatings all experiments were performed in a cooling chamber at 10 c 1 5 except for experiments with r solanacearum which had to be performed within a laminar flow cabinet at room temperature due to the bacteria s quarantine status the column was operated in upflow direction at a pump rate of 2 5 ml min 1 to ensure saturated conditions each experiment was setup as following 1 filling of the column with sand material and equilibration with about 13 pore volumes pvs agw 2 breakthrough experiments with the non reactive salt tracer solutions there the sodium chloride solution was pumped for 85 min ca 2 4 pvs followed by switching back to the agw solution until the initial ec was measured 3 bacterial breakthrough experiments where the bacterial suspension containing ca 106 cfu ml 1 was also pumped for 85 min followed by switching back to the agw solution effluent samples of ca 0 5 ml were collected manually in reaction tubes at adequate time points and evaluated by dilution plating 2 3 inoculation solution r solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 phylotype ii strain ipo 1828 d solani ipo 2266 and p carotovorum ipo 1990 are plant pathogenic bacteria present in surface waters and were used in this study their transport was compared with escherichia coli wr1 nctc 13167 the selected bacteria are all gram negative rod shaped flagellated and have a similar size of 1 2 2 5 µm in length and 0 4 1 µm in width zeta potentials have been obtained from literature and they show that all pathogens are negatively charged 9 85 mv for p carotovorum gutierrez pacheco et al 2018 22 mv for e coli wr1 schijven et al 2008 21 3 mv for r solanacearum yan et al 2004 and 25 03 mv for dickeya spp formerly named erwinia chrysanthemi liu et al 2008 bacterial suspensions were prepared by incubating the respective bacteria in oxic liquid medium overnight for 15 h at 28 c e coli 12 h at 37 c on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm therefore the bacteria were harvested during the late log and early stationary growth phase details on bacteria and culture media preparation can be found in the supplement s2 the grown cultures were harvested by centrifugation 3500 x g 20 min at room temperature followed by washing and resuspending the pellet in a quarter strength ringer s solution sigma aldrich st louis usa this pelleting and washing step was repeated twice to remove any excess broth the bacterial suspension was then diluted to reach an optical density of 0 1 at 600 nm representing a concentration of 108 cfu ml 1 and was used to inoculate 250 ml of anoxic agw to reach a final concentration of 106 cfu ml 1 the concentration of the inoculation suspension c0 and the inoculated agw before and at the end of the breakthrough experiment and enumeration of the bacterial effluent concentrations were confirmed by dilution plating using selective media s2 elphinstone et al 1998 hélias et al 2012 furthermore bacterial hydrophobicity was analyzed using the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon math test as described by gargiulo et al 2008 2 4 data analysis and modeling breakthrough curves of the non reactive salt tracer and bacteria were analyzed with hydrus 1d simunek et al 2005 solute transport of the non reactive tracer is described by the advection dispersion equation under steady state flow conditions and a constant head 1 c t d 2 c x 2 ν c x where c is the solute concentration in the liquid phase m l 3 t is time t d is the

two different kinetic sites in hydrus 1d normalized c c0 values were used as input values and to model the tailing of the btc log transformation of c c0 was applied to overcome the great difference between maximum and minimum bacterial effluent concentrations schijven and šimůnek 2002 porosity θ and longitudinal dispersivity α l l α l d υ were both determined from salt tracer experiments and used as input values to model bacterial btc growth or die off of the bacteria was not considered within the time span of the experiments about 9 h as we have shown in batch experiments that die off in the water phase took only place after more than 24 h eisfeld et al 2021 hydrus 1d allows to compare the fit of a 1 or 2 site kinetic model by evaluating the coefficient of determination r2 and the akaike information criterion aic as output data from hydrus 1d the aic considers both the goodness of fit and parsimony of the models for our experiments the model with the smallest aic value was therefore chosen as best model the advection dispersion eq 2 accounts for reversibility of the bacterial attachment we compare these results with the cft that assumes a single grain size with perfect sphericity and smoothness where bacteria attach irreversibly we used the equations described by tufenkji and elimelech 2004 to calculate the single collector contact efficiency η0 and sticking

concentrations c c0 were fitted in hydrus 1d to obtain longitudinal dispersivity α l and porosity θ as shown in table s3 in quartz sand these parameters were evaluated for each experiment individually and the porosity was 0 37 0 40 with α l of 0 038 0 045 cm the same parameters were obtained in the aquifer sand experiments by combining the data of the chloride btcs of the replicate experiments per bacterium for r solanacearum in medium aquifer sand only two salt tracer tests were executed the porosity in fine and medium aquifer sand was lower 0 31 0 34 than in the quartz sand experiments whereas α l was considerably higher ranging between 0 28 1 5 cm α l of medium aquifer sand used for experiments with e coli was 1 51 cm thereby similar to the columns filled with fine sand 1 46 cm differences in porosity and longitudinal dispersivity may arise from combining data of the tracer btcs of the aquifer sand but also from column packing or variation in grain size distribution of the natural aquifer sand fig s1 these variations in dispersivity have also been reported by other authors oudega et al 2021 schijven et al 2002 but have little influence on the fitting and adsorption parameters 3 2 bacterial transport in quartz sand the bacterial btcs are shown in figs 1 and 2 the modified advection dispersion eq 2 for bacterial transport implemented in hydrus 1d was applied to fit the bacterial btcs table 2 shows the attachment and detachment parameters for a 1 or 2 site kinetic model in most cases the 2 site kinetic model showed a better fit when comparing the r2 and aic table s5 all btcs of quartz and natural mar sand were analyzed for blocking by fitting the blocking parameter smax1 e g hornstra et al 2018 in hydrus 1d in blocking available grain surfaces get occluded by for example attached bacteria which decreases the retention of other bacteria as less favorable sites are available ryan and elimelech 1996 adding the blocking parameter did not improve model fit considering the aic in all experiments the bacterial btcs coincided with the tracer btcs but the bacterial btcs showed a lower c c0 as consequence of bacterial attachment which we describe as removal fig 1 presents the results of the duplicate bacterial btcs in quartz sand additionally fig s3a compares the btcs of the four bacteria where c c0 is presented linearly while fig s3b displays the same results using log transformed c c0 values which allowed to identify the tails of the btcs caused by detachment e coli had the highest removal in quartz sand followed by p carotovorum and d solani r solanacearum was least removed reflected by a high c c0 of 0 85 in replicate 1 and a low katt1 of 6 day 1 in comparison katt1 was ten times higher for e coli 61 day 1 replicate 1 and the c c0 peak was 0 18 the bacterial btc of e coli was best fitted with the 1 site kinetic model and therefore removal is solely guided by kinetic site 1 the btc of the plant pathogenic bacteria were best fitted with the 2 site kinetic model but a comparison of the aics often showed little difference indicating that the 1 site model would also be an adequate fit at kinetic site 2 attachment occurred to a lesser extent than at site 1 katt2 1 4 day 1 while kinetic site 1 showed little detachment kdet1 0 03 2 2 day 1 detachment at site 2 was very high ranging from 11 112 day 1 note that katt1 of d solani and r solanacearum and all kdet2 rate coefficients show a very high standard deviation its implication will be discussed in the section of parameter evaluation overall the plant pathogenic bacteria were removed to a lesser extent than e coli and their btc peak had a higher c c0 value reported bacterial characteristics such as cell size surface charge or growth stage are similar for the selected bacteria moreover the results of the hydrophobicity test table s4 indicate that all bacteria are hydrophilic with little difference 2 1 8 9 in partitioning into the hydrophobic phase therefore other bacterial characteristics like the specific surface structure e g lipopolysaccharides may cause the different transport behaviors gilbert et al 1991 ginn et al 2002 nevertheless these were not further analyzed and should be addressed in future studies 3 3 bacterial transport in aquifer sand bacterial btcs in medium aquifer sand are shown in fig 2 a d the replicate experiments for each bacterium show a higher variability in aquifer than in quartz sand as a result of the greater heterogeneity of the sand material represented by a higher cu in some experiments retained bacteria from a previous replicate experiment detached and were measured in the effluent before the actual bacterial breakthrough was expected yet these concentrations were low 102 and once 103 cfu ml and were in the range or lower than the tail concentrations caused by detachment the peak breakthrough of the bacteria and the overall removal was not influenced for example during the transport of e coli in anoxic medium mar sand replicate 2 and 3 about 102 cfu ml were detected in the first sample taken after 1 min however katt1 as well as the overall removal were higher in replicate 2 and 3 in comparison to replicate 1 which did not yet contain attached bacteria in anoxic medium aquifer sand the c c0 values were at least three orders of magnitude lower than in the quartz sand differences in attachment to quartz and natural mar sand can also be explained by the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory derjaguin and landau 1993 verwey et al 1948 it describes the repulsive and attractive forces between the bacterial cell and grain surface clean quartz sand has a negative surface charge negative zeta potential that repulses negatively charged bacteria elimelech et al 2000 unfavorable attachment can occur when the distance between grain surface and bacterial cells gets small enough and the attractive van der waals forces dominate over the repulsive double layer favorable attachment occurs in natural sediments where metal oxides depict favorable attachment sites that attract negatively charged bacteria fine and medium mar sand had the same amount of fe and al metal oxides table s2 although the total extractable iron was higher in medium aquifer 21 0 6 mg l 1 than in fine aquifer sand 6 8 0 7 mg l 1 table s6 grain size played an important role in the retention of the bacteria as the mar sand has a larger fraction of fine sands compared to quartz providing a greater total surface area for attachment likewise the retention in fine mar sand has been greater than in medium mar sand they varied in the fraction of fine sands smaller than 250 µm which was about 77 in fine and 30 in medium mar sand these fractions of very fine sands silt and clay 32 µm 4 7 in fine and 3 2 in medium mar sand reduce the pore space which can result in a retention of the bacteria by size exclusion or a longer travel distance through the column this increases contact time and the chance of attachment of bacteria to the sand material murphy and ginn 2000 as observed in the quartz sand experiments e coli showed higher removal than the plant pathogenic bacteria comparing the btcs where the peak c c0 is on average 2 3 10 3 for e coli and 1 9 10 2 for p carotovorum and 1 4 10 2 for r solanacearum moreover katt1 coefficients were about ten times higher in medium aquifer sand ranging from 129 551 day 1 detachment at site 1 is negligible as values are small 1 day 1 similar to the quartz sand experiments the highest removal was achieved in fine aquifer sand under anoxic and oxygenated conditions where p carotovorum had a katt1 of 765 day 1 and 515 day 1 respectively the peak c c0 values in fine aquifer sand were very low 1 0 10 4 under anoxic and 8 1 10 4 under oxygenated conditions and effluent concentrations were at the limit of detection fig 2c d as a result of the high removal the breakthrough peak in fine sand columns was less pronounced in comparison to the shape of the btcs in quartz and medium aquifer sand experiments the effluent concentrations in the experiment with oxygenated fine sand were scattered and resulted in a poor model fit r2 0 21 although the data of the anoxic fine sand experiments were also scattered a reasonable fit using the 1 site kinetic model was achieved r2 0 81 here the initial breakthrough of the bacteria was noticeable which has a greater influence on r2 overall all btcs of p carotovorum in aquifer sand were better fitted with the 1 site kinetic model while the transport of e coli and r solanacearum in medium aquifer sand showed a better fit applying the 2 site kinetic model the katt2 and kdet2 values were in a similar range for r solanacearum about 25 day 1 while for e coli katt2 was higher 75 132 day 1 than kdet2 0 4 79 day 1 the results agree with the observations by schijven et al 2002 that site 1 is characterized by relatively fast attachment and slow detachment while site 2 is characterized by relatively fast attachment and fast detachment implying that attachment to site 1 mostly determines removal 3 4 parameter evaluation the 1 and 2 site kinetic models and associated parameter estimates resulted in a good fit of the bacterial breakthrough data as confirmed by aic and r2 yet we often found little differences between the 1 and 2 site kinetic models in terms of goodness of fit aic and r2 table s5 indicating both models would be a reasonable choice and that kinetic site 2 is less relevant e g e coli in quartz sand the rate coefficients of kinetic site 2 influenced the shape of the btc and improved model fit as for example the btc of p carotovorum replicate 2 in anoxic medium aquifer sand fig 2c there the 2 site kinetic model allowed a smooth transition from the declining limb towards the tail of the btc governed by katt2 and kdet2 schijven et al 2000 in contrast the 1 site kinetic model replicate 1 and 3 failed to model a smooth transition from the peak to the decline of the btc and the curve shape of the tail nevertheless fig 2c shows that the 1 site model represents sufficiently the curve shape of the btcs consequently site 2 was less important for the removal of the pathogens which was also represented by the high standard deviations of the parameters at site 2 e g kdet2 49 39 day 1 p carotovorum in quartz sand the peak c c0 was mainly determined by katt1 which was confirmed by calculating c c0 using only katt1 as input value using eq 5 the calculated c c0 and modeled c c0 by hydrus 1d were in the same range kdet1 determined the height of the tail and the values of c c0 at the tail are magnitudes lower than at the peak breakthrough in all experiments in the aquifer sand experiments the tail was about three orders of magnitude lower than the peak c c0 and in all experiment the tail could only be visualized using the semi log scale see fig s3 therefore the removal mechanism can be simplified and only described by irreversible attachment that neglects detachment we compared results of the reversible attachment detachment model with cft to evaluate katt1 in cft the removal of colloids bacteria is described with the single collector contact efficiency η0 and the sticking efficiency α from which an irreversible deposition rate can be calculated pang et al 2021 the results of η0 and α are shown in table 2 η0 was similar in quartz and aquifer sand 0 009 0 014 α values were low in quartz sand 0 018 0 176 reflecting little attachment while higher collision frequencies were represented by high α in aquifer sand 0 182 0 725 previously reported hijnen et al 2005 sticking efficiencies for e coli wr1 in column experiments with finer natural sandy soil d50 180 µm were 0 341 at 0 5 m day 1 and 0 424 at 0 9 m day 1 therefore lower than our results for e coli in medium aquifer sand α 0 540 0 725 at 3 6 m day 1 moreover cft predicts that finer sand results in higher sticking efficiencies yet in our results sticking efficiencies of p carotovorum in medium aquifer sand were similar or higher than in fine sand cft does not consider heterogeneities of the porous medium such as metal oxides that pose favorable attachment sites nor physiological bacterial characteristics like hydrophobicity or surface charge the attachment detachment model accounts for these heterogeneities which is reflected in higher katt1 comparing transport of p carotovorum in anoxic fine 765 day 1 and medium aquifer sand e g rep 1 184 day 1 finally although katt1 mostly governs removal detachment has to be taken into account as detached microorganisms re contaminate the water source and might pose a risk to the end user results of knappett et al 2014 pointed out detachment should not be ignored at the field scale 3 5 microbial removal rates to evaluate our results on a larger scale we analyzed log10 removal per meter that only takes into account irreversible attachment to site 1 these ranged between 0 42 for r solanacearum and 6 8 log10 m 1 for e coli in quartz sand a similar removal 4 69 log m 1 in quartz sand columns d50 250 µm were obtained for e coli j6 2 by weaver et al 2013 our quartz sand experiments allowed to investigate bacterial transport under very controlled conditions as the sand has a defined grain size and no favorable attachment sites there were no physicochemical differences between the quartz experiments except that the experiment with r solanacearum was done at room temperature previous research showed that temperature had little effect on bacterial deposition kim et al 2009 but it did influence the retention of viruses sasidharan et al 2017 consequently differences in transport are due to the nature of the bacterial species and their metabolic state which influences cell characteristics like hydrophobicity and surface charge bradford et al 2013 murphy and ginn 2000 compared to quartz sand the removal in anoxic medium aquifer sand was much higher for r solanacearum 18 log10 m 1 and p carotovorum 19 log10 m 1 and even 28 log10 m 1 for e coli similar removal of about 20 log m 1 were presented by oudega et al 2021 using column experiments with natural heterogeneous gravel material and the bacterium bacillus subtilis and a bacteriophage yet the authors found a much lower removal in the field 0 2 log m 1 which they explained by preferential flow paths that may occur in their studied aquifer and enhance the bacterial transport these large discrepancies between column and field studies have also been summarized by pang 2009 and need to be considered in risk assessments the highest removal 40 log10 m 1 was observed in oxic fine aquifer sand for p carotovorum this highlights the importance to know about the geological structure of a site although the aquifer sands used in our study had a similar d50 of 192 µm fine and 305 µm medium their removal capacity differed greatly this may be caused amongst others by the very fine fraction 125 µm which was 10 in fine sand and only 3 in medium aquifer sand table s1 therefore a detailed geological description of a mar site is very useful to predict removal of pathogens and field tests should be included if feasible 3 6 influence of oxygenation in this research the influence of oxygenation of the aquifer sand material and effects on the transport of p carotovorum was investigated the column filled with medium aquifer sand was first operated under anoxic conditions followed by flushing the column with oxic agw to simulate infiltration of oxic water into an anoxic aquifer oxygen levels in the column influent and effluent remained below 0 1 mg l 1 during anoxic experiments during the flushing the influent o2 concentration was about 12 mg l 1 while the effluent o2 levels were on average 1 4 mg l 1 lower than the influent indicating o2 consumption by chemical and or biological reactions within the column reactive transport modelling has shown that the injection of oxic water into an anoxic aquifer will modify the biological and geochemical properties of the aquifer and thereby could affect the microbial transport over time kruisdijk and van breukelen 2021 ferrous iron e g from minerals like pyrite is oxidized and results in formation of positively charged iron oxide coatings which can increase bacterial attachment due to their negative surface charge johnson et al 1996 for example virus attachment was reduced under anoxic conditions in field experiments schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 while sub oxic conditions increased virus removal due to positively charged metal oxides hornstra et al 2018 in contrast our results unexpectedly show that removal of p carotovorum decreased under oxygenated conditions compared to prior anoxic conditions the average removal was 19 1 3 log10 m 1 under anoxic and 13 4 log10 m 1 under oxic conditions the transport in oxygenated fine aquifer sand also resulted in lower removal although the flushing with oxygen rich water was done for a shorter time 2 days here the removal was 40 log10 m 1 under anoxic and 31 log10 m 1 under oxic conditions on the one hand lower retention during oxic experiments may have been a result of fewer available attachment sites due to retained cells of p carotovorum during the anoxic medium mar experiments on the other hand we expect that most the bacteria died off during the two weeks flushing with oxic agw eisfeld et al 2021 or detached during flushing with deionized water which changed the ionic strength foppen et al 2007 moreover the retention of p carotovorum in oxic medium mar sand in replicate 2 was just as high katt1 215 day 1 as during the anoxic experiments katt1 129 202 day 1 which indicates that there were still sufficient attachment sites available the two other replicate experiments 1 3 under oxic conditions showed less removal under oxic conditions calculated sticking efficiencies that were lower in oxic compared to the anoxic experiments in medium and fine aquifer sand as stated earlier oxygen rich water modifies the geochemistry of an anoxic aquifer but also acts as an environmental signal for microorganisms that may trigger metabolic changes which consequently modifies attachment as response to anoxic conditions microorganism can modify their gene expression which may lead to the production of different surface structures e g lipopolysaccharides and alterations in surface charge as shown for e coli landini and zehnder 2002 castro and tufenkji 2008 analyzed the transport of e coli o157 h7 and yersinia enterocolitica under low and high oxygen concentrations while e coli had a higher sticking efficiency under oxic conditions attachment of y enterocolitica was increased under anoxic conditions the authors assumed that growing the bacteria either aerobically or anaerobically resulted in differences in the cell surface structure and surface charge similarly the plant pathogenic bacteria have adaptation strategies that changes their transcriptional response and surface properties in response to environmental changes lisicka et al 2018 to conclude expected improvement in removal due to oxygenation was not observed as the duration of the oxygenation may have been insufficient to increase the presence of iron oxides future research is needed to further investigate the effects of oxygenation on the porous media and its effects on the pathogens and natural microbiota to evaluate it overall effects on pathogen transport 3 7 applicability to mar systems column experiments are an important tool in the assessment of bacterial transport because environmental conditions can be better controlled than in the field nevertheless upscaling of these results to field scale needs to be done with caution as results may overestimate the actual removal in the field particularly when the variation in grain size distribution with depth is poorly characterized oudega et al 2021 pang 2009 the quality of the water used for injection should also be considered in translating column results to the field scale in our study high inoculation concentrations 106 cfu ml 1 were used to enable measuring the breakthrough over a longer period but this does not represent concentrations of plant pathogenic bacteria found in surface waters which are about 0 1 103 cfu ml 1 wenneker et al 1999 moreover the applied flow velocity of 3 6 m day 1 represents high groundwater flow during constant injection under realistic conditions water will be injected during rain events but recovered at a different time point and the velocity in the aquifer will be lower especially during periods without infiltration lower velocity results in higher contact time of the pathogens with the grain surface which favors attachment and residence time is an essential factor in mar operation hendry et al 1999 massmann et al 2008 field experiments with pathogenic organisms are often prohibited therefore we included e coli wr1 as reference organism for future field experiments yet e coli wr1 had the highest removal in quartz and aquifer sand in comparison to the plant pathogenic bacteria which makes it unsuitable for direct comparison to these pathogens in a future study an alternative surrogate for field experiments should be tested in column experiments beforehand to evaluate the comparability with the plant pathogens nevertheless the results showed that the aquifer sands were an effective filter to remove bacterial pathogens future work will combine the results of this study on filtration processes with those of die off experiments with the same plant pathogens eisfeld et al 2021 in a quantitative microbial risk assessment model to aid the design e g minimal travel distances and residence times of mar systems 4 conclusions plant pathogenic bacteria are a threat to global agricultural production and dissemination of plant diseases via contaminated irrigation water has often been observed irrigation water availability is under pressure due to water scarcity and the deterioration of surface water quality we studied if aquifer storage and recovery as solution for water scarcity could deliver safe irrigation water by means of plant pathogen removal during transport in natural sediments in laboratory column experiments we showed the effective removal of three plant pathogenic bacteria in natural sediments from a mar site and compared the transport with the human pathogen e coli wr1 removal parameters were obtained by modeling the results in hydrus 1d the heterogeneous natural aquifer sands had a higher up to several log10 pathogen removal capacity than quartz sand oxygenation of the anoxic aquifer sands did not increase removal contrary to our expectations tailing caused by detachment has been observed in all btcs but was several magnitudes lower than the peak c c0 suggesting that it may be neglected however detachment has to be considered as trace levels of highly infectious pathogens may still be present after soil treatment the quartz sand experiments represent non favorable conditions for attachment and results may be used as worst case scenario in risk assessments in conclusion our study confirms the potential of mar as a natural water treatment technology in agricultural settings to store and supply both fresh and bacterially safe irrigation
