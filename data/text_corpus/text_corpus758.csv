3790,dam reservoirs are complex depositional systems which provide barriers to natural sediment transport along river courses in addition reservoir sedimentation causes serious problems in their operational management given the wide variability of reservoir bottom shapes total volumes of stored water river discharges sediment loads and sediment textures universal depositional models are difficult to achieve for dam reservoirs this article focuses on the need to improve current understandings of sedimentation processes and thorough spatial particle size distribution in dam reservoirs to achieve this aim sonar and ground penetrating radar surveys were combined with high resolution stratigraphic data from 44 short sediment cores in two valley type reservoirs seč and křižanovice part of a reservoir cascade in the chrudimka river which is a left hand tributary of the labe river czech republic sonar survey was used to construct bathymetric maps and bottom reflection intensity images the results showed topography inherited from pre reservoir times and a good degree of correspondence between bottom reflection intensity and grain size the sedimentation patterns exhibit distinct proximal to distal and transversal changes in sediment facies and grain size pre reservoir and present morphologies have substantially shaped sediment accumulation spatial grain size sorting is a function of travel distance within reservoirs which is conditioned by their bended and narrow geometry as well as by reservoir management two stages of reservoir sedimentation are recognised the initial stage was characterised by the filling of local depressions which were overlain by the second stage typified by continuous and horizontally deposited sediments relatively low sediment accumulation rates from 0 2 to 1 06 cm year are the consequence of reservoir characteristics capacity and associated accommodation space and factors at a basin scale low discharge geology and land use slow reduction of reservoir capacity was observed the calculated trap efficiency is very high in the seč reservoir and much lower in the křižanovice reservoir the main factor controlling trap efficiency is reservoir capacity and shape combined with low inflow ultimately the trap efficiency change over time because of varying reservoir capacity due to seasonal water level fluctuation and varying hydrologic conditions due to the slow silting of the reservoir the trap efficiency has decreased only slightly aside from general trends some specific features exist for every reservoir based on local geometry and reservoir management strategy this implies that an innovative approach combining map sonar and geophysical surveys with core data is required to develop better facies models and to optimise sediment management strategies keywords reservoir sediments bathymetry ground penetrating radar sediment accumulation rate trap efficiency high resolution stratigraphy 1 introduction an increasing number of reservoirs reservoir cascades and ponds worldwide create significant barriers to sediment transport in fluvial environments vörösmarty et al 2003 kummu and varis 2007 ran et al 2013 wisser et al 2013 sediments accumulated in dammed reservoirs are commonly used as environmental archives documenting flood events past trophic conditions land use changes and in particular pollution history e g shotbolt et al 2001 förstner 2004 van metre and mahler 2004 wildi et al 2004 audry et al 2010 palanques et al 2014 sedláček et al 2017 however the use of reservoir sediments as archives can be limited due to their lithological heterogeneity pre dam bottom topography sediment reworking and other factors in some works a single master core has been studied under the assumption that it can represent the history of the whole reservoir e g nehyba et al 2011 dhivert et al 2015 but most researchers work with multiple cores located in various part of the reservoir to encompass the lithologic variability snyder et al 2006 palanques et al 2014 sedláček et al 2017 the selection of coring sites is crucial as too few cores in non representative locations may provide pitfalls for interpretation on the other hand the retrieval of multiple cores and data processing requires large amounts of time hence better reservoir facies models are necessary to optimise coring strategies many parameters affect the sedimentation in dams and consequently the total volume and internal architecture of sedimentary bodies as well as their utilization as environmental archives the pre reservoir floodplain morphology is an important variable that controls sediment distribution after the dam construction venteris et al 2014 knowledge about the pre reservoir morphology helps to identify past and current sediment accumulation sites and calculate the sediment thickness and architecture moorman et al 2001 odhiambo and boss 2004 viseras et al 2009 the geometry of a dam reservoir affects sediment transport and distribution in the reservoir the valley reservoirs which are the most frequent type are long narrow shallower in the upstream part and deeper near the dam producing a distinct longitudinal depositional gradient shotbolt et al 2005 in the basin shaped reservoirs the sediment thickness varies both longitudinally and transversally in many reservoirs the sedimentary infill pinches out from the inflow towards the dam creating wedge like bodies shotbolt et al 2005 sedláček et al 2013 2017 pacina et al 2020 in others especially small reservoirs the maximum thickness is attained in the distal parts close to the dam occasionally creating a so called muddy lake area shotbolt et al 2005 dhivert et al 2015 sedláček et al 2016 whereas in long and narrow reservoirs sediments tend to accumulate in the medial parts of the reservoir body snyder et al 2004 consequently the dam reservoirs may develop deltaic deposits wedge shaped deposits with maximum thickness near the dam tapering deposits with maximum thickness near the inflow or uniform deposits with more less constant thickness morris and fan 1997 in addition sedimentation in reservoirs is largely governed by hyperpycnal flows balacco et al 2004 lai and capart 2009 and or further influenced by anthropogenic manipulations with water level lópez et al 2016 sediment reworking due to wind action teeter et al 2001 and underwater currents and slides shotbolt et al 2005 the variability of depositional styles infers the trap efficiency percentage of sediment trapped in the reservoir out of the total sediment input of dam reservoirs morris and fan 1997 which in turn have critical impact on reservoir lifespan effects of downstream river bed erosion by sediment starved waters and finally the coastal areas morris and fan 1997 vörösmarty et al 2003 kummu and varis 2007 smith et al 2017 reservoir sedimentation is one of the main problems in their operational management worldwide causing loss of storage capacity turbine abrasion blockage of bottom outlets and power intakes e g morris and fan 1997 guillén ludeña et al 2018 controlled sediment routing or removal is used in flushing operations in order to release sediment deposits out of the reservoir e g schüttrumpf and detering 2011 espa et al 2011 bladé castellet et al 2019 therefore there is a need for tools to control the effectiveness of these operations this variability of sedimentary processes combined with numerous negative effects of river damming implies the need for better facies models as well as a thorough understanding of the spatial particle size distribution in dam reservoirs in this study we investigated a cascade of two valley type reservoirs seč and křižanovice located in the chrudimka river of the labe elbe river catchment czech republic we studied the sedimentation processes in the reservoirs using a combination of sonar bathymetry ground penetrating radar surveys and multi proxy lithologic analysis of 44 shallow cores the aim of this paper was to obtain a robust information about sediment distribution sedimentation processes and stratigraphic architecture of the reservoir deposits the results enhance current understandings of sediment deposition in reservoirs and present a suitable workflow for sediment coring and the use of sediment archives detailed knowledge of sediment facies and particle size distribution can be used further to optimise sediment management strategies 2 geographic setting and history the seč and křižanovice reservoirs are located on the chrudimka river which is a left hand tributary of the labe elbe river in the central part of the czech republic fig 1 several reservoirs are located on the chrudimka river creating a reservoir cascade comprising the hamry seč seč i padrť seč ii křižanovice and křižanovice ii reservoirs in the downstream direction both studied sites represent valley type reservoirs relatively narrow in the proximal part and broader near the dam wall the seč reservoir was built earlier between 1924 and 1935 as a flood control measure at present the reservoir is used for hydroelectric generation fishing and recreation activities its total volume is 21 795 mm3 and its surface area is 220 1 ha its mean annual inflow discharge is 2 28 m3s 1 q10 77 q50 129 and q100 157 m3s 1 and outflow 2 41 m3s 1 the outflow value is not a constant but is determined at different levels which are given by the water level in the reservoir at different periods during the year nevertheless the minimum outflow is set at 0 5 m3s 1 the křižanovice reservoir is much smaller and was built later between 1947 and 1953 for electricity production and water storage its volume is 2 036 mm3 its flooded area is 31 8 ha and its mean annual inflow discharge is 2 61 m3s 1 q10 69 9 q50 118 and q100 142 m3s 1 and an average outflow 2 61 m3s 1 minimum outflow is 0 37 m3s 1 the outflow is governed by the same principles as in the case of the seč reservoir for detailed information about the reservoirs see table 1 compared to other czech reservoirs such as the plumov sedláček et al 2016 the nové mlýny sedláček et al 2017 and the les království bábek et al 2020 seč and křižanovice reservoirs do not have significant problems with silting and therefore sediment removal or flushing was not carried out in the past only local dredging was performed in the křižanovice reservoir in front of the bottom outlet in years 2007 and 2018 both reservoirs experience regular water level fluctuations the water level is drawn down about 4 6 m in the seč reservoir and 2 3 in the křižanovice reservoir usually each autumn to provide storage capacity for the next spring runoff and then the water level is restored to its normal capacity lower water levels are also connected to drought periods due to low inflow detailed graphs showing variations in inflow discharge and water level are presented in fig 2 for the last two decades data shared by the operator povodí labe sp the catchment area of the chrudimka river above the seč reservoir is 216 15 km2 and 256 45 km2 above the křižanovice reservoir with average elevations ranging between 680 m the chrudimka river spring area and 405 8 m křižanovice dam above sea level the territory is classified as a moderately warm and damp region with four seasons corresponding to the continental and temperate climatic zone köppen geiger climate classification system tolasz and baštýřová 2007 the mean annual precipitation in the catchments are 973 mm and 973 4 mm respectively lowest average monthly precipitation is typical for february 45 mm and highest for july 99 mm but mostly in the form of torrential rains mean annual temperatures range between 5 5 and 8 5 c depending on altitude evapotranspiration range between 200 mm in spring and 600 mm in autumn and winter tolasz and baštýřová 2007 the background geology comprises crystalline rocks especially gneiss migmatites and granulites metagranites of the kutná hora svratka crystalline unit and the bohemicum and granodiorite of the železné hory pluton chlupáč and štorch 1992 relics of cretaceous marine sediments are locally preserved the surface of the valleys is covered by quaternary sediments and soils the catchment areas comprise crop fields meadows and forests its land use changed in the second half of the 20th century during the communist era when the original mosaic of small crop fields was transformed into large parcels the reduction in the percentage of arable land occurred mostly after 1989 and conversely meadows began to expand 3 material methods and sampling strategy the bathymetry data were attained with the use of the humminbird helix 7 chirp di gps g2 sonar equipped with standard gps in combination with a small inflatable boat the sonar emits a cone shaped beam as the relative depth value is calculated from the time of the most intense reflection the depth values are constant when tilted both pitch and roll to an angle corresponding to half the apex angle of the cone the stability of the boat is then ensured by a slow ride up to 5 km h uniformly distributed load and low wave amplitudes a maximum of 10 cm the accuracy of the sonar used for this survey was in detail tested in other czech reservoirs pacina et al 2020 data obtained during extremely low water levels were used to verify the accuracy points directly measured with an rtk gnss receiver and photogrammetrically processed into a digital surface model the root mean square error of the measured elevations is approximately 10 20 cm the water bodies were scanned in lines arranged roughly perpendicular to the former river thalweg the line density was dependent on the size of the reservoir the nature of the reservoir bottom and identification of ideal sampling sites the density within the seč reservoir was one line per 100 m and within the křižanovice reservoir one line per 30 m the bathymetric datasets were acquired as single points in the wgs 84 coordinate system and later transformed into the czech national s jtsk coordinate system and stored in the esri file geodatabase the precise gnss receiver was used to estimate the altitude of the actual water level with approx 3 cm accuracy the relative water depth values were re calculated as elevations the topo to raster interpolation function implemented in arcgis was used to produce a digital elevation model dem of the reservoir bottom the spatial resolution of 5 m was used for the dems created for both reservoirs other spatial resolutions were tested as well but higher ones 1 m generate many interpolation artifacts and the lower ones 10 m was tested hide details in areas surveyed with higher point density ground penetrating radar gpr was placed on the small inflatable boat and dragged at a constant speed along the line a total of 69 longitudinal and transversal profiles were measured by gssi terrasirch 3000 conyers inc usa gpr equipped with 400 mhz frequency antenna its use was limited by water depth maximum penetration 4 m through the water column due to the absorbance of the gpr signal by the conductive water environment raw gpr data were filtered using dewow background removal manual gain band pass frequency and running average filters using reflexw software sandmeier germany water depth conversion of the two way travel time data from profiles was performed using sonar bathymetry and depth gauge data obtained during coring in total 29 short sediment cores fig 1 were taken from the seč reservoir marked as seč 1 to 29 and 15 cores from the křižanovice reservoir marked as křiž 1 to 15 using a floating platform the sampling sites were selected based on the study of historical aerial bathymetric and bottom reflection intensity data prior to sampling gpr measurements were also performed the core recovery was performed using a rod operated multisampler piston corer with an inner diameter of 4 5 cm eijkelkamp the netherlands in shallow parts of reservoirs maximum 4 m in deeper water cores were recovered using a uwitec gravity corer sampler austria with hydraulic core catcher into tubes with an inner diameter of 6 3 cm the maximum sediment penetration depth was 0 85 m in the seč reservoir and 0 74 m in the křižanovice reservoir the cores were sampled with a 1 or 2 cm vertical interval depending on lithology and required resolution surface samples were taken along three transverse transects fig 1 in the proximal sečd3 1 to 9 middle seč d2 1 to 17 and distal parts sečd1 1 to 20 of the seč reservoir using a van veen grab sampler eijkelkamp the netherlands subsequently the samples were air dried under ambient conditions and stored in plastic bags all samples were analysed for low field mass specific magnetic susceptibility using kly 4s kappabridge agico czech republic with a magnetic field intensity of 300 a m 1 operating frequency of 920 hz and sensitivity of 3 10 8si the grain size distribution of selected core and surface samples was analysed by a fritsch analysette 22 mircotec plus laser particle sizer fritsch gmbh germany with a measuring range of 0 01 to 2000 µm prior to analysis the samples were homogenised and mixed into a paste in water and one drop of surfactant dusazin 901 was added floating coarse organic detritus if present was removed manually the sediment colour of dry sample aliquots powdered to analytical fineness was analysed by visible light diffuse reflectance spectroscopy vis drs using a hand held x rite sp62 spectrophotometer x rite inc usa with a tungsten light source d 8 measurement geometry and 8 mm aperture the data were visualised in ciel a b colour space selected cores seč 17 25 and 28 křiž 8 11 and 13 were analysed for 137cs mass activity with vertical interval 6 cm to increase the sample mass minimum mass needed for this method was 20 g using a laboratory gamma spectrometer sg 1000 lab with nai tl scintillation detector with detection limit 9 bq kg 1 and 30 min measurement time the results were expressed as depth distribution in 137cs mass activity 4 results 4 1 bathymetry and subsurface sediment architecture the detailed bathymetry survey indicated a high gradient in the present bottom morphology in both reservoirs fig 1 the water depth increases gradually in the downstream direction in the seč reservoir a narrow 100 m upstream portion near the inflow is characterised by very shallow to shallow 1 2 m water depths the water depth then gradually increases to 3 m the valley bottom is relatively flat with gentle slopes and a low thalweg gradient of about 2 5 m km further downstream slopes are steeper and the reservoir width 200 m and water depth increase the reservoir basin with maximum depths of up to 27 5 m is located near the dam 40 m here the thalweg gradient increases to 5 m km the bathymetry survey revealed that the bottom topography has been inherited from pre reservoir times the main feature of the bottom topography represents a former channel of the chrudimka river still visible on the present valley floor exhibiting a low sinuosity bent depression a similar bathymetry pattern was observed in the křižanovice reservoir showing a shallow water depth in the proximal part 3 m and a gradual depth increase 7 10 m in the medial parts to the dam wall with a maximum depth of about 14 m the reservoir width is rather uniform and varies from 90 to 240 m the widest profile is located in the medial parts near the core site křiž 12 sonar data were used to estimate bottom reflection intensity fig 3 which is inferred from the amplitude of the reflected sound wave and indicates the ability of the bottom cover to absorb this wave as a result a high reflection amplitude implies higher bottom hardness and it is accompanied by multiple reflections the wave can reflect easily back to the water surface such reflection is typical of rocky bottoms i e without sediment cover or for coarse grained sediments in contrast softer fine grained clayey and silty sediments reveal a single reflection with lower amplitude due to a stronger absorption bottom reflection intensity was visualised as an interpolated raster layer the higher values of bottom reflection intensity were found in the proximal parts of the seč reservoir on its margins and close to the dam wall particularly high values were measured on the east reservoir bank northeast of the mid reservoir island here reservoir borders with several metre high cliffs were noted which continue below the water level to the bottom conversely lower values were measured in the central part of the valley generally mirroring the thalweg this zone begins after the first bend of the reservoir and narrows near the coring site 26 it is widest near the coring sites 24 and 25 low intensity values also occur in the inflow part around coring sites 6 and 7 on the other hand higher values seem to coincide here with the former channel bottom reflection intensity values are lower in the proximal and central parts of the křižanovice reservoir towards the dam wall the reflection intensities increase except for several places with lower values located around the coring site křiž 13 the gpr survey was able to acquire detailed bottom topography in the inflow parts of both reservoirs to a maximum water depth of 4 m as the water depth increases the reflections begin to fade selected profiles are presented in fig 4 all profiles exhibit a clear bottom reflection at the water sediment interface indicating the present day bottom surface the reservoir floor extends from inclined slopes at the reservoir margins to a flat bottom in the reservoir centre the former channel of the chrudimka river is the most prominent element of the bottom morphology and reveals some inherited characteristics from the previous fluvial stage under the reservoir floor several units were distinguished depending on the type of reflections less inclined channel slopes tend to accumulate sediment by lateral accretion seč 6 profile fig 4 and conversely no sediment is deposited in more steeply cut banks another possible explanation points to underwater slide almost no sediment is deposited within the channel itself in the inflow part as indicated by mounded reflections in the seč 5 profile fig 4 but a thin sediment layer is indicated by subhorizontal parallel reflections on the channel slopes and channel bottom in seč 4 and seč 6 profiles lower parts of all profiles are characterised by low frequency noise while the overlying high frequency sediment layer refers to high frequency lacustrine sediments the lower unit is composed of an altered bedrock or fluvial sequence in which the mounded and hyperbolic reflections are probably caused by the presence of large clasts and boulders the onset of reservoir sedimentation is visible in most profiles and represents an important stratigraphic surface of the former valley floor two units of reservoir sediments can be distinguished on the flat platform depending on the internal architecture fig 4 first the older unit tends to copy the pre reservoir bottom due to compensation and levelling off the bottom after filling it causes higher sediment thickness in local depressions subhorizontal reflectors characterise the second overlaying unit the onlap of reservoir sediment to the bedrock was identified in reservoir margins on steeply inclined slopes the reflection of the reservoir sediment unit varies according to its position within the reservoir profiles located close to the inflow display poor hummocky or saw tooth reflections while more distal profiles display relatively smooth and well defined reflectors slight evidence of downstream accretion can be observed in the longitudinal profiles 4 2 lithology based on visual observations and other analyses we identified two main lithological units present in the cores the lower unit comprises massive brown to yellow brown sands and small rock fragments of colluvial or fluvial sequence deposited before reservoir filling the upper younger unit is represented by the reservoir sediments the lithology of reservoir sediments varies in a proximal to distal direction brown grey or light brown sandy silts to silts with occasional layers of fine to coarse sand very common plant wood remains and phytodetritus and no lamination present prevail in the inflow parts homogeneous grey to black grey silts or clayey silts prevail in distal parts rarely with the admixture of fine grained sands the boundary between both units represents the onset of lacustrine sedimentation this boundary is sharp and easily identified colour and textural change in some cores for example seč 5 yet this transition is rather gradual and diffuse in other cores however this sedimentary sequence is not found in all cores the thickness of reservoir sediments varies across the reservoir from 15 cm seč 10 to 60 cm seč 27 in the seč reservoir minimum thickness is generally found in some proximal cores seč 5 10 11 and 17 while in distal cores it is higher seč 21 25 28 and 29 but this trend is not true for all cores differences in sediment thickness could also be observed in nearby cores seč 11 showed only 32 cm of reservoir sediments it was located near the thalweg while seč 12 was much thicker 60 cm a sharper lithological contrast was found between the main sediment units in the křižanovice reservoir the older pre reservoir unit is composed of poorly sorted light coloured grey or grey brown medium to coarse sands silty sands occasionally containing clasts 1cm the thickness of the reservoir sediments varies from 10 to 45 cm slightly rising in the flow direction maximum thickness can be observed in the core křiž 12 reservoir sediments are more fine grained in general dark grey black or grey brown coloured an exception is found in inflow facies composed of medium to coarse grained sands and silty sands downstream the sediment can be classified as sandy silts or silts with occasional sandy layers silts or clayey silts have been deposited near the dam wall lamination is usually absent aside from some parts of the proximal cores revealing sandy layers or laminae křiž 8 phytodetritus and plant remains were common 4 3 petrophysical patterns magnetic susceptibility and mass activity of 137cs mass specific ms values vary widely from 2 57 10 9 m3kg 1 core seč 14 depth 31 33 cm to 7 18 10 7 m3kg 1 core seč 5 depth interval 16 18 cm in the seč reservoir and from 2 16 10 8 m3kg 1 core křiž 10 depth 10 cm to 3 7 10 6 m3kg 1 křiž 7 depth 62 cm in the křižanovice reservoir some cores are characterised by extremely low variability of ms while others exhibit local minima and maxima on an ms log the greatest dispersion of values was generally found in the lower parts of some cores seč 5 11 12 14 which can be related to the heterogeneous nature of underlying alluvial sediments while in other cores parts that were composed of alluvial sediments the depth pattern of ms was almost constant core seč 19 ms of the pre reservoir sediments was significantly higher up to two orders of magnitude in the křižanovice reservoir the onset of reservoir sedimentation is characterised by a sharp decrease in ms values in some cores free of a fluctuating upward pattern with typical values in the range of 3 5 10 7 m3kg 1 in proximal cores and about 1 3 10 7 m3kg 1 in distal cores aside from this uniform trend a slight saw tooth pattern was found in křiž 1 and křiž 4 cores revealing local minima and maxima in the ms log the minor ms increase was observed at the subsurface or surface layers of some cores through the reservoir cores křiž 1 8 10 and 15 the 137cs mass activity exhibited a distinct peak in all measured cores fig 5 137cs mass activity values varied from values below the detection limit 9 bq kg 1 to 172 bq kg 1 background values found in the deepest parts of the sediment cores were typically below the instrument detection limit maximum values were detected in the seč 25 core with a value of 152 bq kg 1 and 172 bq kg 1 in the křiž 11 core in general lower peak values were observed in the proximal parts and were slightly higher in the distal parts of the reservoirs the peak of 137cs was located at a depth interval of 12 18 cm core seč 17 30 36 cm core seč 28 depth profiles of 137cs mass activity were characterised by a sharp increase followed by a peak and subsequently a progressive decrease in the top layers such a pattern was observed in the cores seč 17 seč 28 and křiž 13 in contrast a gradual increase was observed in cores seč 25 křiž 8 and 11 mass activity rose from depths of 24 to 30 cm to a maximum of 6 12 cm below the surface 4 4 grain size grain size distribution was analysed in selected cores all or half of the samples and for all surface samples if the lithological contrast between pre and reservoir sediments was sometimes unclear the main textural difference was found in the presence of coarse to very coarse sand and occasionally gravel grains in the former unit moreover histograms of the pre reservoir sediment showed a presence of a coarse fraction centred at 0 5 mm and typically exhibiting a polymodal distribution the overall trends indicate changing sediment texture in the proximal to distal direction in both reservoirs fig 6 downcore grain size variations were found in proximal cores showing a saw tooth pattern while a more uniform depth distribution was observed in some distal cores the silt and sand percentage varied widely while clay proportions were more stable the dominant fraction was silt in most cores but samples from inflow and proximal parts were characterised by an abundance of sand fig 6 significant sand proportions were observed until the first third of the seč reservoir and sand proportions decreased downstream except for some local peaks core seč 29 but these showed very fine or fine sand the minor sand increase was observed in some cores through the reservoir in the subsurface samples the general trend refers to the gradual increase in clay proportions in the proximal to distal direction the typical clay percentage was about 5 8 in the inflow part growing to 8 10 in the middle part and then to the highest proportions 11 16 close to the dam wall core seč 28 box plots of the grain size median d50 were constructed for reservoir sediments in selected cores through the seč reservoir along the thalweg according to ternary plots fig 6 most samples are classified as silts and sandy silts according to folk s classification 1974 similar grain size trends were observed in the křižanovice reservoir fig 6 the heterogeneous texture was observed up to 700 m from the inflow silt dominated in most of the cores except for the inflow part where sand prevailed silt proportions revealed a fluctuating pattern from 24 to 65 increasing and more stable silt proportions were found in the distal cores but significant sand proportions were also found there for example in the core křiž 8 up to 77 in subsurface layers fig 6 and in the most distal core křiž 15 up to 29 just as in the seč reservoir the difference was in the proportions of individual sand fractions the admixture or a substantial amount of medium to very coarse sand grains were observed in the proximal cores while mostly very fine or fine sand was present in the distal sites the clay proportions were mostly very low varying from 3 to 7 in the inflow and slightly rising in the flow direction typical clay proportions varied from 4 to 10 in the middle part core křiž 8 then from 8 to 13 in the distal cores cores křiž 12 and 15 there the depth pattern of grain size was free of fluctuations the surface samples revealed a gradual decrease in grain size in the flow direction the dominant fraction was silt in the surface layers but the ratio between fine and coarse silt was almost constant the inflow samples contained substantial amounts of fine to medium sand while in the distal samples the sand fraction was composed of very fine sand grains the clay proportions increased downstream from 4 5 to 8 10 the general longitudinal trend shows a gradual in the seč reservoir or more rapid in the křižanovice reservoir downstream decrease of d50 fig 7 as expected with only some local excursions present the grain size median is quite variable in the first third of the seč reservoir length then the values decrease behind coring site 17 and become more uniform they vary in a narrower interval grain size median slight increases in the section between coring sites seč 24 and 29 finally the lowest values of d50 were found in distal parts of the reservoir core seč 28 similarly the grain size median is variable in the very proximal part of the křižanovice reservoir and then shows a rapid decrease towards the medial part of the reservoir behind coring site 8 subsequently the values tend to be uniform and finally a slight increase was observed near the dam wall coring site 15 we also compared the grain size characteristics in the surface layers top 2 cm of all cores to document the current spatial grain size variability across the seč reservoir fig 8 the general trend shows a gradual decrease of d50 the inflow part is characterised by greater variability up to an extreme value of 337 µm and a large proportion of coarse to very coarse sand in the core seč 13 which was probably caused by the presence of eroded bank material otherwise d50 ranges from 35 to 81 µm depending on the position relative to the thalweg sand proportions decrease downstream and there is a difference in the proportions of individual sand fractions coarse and very coarse sand does not occur after the first bend of the reservoir 1 km core seč 17 behind the inflow and finally only very fine sand occurs in the most distal site core seč 28 downstream d50 decreases to 23 33 µm in the middle part and finally to 18 µm in the most distal site the c m diagram passega 1957 1964 was constructed to discriminate between sediment transport and deposition processes fig 9 the c parameter should be the 99th percentile d99 and the m parameter represents the grain size median d50 for low reproducibility of d99 we used d90 percentile to be more representative as suggested by dhivert et al 2015 the relationship between c and m indicates the effect of sorting by water currents and bottom turbulence passega 1957 1964 three domains have been defined suggesting particle transport under distinct sedimentation regimes the first domain with low c and m parameters and c m 3 ratios is parallel to the c m line and indicates sedimentation from suspension it mainly comprises distal samples from both reservoirs the second domain non parallel to the c m line and with higher c m values and higher c m ratios c m 3 to 10 suggests a graded suspension transport mode under higher energy conditions this means that the coarsest sand particles could be transported in suspension during floods bravard et al 2014 the third domain exhibiting high c m values and variable c m ratios comprises sediments deposited in a high energy environment the particles were transported as bed load in the channel bottom predominantly in the proximal part of the reservoirs core seč 24 transport mode depends not only on particle diameter density and shape but also on hydraulic conditions which are determined by reservoir size and operation ehrbar et al 2018 the depth profiles of d50 and d90 percentiles and c m line were constructed in order to identify past changes in the transport type as shown for the two nearby cores seč 11 and 12 in the proximal part of the seč reservoir fig 10 both cores were located in the same distance from the inflow however one core seč 11 was located near the thalweg while the other was drilled in a shallower place seč 12 the depth pattern of d50 is almost constant in both cores while several deflections were found on the d90 depth profile showing some extreme values exceeding 800 μm in the seč 12 core the values were lower for the seč 11 core the samples having high d90 values also exhibit different domain on the c m diagram indicating a higher water turbulence the logs of grain size parameters were compared to ms logs fig 10 in addition the variability in grain size was evaluated in a cross sectional profile d2 in the seč reservoir using grab samples fig 11 sediments are relatively coarse grained typically with bimodal or polymodal distribution d50 from 30 to 60 µm on both steeply inclined slopes near the reservoir banks in the centre of the reservoir where the floor is flat or only gently inclined former floodplain sediments are much finer and show unimodal distribution with relatively constant d50 20 µm fig 11 it is important to note that the very central part of reservoir with a flat bottom the former river thalweg fig 11 samples d8 and d9 has a more coarse grained distribution than the surrounding samples on the gently inclined reservoir floor this suggests that the thalweg is prone to more dynamic conditions likely related to hyperpycnal flows than the surrounding pre reservoir floodplain which tend to accumulate sediment only by suspension settling 4 5 sediment colour colour contrast was found between two main sediment units in the seč reservoir pre reservoir sediment revealed high brightness ciel typically in the range of 60 to 63 or even 70 core seč 19 and higher ciea and cieb which supports visual observation ciea vs cieb plots were constructed to visualise this difference fig 12 unfortunately there was gradual or no colour change after reservoir filling while an abrupt change ciel was observed in the cores seč 17 25 and 28 the depth distribution of all vis drs data usually exhibits a more heterogeneous pattern in the inflow and proximal cores while a uniform pattern is typical for distal cores in accordance with the ms and grain size logs slight shifts in cieb values were found i e to yellow shades for distal samples a partial positive correlation was found between brightness and ms values in the sense of main deflections for reservoir sediments while in some cores or parts there was no correlation distinct trends in sediment colour were found in the křižanovice reservoir proximal sediments are on average darker ciel values from 51 6 to 57 9 core křiž 2 becoming paler downstream ciel values from 58 1 to 62 9 core křiž 11 as well as near a dam wall ciel values from 60 4 to 62 2 core křiž 13 the slight downstream shift was observed in ciea and significant in the cieb axis suggesting a shift to yellow shades downstream as well as in the seč reservoir 5 discussion 5 1 geophysical survey bottom morphology and grain size a good level of correspondence was found between gpr profiles and bathymetric data in terms of bottom morphology the gpr is thus an efficient tool for underwater surveys in shallow reservoirs but it must be supported by data from the sediment cores for a more reliable interpretation it was able to distinguish the former channel of the chrudimka river and visualise the reservoir bottom gpr was used to distinguish individual facies within the reservoirs as confirmed in other works moorman et al 2001 viseras et al 2009 the gpr survey revealed poorly defined reflectors close to the inflow showing either the former floodplain sediments or reworked reservoir sediments this reflection type agrees with the heterogeneous nature of coarse grained inflow sediments several types of gpr reflections allow us to describe internal structures and facies with different dielectric constants moorman et al 2001 have distinguished three basic reflection types in lake sediments and this concept can also be applied to the seč reservoir well defined reflectors 1 of reservoir sediments create continuous near horizontal lines in cross section hyperbolic reflections 2 are generated by small bodies for example boulders and bedrock pinnacles chaotic reflection 3 is typical for discontinuous layers containing coarser clasts and disturbed layering such an instance of chaotic reflection was identified close to the inflow of the seč reservoir supporting our assumptions about sediment reworking and the deposition of relatively heterogeneous coarse grained sediments in the reservoir inflow as confirmed by the results of the grain size analysis this type of reflection can be assigned to a fluvial or colluvial sequence below the reservoir sediments the downstream transition from hummocky wavy and asymmetric to smooth symmetric reflections of the uppermost sediment layer found in both studied reservoirs reflects downstream facies change a similar pattern was described in the ship creek reservoir in alaska hunter et al 2003 and alhama reservoir in spain viseras et al 2009 a good degree of agreement was found between bottom reflection intensity estimated from the sonar and grain size data obtained from the corresponding sediment samples the suitability of the geophysical imaging of sediment bottom reflection intensity which is related to sediment texture and type has rarely been indicated for mapping of the bottom cover e g venteris et al 2014 it is based on acoustic reflectance and therefore the amplitude of the reflected sound waves soft reservoir sediments can be characterised by a single reflection and lower intensity of returning waves while hard bedrock and coarse grained sediments are characterised by a double or multiple reflection with higher intensity soft bottom reflection is typical of zones along the thalweg and in the valley centre especially in the middle and more distal parts of both reservoirs it coincides with fine grained sediments with a predominance of mud clay silt hard reflection of higher amplitude denotes the presence of coarser sediments or hard bedrock without fine sedimentary cover such a reflection occurred in the inflow part of reservoirs and at the steeply inclined margins around the flat bottom which is further supported by the gpr survey and grain size analysis both methods indicated the presence of coarse grained material on the reservoir margins correspondence between d50 and bottom reflection intensity was observed in the seč reservoir along cross sectional profile d2 as evident in fig 11 where samples having higher d50 also reveal higher values of bottom reflection intensity however only weak statistical correlation was found between the both parameters r2 0 27 for the whole reservoir it may be caused by many uncertainties between grain size and bottom reflection intensity such as the rapid alternation of coarse and fine grained subsurface layers unknown depth of penetration of the acoustic waves nepheloid layer etc while grain size measurements are point data bottom reflection intensity data refer to interpolated raster based layer we have found that using a combination of historic maps and present bathymetry is essential to selecting the best possible coring sites 5 2 sediment stratigraphy and deposition processes the particle size decreases in the proximal to distal direction fig 6 which is a common trend in reservoirs e g lópez et al 2016 sedláček et al 2017 reflecting decreasing hydrodynamic energy the most important variable affecting the sediment distribution is the basin geometry and the resulting available accommodation space actual water volume in the reservoir a relatively simple reservoir geometry highlights the role of longitudinal trends in both reservoirs which is related to current velocity and hence sediment transport capacity snyder et al 2004 no distinct gradient in reservoir sediment thickness was found that contradicts the results of other studies cf dhivert et al 2015 sedláček et al 2013 2017 sediment accumulation rates sar are similar across the studied reservoirs suggesting uniform deposition in the sense of morris and fan 1997 with a slight indication of tapering because sediments are thickest in the middle parts of reservoirs uniform and tapering deposits also occur in long and narrow reservoirs with small load of fine sediment and high water level fluctuation morris and fan 1997 the tendency to taper gently is also demonstrated by increasing bottom reflection intensity near the dam wall suggesting that there can be hard bedrock i e without reservoir sediments however there is a narrow strip of soft sediments along the thalweg pointing to the dam outlet in the seč reservoir sediment thickness rose gently in the křižanovice reservoir to the dam wall in addition grain size median and bottom reflection values are slightly higher near the dam wall because sediments can easily reach the dam wall in smaller reservoirs shotbolt et al 2005 sedláček et al 2016 the low lithological contrast between pre reservoir and reservoir sediments suggests a slow transition from fluvial to lacustrine domains in some cores i e slow reservoir filling in the initial stages this assumption is supported by petrophysical proxies revealing almost no change after reservoir filling especially in sites further from the thalweg such sites may be characterised by the calm deposition of overbank fines during the previous fluvial stage in contrast the onset of reservoir sedimentation was sharp in some cores near the thalweg most likely due to more rapid inwash as the reservoir first fills shotbolt et al 2001 another explanation refers to periodic sediment reworking inflow part blurring the boundary between fluvial and reservoir sediments changes in element concentrations or element ratios can help distinguish the onset of reservoir sedimentation matys grygar et al 2018 have found increases in ti and al si and a decrease in k and ca in seč reservoir sediments after filling as well as enhanced retention of the finest particulates especially fe and mn oxides the coincidence of the pre dam position of the chrudimka river channel with the present thalweg as revealed by bathymetric survey documents a stable channel course near the reservoir inflow almost no sediment has been deposited within the former channel due to strong underwater currents causing erosion this assumption is supported by the gpr images and bottom reflection intensity imaging because the former channel is characterised by more intense reflection than the surrounding area conversely sediments are mostly accumulated on the former flat valley floor river floodplain and outside the former river channel what is also evident in the gpr profiles 4 and 5 see fig 4 reservoir sediments tend to fill local depressions as again best illustrated by the gpr survey in these local depressions sediments are also easier to retain even when the water level is lowered following the levelling of the original bottom roughness these initial sediment packages were overlain by horizontal layers a typical deltaic complex was not recognised in the inflow cf sedláček et al 2017 bábek et al 2020 most likely resulting from the narrow and funnel like geometry of the reservoir inflow part its low depth fluctuating water level and very low sediment input from the river catchment there is no clear evidence of upward coarsening trends in the seč reservoir sediments only a minor increase in sand content was observed in the top 10 cm in some cores through the reservoir on the other hand an upward increasing proportion of sand suggests progradation in the křižanovice reservoir slight evidence of downstream accretion indicates that the depocentre is moving downstream through the action of hyperpycnical currents occasional coarse sandy layers are probably flood related event beds or are related to water level fluctuations however considering predominantly stable inflow discharge sediment input is rather a steady process large inflow events which would bring a large amount of sediments have rarely occurred in the last two decades fig 2 as the distance from the thalweg increases in the transverse direction current velocity decreases and a relatively fine grained sediment can be deposited relatively close to the inflow part cores seč 3 and 17 large dispersion of c and m parameters found in some very proximal cores suggests changes in the sediment transport type which are also shown in the c m diagram the coarse grain size distribution of some layers in the proximal cores might be related to changes in the water level rather than the floods this assumption is supported by the depth profiles of c d90 and m d50 parameters showing almost cyclic variations and sudden jumps in the c parameter coarsest fractions it indicates that this parameter is much more sensitive to the water level changes compared to the grain size median these sudden changes cannot be found elsewhere in the proximal parts of both reservoirs but only in the cores located in a greater distance from the thalweg and or having a low water depth such sites are more influenced by the water lever lowering compared to the sites in near the thalweg as depth and distance from the inflow increase the sedimentation pattern changes sediments additionally tend to accumulate in the former channel and within the deepest part of the central valley due to the accumulation of post depositional mobilised bottom sediments from the reservoir inflow and margins shotbolt et al 2005 this was confirmed by grain size data revealing uniform grain size distribution in the valley centre see fig 11 material containing soft reservoir sediments mixed with bank derived material is deposited on the steep slopes of reservoir margins this assumption is also supported by bottom reflection intensity because both reservoir margins show hard reflections the coarser grained nature of the sediment in the thalweg fig 11 indicates the role played by hyperpycnical flows in sediment distribution in contrast to the finer nature of sediment on the slopes of the thalweg which was likely deposited by suspension settling due to reservoir dynamics there is no fixed division of the studied reservoir bottoms to erosional transportation and accumulation zones in the sense of håkanson 1977 1981 the erosional zones are located at the reservoir margins close to the inflow and within the channel which are characterised by high levels of water turbulence shotbolt et al 2005 but not all such areas the accumulation zone is located in the central part of the reservoir as is common shotbolt et al 2005 but some sites of preferred accumulation were also identified in isolated spots in the proximal parts 5 3 sediment accumulation rates the peak in 137cs mass activity is interpreted as the fallout event from the chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in 1986 e g appleby 2001 heim et al 2004 wildi et al 2004 the results agree with works conducted in other czech reservoirs nehyba et al 2011 sedláček et al 2013 2017 and oxbow lakes bábek et al 2008 sedláček et al 2016 the post depositional migration of 137cs is usually limited in water saturated reservoirs and lacustrine sediments appleby 2001 ilus and saxén 2005 but the reworking of 137cs enriched layers into younger strata may occur due to floods underwater slides and other processes this may explain the apparent gradual increase of 137cs mass activity in some cores seč 25 křiž 8 and 11 whereas in others a sharp 137cs peak was found no clear evidence was found for older 137cs events in contrast to other reservoirs sedláček et al 2013 2016 low 137cs activities in basal sequences may be residues from such events this can be the case of the křižanovice reservoir because its filling started roughly in parallel with nuclear tests in the atmosphere during the 1950s and this may help to explain the 137cs presence in the reservoir basal sequences peak 137cs concentrations are comparable in both reservoirs suggesting that 137cs distribution was only slightly affected by the river damming or a substantial amount of 137cs was derived in a river section between both reservoirs higher values in reservoir distal parts are generally related to lithological change in particular to grain size because 137cs is preferentially bound to fine and clay particles alberts et al 1989 ilus and saxén 2005 three dated events were used to calculate an average sedimentation rate for two time periods the first important event represents the onset of lacustrine sedimentation 1935 in seč reservoir 1953 in křižanovice reservoir inferred from lithological description ms drs logs and grain size characteristics it is important to note that the safe determination of this boundary can only be achieved by a combination of all methods especially in the relatively homogeneous sediment record the second event was the chernobyl nuclear power plant accident 1986 while the final tie point was the year of core extraction 2017 from reservoir filling until the present day average sediment accumulation rates sar reservoir base found in 12 cores were in the interval from 0 2 core seč 5 to 0 7 cores 12 and 27 cm year similar values were calculated for the křižanovice reservoir the reservoir base was found in 8 cores and produced estimates varying from 0 2 core křiž 5 to 0 69 core křiž 12 cm year for six 137cs dated cores the sar ranged from 0 48 to 1 06 cm year since 1986 in the seč reservoir cores seč 17 25 and 28 and from 0 67 to 0 87 cm year for the křižanovice reservoir cores křiž 8 11 and 13 this implies that sar was roughly similar since reservoir filling in the core seč 25 on the other hand there is a discrepancy in the sar in cores seč 17 and 28 because the main 137cs peak is located just a few cm above the reservoir sedimentation onset the sars are much lower in comparison to other czech reservoirs e g the valley type brno reservoir 0 3 to 4 6 cm yr the nové mlýny reservoir 0 6 to 2 3 cm yr and the les království reservoir 2 8 up to to 9 7 cm yr sedláček et al 2013 2017 bábek et al 2020 a typical sediment accumulation rate reported in dam reservoirs worldwide is above 2 cm year müller et al 2000 arnason and fletscher 2003 audry et al 2004 the relatively lower accumulation rate can be caused by the size of the accommodation space and especially by the low sediment input from the river catchment consider the elbe river annual discharge of 52 4 m3s 1 in the les království reservoir vs the chrudimka river annual discharge of 2 28 m3s 1 vs in the seč reservoir it can also be the main factor affecting sar because its average values are comparable in both reservoirs although the sediment volume is much lower in the křižanovice reservoir 5 4 trap efficiency and sediment balance trap efficiency is an important variable to assess sediment balance in the sense the in and out fluxes of sediments to each reservoir trap efficiency is a function of reservoir geometry inflow and incoming sediment characteristics heinemann 1984 verstraeten and poesen 2000 sediment trapping is also dependent on particle diameter morris and fan 1997 because coarser material has a higher settling velocity and is deposited preferentially verstraeten and poesen 2000 the narrow and bent shape of the studied reservoir contributes to the effective trap efficiency for coarse grained particles both reservoirs are capable of trapping particles larger than 0 125 mm fine sand completely because coarse grained particles do not occur in distal cores moreover a substantial proportion of fine sand and silt is trapped main fraction deposited in reservoirs is silt walling and moorehead 1989 especially fine silt as reported in barasona reservoir over 60 in spain lópez et al 2016 snyder et al 2006 have reported the effective trap efficiency for coarse grained particles larger than 4 mm a certain amount of clay sized particles is not trapped and is flushed away via the reservoir outlet guillén ludeña et al 2018 clay proportions are comparable in both reservoirs a minor increase was merely observed in the proximal to distal direction and therefore the finest fractions are only slightly affected by river damming similar results were also present in a medium sized reservoir anselmetti et al 2007 however bedrock geology does not allow the formation of large amounts of clay particles we calculated the trap efficiency te of both reservoirs using the heinmann formula 1981 which was modified from the original brune method 1953 t e 22 119 6 c i 0 012 1 02 c i where c the reservoir capacity km3 i the reservoir inflow km3 year the calculated value of te reached 90 6 for the seč reservoir and a much lower value of 57 4 for the křižanovice reservoir however this calculation applies to the initial capacity after reservoir filling the present value considering the decrease in reservoir capacity due to silting is slightly lower values of 90 4 and 56 2 respectively trap efficiencies are not uniform over time because of varying reservoir capacity due to seasonal water level fluctuation and varying hydrologic conditions rausch and heinemann 1975 morris and fan 1997 verstraeten and poesen 2000 in addition te decrease over time due to the reduction in reservoir capacity brune 1953 minear and kondolf 2009 bábek et al 2020 trap efficiency also temporarily decreases with water level lowering providing more opportunity for resuspension and transport of stored sediments snyder et al 2004 it implies that the te tends to reduce more quickly in reservoirs undergoing frequent water level fluctuation assuming maximum seasonal decrease of water level of 6 and 3 m in seč and křižanovice reservoirs the recalculated value of te decrease slightly to 85 5 for the seč reservoir and more distinctly to 45 1 for the křižanovice reservoir the high trap efficiency most likely results from the long and narrow shape of the seč reservoir in combination with its relatively high reservoir capacity and low inflow the te has remained high until the present day indicated among others by its ability to capture most heavy metal pollution and fine sediment components including fe oxides in contrast heavy metal concentrations are significantly lower in the křižanovice reservoir matys grygar et al 2018 in the křižanovice reservoir the much lower initial te and its more pronounced decrease through reservoir operation is probably a result of its smaller capacity reservoirs that are small relative to the annual inflow have much lower trapping kondolf et al 2004 it is also known that smaller reservoirs tend to lose their capacity more quickly carvalho et al 2000 verstraeten and poesen 2000 however calculations of te based on the capacity to inflow ratio are only applicable to long term average conditions morris and fan 1997 high trap efficiency may also be the result of relatively little water fluctuations with respect to still high storage capacity in the seč reservoir as well as absence of flushing operations the total volume of deposited sediments was estimated by the volume of a geometric figure that resembles a trapezoidal cross section multiplied by the length romero díaz et al 2007 we calculated that 647 000 m3 of sediment is deposited in the seč reservoir and 89 000 m3 is deposited in the křižanovice reservoir considering their years of operation this implies a mean annual sediment supply of 7 890 m3 for seč and 1 390 m3 for the křižanovice reservoir the annual sediment yield was calculated by dividing the total accumulated sediment in the reservoir by the period between the core extraction and reservoir filling operation time this gives an average sediment yield in terms of mean sediment volume per year that is then normalized to the total reservoir catchment area area specific sediment yield ssy using the formula ssy v t a where ssy is the area specific sediment yield expressed in m3 km2 year v is the total sediment volume in the reservoir m3 t is operation time years and a is the catchment area km2 this value was much higher for seč reaching 36 5 m3 km2 year compared to only 5 42 m3 km2 year for křižanovice reservoir however calculated ssy is underestimated because it does not consider the finest fraction which escapes the reservoirs through suspended load therefore the measured values need to be corrected for the trap efficiency verstraeten and poesen 2002 based on the te 9 6 and 43 8 of incoming sediment was not trapped and passed through the seč and křižanovice reservoirs routing efficiency which corresponds to 68 707 m3 and 69 362 m3 of sediments since the reservoir operation respectively the annual sediment output is 837 m3 and 1083 m3 respectively after correction the ssy is 40 4 m3 km2 year for the seč and 9 6 m3 km2 year for the křižanovice reservoir the difference between the both reservoirs may be a consequence of a more effective sediment trapping in the seč reservoir compared to the seč reservoir other czech reservoirs display equivalent or lower ssy values the values without correction to passed sediments 36 8 m3 km2 year for the les království reservoir catchment area 531 8 km2 sediment yield calculated from bábek et al 2020 14 95 m3 km2 year for the brno reservoir catchment area 1 586 km2 and 10 92 m3 km2 year for the nové mlýny reservoir upper basin 4 6 m3 km2 year for the middle basin and 2 83 m3 km2 year for the lower basin catchment areas 4 599 11 713 and 11 853 km2 respectively sedláček et al 2016 in other examples the ssy varied between 7 and 1 688 m3 km2 y for 24 water reservoirs in kansas usa rahmani et al 2018 between 89 and 520 m3 km2 y for water reservoirs in california usa minear and kondolf 2009 and between 1 068 to 2 204 m3 km2 y for water reservoirs in the swiss alps guillén ludeña et al 2018 the reservoirs studied are located in the upper reach of the chrudimka river with small catchment areas it has been acknowledged that sediment yield depends among other factors such as land use and hydrological regime on the size of the catchment area i e higher sediment yield has been observed in smaller catchment areas walling 1983 rompaey et al 2001 rahmani et al 2018 which is also confirmed by our results in addition sediment pathways can be influenced by possible sediment traps upstream walling 1983 verstraeted and poesen 2002 sedláček et al 2016 but no extensive floodplain occurs upstream contributing to relative higher sediment transport to the seč reservoir on the other hand most of the catchment area is composed of resistant crystalline and metamorphic rocks and covered by forests and meadows which further contributes to low sediment yield variations in sediment yield are related to changes at a basin scale land use changes on a long term scale while annual variations in sediment production may be controlled primarily by flood magnitude and frequency ambers 2001 szalińska et al 2020 based on mean inflow discharge of the chrudimka river we suppose that sediment yield is highest during spring and summer and lowest during winter however a decrease in snowfall and early spring thaw period may increase sediment yield during the winter season in the next decades szalińska et al 2020 the reservoirs lifespans were not dramatically reduced due to siltation as capacity had only decreased by about 3 in seč and 4 4 in křižanovice since filling indicating negligible annual loss of storage capacity of just 0 04 and 0 06 respectively far below the global average hypothetically if the sediment yield remains stable it will take 2680 and 1400 years to infill the seč and křižanovice reservoir respectively for the comparison the annual loss of storage capacity is estimated to range between 0 5 and 1 at the global scale mahmood 1987 white 2001 araújo et al 2006 wisser et al 2013 5 5 sediment reworking and water level fluctuations sediment reworking is probably common in the proximal part of both reservoirs examined especially close to the inflows in the former river channel or on steeper valley slopes therefore cores from very proximal parts of the reservoir bottom cannot be used as reliable sediment archives sediment deposition and reworking are controlled by water current velocity local reservoir geometry and operation management water levels in some czech reservoirs including the seč reservoir are regularly reduced before expected flood periods or in winter months see fig 2 water level lowering can also be caused by the periods of drought which have occurred more frequently in central europe in recent years trnka et al 2014 periods of droughts can have a far reaching effect on sedimentation processes in reservoirs trap efficiency and sediment balance for example the recent summer drought periods in 2016 and 2018 caused the water level to decrease by approximately five meters in the seč reservoir recently incision and erosive downstream transport has been reported in two czech reservoirs skalka and nechranice because of the summer 2019 drawdown in drought period pacina et al 2020 drought associated changes in climate may have an increasing effect on the sediment distribution in czech reservoirs in the future decades during low water period in the seč and křižanovice reservoirs the shallow bottom is exposed on which erosion and accumulation are likely to alternate morris and fan 1997 these contrasts may be denoted as switching between fluvial and lacustrine sedimentation during water level lowering influencing the trap efficiency morris and fan 1997 snyder et al 2004 sediment movement during water level fluctuations can be highlighted at steep sides of the reservoirs and may cause the erosion of proximal sediments coarse grained proximal sediments tend to have a low erosion stability while decreasing particle size and increasing cohesiveness lead to a higher sediment stability beckers et al 2018 moreover bank erosion can act as an additional sediment source shotbolt et al 2005 mccartney 2009 water level lowering is associated with moderate changes in the grain size distribution consequently reservoir sediments affected by lowstands exhibit bimodal grain size distribution lópez et al 2016 as shown also by our data see fig 11 as a result of both phenomena fresh sediment is deposited in the deepest parts of the reservoir another consequence of frequent water level fluctuations can be sediment relocation through the reservoir and its flushing down into the deeper parts of the reservoir ehrbar et al 2018 bladé castellet et al 2019 it can explain greater sediment thicknesses in the medial part of the seč reservoir as well as a slight increase of the grain size median in the section between coring sites 24 and 29 see fig 7 thus bank erosion and water level operation can explain the presence of relatively coarse grained particles in some distal cores water level lowering causes an increase in the sand fraction downstream compared to the situation in highstands which would result in a more homogeneous sediment character lópez et al 2016 drawdowns might induce different sediment transport patterns compared to the high water level conditions as indicated by the c m diagram 5 6 downstream effects of damming considering the high trap efficiency of the seč reservoir a substantial amount of sediment accumulated in the křižanovice reservoir was probably derived from the river section between the both reservoirs this assumption is supported by different ms and colour signatures for the křižanovice reservoir in addition coarse sand sized grains greater than0 125 mm are completely trapped in the seč reservoir and there is a predominance of sand sized grains and overall coarse sediment texture in the proximal part of the křižanovice reservoir its inflow part is comparable to the corresponding inflow part of the seč reservoir in terms of grain size see fig 6b in the křižanovice reservoir inflow part sediments are very poorly sorted and coarse sand sized grains are very angular at a closer look which suggest their transport over a short distance coarsening of river bed material is one of typical downstream response to river damming kondolf 1997 sandy deposits just a few decimetres thick were described between both reservoirs while silt deposition was absent matys grygar et al 2018 it is also likely that a certain amount of sediment is not derived from the chrudimka river channel itself but from small mainly unnamed tributaries due to the damming the chrudimka river course downstream the seč reservoir is more prone to eroding the channel bed and adjacent banks and tends to incise this effect of sediment deficit represents a consequence of sediment starved waters kondolf and swanson 1993 kondolf 1997 kondolf et al 2004 the chrudimka river has a higher thalweg slope steepest just below the seč dam wall up to 6 5 m km before slowly decreasing to 3 5 4 m km a higher thalweg slope can lead to a faster erosion rate there is a small 0 149 mm3 reservoir seč ii padrty situated just below the seč reservoir dam which can trap a certain amount of sediment the same results in terms of increased bank and bed erosion have been reported e g in the mekong river between the manwan and chiang saen reservoirs kummu and varis 2007 5 7 variation in physical properties variations in physical properties reflect changing conditions within reservoirs as well as variations in sediment input a highly fluctuating pattern reflects changing energy conditions in the proximal parts while the more uniform distribution point of calm conditions of suspension settling in the distal parts sedláček et al 2013 2017 we identified three types of behaviour of ms in relation to other physical properties especially grain size 1 the ms values are positively correlated to fine fractions clay and silt likely due to the higher concentrations of fe oxides bábek et al 2011 their r2 varying from 0 33 to 0 68 conversely the ms values are lower in sand sized fractions mostly composed of diamagnetic quartz and feldspar grains such a pattern was found in the cores seč 2 22 25 and 28 2 an opposite trend points to the positive correlation to sand fraction and negative to fine particles was observed in cores seč 5 11 12 and 21 nevertheless in those cores the sand fraction was fine to very fine 3 in addition a good degree of correspondence was found between the depth profiles of d90 and ms logs see fig 10 the peaks of extreme d90 values coincided with the peaks on ms logs as can be seen ms logs can help identify past water level changes associated with floods and or lowstands ms is not driven exclusively by grain size in all sediments because such correlations fail to fit in the same cores or parts as shown in cores seč 21 and 29 besides grain size control the ms values can also be influenced by diamagnetic organic matter and the presence of fe oxides ms can increase significantly due to the presence of ferrimagnetic magnetite maghemite and antiferromagnetic hematite minerals which may be enriched in fine sand fraction the ms values are significantly higher in the křižanovice reservoir this may be related to the distinctive bedrock geology of the river section between the reservoirs which is supported by the slightly different colour signatures for the křižanovice reservoir indeed bodies of metamorphic rocks are located here including metagabbro gneiss to migmatitic rocks and sometimes quartzitic gneiss in particular gabbro rocks tend to exhibit high ms values sediment colour is related to the geology of the source area therefore ciel data were used as a relative indicator of sediment composition and in lake processes compared to ms colour properties appear to be a better correlation tool because some deflections with potential correlations were found higher ciel values are associated with light coloured mineral constituents quartz and feldspar and lower values with greater amounts of dark clay minerals and organic matter bábek et al 2008 no significant proximal to distal brightness trends were observed in the seč reservoir except for a moderate increase in its middle part on the other hand gradually increasing ciel values were observed in the křižanovice reservoir causing higher degrees of brightness of distal facies inflow sediments show greater colour variance because of changing current velocity conditions and water level while distal sediments reveal more homogenous colour pointing to more calm sedimentary conditions sedláček et al 2017 as suggest the c m diagram see fig 9 slight shifts in ciea cieb ratios fig 12 for distal samples are attributed to facies change in the proximal to distal direction and different redox conditions in individual cores sedláček et al 2017 longer residence time in the water column for more distal sites can lead to a higher degree of fe oxidation in the oxy hydroxide mixtures sedláček et al 2017 matys grygar et al 2018 resulting in shift towards yellow the seč reservoir and red yellow hues the křižanovice reservoir sediment colour and ciea cieb ratios have proven to be an important tool for identifying the onset of the reservoir sedimentation in general petrophysical proxies and grain size depth patterns were devoid of significant fluctuations in the křižanovice reservoir even in proximal parts this may be linked to more stable discharges see fig 2 buffered by the upstream seč reservoir 6 conclusions our results indicate some common sedimentary processes are occurring in the reservoirs studied but there are also site specific factors that affect sediment distribution that are unique to each reservoir therefore reservoir research is not a trivial task and using reservoir sediments as environmental archives requires a considerable care an important factor affecting sediment accumulation is the pre reservoir floodplain morphology subsequent reservoir geometry and management although the thickness of the reservoir sediment exhibits certain general patterns it can also vary from place to place according to such site specific conditions as the distance from inflow distance from thalweg bottom topography and thalweg gradient detailed grain size analysis also revealed some site specific patterns spatially distinct grain size sorting recognized in both reservoirs is a function of travel distance within the reservoir which is conditioned by their bent and narrow geometry as well as by reservoir management especially manipulation with the water level in the reservoirs studied here trap efficiency proved to be particularly dependent on reservoir capacity due to low discharge the much larger seč reservoir is located upstream and will thus prolong the lifespan of the smaller downstream reservoirs of the chrudimka river cascade including the křižanovice reservoir the total trap efficiency of the reservoir cascade on the chrudimka river must be enormous and this must inevitably affect the fluvial system downstream on the other hand a certain amount of sediment is derived from below each reservoir due to the effect of sediment starved waters the seč reservoir developed a unique depositional style in which neither inflow delta nor distal muddy lake developed instead a sediment layer of relatively uniform thickness with a slight indication of tapering is distributed all along the reservoir length this depositional style is caused by the low sediment yield combined with the high trap efficiency and frequent water management operations methods used in this study are suitable for estimating how the reservoir management operations will affect the sediment distribution including the real impact of flushing operations on the sediment removal the best conclusions can be achieved with data integration based on our experience as demonstrated above we suggest that a reservoir sediment survey should be conducted in several steps combining bathymetry and geophysical surveys with high resolution stratigraphic methods and establishing chronological sequence each study should start by investigating available old maps before proceeding with bathymetric measurements including bottom reflection intensity and gpr survey in water depth less than ca 4 m the next step should be the selection of suitable coring sites with expected continuous sediment accumulation and thus a well defined stratigraphy following core extraction and analyses master cores could be selected for sediment archive purposes on the other hand

3790,dam reservoirs are complex depositional systems which provide barriers to natural sediment transport along river courses in addition reservoir sedimentation causes serious problems in their operational management given the wide variability of reservoir bottom shapes total volumes of stored water river discharges sediment loads and sediment textures universal depositional models are difficult to achieve for dam reservoirs this article focuses on the need to improve current understandings of sedimentation processes and thorough spatial particle size distribution in dam reservoirs to achieve this aim sonar and ground penetrating radar surveys were combined with high resolution stratigraphic data from 44 short sediment cores in two valley type reservoirs seč and křižanovice part of a reservoir cascade in the chrudimka river which is a left hand tributary of the labe river czech republic sonar survey was used to construct bathymetric maps and bottom reflection intensity images the results showed topography inherited from pre reservoir times and a good degree of correspondence between bottom reflection intensity and grain size the sedimentation patterns exhibit distinct proximal to distal and transversal changes in sediment facies and grain size pre reservoir and present morphologies have substantially shaped sediment accumulation spatial grain size sorting is a function of travel distance within reservoirs which is conditioned by their bended and narrow geometry as well as by reservoir management two stages of reservoir sedimentation are recognised the initial stage was characterised by the filling of local depressions which were overlain by the second stage typified by continuous and horizontally deposited sediments relatively low sediment accumulation rates from 0 2 to 1 06 cm year are the consequence of reservoir characteristics capacity and associated accommodation space and factors at a basin scale low discharge geology and land use slow reduction of reservoir capacity was observed the calculated trap efficiency is very high in the seč reservoir and much lower in the křižanovice reservoir the main factor controlling trap efficiency is reservoir capacity and shape combined with low inflow ultimately the trap efficiency change over time because of varying reservoir capacity due to seasonal water level fluctuation and varying hydrologic conditions due to the slow silting of the reservoir the trap efficiency has decreased only slightly aside from general trends some specific features exist for every reservoir based on local geometry and reservoir management strategy this implies that an innovative approach combining map sonar and geophysical surveys with core data is required to develop better facies models and to optimise sediment management strategies keywords reservoir sediments bathymetry ground penetrating radar sediment accumulation rate trap efficiency high resolution stratigraphy 1 introduction an increasing number of reservoirs reservoir cascades and ponds worldwide create significant barriers to sediment transport in fluvial environments vörösmarty et al 2003 kummu and varis 2007 ran et al 2013 wisser et al 2013 sediments accumulated in dammed reservoirs are commonly used as environmental archives documenting flood events past trophic conditions land use changes and in particular pollution history e g shotbolt et al 2001 förstner 2004 van metre and mahler 2004 wildi et al 2004 audry et al 2010 palanques et al 2014 sedláček et al 2017 however the use of reservoir sediments as archives can be limited due to their lithological heterogeneity pre dam bottom topography sediment reworking and other factors in some works a single master core has been studied under the assumption that it can represent the history of the whole reservoir e g nehyba et al 2011 dhivert et al 2015 but most researchers work with multiple cores located in various part of the reservoir to encompass the lithologic variability snyder et al 2006 palanques et al 2014 sedláček et al 2017 the selection of coring sites is crucial as too few cores in non representative locations may provide pitfalls for interpretation on the other hand the retrieval of multiple cores and data processing requires large amounts of time hence better reservoir facies models are necessary to optimise coring strategies many parameters affect the sedimentation in dams and consequently the total volume and internal architecture of sedimentary bodies as well as their utilization as environmental archives the pre reservoir floodplain morphology is an important variable that controls sediment distribution after the dam construction venteris et al 2014 knowledge about the pre reservoir morphology helps to identify past and current sediment accumulation sites and calculate the sediment thickness and architecture moorman et al 2001 odhiambo and boss 2004 viseras et al 2009 the geometry of a dam reservoir affects sediment transport and distribution in the reservoir the valley reservoirs which are the most frequent type are long narrow shallower in the upstream part and deeper near the dam producing a distinct longitudinal depositional gradient shotbolt et al 2005 in the basin shaped reservoirs the sediment thickness varies both longitudinally and transversally in many reservoirs the sedimentary infill pinches out from the inflow towards the dam creating wedge like bodies shotbolt et al 2005 sedláček et al 2013 2017 pacina et al 2020 in others especially small reservoirs the maximum thickness is attained in the distal parts close to the dam occasionally creating a so called muddy lake area shotbolt et al 2005 dhivert et al 2015 sedláček et al 2016 whereas in long and narrow reservoirs sediments tend to accumulate in the medial parts of the reservoir body snyder et al 2004 consequently the dam reservoirs may develop deltaic deposits wedge shaped deposits with maximum thickness near the dam tapering deposits with maximum thickness near the inflow or uniform deposits with more less constant thickness morris and fan 1997 in addition sedimentation in reservoirs is largely governed by hyperpycnal flows balacco et al 2004 lai and capart 2009 and or further influenced by anthropogenic manipulations with water level lópez et al 2016 sediment reworking due to wind action teeter et al 2001 and underwater currents and slides shotbolt et al 2005 the variability of depositional styles infers the trap efficiency percentage of sediment trapped in the reservoir out of the total sediment input of dam reservoirs morris and fan 1997 which in turn have critical impact on reservoir lifespan effects of downstream river bed erosion by sediment starved waters and finally the coastal areas morris and fan 1997 vörösmarty et al 2003 kummu and varis 2007 smith et al 2017 reservoir sedimentation is one of the main problems in their operational management worldwide causing loss of storage capacity turbine abrasion blockage of bottom outlets and power intakes e g morris and fan 1997 guillén ludeña et al 2018 controlled sediment routing or removal is used in flushing operations in order to release sediment deposits out of the reservoir e g schüttrumpf and detering 2011 espa et al 2011 bladé castellet et al 2019 therefore there is a need for tools to control the effectiveness of these operations this variability of sedimentary processes combined with numerous negative effects of river damming implies the need for better facies models as well as a thorough understanding of the spatial particle size distribution in dam reservoirs in this study we investigated a cascade of two valley type reservoirs seč and křižanovice located in the chrudimka river of the labe elbe river catchment czech republic we studied the sedimentation processes in the reservoirs using a combination of sonar bathymetry ground penetrating radar surveys and multi proxy lithologic analysis of 44 shallow cores the aim of this paper was to obtain a robust information about sediment distribution sedimentation processes and stratigraphic architecture of the reservoir deposits the results enhance current understandings of sediment deposition in reservoirs and present a suitable workflow for sediment coring and the use of sediment archives detailed knowledge of sediment facies and particle size distribution can be used further to optimise sediment management strategies 2 geographic setting and history the seč and křižanovice reservoirs are located on the chrudimka river which is a left hand tributary of the labe elbe river in the central part of the czech republic fig 1 several reservoirs are located on the chrudimka river creating a reservoir cascade comprising the hamry seč seč i padrť seč ii křižanovice and křižanovice ii reservoirs in the downstream direction both studied sites represent valley type reservoirs relatively narrow in the proximal part and broader near the dam wall the seč reservoir was built earlier between 1924 and 1935 as a flood control measure at present the reservoir is used for hydroelectric generation fishing and recreation activities its total volume is 21 795 mm3 and its surface area is 220 1 ha its mean annual inflow discharge is 2 28 m3s 1 q10 77 q50 129 and q100 157 m3s 1 and outflow 2 41 m3s 1 the outflow value is not a constant but is determined at different levels which are given by the water level in the reservoir at different periods during the year nevertheless the minimum outflow is set at 0 5 m3s 1 the křižanovice reservoir is much smaller and was built later between 1947 and 1953 for electricity production and water storage its volume is 2 036 mm3 its flooded area is 31 8 ha and its mean annual inflow discharge is 2 61 m3s 1 q10 69 9 q50 118 and q100 142 m3s 1 and an average outflow 2 61 m3s 1 minimum outflow is 0 37 m3s 1 the outflow is governed by the same principles as in the case of the seč reservoir for detailed information about the reservoirs see table 1 compared to other czech reservoirs such as the plumov sedláček et al 2016 the nové mlýny sedláček et al 2017 and the les království bábek et al 2020 seč and křižanovice reservoirs do not have significant problems with silting and therefore sediment removal or flushing was not carried out in the past only local dredging was performed in the křižanovice reservoir in front of the bottom outlet in years 2007 and 2018 both reservoirs experience regular water level fluctuations the water level is drawn down about 4 6 m in the seč reservoir and 2 3 in the křižanovice reservoir usually each autumn to provide storage capacity for the next spring runoff and then the water level is restored to its normal capacity lower water levels are also connected to drought periods due to low inflow detailed graphs showing variations in inflow discharge and water level are presented in fig 2 for the last two decades data shared by the operator povodí labe sp the catchment area of the chrudimka river above the seč reservoir is 216 15 km2 and 256 45 km2 above the křižanovice reservoir with average elevations ranging between 680 m the chrudimka river spring area and 405 8 m křižanovice dam above sea level the territory is classified as a moderately warm and damp region with four seasons corresponding to the continental and temperate climatic zone köppen geiger climate classification system tolasz and baštýřová 2007 the mean annual precipitation in the catchments are 973 mm and 973 4 mm respectively lowest average monthly precipitation is typical for february 45 mm and highest for july 99 mm but mostly in the form of torrential rains mean annual temperatures range between 5 5 and 8 5 c depending on altitude evapotranspiration range between 200 mm in spring and 600 mm in autumn and winter tolasz and baštýřová 2007 the background geology comprises crystalline rocks especially gneiss migmatites and granulites metagranites of the kutná hora svratka crystalline unit and the bohemicum and granodiorite of the železné hory pluton chlupáč and štorch 1992 relics of cretaceous marine sediments are locally preserved the surface of the valleys is covered by quaternary sediments and soils the catchment areas comprise crop fields meadows and forests its land use changed in the second half of the 20th century during the communist era when the original mosaic of small crop fields was transformed into large parcels the reduction in the percentage of arable land occurred mostly after 1989 and conversely meadows began to expand 3 material methods and sampling strategy the bathymetry data were attained with the use of the humminbird helix 7 chirp di gps g2 sonar equipped with standard gps in combination with a small inflatable boat the sonar emits a cone shaped beam as the relative depth value is calculated from the time of the most intense reflection the depth values are constant when tilted both pitch and roll to an angle corresponding to half the apex angle of the cone the stability of the boat is then ensured by a slow ride up to 5 km h uniformly distributed load and low wave amplitudes a maximum of 10 cm the accuracy of the sonar used for this survey was in detail tested in other czech reservoirs pacina et al 2020 data obtained during extremely low water levels were used to verify the accuracy points directly measured with an rtk gnss receiver and photogrammetrically processed into a digital surface model the root mean square error of the measured elevations is approximately 10 20 cm the water bodies were scanned in lines arranged roughly perpendicular to the former river thalweg the line density was dependent on the size of the reservoir the nature of the reservoir bottom and identification of ideal sampling sites the density within the seč reservoir was one line per 100 m and within the křižanovice reservoir one line per 30 m the bathymetric datasets were acquired as single points in the wgs 84 coordinate system and later transformed into the czech national s jtsk coordinate system and stored in the esri file geodatabase the precise gnss receiver was used to estimate the altitude of the actual water level with approx 3 cm accuracy the relative water depth values were re calculated as elevations the topo to raster interpolation function implemented in arcgis was used to produce a digital elevation model dem of the reservoir bottom the spatial resolution of 5 m was used for the dems created for both reservoirs other spatial resolutions were tested as well but higher ones 1 m generate many interpolation artifacts and the lower ones 10 m was tested hide details in areas surveyed with higher point density ground penetrating radar gpr was placed on the small inflatable boat and dragged at a constant speed along the line a total of 69 longitudinal and transversal profiles were measured by gssi terrasirch 3000 conyers inc usa gpr equipped with 400 mhz frequency antenna its use was limited by water depth maximum penetration 4 m through the water column due to the absorbance of the gpr signal by the conductive water environment raw gpr data were filtered using dewow background removal manual gain band pass frequency and running average filters using reflexw software sandmeier germany water depth conversion of the two way travel time data from profiles was performed using sonar bathymetry and depth gauge data obtained during coring in total 29 short sediment cores fig 1 were taken from the seč reservoir marked as seč 1 to 29 and 15 cores from the křižanovice reservoir marked as křiž 1 to 15 using a floating platform the sampling sites were selected based on the study of historical aerial bathymetric and bottom reflection intensity data prior to sampling gpr measurements were also performed the core recovery was performed using a rod operated multisampler piston corer with an inner diameter of 4 5 cm eijkelkamp the netherlands in shallow parts of reservoirs maximum 4 m in deeper water cores were recovered using a uwitec gravity corer sampler austria with hydraulic core catcher into tubes with an inner diameter of 6 3 cm the maximum sediment penetration depth was 0 85 m in the seč reservoir and 0 74 m in the křižanovice reservoir the cores were sampled with a 1 or 2 cm vertical interval depending on lithology and required resolution surface samples were taken along three transverse transects fig 1 in the proximal sečd3 1 to 9 middle seč d2 1 to 17 and distal parts sečd1 1 to 20 of the seč reservoir using a van veen grab sampler eijkelkamp the netherlands subsequently the samples were air dried under ambient conditions and stored in plastic bags all samples were analysed for low field mass specific magnetic susceptibility using kly 4s kappabridge agico czech republic with a magnetic field intensity of 300 a m 1 operating frequency of 920 hz and sensitivity of 3 10 8si the grain size distribution of selected core and surface samples was analysed by a fritsch analysette 22 mircotec plus laser particle sizer fritsch gmbh germany with a measuring range of 0 01 to 2000 µm prior to analysis the samples were homogenised and mixed into a paste in water and one drop of surfactant dusazin 901 was added floating coarse organic detritus if present was removed manually the sediment colour of dry sample aliquots powdered to analytical fineness was analysed by visible light diffuse reflectance spectroscopy vis drs using a hand held x rite sp62 spectrophotometer x rite inc usa with a tungsten light source d 8 measurement geometry and 8 mm aperture the data were visualised in ciel a b colour space selected cores seč 17 25 and 28 křiž 8 11 and 13 were analysed for 137cs mass activity with vertical interval 6 cm to increase the sample mass minimum mass needed for this method was 20 g using a laboratory gamma spectrometer sg 1000 lab with nai tl scintillation detector with detection limit 9 bq kg 1 and 30 min measurement time the results were expressed as depth distribution in 137cs mass activity 4 results 4 1 bathymetry and subsurface sediment architecture the detailed bathymetry survey indicated a high gradient in the present bottom morphology in both reservoirs fig 1 the water depth increases gradually in the downstream direction in the seč reservoir a narrow 100 m upstream portion near the inflow is characterised by very shallow to shallow 1 2 m water depths the water depth then gradually increases to 3 m the valley bottom is relatively flat with gentle slopes and a low thalweg gradient of about 2 5 m km further downstream slopes are steeper and the reservoir width 200 m and water depth increase the reservoir basin with maximum depths of up to 27 5 m is located near the dam 40 m here the thalweg gradient increases to 5 m km the bathymetry survey revealed that the bottom topography has been inherited from pre reservoir times the main feature of the bottom topography represents a former channel of the chrudimka river still visible on the present valley floor exhibiting a low sinuosity bent depression a similar bathymetry pattern was observed in the křižanovice reservoir showing a shallow water depth in the proximal part 3 m and a gradual depth increase 7 10 m in the medial parts to the dam wall with a maximum depth of about 14 m the reservoir width is rather uniform and varies from 90 to 240 m the widest profile is located in the medial parts near the core site křiž 12 sonar data were used to estimate bottom reflection intensity fig 3 which is inferred from the amplitude of the reflected sound wave and indicates the ability of the bottom cover to absorb this wave as a result a high reflection amplitude implies higher bottom hardness and it is accompanied by multiple reflections the wave can reflect easily back to the water surface such reflection is typical of rocky bottoms i e without sediment cover or for coarse grained sediments in contrast softer fine grained clayey and silty sediments reveal a single reflection with lower amplitude due to a stronger absorption bottom reflection intensity was visualised as an interpolated raster layer the higher values of bottom reflection intensity were found in the proximal parts of the seč reservoir on its margins and close to the dam wall particularly high values were measured on the east reservoir bank northeast of the mid reservoir island here reservoir borders with several metre high cliffs were noted which continue below the water level to the bottom conversely lower values were measured in the central part of the valley generally mirroring the thalweg this zone begins after the first bend of the reservoir and narrows near the coring site 26 it is widest near the coring sites 24 and 25 low intensity values also occur in the inflow part around coring sites 6 and 7 on the other hand higher values seem to coincide here with the former channel bottom reflection intensity values are lower in the proximal and central parts of the křižanovice reservoir towards the dam wall the reflection intensities increase except for several places with lower values located around the coring site křiž 13 the gpr survey was able to acquire detailed bottom topography in the inflow parts of both reservoirs to a maximum water depth of 4 m as the water depth increases the reflections begin to fade selected profiles are presented in fig 4 all profiles exhibit a clear bottom reflection at the water sediment interface indicating the present day bottom surface the reservoir floor extends from inclined slopes at the reservoir margins to a flat bottom in the reservoir centre the former channel of the chrudimka river is the most prominent element of the bottom morphology and reveals some inherited characteristics from the previous fluvial stage under the reservoir floor several units were distinguished depending on the type of reflections less inclined channel slopes tend to accumulate sediment by lateral accretion seč 6 profile fig 4 and conversely no sediment is deposited in more steeply cut banks another possible explanation points to underwater slide almost no sediment is deposited within the channel itself in the inflow part as indicated by mounded reflections in the seč 5 profile fig 4 but a thin sediment layer is indicated by subhorizontal parallel reflections on the channel slopes and channel bottom in seč 4 and seč 6 profiles lower parts of all profiles are characterised by low frequency noise while the overlying high frequency sediment layer refers to high frequency lacustrine sediments the lower unit is composed of an altered bedrock or fluvial sequence in which the mounded and hyperbolic reflections are probably caused by the presence of large clasts and boulders the onset of reservoir sedimentation is visible in most profiles and represents an important stratigraphic surface of the former valley floor two units of reservoir sediments can be distinguished on the flat platform depending on the internal architecture fig 4 first the older unit tends to copy the pre reservoir bottom due to compensation and levelling off the bottom after filling it causes higher sediment thickness in local depressions subhorizontal reflectors characterise the second overlaying unit the onlap of reservoir sediment to the bedrock was identified in reservoir margins on steeply inclined slopes the reflection of the reservoir sediment unit varies according to its position within the reservoir profiles located close to the inflow display poor hummocky or saw tooth reflections while more distal profiles display relatively smooth and well defined reflectors slight evidence of downstream accretion can be observed in the longitudinal profiles 4 2 lithology based on visual observations and other analyses we identified two main lithological units present in the cores the lower unit comprises massive brown to yellow brown sands and small rock fragments of colluvial or fluvial sequence deposited before reservoir filling the upper younger unit is represented by the reservoir sediments the lithology of reservoir sediments varies in a proximal to distal direction brown grey or light brown sandy silts to silts with occasional layers of fine to coarse sand very common plant wood remains and phytodetritus and no lamination present prevail in the inflow parts homogeneous grey to black grey silts or clayey silts prevail in distal parts rarely with the admixture of fine grained sands the boundary between both units represents the onset of lacustrine sedimentation this boundary is sharp and easily identified colour and textural change in some cores for example seč 5 yet this transition is rather gradual and diffuse in other cores however this sedimentary sequence is not found in all cores the thickness of reservoir sediments varies across the reservoir from 15 cm seč 10 to 60 cm seč 27 in the seč reservoir minimum thickness is generally found in some proximal cores seč 5 10 11 and 17 while in distal cores it is higher seč 21 25 28 and 29 but this trend is not true for all cores differences in sediment thickness could also be observed in nearby cores seč 11 showed only 32 cm of reservoir sediments it was located near the thalweg while seč 12 was much thicker 60 cm a sharper lithological contrast was found between the main sediment units in the křižanovice reservoir the older pre reservoir unit is composed of poorly sorted light coloured grey or grey brown medium to coarse sands silty sands occasionally containing clasts 1cm the thickness of the reservoir sediments varies from 10 to 45 cm slightly rising in the flow direction maximum thickness can be observed in the core křiž 12 reservoir sediments are more fine grained in general dark grey black or grey brown coloured an exception is found in inflow facies composed of medium to coarse grained sands and silty sands downstream the sediment can be classified as sandy silts or silts with occasional sandy layers silts or clayey silts have been deposited near the dam wall lamination is usually absent aside from some parts of the proximal cores revealing sandy layers or laminae křiž 8 phytodetritus and plant remains were common 4 3 petrophysical patterns magnetic susceptibility and mass activity of 137cs mass specific ms values vary widely from 2 57 10 9 m3kg 1 core seč 14 depth 31 33 cm to 7 18 10 7 m3kg 1 core seč 5 depth interval 16 18 cm in the seč reservoir and from 2 16 10 8 m3kg 1 core křiž 10 depth 10 cm to 3 7 10 6 m3kg 1 křiž 7 depth 62 cm in the křižanovice reservoir some cores are characterised by extremely low variability of ms while others exhibit local minima and maxima on an ms log the greatest dispersion of values was generally found in the lower parts of some cores seč 5 11 12 14 which can be related to the heterogeneous nature of underlying alluvial sediments while in other cores parts that were composed of alluvial sediments the depth pattern of ms was almost constant core seč 19 ms of the pre reservoir sediments was significantly higher up to two orders of magnitude in the křižanovice reservoir the onset of reservoir sedimentation is characterised by a sharp decrease in ms values in some cores free of a fluctuating upward pattern with typical values in the range of 3 5 10 7 m3kg 1 in proximal cores and about 1 3 10 7 m3kg 1 in distal cores aside from this uniform trend a slight saw tooth pattern was found in křiž 1 and křiž 4 cores revealing local minima and maxima in the ms log the minor ms increase was observed at the subsurface or surface layers of some cores through the reservoir cores křiž 1 8 10 and 15 the 137cs mass activity exhibited a distinct peak in all measured cores fig 5 137cs mass activity values varied from values below the detection limit 9 bq kg 1 to 172 bq kg 1 background values found in the deepest parts of the sediment cores were typically below the instrument detection limit maximum values were detected in the seč 25 core with a value of 152 bq kg 1 and 172 bq kg 1 in the křiž 11 core in general lower peak values were observed in the proximal parts and were slightly higher in the distal parts of the reservoirs the peak of 137cs was located at a depth interval of 12 18 cm core seč 17 30 36 cm core seč 28 depth profiles of 137cs mass activity were characterised by a sharp increase followed by a peak and subsequently a progressive decrease in the top layers such a pattern was observed in the cores seč 17 seč 28 and křiž 13 in contrast a gradual increase was observed in cores seč 25 křiž 8 and 11 mass activity rose from depths of 24 to 30 cm to a maximum of 6 12 cm below the surface 4 4 grain size grain size distribution was analysed in selected cores all or half of the samples and for all surface samples if the lithological contrast between pre and reservoir sediments was sometimes unclear the main textural difference was found in the presence of coarse to very coarse sand and occasionally gravel grains in the former unit moreover histograms of the pre reservoir sediment showed a presence of a coarse fraction centred at 0 5 mm and typically exhibiting a polymodal distribution the overall trends indicate changing sediment texture in the proximal to distal direction in both reservoirs fig 6 downcore grain size variations were found in proximal cores showing a saw tooth pattern while a more uniform depth distribution was observed in some distal cores the silt and sand percentage varied widely while clay proportions were more stable the dominant fraction was silt in most cores but samples from inflow and proximal parts were characterised by an abundance of sand fig 6 significant sand proportions were observed until the first third of the seč reservoir and sand proportions decreased downstream except for some local peaks core seč 29 but these showed very fine or fine sand the minor sand increase was observed in some cores through the reservoir in the subsurface samples the general trend refers to the gradual increase in clay proportions in the proximal to distal direction the typical clay percentage was about 5 8 in the inflow part growing to 8 10 in the middle part and then to the highest proportions 11 16 close to the dam wall core seč 28 box plots of the grain size median d50 were constructed for reservoir sediments in selected cores through the seč reservoir along the thalweg according to ternary plots fig 6 most samples are classified as silts and sandy silts according to folk s classification 1974 similar grain size trends were observed in the křižanovice reservoir fig 6 the heterogeneous texture was observed up to 700 m from the inflow silt dominated in most of the cores except for the inflow part where sand prevailed silt proportions revealed a fluctuating pattern from 24 to 65 increasing and more stable silt proportions were found in the distal cores but significant sand proportions were also found there for example in the core křiž 8 up to 77 in subsurface layers fig 6 and in the most distal core křiž 15 up to 29 just as in the seč reservoir the difference was in the proportions of individual sand fractions the admixture or a substantial amount of medium to very coarse sand grains were observed in the proximal cores while mostly very fine or fine sand was present in the distal sites the clay proportions were mostly very low varying from 3 to 7 in the inflow and slightly rising in the flow direction typical clay proportions varied from 4 to 10 in the middle part core křiž 8 then from 8 to 13 in the distal cores cores křiž 12 and 15 there the depth pattern of grain size was free of fluctuations the surface samples revealed a gradual decrease in grain size in the flow direction the dominant fraction was silt in the surface layers but the ratio between fine and coarse silt was almost constant the inflow samples contained substantial amounts of fine to medium sand while in the distal samples the sand fraction was composed of very fine sand grains the clay proportions increased downstream from 4 5 to 8 10 the general longitudinal trend shows a gradual in the seč reservoir or more rapid in the křižanovice reservoir downstream decrease of d50 fig 7 as expected with only some local excursions present the grain size median is quite variable in the first third of the seč reservoir length then the values decrease behind coring site 17 and become more uniform they vary in a narrower interval grain size median slight increases in the section between coring sites seč 24 and 29 finally the lowest values of d50 were found in distal parts of the reservoir core seč 28 similarly the grain size median is variable in the very proximal part of the křižanovice reservoir and then shows a rapid decrease towards the medial part of the reservoir behind coring site 8 subsequently the values tend to be uniform and finally a slight increase was observed near the dam wall coring site 15 we also compared the grain size characteristics in the surface layers top 2 cm of all cores to document the current spatial grain size variability across the seč reservoir fig 8 the general trend shows a gradual decrease of d50 the inflow part is characterised by greater variability up to an extreme value of 337 µm and a large proportion of coarse to very coarse sand in the core seč 13 which was probably caused by the presence of eroded bank material otherwise d50 ranges from 35 to 81 µm depending on the position relative to the thalweg sand proportions decrease downstream and there is a difference in the proportions of individual sand fractions coarse and very coarse sand does not occur after the first bend of the reservoir 1 km core seč 17 behind the inflow and finally only very fine sand occurs in the most distal site core seč 28 downstream d50 decreases to 23 33 µm in the middle part and finally to 18 µm in the most distal site the c m diagram passega 1957 1964 was constructed to discriminate between sediment transport and deposition processes fig 9 the c parameter should be the 99th percentile d99 and the m parameter represents the grain size median d50 for low reproducibility of d99 we used d90 percentile to be more representative as suggested by dhivert et al 2015 the relationship between c and m indicates the effect of sorting by water currents and bottom turbulence passega 1957 1964 three domains have been defined suggesting particle transport under distinct sedimentation regimes the first domain with low c and m parameters and c m 3 ratios is parallel to the c m line and indicates sedimentation from suspension it mainly comprises distal samples from both reservoirs the second domain non parallel to the c m line and with higher c m values and higher c m ratios c m 3 to 10 suggests a graded suspension transport mode under higher energy conditions this means that the coarsest sand particles could be transported in suspension during floods bravard et al 2014 the third domain exhibiting high c m values and variable c m ratios comprises sediments deposited in a high energy environment the particles were transported as bed load in the channel bottom predominantly in the proximal part of the reservoirs core seč 24 transport mode depends not only on particle diameter density and shape but also on hydraulic conditions which are determined by reservoir size and operation ehrbar et al 2018 the depth profiles of d50 and d90 percentiles and c m line were constructed in order to identify past changes in the transport type as shown for the two nearby cores seč 11 and 12 in the proximal part of the seč reservoir fig 10 both cores were located in the same distance from the inflow however one core seč 11 was located near the thalweg while the other was drilled in a shallower place seč 12 the depth pattern of d50 is almost constant in both cores while several deflections were found on the d90 depth profile showing some extreme values exceeding 800 μm in the seč 12 core the values were lower for the seč 11 core the samples having high d90 values also exhibit different domain on the c m diagram indicating a higher water turbulence the logs of grain size parameters were compared to ms logs fig 10 in addition the variability in grain size was evaluated in a cross sectional profile d2 in the seč reservoir using grab samples fig 11 sediments are relatively coarse grained typically with bimodal or polymodal distribution d50 from 30 to 60 µm on both steeply inclined slopes near the reservoir banks in the centre of the reservoir where the floor is flat or only gently inclined former floodplain sediments are much finer and show unimodal distribution with relatively constant d50 20 µm fig 11 it is important to note that the very central part of reservoir with a flat bottom the former river thalweg fig 11 samples d8 and d9 has a more coarse grained distribution than the surrounding samples on the gently inclined reservoir floor this suggests that the thalweg is prone to more dynamic conditions likely related to hyperpycnal flows than the surrounding pre reservoir floodplain which tend to accumulate sediment only by suspension settling 4 5 sediment colour colour contrast was found between two main sediment units in the seč reservoir pre reservoir sediment revealed high brightness ciel typically in the range of 60 to 63 or even 70 core seč 19 and higher ciea and cieb which supports visual observation ciea vs cieb plots were constructed to visualise this difference fig 12 unfortunately there was gradual or no colour change after reservoir filling while an abrupt change ciel was observed in the cores seč 17 25 and 28 the depth distribution of all vis drs data usually exhibits a more heterogeneous pattern in the inflow and proximal cores while a uniform pattern is typical for distal cores in accordance with the ms and grain size logs slight shifts in cieb values were found i e to yellow shades for distal samples a partial positive correlation was found between brightness and ms values in the sense of main deflections for reservoir sediments while in some cores or parts there was no correlation distinct trends in sediment colour were found in the křižanovice reservoir proximal sediments are on average darker ciel values from 51 6 to 57 9 core křiž 2 becoming paler downstream ciel values from 58 1 to 62 9 core křiž 11 as well as near a dam wall ciel values from 60 4 to 62 2 core křiž 13 the slight downstream shift was observed in ciea and significant in the cieb axis suggesting a shift to yellow shades downstream as well as in the seč reservoir 5 discussion 5 1 geophysical survey bottom morphology and grain size a good level of correspondence was found between gpr profiles and bathymetric data in terms of bottom morphology the gpr is thus an efficient tool for underwater surveys in shallow reservoirs but it must be supported by data from the sediment cores for a more reliable interpretation it was able to distinguish the former channel of the chrudimka river and visualise the reservoir bottom gpr was used to distinguish individual facies within the reservoirs as confirmed in other works moorman et al 2001 viseras et al 2009 the gpr survey revealed poorly defined reflectors close to the inflow showing either the former floodplain sediments or reworked reservoir sediments this reflection type agrees with the heterogeneous nature of coarse grained inflow sediments several types of gpr reflections allow us to describe internal structures and facies with different dielectric constants moorman et al 2001 have distinguished three basic reflection types in lake sediments and this concept can also be applied to the seč reservoir well defined reflectors 1 of reservoir sediments create continuous near horizontal lines in cross section hyperbolic reflections 2 are generated by small bodies for example boulders and bedrock pinnacles chaotic reflection 3 is typical for discontinuous layers containing coarser clasts and disturbed layering such an instance of chaotic reflection was identified close to the inflow of the seč reservoir supporting our assumptions about sediment reworking and the deposition of relatively heterogeneous coarse grained sediments in the reservoir inflow as confirmed by the results of the grain size analysis this type of reflection can be assigned to a fluvial or colluvial sequence below the reservoir sediments the downstream transition from hummocky wavy and asymmetric to smooth symmetric reflections of the uppermost sediment layer found in both studied reservoirs reflects downstream facies change a similar pattern was described in the ship creek reservoir in alaska hunter et al 2003 and alhama reservoir in spain viseras et al 2009 a good degree of agreement was found between bottom reflection intensity estimated from the sonar and grain size data obtained from the corresponding sediment samples the suitability of the geophysical imaging of sediment bottom reflection intensity which is related to sediment texture and type has rarely been indicated for mapping of the bottom cover e g venteris et al 2014 it is based on acoustic reflectance and therefore the amplitude of the reflected sound waves soft reservoir sediments can be characterised by a single reflection and lower intensity of returning waves while hard bedrock and coarse grained sediments are characterised by a double or multiple reflection with higher intensity soft bottom reflection is typical of zones along the thalweg and in the valley centre especially in the middle and more distal parts of both reservoirs it coincides with fine grained sediments with a predominance of mud clay silt hard reflection of higher amplitude denotes the presence of coarser sediments or hard bedrock without fine sedimentary cover such a reflection occurred in the inflow part of reservoirs and at the steeply inclined margins around the flat bottom which is further supported by the gpr survey and grain size analysis both methods indicated the presence of coarse grained material on the reservoir margins correspondence between d50 and bottom reflection intensity was observed in the seč reservoir along cross sectional profile d2 as evident in fig 11 where samples having higher d50 also reveal higher values of bottom reflection intensity however only weak statistical correlation was found between the both parameters r2 0 27 for the whole reservoir it may be caused by many uncertainties between grain size and bottom reflection intensity such as the rapid alternation of coarse and fine grained subsurface layers unknown depth of penetration of the acoustic waves nepheloid layer etc while grain size measurements are point data bottom reflection intensity data refer to interpolated raster based layer we have found that using a combination of historic maps and present bathymetry is essential to selecting the best possible coring sites 5 2 sediment stratigraphy and deposition processes the particle size decreases in the proximal to distal direction fig 6 which is a common trend in reservoirs e g lópez et al 2016 sedláček et al 2017 reflecting decreasing hydrodynamic energy the most important variable affecting the sediment distribution is the basin geometry and the resulting available accommodation space actual water volume in the reservoir a relatively simple reservoir geometry highlights the role of longitudinal trends in both reservoirs which is related to current velocity and hence sediment transport capacity snyder et al 2004 no distinct gradient in reservoir sediment thickness was found that contradicts the results of other studies cf dhivert et al 2015 sedláček et al 2013 2017 sediment accumulation rates sar are similar across the studied reservoirs suggesting uniform deposition in the sense of morris and fan 1997 with a slight indication of tapering because sediments are thickest in the middle parts of reservoirs uniform and tapering deposits also occur in long and narrow reservoirs with small load of fine sediment and high water level fluctuation morris and fan 1997 the tendency to taper gently is also demonstrated by increasing bottom reflection intensity near the dam wall suggesting that there can be hard bedrock i e without reservoir sediments however there is a narrow strip of soft sediments along the thalweg pointing to the dam outlet in the seč reservoir sediment thickness rose gently in the křižanovice reservoir to the dam wall in addition grain size median and bottom reflection values are slightly higher near the dam wall because sediments can easily reach the dam wall in smaller reservoirs shotbolt et al 2005 sedláček et al 2016 the low lithological contrast between pre reservoir and reservoir sediments suggests a slow transition from fluvial to lacustrine domains in some cores i e slow reservoir filling in the initial stages this assumption is supported by petrophysical proxies revealing almost no change after reservoir filling especially in sites further from the thalweg such sites may be characterised by the calm deposition of overbank fines during the previous fluvial stage in contrast the onset of reservoir sedimentation was sharp in some cores near the thalweg most likely due to more rapid inwash as the reservoir first fills shotbolt et al 2001 another explanation refers to periodic sediment reworking inflow part blurring the boundary between fluvial and reservoir sediments changes in element concentrations or element ratios can help distinguish the onset of reservoir sedimentation matys grygar et al 2018 have found increases in ti and al si and a decrease in k and ca in seč reservoir sediments after filling as well as enhanced retention of the finest particulates especially fe and mn oxides the coincidence of the pre dam position of the chrudimka river channel with the present thalweg as revealed by bathymetric survey documents a stable channel course near the reservoir inflow almost no sediment has been deposited within the former channel due to strong underwater currents causing erosion this assumption is supported by the gpr images and bottom reflection intensity imaging because the former channel is characterised by more intense reflection than the surrounding area conversely sediments are mostly accumulated on the former flat valley floor river floodplain and outside the former river channel what is also evident in the gpr profiles 4 and 5 see fig 4 reservoir sediments tend to fill local depressions as again best illustrated by the gpr survey in these local depressions sediments are also easier to retain even when the water level is lowered following the levelling of the original bottom roughness these initial sediment packages were overlain by horizontal layers a typical deltaic complex was not recognised in the inflow cf sedláček et al 2017 bábek et al 2020 most likely resulting from the narrow and funnel like geometry of the reservoir inflow part its low depth fluctuating water level and very low sediment input from the river catchment there is no clear evidence of upward coarsening trends in the seč reservoir sediments only a minor increase in sand content was observed in the top 10 cm in some cores through the reservoir on the other hand an upward increasing proportion of sand suggests progradation in the křižanovice reservoir slight evidence of downstream accretion indicates that the depocentre is moving downstream through the action of hyperpycnical currents occasional coarse sandy layers are probably flood related event beds or are related to water level fluctuations however considering predominantly stable inflow discharge sediment input is rather a steady process large inflow events which would bring a large amount of sediments have rarely occurred in the last two decades fig 2 as the distance from the thalweg increases in the transverse direction current velocity decreases and a relatively fine grained sediment can be deposited relatively close to the inflow part cores seč 3 and 17 large dispersion of c and m parameters found in some very proximal cores suggests changes in the sediment transport type which are also shown in the c m diagram the coarse grain size distribution of some layers in the proximal cores might be related to changes in the water level rather than the floods this assumption is supported by the depth profiles of c d90 and m d50 parameters showing almost cyclic variations and sudden jumps in the c parameter coarsest fractions it indicates that this parameter is much more sensitive to the water level changes compared to the grain size median these sudden changes cannot be found elsewhere in the proximal parts of both reservoirs but only in the cores located in a greater distance from the thalweg and or having a low water depth such sites are more influenced by the water lever lowering compared to the sites in near the thalweg as depth and distance from the inflow increase the sedimentation pattern changes sediments additionally tend to accumulate in the former channel and within the deepest part of the central valley due to the accumulation of post depositional mobilised bottom sediments from the reservoir inflow and margins shotbolt et al 2005 this was confirmed by grain size data revealing uniform grain size distribution in the valley centre see fig 11 material containing soft reservoir sediments mixed with bank derived material is deposited on the steep slopes of reservoir margins this assumption is also supported by bottom reflection intensity because both reservoir margins show hard reflections the coarser grained nature of the sediment in the thalweg fig 11 indicates the role played by hyperpycnical flows in sediment distribution in contrast to the finer nature of sediment on the slopes of the thalweg which was likely deposited by suspension settling due to reservoir dynamics there is no fixed division of the studied reservoir bottoms to erosional transportation and accumulation zones in the sense of håkanson 1977 1981 the erosional zones are located at the reservoir margins close to the inflow and within the channel which are characterised by high levels of water turbulence shotbolt et al 2005 but not all such areas the accumulation zone is located in the central part of the reservoir as is common shotbolt et al 2005 but some sites of preferred accumulation were also identified in isolated spots in the proximal parts 5 3 sediment accumulation rates the peak in 137cs mass activity is interpreted as the fallout event from the chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in 1986 e g appleby 2001 heim et al 2004 wildi et al 2004 the results agree with works conducted in other czech reservoirs nehyba et al 2011 sedláček et al 2013 2017 and oxbow lakes bábek et al 2008 sedláček et al 2016 the post depositional migration of 137cs is usually limited in water saturated reservoirs and lacustrine sediments appleby 2001 ilus and saxén 2005 but the reworking of 137cs enriched layers into younger strata may occur due to floods underwater slides and other processes this may explain the apparent gradual increase of 137cs mass activity in some cores seč 25 křiž 8 and 11 whereas in others a sharp 137cs peak was found no clear evidence was found for older 137cs events in contrast to other reservoirs sedláček et al 2013 2016 low 137cs activities in basal sequences may be residues from such events this can be the case of the křižanovice reservoir because its filling started roughly in parallel with nuclear tests in the atmosphere during the 1950s and this may help to explain the 137cs presence in the reservoir basal sequences peak 137cs concentrations are comparable in both reservoirs suggesting that 137cs distribution was only slightly affected by the river damming or a substantial amount of 137cs was derived in a river section between both reservoirs higher values in reservoir distal parts are generally related to lithological change in particular to grain size because 137cs is preferentially bound to fine and clay particles alberts et al 1989 ilus and saxén 2005 three dated events were used to calculate an average sedimentation rate for two time periods the first important event represents the onset of lacustrine sedimentation 1935 in seč reservoir 1953 in křižanovice reservoir inferred from lithological description ms drs logs and grain size characteristics it is important to note that the safe determination of this boundary can only be achieved by a combination of all methods especially in the relatively homogeneous sediment record the second event was the chernobyl nuclear power plant accident 1986 while the final tie point was the year of core extraction 2017 from reservoir filling until the present day average sediment accumulation rates sar reservoir base found in 12 cores were in the interval from 0 2 core seč 5 to 0 7 cores 12 and 27 cm year similar values were calculated for the křižanovice reservoir the reservoir base was found in 8 cores and produced estimates varying from 0 2 core křiž 5 to 0 69 core křiž 12 cm year for six 137cs dated cores the sar ranged from 0 48 to 1 06 cm year since 1986 in the seč reservoir cores seč 17 25 and 28 and from 0 67 to 0 87 cm year for the křižanovice reservoir cores křiž 8 11 and 13 this implies that sar was roughly similar since reservoir filling in the core seč 25 on the other hand there is a discrepancy in the sar in cores seč 17 and 28 because the main 137cs peak is located just a few cm above the reservoir sedimentation onset the sars are much lower in comparison to other czech reservoirs e g the valley type brno reservoir 0 3 to 4 6 cm yr the nové mlýny reservoir 0 6 to 2 3 cm yr and the les království reservoir 2 8 up to to 9 7 cm yr sedláček et al 2013 2017 bábek et al 2020 a typical sediment accumulation rate reported in dam reservoirs worldwide is above 2 cm year müller et al 2000 arnason and fletscher 2003 audry et al 2004 the relatively lower accumulation rate can be caused by the size of the accommodation space and especially by the low sediment input from the river catchment consider the elbe river annual discharge of 52 4 m3s 1 in the les království reservoir vs the chrudimka river annual discharge of 2 28 m3s 1 vs in the seč reservoir it can also be the main factor affecting sar because its average values are comparable in both reservoirs although the sediment volume is much lower in the křižanovice reservoir 5 4 trap efficiency and sediment balance trap efficiency is an important variable to assess sediment balance in the sense the in and out fluxes of sediments to each reservoir trap efficiency is a function of reservoir geometry inflow and incoming sediment characteristics heinemann 1984 verstraeten and poesen 2000 sediment trapping is also dependent on particle diameter morris and fan 1997 because coarser material has a higher settling velocity and is deposited preferentially verstraeten and poesen 2000 the narrow and bent shape of the studied reservoir contributes to the effective trap efficiency for coarse grained particles both reservoirs are capable of trapping particles larger than 0 125 mm fine sand completely because coarse grained particles do not occur in distal cores moreover a substantial proportion of fine sand and silt is trapped main fraction deposited in reservoirs is silt walling and moorehead 1989 especially fine silt as reported in barasona reservoir over 60 in spain lópez et al 2016 snyder et al 2006 have reported the effective trap efficiency for coarse grained particles larger than 4 mm a certain amount of clay sized particles is not trapped and is flushed away via the reservoir outlet guillén ludeña et al 2018 clay proportions are comparable in both reservoirs a minor increase was merely observed in the proximal to distal direction and therefore the finest fractions are only slightly affected by river damming similar results were also present in a medium sized reservoir anselmetti et al 2007 however bedrock geology does not allow the formation of large amounts of clay particles we calculated the trap efficiency te of both reservoirs using the heinmann formula 1981 which was modified from the original brune method 1953 t e 22 119 6 c i 0 012 1 02 c i where c the reservoir capacity km3 i the reservoir inflow km3 year the calculated value of te reached 90 6 for the seč reservoir and a much lower value of 57 4 for the křižanovice reservoir however this calculation applies to the initial capacity after reservoir filling the present value considering the decrease in reservoir capacity due to silting is slightly lower values of 90 4 and 56 2 respectively trap efficiencies are not uniform over time because of varying reservoir capacity due to seasonal water level fluctuation and varying hydrologic conditions rausch and heinemann 1975 morris and fan 1997 verstraeten and poesen 2000 in addition te decrease over time due to the reduction in reservoir capacity brune 1953 minear and kondolf 2009 bábek et al 2020 trap efficiency also temporarily decreases with water level lowering providing more opportunity for resuspension and transport of stored sediments snyder et al 2004 it implies that the te tends to reduce more quickly in reservoirs undergoing frequent water level fluctuation assuming maximum seasonal decrease of water level of 6 and 3 m in seč and křižanovice reservoirs the recalculated value of te decrease slightly to 85 5 for the seč reservoir and more distinctly to 45 1 for the křižanovice reservoir the high trap efficiency most likely results from the long and narrow shape of the seč reservoir in combination with its relatively high reservoir capacity and low inflow the te has remained high until the present day indicated among others by its ability to capture most heavy metal pollution and fine sediment components including fe oxides in contrast heavy metal concentrations are significantly lower in the křižanovice reservoir matys grygar et al 2018 in the křižanovice reservoir the much lower initial te and its more pronounced decrease through reservoir operation is probably a result of its smaller capacity reservoirs that are small relative to the annual inflow have much lower trapping kondolf et al 2004 it is also known that smaller reservoirs tend to lose their capacity more quickly carvalho et al 2000 verstraeten and poesen 2000 however calculations of te based on the capacity to inflow ratio are only applicable to long term average conditions morris and fan 1997 high trap efficiency may also be the result of relatively little water fluctuations with respect to still high storage capacity in the seč reservoir as well as absence of flushing operations the total volume of deposited sediments was estimated by the volume of a geometric figure that resembles a trapezoidal cross section multiplied by the length romero díaz et al 2007 we calculated that 647 000 m3 of sediment is deposited in the seč reservoir and 89 000 m3 is deposited in the křižanovice reservoir considering their years of operation this implies a mean annual sediment supply of 7 890 m3 for seč and 1 390 m3 for the křižanovice reservoir the annual sediment yield was calculated by dividing the total accumulated sediment in the reservoir by the period between the core extraction and reservoir filling operation time this gives an average sediment yield in terms of mean sediment volume per year that is then normalized to the total reservoir catchment area area specific sediment yield ssy using the formula ssy v t a where ssy is the area specific sediment yield expressed in m3 km2 year v is the total sediment volume in the reservoir m3 t is operation time years and a is the catchment area km2 this value was much higher for seč reaching 36 5 m3 km2 year compared to only 5 42 m3 km2 year for křižanovice reservoir however calculated ssy is underestimated because it does not consider the finest fraction which escapes the reservoirs through suspended load therefore the measured values need to be corrected for the trap efficiency verstraeten and poesen 2002 based on the te 9 6 and 43 8 of incoming sediment was not trapped and passed through the seč and křižanovice reservoirs routing efficiency which corresponds to 68 707 m3 and 69 362 m3 of sediments since the reservoir operation respectively the annual sediment output is 837 m3 and 1083 m3 respectively after correction the ssy is 40 4 m3 km2 year for the seč and 9 6 m3 km2 year for the křižanovice reservoir the difference between the both reservoirs may be a consequence of a more effective sediment trapping in the seč reservoir compared to the seč reservoir other czech reservoirs display equivalent or lower ssy values the values without correction to passed sediments 36 8 m3 km2 year for the les království reservoir catchment area 531 8 km2 sediment yield calculated from bábek et al 2020 14 95 m3 km2 year for the brno reservoir catchment area 1 586 km2 and 10 92 m3 km2 year for the nové mlýny reservoir upper basin 4 6 m3 km2 year for the middle basin and 2 83 m3 km2 year for the lower basin catchment areas 4 599 11 713 and 11 853 km2 respectively sedláček et al 2016 in other examples the ssy varied between 7 and 1 688 m3 km2 y for 24 water reservoirs in kansas usa rahmani et al 2018 between 89 and 520 m3 km2 y for water reservoirs in california usa minear and kondolf 2009 and between 1 068 to 2 204 m3 km2 y for water reservoirs in the swiss alps guillén ludeña et al 2018 the reservoirs studied are located in the upper reach of the chrudimka river with small catchment areas it has been acknowledged that sediment yield depends among other factors such as land use and hydrological regime on the size of the catchment area i e higher sediment yield has been observed in smaller catchment areas walling 1983 rompaey et al 2001 rahmani et al 2018 which is also confirmed by our results in addition sediment pathways can be influenced by possible sediment traps upstream walling 1983 verstraeted and poesen 2002 sedláček et al 2016 but no extensive floodplain occurs upstream contributing to relative higher sediment transport to the seč reservoir on the other hand most of the catchment area is composed of resistant crystalline and metamorphic rocks and covered by forests and meadows which further contributes to low sediment yield variations in sediment yield are related to changes at a basin scale land use changes on a long term scale while annual variations in sediment production may be controlled primarily by flood magnitude and frequency ambers 2001 szalińska et al 2020 based on mean inflow discharge of the chrudimka river we suppose that sediment yield is highest during spring and summer and lowest during winter however a decrease in snowfall and early spring thaw period may increase sediment yield during the winter season in the next decades szalińska et al 2020 the reservoirs lifespans were not dramatically reduced due to siltation as capacity had only decreased by about 3 in seč and 4 4 in křižanovice since filling indicating negligible annual loss of storage capacity of just 0 04 and 0 06 respectively far below the global average hypothetically if the sediment yield remains stable it will take 2680 and 1400 years to infill the seč and křižanovice reservoir respectively for the comparison the annual loss of storage capacity is estimated to range between 0 5 and 1 at the global scale mahmood 1987 white 2001 araújo et al 2006 wisser et al 2013 5 5 sediment reworking and water level fluctuations sediment reworking is probably common in the proximal part of both reservoirs examined especially close to the inflows in the former river channel or on steeper valley slopes therefore cores from very proximal parts of the reservoir bottom cannot be used as reliable sediment archives sediment deposition and reworking are controlled by water current velocity local reservoir geometry and operation management water levels in some czech reservoirs including the seč reservoir are regularly reduced before expected flood periods or in winter months see fig 2 water level lowering can also be caused by the periods of drought which have occurred more frequently in central europe in recent years trnka et al 2014 periods of droughts can have a far reaching effect on sedimentation processes in reservoirs trap efficiency and sediment balance for example the recent summer drought periods in 2016 and 2018 caused the water level to decrease by approximately five meters in the seč reservoir recently incision and erosive downstream transport has been reported in two czech reservoirs skalka and nechranice because of the summer 2019 drawdown in drought period pacina et al 2020 drought associated changes in climate may have an increasing effect on the sediment distribution in czech reservoirs in the future decades during low water period in the seč and křižanovice reservoirs the shallow bottom is exposed on which erosion and accumulation are likely to alternate morris and fan 1997 these contrasts may be denoted as switching between fluvial and lacustrine sedimentation during water level lowering influencing the trap efficiency morris and fan 1997 snyder et al 2004 sediment movement during water level fluctuations can be highlighted at steep sides of the reservoirs and may cause the erosion of proximal sediments coarse grained proximal sediments tend to have a low erosion stability while decreasing particle size and increasing cohesiveness lead to a higher sediment stability beckers et al 2018 moreover bank erosion can act as an additional sediment source shotbolt et al 2005 mccartney 2009 water level lowering is associated with moderate changes in the grain size distribution consequently reservoir sediments affected by lowstands exhibit bimodal grain size distribution lópez et al 2016 as shown also by our data see fig 11 as a result of both phenomena fresh sediment is deposited in the deepest parts of the reservoir another consequence of frequent water level fluctuations can be sediment relocation through the reservoir and its flushing down into the deeper parts of the reservoir ehrbar et al 2018 bladé castellet et al 2019 it can explain greater sediment thicknesses in the medial part of the seč reservoir as well as a slight increase of the grain size median in the section between coring sites 24 and 29 see fig 7 thus bank erosion and water level operation can explain the presence of relatively coarse grained particles in some distal cores water level lowering causes an increase in the sand fraction downstream compared to the situation in highstands which would result in a more homogeneous sediment character lópez et al 2016 drawdowns might induce different sediment transport patterns compared to the high water level conditions as indicated by the c m diagram 5 6 downstream effects of damming considering the high trap efficiency of the seč reservoir a substantial amount of sediment accumulated in the křižanovice reservoir was probably derived from the river section between the both reservoirs this assumption is supported by different ms and colour signatures for the křižanovice reservoir in addition coarse sand sized grains greater than0 125 mm are completely trapped in the seč reservoir and there is a predominance of sand sized grains and overall coarse sediment texture in the proximal part of the křižanovice reservoir its inflow part is comparable to the corresponding inflow part of the seč reservoir in terms of grain size see fig 6b in the křižanovice reservoir inflow part sediments are very poorly sorted and coarse sand sized grains are very angular at a closer look which suggest their transport over a short distance coarsening of river bed material is one of typical downstream response to river damming kondolf 1997 sandy deposits just a few decimetres thick were described between both reservoirs while silt deposition was absent matys grygar et al 2018 it is also likely that a certain amount of sediment is not derived from the chrudimka river channel itself but from small mainly unnamed tributaries due to the damming the chrudimka river course downstream the seč reservoir is more prone to eroding the channel bed and adjacent banks and tends to incise this effect of sediment deficit represents a consequence of sediment starved waters kondolf and swanson 1993 kondolf 1997 kondolf et al 2004 the chrudimka river has a higher thalweg slope steepest just below the seč dam wall up to 6 5 m km before slowly decreasing to 3 5 4 m km a higher thalweg slope can lead to a faster erosion rate there is a small 0 149 mm3 reservoir seč ii padrty situated just below the seč reservoir dam which can trap a certain amount of sediment the same results in terms of increased bank and bed erosion have been reported e g in the mekong river between the manwan and chiang saen reservoirs kummu and varis 2007 5 7 variation in physical properties variations in physical properties reflect changing conditions within reservoirs as well as variations in sediment input a highly fluctuating pattern reflects changing energy conditions in the proximal parts while the more uniform distribution point of calm conditions of suspension settling in the distal parts sedláček et al 2013 2017 we identified three types of behaviour of ms in relation to other physical properties especially grain size 1 the ms values are positively correlated to fine fractions clay and silt likely due to the higher concentrations of fe oxides bábek et al 2011 their r2 varying from 0 33 to 0 68 conversely the ms values are lower in sand sized fractions mostly composed of diamagnetic quartz and feldspar grains such a pattern was found in the cores seč 2 22 25 and 28 2 an opposite trend points to the positive correlation to sand fraction and negative to fine particles was observed in cores seč 5 11 12 and 21 nevertheless in those cores the sand fraction was fine to very fine 3 in addition a good degree of correspondence was found between the depth profiles of d90 and ms logs see fig 10 the peaks of extreme d90 values coincided with the peaks on ms logs as can be seen ms logs can help identify past water level changes associated with floods and or lowstands ms is not driven exclusively by grain size in all sediments because such correlations fail to fit in the same cores or parts as shown in cores seč 21 and 29 besides grain size control the ms values can also be influenced by diamagnetic organic matter and the presence of fe oxides ms can increase significantly due to the presence of ferrimagnetic magnetite maghemite and antiferromagnetic hematite minerals which may be enriched in fine sand fraction the ms values are significantly higher in the křižanovice reservoir this may be related to the distinctive bedrock geology of the river section between the reservoirs which is supported by the slightly different colour signatures for the křižanovice reservoir indeed bodies of metamorphic rocks are located here including metagabbro gneiss to migmatitic rocks and sometimes quartzitic gneiss in particular gabbro rocks tend to exhibit high ms values sediment colour is related to the geology of the source area therefore ciel data were used as a relative indicator of sediment composition and in lake processes compared to ms colour properties appear to be a better correlation tool because some deflections with potential correlations were found higher ciel values are associated with light coloured mineral constituents quartz and feldspar and lower values with greater amounts of dark clay minerals and organic matter bábek et al 2008 no significant proximal to distal brightness trends were observed in the seč reservoir except for a moderate increase in its middle part on the other hand gradually increasing ciel values were observed in the křižanovice reservoir causing higher degrees of brightness of distal facies inflow sediments show greater colour variance because of changing current velocity conditions and water level while distal sediments reveal more homogenous colour pointing to more calm sedimentary conditions sedláček et al 2017 as suggest the c m diagram see fig 9 slight shifts in ciea cieb ratios fig 12 for distal samples are attributed to facies change in the proximal to distal direction and different redox conditions in individual cores sedláček et al 2017 longer residence time in the water column for more distal sites can lead to a higher degree of fe oxidation in the oxy hydroxide mixtures sedláček et al 2017 matys grygar et al 2018 resulting in shift towards yellow the seč reservoir and red yellow hues the křižanovice reservoir sediment colour and ciea cieb ratios have proven to be an important tool for identifying the onset of the reservoir sedimentation in general petrophysical proxies and grain size depth patterns were devoid of significant fluctuations in the křižanovice reservoir even in proximal parts this may be linked to more stable discharges see fig 2 buffered by the upstream seč reservoir 6 conclusions our results indicate some common sedimentary processes are occurring in the reservoirs studied but there are also site specific factors that affect sediment distribution that are unique to each reservoir therefore reservoir research is not a trivial task and using reservoir sediments as environmental archives requires a considerable care an important factor affecting sediment accumulation is the pre reservoir floodplain morphology subsequent reservoir geometry and management although the thickness of the reservoir sediment exhibits certain general patterns it can also vary from place to place according to such site specific conditions as the distance from inflow distance from thalweg bottom topography and thalweg gradient detailed grain size analysis also revealed some site specific patterns spatially distinct grain size sorting recognized in both reservoirs is a function of travel distance within the reservoir which is conditioned by their bent and narrow geometry as well as by reservoir management especially manipulation with the water level in the reservoirs studied here trap efficiency proved to be particularly dependent on reservoir capacity due to low discharge the much larger seč reservoir is located upstream and will thus prolong the lifespan of the smaller downstream reservoirs of the chrudimka river cascade including the křižanovice reservoir the total trap efficiency of the reservoir cascade on the chrudimka river must be enormous and this must inevitably affect the fluvial system downstream on the other hand a certain amount of sediment is derived from below each reservoir due to the effect of sediment starved waters the seč reservoir developed a unique depositional style in which neither inflow delta nor distal muddy lake developed instead a sediment layer of relatively uniform thickness with a slight indication of tapering is distributed all along the reservoir length this depositional style is caused by the low sediment yield combined with the high trap efficiency and frequent water management operations methods used in this study are suitable for estimating how the reservoir management operations will affect the sediment distribution including the real impact of flushing operations on the sediment removal the best conclusions can be achieved with data integration based on our experience as demonstrated above we suggest that a reservoir sediment survey should be conducted in several steps combining bathymetry and geophysical surveys with high resolution stratigraphic methods and establishing chronological sequence each study should start by investigating available old maps before proceeding with bathymetric measurements including bottom reflection intensity and gpr survey in water depth less than ca 4 m the next step should be the selection of suitable coring sites with expected continuous sediment accumulation and thus a well defined stratigraphy following core extraction and analyses master cores could be selected for sediment archive purposes on the other hand

3791,gridded precipitation products are efficient supplements to surface meteorological gauges and thus a comprehensive evaluation of such products is essential this study systematically evaluated the performance of 4 gridded precipitation datasets with hourly scale in mainland china with ground gauge precipitation as a benchmark in particular we assessed the performance of two satellite based precipitation estimations spes integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg and global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap and two reanalysis precipitation estimations rpes modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr the results reveal that all the products have better performance in low latitude areas and have worse performance in the high latitude mountainous regions spe products have similar features of temporal spatial performance and diurnal cycle estimation and so have rpe products the overall summer spe accuracy surpasses that of all rpe products and vice versa in winter the error decomposition of each product linked the summer bias to excessive false events of light precipitation in winter the spe error is generally a result of missed and false events while that of the rpes originates from false precipitation the product accuracy increases with the time scale and the daily merra accuracy exceeds that of other products however due to the challenge in representing convective precipitation the accuracy of the diurnal cycle and peak hour is lower than that of the spes and representing weaker amplitudes compared to the gauge precipitation this consequently results in rpes poorer performance in extreme heavy precipitation compared to the spe products the results of this study are useful for both developers and users of gridded precipitation products keywords satellite precipitation estimation reanalysis precipitation estimation diurnal cycle extreme precipitation 1 introduction gridded precipitation products are important supplements to precipitation datasets huffman et al 2007 janowiak et al 1998 despite the numerous ground weather gauge stations and radar precipitation estimations that provide accurate ground precipitation observations spatial continuity in datasets is still lacking and the observation ranges are relatively limited skofronick jackson et al 2017 urita et al 2011 zhang et al 2012a gridded precipitation datasets have made remarkable progress in the last decades constantly improving the observation resolution and estimation accuracy bosilovich et al 2008 hossain and lettenmaier 2006 hou et al 2000 sub daily and hourly precipitation extremes exhibit an increase in intensity that exceeds thermodynamic constraints berg et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 the improvements in high resolution gridded precipitation data can facilitate sub daily extreme precipitation studies gridded precipitation estimations can generally be divided into two types based on their retrieval methods satellite based precipitation estimations spes and retrospective analysis precipitation estimations reanalysis precipitation estimations rpes sun et al 2018 the current key sensing methods for spes can be classified as 1 infrared ir satellites which retrieves ground precipitation using images of cloud top temperature kidd and huffman 2011 sorooshian et al 2000 2 passive microwave pmw which directly detects precipitation sized particles huffman et al 2007 skofronick jackson et al 2017 and 3 active microwave amw which employs spaceborne precipitation radar kidd and huffman 2011 kubota et al 2007 the spes usually integrate the advantages of multi types of satellite based sensors to estimate precipitation rather than adopting measurements from single type of sensors huffman et al 2007 kidd and huffman 2011 prakash et al 2018 for example the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa dataset is developed by combining various low earth orbit pmw and ir satellite based measurements huffman et al 2007 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann s core algorithm is to calculate precipitation based on ir image and to improve the accuracy by adaptively adjusting the network parameters using the instantaneous rain rate estimates from the trmm microwave imager sorooshian et al 2000 the multi satellite conjoint estimation algorithm can simultaneously take advantage of high precision of microwave remote sensing and wide coverage of ir remote sensing and thus provide more accurate and reliable estimation results many products release research version precipitation estimation adjusted by gauge based products which generally have better performance than the unadjusted version gelaro et al 2017 huffman et al 2019 huffman et al 2007 mega et al 2018 saha et al 2014 rpes combine the collection and assimilation of multi source meteorological data with a background forecast model to estimate the meteorological dynamic process bosilovich et al 2008 therefore rpes typically contain more meteorological variable estimations compared to spes and provide longer term precipitation estimations janowiak et al 1998 kidd and huffman 2011 sun et al 2018 limited by the effective observation range geosynchronous satellites the coverage of mainstream spes is constrained within 60 n s in contrast as rpe is derived from global climate models it can provide global observations thus rpes are suitable for high latitude water cycle studies serreze et al 2003 serreze and hurst 2000 however the lack of ground meteorological stations in polar regions increases the uncertainty in the evaluation of rpes gridded precipitation products have been widely applied in numerous fields over the recent years including hydrological modeling drought monitoring real time flood predictions landslide modeling and disease control ford et al 2009 hu et al 2019 wu et al 2014 yuan et al 2019 the precipitation observation bias is a complex function of topography altitude latitude seasons precipitation intensity and etc bosilovich et al 2008 reichle et al 2011 sorooshian et al 2011 wu et al 2014 yong et al 2010 and thus many evaluations have been carried out to investigate product quality the majority of evaluations focus on a certain area with either spes or rpes under evaluation many assessments have investigated the performance of the precipitation products of trmm and its successor the global precipitation measurement mission gpm lu and yong 2020 trmm is equipped with the ku band radar while the gpm core observatory is equipped with the ka ku band radar thus improving on the capturing of light precipitation huffman et al 2007 kozu et al 2001 skofronick jackson et al 2017 the gpm era products have higher temporal and spatial resolution compared to trmm however the precipitation estimation error has not been significantly improved according to some studies especially in high altitude regions and arid regions prakash et al 2016 satgé et al 2017 tang et al 2016 wang et al 2019b in general gpm is a qualified successor to trmm prakash et al 2018 satgé et al 2017 tang et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 in terms of rpe evaluations bosilovich et al 2008 assessed the performance of five reanalysis precipitation datasets at a global scale revealing poor precipitation estimates in tropical oceanic regions and limited improvements in land estimates of rpes although incorporating satellite observations has improved rpe performances chen et al 2019 hou et al 2000 the accuracy of the assimilation data still limits the quality of rpes bosilovich et al 2008 extensive research has been performed on the bias of gridded precipitation products yet the majority concentrated solely on spe or rpe islam et al 2020 lu and yong 2020 prakash et al 2018 wang et al 2019a watters et al 2021 research comparing rpes and spes is limited the derivation of spes and rpes is completely different and the geographic and seasonal uncertainties of gridded datasets are extensive ebert et al 2007 sun et al 2020 tang et al 2020 thus the advantages and disadvantages of the two product types remain to be clarified with the development in sensors and atmospheric models gridded datasets have experienced a vast improvement in the past few decades however the inaccessibility of ground precipitation observations causes difficulties in studies on hourly extreme precipitation the development of high spatial and temporal resolution grid data is very promising evaluating the accuracy of hourly gridded products can provide a scientific basis for the study of hourly extreme precipitation based on the aforementioned advances and limitations in the current literature we define the objectives of the study as follows 1 to investigate the quality and accuracy of two spe and two rpe products at the hourly and daily scale and compare them with a dense gauge network in mainland china during 2008 2017 2 to explore the respective characteristics of the spe and rpe products under different seasons and topography and 3 to assess the performance of the rpes and spes under extreme weather 2 material and methods 2 1 study area china has a continental area of approximately 9 6 million km2 with an average elevation decreases from over 4000 m in the west to below 500 m in the east the chinese mainland spans from the east to west and its climate varies within the low to high latitudes e g subtropical monsoon continental arid and paramos climates thus in order to better understand the performance of different types of precipitation products under various climate and topography we select mainland china as the study area the study area was divided into nine river basins based on the river system characteristics fig 1 a 1 the songhua river and liaohe river basin slb 2 the haihe river basin hairb 3 the huaihe river basin huairb 4 the yellow river basin yrb 5 the yangtze river basin ytzrb 6 the pearl river basin prb 7 the southeast river basin serb 8 the southwest basin swb and 9 the continental basin cb fig 1b presents the spatial distribution of the average annual precipitation from 2008 to 2017 of each basin the precipitation increases from northwest to southeast and west to east in mainland china prb and serb in southeast china are the most humid regions due to the subtropical monsoon climate while cb the location of the tianshan mountains is far from the influence of monsoon climate and its average precipitation is just one tenth of prb and serb cb is also one of the most arid areas on the world we evaluate and compare the precipitation product quality between the nine basins 2 2 data to compare the performance of spe and rpe the china hourly merged precipitation analysis cmpa with a 0 1 0 1 lon lat spatial and 1 hourly temporal resolution was used as the benchmark precipitation dataset cmpa is merged by more than 30 000 automatic weather stations awss and climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph through probability density function optimal interpolation with more than 50 of cmpa grids contains more than one ground gauges shen et al 2014 it is important to note that merge procedure of cmpa will affect the results of the assessment to avoid those impacts on the ground gauge dataset using the cmpa grid that contain as many awss as possible as the reference precipitation dataset is the most efficient way among more than 30 000awss 2169 stations were national basic stations nbs the general awss were basically built around these nbss as the densification of the ground gauge network the grids where the nbss located in are most likely to contain more awss therefore we extracted the cmpa grids to where the nbss located were selected out to be used as the ground gauge precipitation dataset as some nbss appear in the same grid 2144 cmpa grids were eventually selected to be used as the ground gauge precipitation note that although the extraction method used in this paper can increase the independence between the benchmark data set and the targeted data sets it cannot completely eliminate the influence of the cmorph merging process on the ground observation precipitation the uncertainty of this point will be discussed later in section 4 1 fig 1b presented the spatial distribution of the selected cmpa grids hereafter we use nbss to refer to these cmpa grids we employed the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg v6 0 and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap v6 0 as the gpm satellite precipitation products gpm core observatory was jointly launched by japan and the united states in 2014 it carries a ku ka band dual frequency precipitation radar and a multifrequency microwave radiometer to serve as physical observation of precipitation system hou et al 2014 imerg was released by nasa in 2014 with very high spatial 0 1 latitude longitude and temporal 30 min resolution it provides early late and final run modes the final run includes 3 5 months of latency following the gpm observations and provides both uncalibrated products and products calibrated using monthly gauge based precipitation from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc huffman et al 2020 huffman et al 2019 gsmap was released by japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa in order to produce high resolution global precipitation maps and to develop precise microwave radiometer algorithms mega et al 2018 ushio et al 2009 gsmap v6 0 was released in 2014 and includes 0 1 0 1 high resolution hourly global precipitation data recorded since april 2000 and provides gauge calibrated version using climate prediction center cpc s daily gauge dataset the reanalysis precipitation products modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra version 2 and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr were selected for this study the nasa developed merra was generated with the v 5 2 0 goddard earth observing system atmospheric model and data assimilation system gelaro et al 2017 reichle et al 2011 the hourly merra runs from 1980 at a resolution of 0 625 0 5 longitude latitude the ncep developed cfsr could be divided into cfsr1 1979 2010 and climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 2011 present cfsr is based on a fully coupled ocean land atmosphere model and uses numerical weather prediction techniques to assimilate and predict atmospheric states saha et al 2010 saha et al 2014 in this study we employed the 2008 2017 hourly merra 2 land surface dataset and cfsr cfsr1 and cfsv2 precipitation datasets to ensure data quality the timesteps missing gauge data were removed from the gauge spe and rpe datasets the effective time series accounted for 98 7 of the total dataset from 2008 to 2017 the basic information of the gridded precipitation products used in this study were summarized in table 1 since cmpa imerg gsmap are all at 0 1 resolution but the rpes have coarser resolution we resampled the two rpes to 0 1 resolution using bilinear interpolation note that the mismatched resolution and resampling procedure could affect the results of evaluation supplemental fig s1 and fig s2 depicted the characteristic of original and interpolated merra and cfsr respectively the results showed that the bilinear interpolation can basically maintain the spatial climatic characteristics of the origin products therefore we believe it is acceptable to use the bilinear interpolated datasets for evaluation however the relevant uncertainty will be discussed later in section 4 1 the spes and interpolated rpes were masked by the selected cmpa grids for evaluation elevation data is used to analyze the relationship between product performance and elevation the elevation data was derived from 30 meter resolution data of the nasa shuttle radar topography mission strm the data can be downloaded from https dwtkns com srtm30m 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 statistical matrix we derived the pearson correlation coefficients c c root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias to evaluate the accuracy of the precipitation products relative to the gauge dataset the kling gupta efficiency kg e was adopted as a comprehensive index to measure the mean correlation coefficient and coefficient of variation cv of the precipitation products gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 using the following equations 1 kg e 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 2 β μ tar μ ref 3 γ cv tar cv ref σ tar μ tar σ ref μ ref where r is equal to c c β is the bias ratio of the mean value γ is the variability ratio of cv μ is the mean value of the precipitation of the target reference dataset and σ is the standard variation of the precipitation of the target reference dataset furthermore the critical success index csi probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far were applied to evaluate the ability to detect precipitation events of the precipitation products compared to the gauge precipitation lu and yong 2020 tian et al 2009 these indexes divide precipitation events into i hit events h which indicate that both the target and reference datasets both detected precipitation ii miss events m which indicate that the reference dataset detected precipitation while the target dataset missed the precipitation iii and false events f which indicate that the target dataset recorded a precipitation event while the reference dataset did not tian et al 2009 the indexes were calculated as follows 4 pod h h m 5 far f h f 6 csi h h m f a threshold for the critical point of precipitation occurrence is required for equations 4 6 as china spans multiple climatic regions the precipitation varies across regions previous studies often use a fixed value as the threshold e g 1 mm day lu and yong 2020 prakash et al 2018 tang et al 2020 tian et al 2009 however the implementation of a fixed threshold here may ignore the light precipitation in the arid regions such as slrb yrb and cb and thus could not reflect the precipitation characteristics across multiple climate regions therefore we adopted the precipitation at the 10th percentile of the nonzero precipitation series of each nbs as the threshold of precipitation occurrence the thresholds are shown in supplemental fig s3 the results range from 0 02 mm hour to 0 29 mm hour from the arid northwest china to the wet southeast china table 2 reports the ranges and optimal values of the aforementioned statistical matrix the matrix performance was determined at the hourly and daily scale and the seasonal performance was also calculated 2 3 2 extreme precipitation assessment both long term drought and short duration extreme heavy precipitation may have serious impacts on the surface environment chen et al 2019 nastos and zerefos 2009 zhang et al 2020 gridded precipitation products could be used as capable tool to capture characteristics of extreme weather so it is also important to investigate its ability in estimating extreme precipitation first in order to better understand the products estimation ability under different precipitation levels the 1st 5th 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th and 99th percentile hourly precipitation of each day were extracted for each nbs to calculated the percentile c c second the nonzero hourly precipitation series were also determined at1st 5th 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th and 99th percentiles for each nbs and set as the threshold for calculating pod far csi following this we determined the percentile hit miss and false biases for each percentile the hit bias is equal to the ratio of the summed difference between the estimated and gauged precipitation for each h event during the study period and the average gauged precipitation the miss and false biases are calculated in a similar manner third the standardized precipitation index spi was employed as a climatic variable to detect and monitor drought mckee et al 1993 this index has been widely adopted in the fields of meteorology agriculture and hydrology the spi of each gridded precipitation product was calculated and compared with the gauged spi consecutive wet days cwd consecutive dry days cdd were used to identify the duration of precipitation events shi et al 2018 wang et al 2013 2 3 3 diurnal cycle assessment the diurnal cycle plays a fundamental role in the earth system variability exerting significant influences on the top of atmosphere and surface energy budgets bao and zhang 2013 chen et al 2014 chen et al 2009 itterly and taylor 2014 due to the strong diurnal changes in thermodynamics and solar radiation diurnal cycle is generally stronger in wet seasons cui et al 2021 itterly et al 2018 watters et al 2021 the evaluation of diurnal cycle was confined to the summer in mainland china summer consists of june july and august summer precipitation counts for more than 50 of the whole year in this study moreover we analyzed the peak time the time of the maximum hourly precipitation in a day the standard variance std of the hourly precipitation in a day and the daily magnitude difference between maximum hourly precipitation and minimum hourly precipitation within the same day 3 results 3 1 key spe and rpe features at the hourly scale fig 2 depicts the average hourly precipitation of each month in mainland china from 2008 to 2017 precipitation is observed to reach a maximum in summer june july and august and a minimum in winter december january and february furthermore gsmap imerg and merra can basically represent the precipitation intensity through seasons while cfsr is prone to overestimations particularly in summer supplemental fig s4 reveals cfsr to overestimate the precipitation in other basins at varying degrees with the exception of the basins in the northeast plain e g slrb hairb huairb 3 1 1 spatial features fig 3 presents the spatial distribution of the average c c rmse and kg e from 2008 to 2017 in mainland china while fig 4 depicts the results for pod far and csi the c c of the spes is greater than that of the rpes while minimal differences are observed between the rmse fig 3 kg e is a comprehensive indicator that combines c c cv and mean precipitation the low kg e values determined for merra and csfr are associated with the lower cv and higher mean precipitation compared to the gauge series supplemental fig s5 respectively in general gsmap and imerg were of high precision in south china fig 4 presents the ability of the four gridded products in capturing precipitation events as already mentioned the climate varied greatly across the nine sub regions and thus we selected the 10th percentile of the precipitation series in each aws as the rain no rain threshold to calculate pod csi and far the rpe derived pods markedly exceed those of the spes while the fars are also higher this indicates the excessive false precipitation of the rpes which consequently reduces the csi the greatest differences between spes and rpes are observed in serb prb swb and ytzrb fig 5 presents the pbias statistics of each basin gsmap has the pbias of smallest magnitude with a median at 10 51 followed by merra imerg and cfsr with medians of 13 22 19 30 and 29 46 respectively the boxplot deviations fluctuate across basins in particular merra exhibits a narrow pbias fluctuation range in all basins while cfsr performs the opposite the overestimated precipitation in cfsr results in a greater bias compared to other products cb and swb exhibit significantly higher biases compared to the other regions for all products this is attributed to their locations in plateau and mountainous regions merra reaches minimum pbias values in these two regions taking c c as the evaluation metric table 3 reports the correlation between the elevation and c c of each product the index value of the best performing products is marked in bold underline and italics simultaneously the same marking method is also used in table 3 5 results demonstrate a negative correlation between the gridded products c c and elevation with merra exhibiting a weak correlation r 0 3 and all other products a moderate correlation 0 3 r 0 8 the higher negative value indicates that the products c c decreases as the elevation increases therefore among the four products assessed in this paper the precipitation estimation of merra was least affected by elevation 3 1 2 diurnal cycle assessment the diurnal cycle is a benchmark for the evaluation of sub daily precipitation bao and zhang 2013 due to the strong diurnal changes in thermodynamics and solar radiation diurnal cycle is generally stronger in wet seasons cui et al 2021 watters et al 2021 therefore the diurnal cycle analyses in this paper are confined to summer fig 6 presents the daily peak hour of precipitation average standard variance in a day and average precipitation magnitude difference between daily maximum precipitation and daily minimum precipitation in summer since the spes obtain diurnal cycle directly from satellite observation their results are more consistent with that of the gauge series the rpes are tend to greatly homogenize the daily precipitation distribution compared to the spes and the peak hour typically occurs 3 6 h prior to the gauge series and spes though both cfsr and merra cannot represent the phase of summer diurnal cycle precisely cfsr still perform ed slightly better than merra fig 7 depicts the summer diurnal cycle in mainland china slrb cb swb and prb all regions exhibit two distinct precipitation peaks in the afternoon and near midnight the result is in agreement with the study of chen et al 2014 and yu et al 2007 the spes can essentially capture the two peaks while the rpes can only exhibit an early afternoon peak between the spes the overall performance of diurnal cycle of imerg is more reliable than gsmap gsmap showed deficiency in diurnal cycle representation in high altitude regions fig 7b c slrb and cb and high latitudes region fig 7d swb exhibiting fluctuations that not present in the gauge series over a few hours however gsmap has similar performance with imerg in subtropical region fig 7e prb in terms of rpes the merra and cfsr afternoon peaks occurred 3 5 and 1 2 h early respectively our results revealed that imerg has the most accurate characterization of the diurnal cycle amongst the four products investigated in this study 3 1 3 seasonal characteristics figs 8 and 9 present the seasonal averaged c c and csi respectively determined from the spe and rpe products over mainland china and the 9 major basins the ability to capture precipitation in the rainy summer and arid winter varies with each product with greater differences observed between product types rather than within products table 4 reports the average seasonal c c and csi of mainland china in terms of average c c the spes were observed to performed better in summer compared to the other seasons while the accuracy was lowest in winter in contrast the rpes exhibited the lowest accuracy in summer while merra surpassed the accuracy of all products in spring and autumn the csi seasonal performances were similar to those of c c supplemental fig s6 presents the seasonal pbias the average precipitation of each product exceeds that of the gauge data cfsr overestimated precipitation by 20 in seasons other than winter cfsr s large overestimation of precipitation results in higher pbias values across basins compared to the other products merra outperforms the spes in the northern basin in terms of c c csi and pbias while the spes exhibit higher accuracies in humid regions 3 2 daily series comparisons table 5 reports the performance of the precipitation products at the hourly and daily scales as well as the daily maximum minimum series the precision of the daily precipitation products is greatly improved compared to the hourly scale merra exhibits the highest precision and csi value in daily precipitation while imerg captures the daily maximum minimum precipitation more accurately than the other products surprisingly low kg e values were determined with the rpes in the daily minimum series this is associated with the much greater average daily minimum precipitation compared to the gauge series and the large amounts of low precipitation estimated in rainless days as seen in the far in fig 10 and the false bias in fig 11 the kg e exhibits a marked improvement in the daily scale compared to the hourly scale in particular the kg e of cfsr changes from negative to positive when moving from the hourly to daily scales this indicates an improvement in the mean precipitation and cv values although the rpes exhibited several defects in the sub daily precipitation distribution the daily precipitation estimates are relatively accurate 3 3 response to extreme weather extreme precipitation has resulted in great challenges to flood control in urban areas in some areas sub daily precipitation has exhibited obvious fluctuations while daily scale precipitation has remained relatively stable zhang et al 2020 obtaining data from gauge precipitation stations proves to be a difficult task particularly for long term records the supplement of hourly scale gridded precipitation products is thus particularly important to determine precipitation changes at a high temporal resolution the first row of fig 10 depicts the c c derived from each day s 1st 5th 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th and 99th percentile hourly precipitation series with summer and winter on the left and right respectively a peak c c value reached its highest at the 90th percentile this is followed by a gradual reduction in the accuracy with the rpes exhibiting a steeper decline compared to the spes furthermore the ability of cfsr to capture high value precipitation is inferior to the other products the winter and summer distributions essentially follow the same trend for the percentile c cs as depicted in figs 8 9 and table 4 gsmap has the worst performance in winter among all products the winter percentile c cs in fig 10 showed that gsmap has slightly better c cs for the precipitation series less than 50th percentile it is precipitation series greater than 50th percentile that cause gsmap to perform worse than other products in winter the second to the last rows of fig 10 depict the pod far csi of the hourly precipitation series with 1st 5th 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th and 99th percentile hourly precipitation taken as the threshold fig 11 presents the relative percent hit miss false total bias determined following the thresholds used in calculation of pod far csi in fig 10 in contrast to the bias depicted in fig 6 and supplemental fig s6 the decomposed bias indicates the hit bias to be predominantly negative this indicates that the captured precipitation is generally underestimated and the positive bias is essentially a result of the false precipitation estimations particularly cfsr massive false events conducted to its bias degree to far exceed other products all products generally underestimate precipitation for extreme summer precipitation events e g when threshold was set to 95th percentile as the threshold increases the hit and false biases gradually tend to 0 while the miss bias gradually increases the pod value also gradually decreases indicating an increase in miss events unlike the spes the winter hit bias of the rpes is positive the rpe determine pod values are significantly higher than those of the spes this is attributed to the precipitation estimated by the reanalysis products in rainless days which also resulted in rpes poorer far values compared to the spes as percentile threshold increases far increases for spes but decreases for rpes this is because stratiform precipitation is the main source of precipitation during winter both pmw and ir sensors used in the satellite observatory have problems with detecting precipitation from these non convective clouds in winter further the snow cover especially over mountainous areas is occasionally misidentified as rain by pmw sensors ebert et al 2007 feidas et al 2009 islam et al 2020 meanwhile rpes are better at estimating stratiform precipitation than convective precipitation tang et al 2020 fig 11 indicates the high miss bias as a cause of gsmap and imerg s inferior performances in winter the spes severely underestimating the precipitation below the 90th percentile particularly for gsmap determining whether precipitation products can effectively capture extreme precipitation is crucial fig 12 demonstrates the cwd and cdd characteristics in mainland china at the monthly scale the rpe derived cwd is inferior to that of the spes this is related to the excessively estimated low level precipitation for rainless days the cdd values simulated by merra and the spes exhibit a closer trend to the gauge series compared to the cfsr fig 13 depicts the spi index and average hourly precipitation at the 95th and 99th percentile of each day in order to assess the extreme precipitation the ability to capture drought or flood events does not vary greatly between products while the extreme precipitation estimated by each gridded product particularly the rpes is lower than that of the gauge series 3 4 improvement through the last decades a stable performance is crucial for products with a long time span fig 14 presents the linear trends that passed the significance test in c c and csi determined from the precipitation during summer and winter of 2008 2017 the significance test was conducted using t test and the stations where p values less than 0 05 were considered to pass the significance test results revealed that the accuracy of the four products is relatively consistent in summer with c c exhibiting a slight increasing trend the csis have negligible trends the spe improvements in summer are greater than those of the rpes with more stations in spes pass the significance test than rpes supplemental table s1 the winter trends in c c and csi for each product are greater their summer counterparts this indicates that each product exhibits improved winter precipitation estimations in winter the improved regions for spes are located in the arid northern plain basins e g slrb huairb and hairb downstream of swb and the coastal areas of serb and prb moreover the degree and spatial range of rpe improvement is greater than those of the spes with the cc csi increasing by more than 0 05 0 03 per year in the vast regions of northeast china and northwest of cb the trend slope without significant test was showed in supplemental fig s7 compared to fig 14 negative trends barely passed the significance test for all products more stations passed the significance test in winter than in summer and the proportion of stations with significant trend was basically greater than 30 supplemental table s1 in summary the improvement in c c generally exceeds that of csi for each product with spe improvements in summer greater than those of rpe and vice versa in winter moreover the improvements in accuracy for winter generally exceed those in summer 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties caused by the benchmark dataset and mismatch resolution the performance of spes and rpes are assessed based on a gauge dataset derived from cmpa in this study the selection of benchmark precipitation and the mismatch of product resolution could cause uncertainties in the evaluation results the uncertainties are mainly reflected in the following aspects 1 the influence of cmorph in the merge procedure of cmpa and the influence of overlapping gauge stations of cmpa aws network and gpcc cpc cmpa is obtained by merging more than 30 000 ground awss and cmorph in order to avoid the influence of cmorph on the benchmark data set the nbs located grids were selected out of cmpa to be used as the benchmark ground gauge precipitation in this paper furthermore the 2 spes and 2 rpes evaluated in this paper all used gauge based precipitation products to adjust their precipitation gpcc monthly gauge based product for imerg and cpc daily gauge based product for gsmap merra and cfsr the in situ gauge stations used by gpcc cpc are partly overlap with the awss used by cmpa however the number of stations gpcc cpc used around 700 stations for gpcc and around 400 for cpc is far less than that the stations used in this study moreover the temporal resolution of cmpa hourly is also higher than that of gpcc cpc monthly and daily scale respectively we believe that the mask extracted dataset was least affected by the merging procedure and closest to the ground gauged precipitation and thus can effectively increase the independence between the reference and target datasets this method has been used in previous literatures e g ma et al 2020 sun et al 2020 tang et al 2020 the sparse gauges in the extensive western china will lead to unreliable evaluation results however the actual performance of the products should be higher than the results in this paper 2 the rpes used in this study have coarser resolution compared to cmpa imerg gsmap we resampled the rpes to 0 1 resolution using bilinear interpolation the mismatch resolution and the interpolation procedure could affect the evaluation results taking 2015 as an example we compared the original and resampled merra and cfsr respectively from the perspectives of annual maximum precipitation annual average precipitation and average daily standard variation the results were showed in supplemental figs s1 and s2 the results indicated that the bilinear interpolation can basically maintain the spatial characteristics of climate while dividing the original products into smaller grids the c c in 2015 was taken as an example to test how the resampling procedure would affect the evaluating results the results of resampling coarse resolution products to high resolution ones or resample high resolution products to coarser resolution ones are shown in supplemental table s2 the results show that both the two resampling strategies will bring errors however since the difference of c c between the products are larger than the error caused by the resampling procedure in table 5 indicating that the difference in spatial scale is not the dominant source of error in rpes therefore we believe it is acceptable to use the bilinear interpolated datasets for evaluation 4 2 data quality of spes and rpes the results of this study demonstrate that the spe precipitation series of the whole year have better overall performance than that of the rpes figs 3 4 however if the precipitation series is divided into seasons the rpes exhibit a higher accuracy in winter lu and yong 2020 reported that the performance of the gpm series products was poorest in winter and tang et al 2020 revealed reanalysis products to perform better in winter than other product types this indicated the necessity of choosing precipitation products according to the season or even month the spatial distribution of accuracy of spes and rpes is also different the rpes are more accurate in the northern plain region while the spes exhibited a higher accuracy in the southern humid area among the sub regions basins the bias in precipitation estimation in cb is the largest and merra is the best performing product in cb this indicates the ability of merra to correct the influence of the high latitude mountainous climate on precipitation estimations convective precipitation is one of the major precipitation types in the middle and low latitude regions of china e g prb swb serb the middle and lower reaches of the ytzrb our results indicate the spes to have a stronger ability in capturing summer convective precipitation while the rpes exhibit large uncertainties this was especially evident in the representation of diurnal cycle due to the strong diurnal changes in thermodynamics and solar radiation the rapidly established near noon convection caused the precipitation diurnal cycle in the afternoon to midnight over land previous studies on the precipitation diurnal cycle base on reanalysis products or large scale atmospheric models consistently revealed early peak and weak amplitude cui et al 2021 itterly et al 2018 watters et al 2021 in this study rpes showed consistent deficiency in representing summer diurnal cycle in mainland china in atmospheric models the uncertainties in diurnal cycle reproduction appear to be linked to the models convective parameterizations and how the schemes interact with the land surface the boundary layer and clouds dynamics itterly et al 2018 randall et al 2003 rpe s consistent early peak may be related to the premature onset of cumulus convection cui et al 2021 watters et al 2021 since the rpes assessed in this paper have coarser resolution than the spes their averaged finer grid 0 1 precipitation are not expected to reflect the intensity or rapid changes in local conditions associated with small scale storms reichle et al 2017 however the performance of rpes in diurnal cycle are more likely to linked to the convection scheme at coarser scale pearson et al 2014 the performance of merra and cfsr showed large differences in other aspects according to fig 10 in this paper merra and cfsr have larger pod and far compared to spes indicating an overproduction of cloud for both rpes pearson et al 2014 however the false bias of cfsr in fig 11 is generally much higher than that of merra and the other two spes which directly leads to an overestimated precipitation of cfsr the differences between cfsr and merra are likely due to differences in radiative cooling for the atmosphere in their respective analysis and for which heating related to precipitation provides the balancing component zhang et al 2012b 4 3 the difference in improvements fig 14 depicts the improvement of the four products in winter and summer from 2008 to 2017 the results indicated obvious differences of product improvement between winter and summer as for the rpes their improvement might be related to the improvement of data quality of input assimilation data of reanalysis system in recent years however the weak improvement in summer also indicated that the reanalysis products still need to be further improved to cope with wet season convection previous evaluation of gauge adjusted and non adjusted imerg gsmap in mainland china showed better performance of gauge adjusted data sets and the adjust procedure has more significant improvement in winter than in summer lu and yong 2020 tang et al 2020 the results of tang et al 2020 indicated that the improvement due to gauge adjustment is greater than the improvement due to satellite sensors which might also be the same for the improvement in gsmap the differences in improvement in winter and summer of gpcc cpc may be part of the reason why spes have better improvement in winter of course cpc also affects the performance of two rpes in this study 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the performance of four gridded precipitation products including two reanalysis precipitation products and two satellite precipitation products our results revealed large variations in the satellite and reanalysis precipitations across different seasons and climate zones at the hourly scale the overall annual performance of the spes surpasses that of the rpes with imerg exhibiting the best performance average c c of mainland china reaching 0 426 however inter season characteristic of the spes and rpes are different the average accuracy of rpe products in winter is greater than those of the spes and vice versa for summer the analysis of the hourly precipitation accuracy demonstrated the positive bias for all products compared to gauge precipitation the bias decomposition reveals that the rpe error generally originates from false bias especially for light precipitation while the spe bias is a result of miss bias the diurnal cycle captured by the rpes is generally inferior than that of the spes rpes tend to reproduce early peaks and weaker magnitude as depicted in the results of diurnal cycle at the daily scale merra has the best overall performance and cfsr improve a lot than at hourly scale in terms of extreme weather the rpes ability to capture sub daily extreme precipitation is inferior to that of the spes especially when reproducing extreme heavy precipitation we further investigated how the gridded products have improved within the last decades spes improved precipitation in the humid regions and rpe improves precipitation in areas with less precipitation in mid to high latitude plains for all products the improvement in winter is greater than in summer furthermore the difficulties in identifying precipitation clouds in high latitude mountainous areas results in large biases for all gridded products this study presents a detailed assessment of the performance of satellite based and reanalysis precipitation products under multi temporal scales and extreme weather the results can provide a theoretical basis for potential users of the precipitation products in areas such as hydrological and meteorological simulations furthermore our study can act as guidance for the application and improvement of global precipitation products declaration of competing

3791,gridded precipitation products are efficient supplements to surface meteorological gauges and thus a comprehensive evaluation of such products is essential this study systematically evaluated the performance of 4 gridded precipitation datasets with hourly scale in mainland china with ground gauge precipitation as a benchmark in particular we assessed the performance of two satellite based precipitation estimations spes integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg and global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap and two reanalysis precipitation estimations rpes modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr the results reveal that all the products have better performance in low latitude areas and have worse performance in the high latitude mountainous regions spe products have similar features of temporal spatial performance and diurnal cycle estimation and so have rpe products the overall summer spe accuracy surpasses that of all rpe products and vice versa in winter the error decomposition of each product linked the summer bias to excessive false events of light precipitation in winter the spe error is generally a result of missed and false events while that of the rpes originates from false precipitation the product accuracy increases with the time scale and the daily merra accuracy exceeds that of other products however due to the challenge in representing convective precipitation the accuracy of the diurnal cycle and peak hour is lower than that of the spes and representing weaker amplitudes compared to the gauge precipitation this consequently results in rpes poorer performance in extreme heavy precipitation compared to the spe products the results of this study are useful for both developers and users of gridded precipitation products keywords satellite precipitation estimation reanalysis precipitation estimation diurnal cycle extreme precipitation 1 introduction gridded precipitation products are important supplements to precipitation datasets huffman et al 2007 janowiak et al 1998 despite the numerous ground weather gauge stations and radar precipitation estimations that provide accurate ground precipitation observations spatial continuity in datasets is still lacking and the observation ranges are relatively limited skofronick jackson et al 2017 urita et al 2011 zhang et al 2012a gridded precipitation datasets have made remarkable progress in the last decades constantly improving the observation resolution and estimation accuracy bosilovich et al 2008 hossain and lettenmaier 2006 hou et al 2000 sub daily and hourly precipitation extremes exhibit an increase in intensity that exceeds thermodynamic constraints berg et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 the improvements in high resolution gridded precipitation data can facilitate sub daily extreme precipitation studies gridded precipitation estimations can generally be divided into two types based on their retrieval methods satellite based precipitation estimations spes and retrospective analysis precipitation estimations reanalysis precipitation estimations rpes sun et al 2018 the current key sensing methods for spes can be classified as 1 infrared ir satellites which retrieves ground precipitation using images of cloud top temperature kidd and huffman 2011 sorooshian et al 2000 2 passive microwave pmw which directly detects precipitation sized particles huffman et al 2007 skofronick jackson et al 2017 and 3 active microwave amw which employs spaceborne precipitation radar kidd and huffman 2011 kubota et al 2007 the spes usually integrate the advantages of multi types of satellite based sensors to estimate precipitation rather than adopting measurements from single type of sensors huffman et al 2007 kidd and huffman 2011 prakash et al 2018 for example the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa dataset is developed by combining various low earth orbit pmw and ir satellite based measurements huffman et al 2007 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann s core algorithm is to calculate precipitation based on ir image and to improve the accuracy by adaptively adjusting the network parameters using the instantaneous rain rate estimates from the trmm microwave imager sorooshian et al 2000 the multi satellite conjoint estimation algorithm can simultaneously take advantage of high precision of microwave remote sensing and wide coverage of ir remote sensing and thus provide more accurate and reliable estimation results many products release research version precipitation estimation adjusted by gauge based products which generally have better performance than the unadjusted version gelaro et al 2017 huffman et al 2019 huffman et al 2007 mega et al 2018 saha et al 2014 rpes combine the collection and assimilation of multi source meteorological data with a background forecast model to estimate the meteorological dynamic process bosilovich et al 2008 therefore rpes typically contain more meteorological variable estimations compared to spes and provide longer term precipitation estimations janowiak et al 1998 kidd and huffman 2011 sun et al 2018 limited by the effective observation range geosynchronous satellites the coverage of mainstream spes is constrained within 60 n s in contrast as rpe is derived from global climate models it can provide global observations thus rpes are suitable for high latitude water cycle studies serreze et al 2003 serreze and hurst 2000 however the lack of ground meteorological stations in polar regions increases the uncertainty in the evaluation of rpes gridded precipitation products have been widely applied in numerous fields over the recent years including hydrological modeling drought monitoring real time flood predictions landslide modeling and disease control ford et al 2009 hu et al 2019 wu et al 2014 yuan et al 2019 the precipitation observation bias is a complex function of topography altitude latitude seasons precipitation intensity and etc bosilovich et al 2008 reichle et al 2011 sorooshian et al 2011 wu et al 2014 yong et al 2010 and thus many evaluations have been carried out to investigate product quality the majority of evaluations focus on a certain area with either spes or rpes under evaluation many assessments have investigated the performance of the precipitation products of trmm and its successor the global precipitation measurement mission gpm lu and yong 2020 trmm is equipped with the ku band radar while the gpm core observatory is equipped with the ka ku band radar thus improving on the capturing of light precipitation huffman et al 2007 kozu et al 2001 skofronick jackson et al 2017 the gpm era products have higher temporal and spatial resolution compared to trmm however the precipitation estimation error has not been significantly improved according to some studies especially in high altitude regions and arid regions prakash et al 2016 satgé et al 2017 tang et al 2016 wang et al 2019b in general gpm is a qualified successor to trmm prakash et al 2018 satgé et al 2017 tang et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 in terms of rpe evaluations bosilovich et al 2008 assessed the performance of five reanalysis precipitation datasets at a global scale revealing poor precipitation estimates in tropical oceanic regions and limited improvements in land estimates of rpes although incorporating satellite observations has improved rpe performances chen et al 2019 hou et al 2000 the accuracy of the assimilation data still limits the quality of rpes bosilovich et al 2008 extensive research has been performed on the bias of gridded precipitation products yet the majority concentrated solely on spe or rpe islam et al 2020 lu and yong 2020 prakash et al 2018 wang et al 2019a watters et al 2021 research comparing rpes and spes is limited the derivation of spes and rpes is completely different and the geographic and seasonal uncertainties of gridded datasets are extensive ebert et al 2007 sun et al 2020 tang et al 2020 thus the advantages and disadvantages of the two product types remain to be clarified with the development in sensors and atmospheric models gridded datasets have experienced a vast improvement in the past few decades however the inaccessibility of ground precipitation observations causes difficulties in studies on hourly extreme precipitation the development of high spatial and temporal resolution grid data is very promising evaluating the accuracy of hourly gridded products can provide a scientific basis for the study of hourly extreme precipitation based on the aforementioned advances and limitations in the current literature we define the objectives of the study as follows 1 to investigate the quality and accuracy of two spe and two rpe products at the hourly and daily scale and compare them with a dense gauge network in mainland china during 2008 2017 2 to explore the respective characteristics of the spe and rpe products under different seasons and topography and 3 to assess the performance of the rpes and spes under extreme weather 2 material and methods 2 1 study area china has a continental area of approximately 9 6 million km2 with an average elevation decreases from over 4000 m in the west to below 500 m in the east the chinese mainland spans from the east to west and its climate varies within the low to high latitudes e g subtropical monsoon continental arid and paramos climates thus in order to better understand the performance of different types of precipitation products under various climate and topography we select mainland china as the study area the study area was divided into nine river basins based on the river system characteristics fig 1 a 1 the songhua river and liaohe river basin slb 2 the haihe river basin hairb 3 the huaihe river basin huairb 4 the yellow river basin yrb 5 the yangtze river basin ytzrb 6 the pearl river basin prb 7 the southeast river basin serb 8 the southwest basin swb and 9 the continental basin cb fig 1b presents the spatial distribution of the average annual precipitation from 2008 to 2017 of each basin the precipitation increases from northwest to southeast and west to east in mainland china prb and serb in southeast china are the most humid regions due to the subtropical monsoon climate while cb the location of the tianshan mountains is far from the influence of monsoon climate and its average precipitation is just one tenth of prb and serb cb is also one of the most arid areas on the world we evaluate and compare the precipitation product quality between the nine basins 2 2 data to compare the performance of spe and rpe the china hourly merged precipitation analysis cmpa with a 0 1 0 1 lon lat spatial and 1 hourly temporal resolution was used as the benchmark precipitation dataset cmpa is merged by more than 30 000 automatic weather stations awss and climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph through probability density function optimal interpolation with more than 50 of cmpa grids contains more than one ground gauges shen et al 2014 it is important to note that merge procedure of cmpa will affect the results of the assessment to avoid those impacts on the ground gauge dataset using the cmpa grid that contain as many awss as possible as the reference precipitation dataset is the most efficient way among more than 30 000awss 2169 stations were national basic stations nbs the general awss were basically built around these nbss as the densification of the ground gauge network the grids where the nbss located in are most likely to contain more awss therefore we extracted the cmpa grids to where the nbss located were selected out to be used as the ground gauge precipitation dataset as some nbss appear in the same grid 2144 cmpa grids were eventually selected to be used as the ground gauge precipitation note that although the extraction method used in this paper can increase the independence between the benchmark data set and the targeted data sets it cannot completely eliminate the influence of the cmorph merging process on the ground observation precipitation the uncertainty of this point will be discussed later in section 4 1 fig 1b presented the spatial distribution of the selected cmpa grids hereafter we use nbss to refer to these cmpa grids we employed the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg v6 0 and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap v6 0 as the gpm satellite precipitation products gpm core observatory was jointly launched by japan and the united states in 2014 it carries a ku ka band dual frequency precipitation radar and a multifrequency microwave radiometer to serve as physical observation of precipitation system hou et al 2014 imerg was released by nasa in 2014 with very high spatial 0 1 latitude longitude and temporal 30 min resolution it provides early late and final run modes the final run includes 3 5 months of latency following the gpm observations and provides both uncalibrated products and products calibrated using monthly gauge based precipitation from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc huffman et al 2020 huffman et al 2019 gsmap was released by japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa in order to produce high resolution global precipitation maps and to develop precise microwave radiometer algorithms mega et al 2018 ushio et al 2009 gsmap v6 0 was released in 2014 and includes 0 1 0 1 high resolution hourly global precipitation data recorded since april 2000 and provides gauge calibrated version using climate prediction center cpc s daily gauge dataset the reanalysis precipitation products modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra version 2 and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr were selected for this study the nasa developed merra was generated with the v 5 2 0 goddard earth observing system atmospheric model and data assimilation system gelaro et al 2017 reichle et al 2011 the hourly merra runs from 1980 at a resolution of 0 625 0 5 longitude latitude the ncep developed cfsr could be divided into cfsr1 1979 2010 and climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 2011 present cfsr is based on a fully coupled ocean land atmosphere model and uses numerical weather prediction techniques to assimilate and predict atmospheric states saha et al 2010 saha et al 2014 in this study we employed the 2008 2017 hourly merra 2 land surface dataset and cfsr cfsr1 and cfsv2 precipitation datasets to ensure data quality the timesteps missing gauge data were removed from the gauge spe and rpe datasets the effective time series accounted for 98 7 of the total dataset from 2008 to 2017 the basic information of the gridded precipitation products used in this study were summarized in table 1 since cmpa imerg gsmap are all at 0 1 resolution but the rpes have coarser resolution we resampled the two rpes to 0 1 resolution using bilinear interpolation note that the mismatched resolution and resampling procedure could affect the results of evaluation supplemental fig s1 and fig s2 depicted the characteristic of original and interpolated merra and cfsr respectively the results showed that the bilinear interpolation can basically maintain the spatial climatic characteristics of the origin products therefore we believe it is acceptable to use the bilinear interpolated datasets for evaluation however the relevant uncertainty will be discussed later in section 4 1 the spes and interpolated rpes were masked by the selected cmpa grids for evaluation elevation data is used to analyze the relationship between product performance and elevation the elevation data was derived from 30 meter resolution data of the nasa shuttle radar topography mission strm the data can be downloaded from https dwtkns com srtm30m 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 statistical matrix we derived the pearson correlation coefficients c c root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias to evaluate the accuracy of the precipitation products relative to the gauge dataset the kling gupta efficiency kg e was adopted as a comprehensive index to measure the mean correlation coefficient and coefficient of variation cv of the precipitation products gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 using the following equations 1 kg e 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 2 β μ tar μ ref 3 γ cv tar cv ref σ tar μ tar σ ref μ ref where r is equal to c c β is the bias ratio of the mean value γ is the variability ratio of cv μ is the mean value of the precipitation of the target reference dataset and σ is the standard variation of the precipitation of the target reference dataset furthermore the critical success index csi probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far were applied to evaluate the ability to detect precipitation events of the precipitation products compared to the gauge precipitation lu and yong 2020 tian et al 2009 these indexes divide precipitation events into i hit events h which indicate that both the target and reference datasets both detected precipitation ii miss events m which indicate that the reference dataset detected precipitation while the target dataset missed the precipitation iii and false events f which indicate that the target dataset recorded a precipitation event while the reference dataset did not tian et al 2009 the indexes were calculated as follows 4 pod h h m 5 far f h f 6 csi h h m f a threshold for the critical point of precipitation occurrence is required for equations 4 6 as china spans multiple climatic regions the precipitation varies across regions previous studies often use a fixed value as the threshold e g 1 mm day lu and yong 2020 prakash et al 2018 tang et al 2020 tian et al 2009 however the implementation of a fixed threshold here may ignore the light precipitation in the arid regions such as slrb yrb and cb and thus could not reflect the precipitation characteristics across multiple climate regions therefore we adopted the precipitation at the 10th percentile of the nonzero precipitation series of each nbs as the threshold of precipitation occurrence the thresholds are shown in supplemental fig s3 the results range from 0 02 mm hour to 0 29 mm hour from the arid northwest china to the wet southeast china table 2 reports the ranges and optimal values of the aforementioned statistical matrix the matrix performance was determined at the hourly and daily scale and the seasonal performance was also calculated 2 3 2 extreme precipitation assessment both long term drought and short duration extreme heavy precipitation may have serious impacts on the surface environment chen et al 2019 nastos and zerefos 2009 zhang et al 2020 gridded precipitation products could be used as capable tool to capture characteristics of extreme weather so it is also important to investigate its ability in estimating extreme precipitation first in order to better understand the products estimation ability under different precipitation levels the 1st 5th 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th and 99th percentile hourly precipitation of each day were extracted for each nbs to calculated the percentile c c second the nonzero hourly precipitation series were also determined at1st 5th 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th and 99th percentiles for each nbs and set as the threshold for calculating pod far csi following this we determined the percentile hit miss and false biases for each percentile the hit bias is equal to the ratio of the summed difference between the estimated and gauged precipitation for each h event during the study period and the average gauged precipitation the miss and false biases are calculated in a similar manner third the standardized precipitation index spi was employed as a climatic variable to detect and monitor drought mckee et al 1993 this index has been widely adopted in the fields of meteorology agriculture and hydrology the spi of each gridded precipitation product was calculated and compared with the gauged spi consecutive wet days cwd consecutive dry days cdd were used to identify the duration of precipitation events shi et al 2018 wang et al 2013 2 3 3 diurnal cycle assessment the diurnal cycle plays a fundamental role in the earth system variability exerting significant influences on the top of atmosphere and surface energy budgets bao and zhang 2013 chen et al 2014 chen et al 2009 itterly and taylor 2014 due to the strong diurnal changes in thermodynamics and solar radiation diurnal cycle is generally stronger in wet seasons cui et al 2021 itterly et al 2018 watters et al 2021 the evaluation of diurnal cycle was confined to the summer in mainland china summer consists of june july and august summer precipitation counts for more than 50 of the whole year in this study moreover we analyzed the peak time the time of the maximum hourly precipitation in a day the standard variance std of the hourly precipitation in a day and the daily magnitude difference between maximum hourly precipitation and minimum hourly precipitation within the same day 3 results 3 1 key spe and rpe features at the hourly scale fig 2 depicts the average hourly precipitation of each month in mainland china from 2008 to 2017 precipitation is observed to reach a maximum in summer june july and august and a minimum in winter december january and february furthermore gsmap imerg and merra can basically represent the precipitation intensity through seasons while cfsr is prone to overestimations particularly in summer supplemental fig s4 reveals cfsr to overestimate the precipitation in other basins at varying degrees with the exception of the basins in the northeast plain e g slrb hairb huairb 3 1 1 spatial features fig 3 presents the spatial distribution of the average c c rmse and kg e from 2008 to 2017 in mainland china while fig 4 depicts the results for pod far and csi the c c of the spes is greater than that of the rpes while minimal differences are observed between the rmse fig 3 kg e is a comprehensive indicator that combines c c cv and mean precipitation the low kg e values determined for merra and csfr are associated with the lower cv and higher mean precipitation compared to the gauge series supplemental fig s5 respectively in general gsmap and imerg were of high precision in south china fig 4 presents the ability of the four gridded products in capturing precipitation events as already mentioned the climate varied greatly across the nine sub regions and thus we selected the 10th percentile of the precipitation series in each aws as the rain no rain threshold to calculate pod csi and far the rpe derived pods markedly exceed those of the spes while the fars are also higher this indicates the excessive false precipitation of the rpes which consequently reduces the csi the greatest differences between spes and rpes are observed in serb prb swb and ytzrb fig 5 presents the pbias statistics of each basin gsmap has the pbias of smallest magnitude with a median at 10 51 followed by merra imerg and cfsr with medians of 13 22 19 30 and 29 46 respectively the boxplot deviations fluctuate across basins in particular merra exhibits a narrow pbias fluctuation range in all basins while cfsr performs the opposite the overestimated precipitation in cfsr results in a greater bias compared to other products cb and swb exhibit significantly higher biases compared to the other regions for all products this is attributed to their locations in plateau and mountainous regions merra reaches minimum pbias values in these two regions taking c c as the evaluation metric table 3 reports the correlation between the elevation and c c of each product the index value of the best performing products is marked in bold underline and italics simultaneously the same marking method is also used in table 3 5 results demonstrate a negative correlation between the gridded products c c and elevation with merra exhibiting a weak correlation r 0 3 and all other products a moderate correlation 0 3 r 0 8 the higher negative value indicates that the products c c decreases as the elevation increases therefore among the four products assessed in this paper the precipitation estimation of merra was least affected by elevation 3 1 2 diurnal cycle assessment the diurnal cycle is a benchmark for the evaluation of sub daily precipitation bao and zhang 2013 due to the strong diurnal changes in thermodynamics and solar radiation diurnal cycle is generally stronger in wet seasons cui et al 2021 watters et al 2021 therefore the diurnal cycle analyses in this paper are confined to summer fig 6 presents the daily peak hour of precipitation average standard variance in a day and average precipitation magnitude difference between daily maximum precipitation and daily minimum precipitation in summer since the spes obtain diurnal cycle directly from satellite observation their results are more consistent with that of the gauge series the rpes are tend to greatly homogenize the daily precipitation distribution compared to the spes and the peak hour typically occurs 3 6 h prior to the gauge series and spes though both cfsr and merra cannot represent the phase of summer diurnal cycle precisely cfsr still perform ed slightly better than merra fig 7 depicts the summer diurnal cycle in mainland china slrb cb swb and prb all regions exhibit two distinct precipitation peaks in the afternoon and near midnight the result is in agreement with the study of chen et al 2014 and yu et al 2007 the spes can essentially capture the two peaks while the rpes can only exhibit an early afternoon peak between the spes the overall performance of diurnal cycle of imerg is more reliable than gsmap gsmap showed deficiency in diurnal cycle representation in high altitude regions fig 7b c slrb and cb and high latitudes region fig 7d swb exhibiting fluctuations that not present in the gauge series over a few hours however gsmap has similar performance with imerg in subtropical region fig 7e prb in terms of rpes the merra and cfsr afternoon peaks occurred 3 5 and 1 2 h early respectively our results revealed that imerg has the most accurate characterization of the diurnal cycle amongst the four products investigated in this study 3 1 3 seasonal characteristics figs 8 and 9 present the seasonal averaged c c and csi respectively determined from the spe and rpe products over mainland china and the 9 major basins the ability to capture precipitation in the rainy summer and arid winter varies with each product with greater differences observed between product types rather than within products table 4 reports the average seasonal c c and csi of mainland china in terms of average c c the spes were observed to performed better in summer compared to the other seasons while the accuracy was lowest in winter in contrast the rpes exhibited the lowest accuracy in summer while merra surpassed the accuracy of all products in spring and autumn the csi seasonal performances were similar to those of c c supplemental fig s6 presents the seasonal pbias the average precipitation of each product exceeds that of the gauge data cfsr overestimated precipitation by 20 in seasons other than winter cfsr s large overestimation of precipitation results in higher pbias values across basins compared to the other products merra outperforms the spes in the northern basin in terms of c c csi and pbias while the spes exhibit higher accuracies in humid regions 3 2 daily series comparisons table 5 reports the performance of the precipitation products at the hourly and daily scales as well as the daily maximum minimum series the precision of the daily precipitation products is greatly improved compared to the hourly scale merra exhibits the highest precision and csi value in daily precipitation while imerg captures the daily maximum minimum precipitation more accurately than the other products surprisingly low kg e values were determined with the rpes in the daily minimum series this is associated with the much greater average daily minimum precipitation compared to the gauge series and the large amounts of low precipitation estimated in rainless days as seen in the far in fig 10 and the false bias in fig 11 the kg e exhibits a marked improvement in the daily scale compared to the hourly scale in particular the kg e of cfsr changes from negative to positive when moving from the hourly to daily scales this indicates an improvement in the mean precipitation and cv values although the rpes exhibited several defects in the sub daily precipitation distribution the daily precipitation estimates are relatively accurate 3 3 response to extreme weather extreme precipitation has resulted in great challenges to flood control in urban areas in some areas sub daily precipitation has exhibited obvious fluctuations while daily scale precipitation has remained relatively stable zhang et al 2020 obtaining data from gauge precipitation stations proves to be a difficult task particularly for long term records the supplement of hourly scale gridded precipitation products is thus particularly important to determine precipitation changes at a high temporal resolution the first row of fig 10 depicts the c c derived from each day s 1st 5th 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th and 99th percentile hourly precipitation series with summer and winter on the left and right respectively a peak c c value reached its highest at the 90th percentile this is followed by a gradual reduction in the accuracy with the rpes exhibiting a steeper decline compared to the spes furthermore the ability of cfsr to capture high value precipitation is inferior to the other products the winter and summer distributions essentially follow the same trend for the percentile c cs as depicted in figs 8 9 and table 4 gsmap has the worst performance in winter among all products the winter percentile c cs in fig 10 showed that gsmap has slightly better c cs for the precipitation series less than 50th percentile it is precipitation series greater than 50th percentile that cause gsmap to perform worse than other products in winter the second to the last rows of fig 10 depict the pod far csi of the hourly precipitation series with 1st 5th 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th and 99th percentile hourly precipitation taken as the threshold fig 11 presents the relative percent hit miss false total bias determined following the thresholds used in calculation of pod far csi in fig 10 in contrast to the bias depicted in fig 6 and supplemental fig s6 the decomposed bias indicates the hit bias to be predominantly negative this indicates that the captured precipitation is generally underestimated and the positive bias is essentially a result of the false precipitation estimations particularly cfsr massive false events conducted to its bias degree to far exceed other products all products generally underestimate precipitation for extreme summer precipitation events e g when threshold was set to 95th percentile as the threshold increases the hit and false biases gradually tend to 0 while the miss bias gradually increases the pod value also gradually decreases indicating an increase in miss events unlike the spes the winter hit bias of the rpes is positive the rpe determine pod values are significantly higher than those of the spes this is attributed to the precipitation estimated by the reanalysis products in rainless days which also resulted in rpes poorer far values compared to the spes as percentile threshold increases far increases for spes but decreases for rpes this is because stratiform precipitation is the main source of precipitation during winter both pmw and ir sensors used in the satellite observatory have problems with detecting precipitation from these non convective clouds in winter further the snow cover especially over mountainous areas is occasionally misidentified as rain by pmw sensors ebert et al 2007 feidas et al 2009 islam et al 2020 meanwhile rpes are better at estimating stratiform precipitation than convective precipitation tang et al 2020 fig 11 indicates the high miss bias as a cause of gsmap and imerg s inferior performances in winter the spes severely underestimating the precipitation below the 90th percentile particularly for gsmap determining whether precipitation products can effectively capture extreme precipitation is crucial fig 12 demonstrates the cwd and cdd characteristics in mainland china at the monthly scale the rpe derived cwd is inferior to that of the spes this is related to the excessively estimated low level precipitation for rainless days the cdd values simulated by merra and the spes exhibit a closer trend to the gauge series compared to the cfsr fig 13 depicts the spi index and average hourly precipitation at the 95th and 99th percentile of each day in order to assess the extreme precipitation the ability to capture drought or flood events does not vary greatly between products while the extreme precipitation estimated by each gridded product particularly the rpes is lower than that of the gauge series 3 4 improvement through the last decades a stable performance is crucial for products with a long time span fig 14 presents the linear trends that passed the significance test in c c and csi determined from the precipitation during summer and winter of 2008 2017 the significance test was conducted using t test and the stations where p values less than 0 05 were considered to pass the significance test results revealed that the accuracy of the four products is relatively consistent in summer with c c exhibiting a slight increasing trend the csis have negligible trends the spe improvements in summer are greater than those of the rpes with more stations in spes pass the significance test than rpes supplemental table s1 the winter trends in c c and csi for each product are greater their summer counterparts this indicates that each product exhibits improved winter precipitation estimations in winter the improved regions for spes are located in the arid northern plain basins e g slrb huairb and hairb downstream of swb and the coastal areas of serb and prb moreover the degree and spatial range of rpe improvement is greater than those of the spes with the cc csi increasing by more than 0 05 0 03 per year in the vast regions of northeast china and northwest of cb the trend slope without significant test was showed in supplemental fig s7 compared to fig 14 negative trends barely passed the significance test for all products more stations passed the significance test in winter than in summer and the proportion of stations with significant trend was basically greater than 30 supplemental table s1 in summary the improvement in c c generally exceeds that of csi for each product with spe improvements in summer greater than those of rpe and vice versa in winter moreover the improvements in accuracy for winter generally exceed those in summer 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties caused by the benchmark dataset and mismatch resolution the performance of spes and rpes are assessed based on a gauge dataset derived from cmpa in this study the selection of benchmark precipitation and the mismatch of product resolution could cause uncertainties in the evaluation results the uncertainties are mainly reflected in the following aspects 1 the influence of cmorph in the merge procedure of cmpa and the influence of overlapping gauge stations of cmpa aws network and gpcc cpc cmpa is obtained by merging more than 30 000 ground awss and cmorph in order to avoid the influence of cmorph on the benchmark data set the nbs located grids were selected out of cmpa to be used as the benchmark ground gauge precipitation in this paper furthermore the 2 spes and 2 rpes evaluated in this paper all used gauge based precipitation products to adjust their precipitation gpcc monthly gauge based product for imerg and cpc daily gauge based product for gsmap merra and cfsr the in situ gauge stations used by gpcc cpc are partly overlap with the awss used by cmpa however the number of stations gpcc cpc used around 700 stations for gpcc and around 400 for cpc is far less than that the stations used in this study moreover the temporal resolution of cmpa hourly is also higher than that of gpcc cpc monthly and daily scale respectively we believe that the mask extracted dataset was least affected by the merging procedure and closest to the ground gauged precipitation and thus can effectively increase the independence between the reference and target datasets this method has been used in previous literatures e g ma et al 2020 sun et al 2020 tang et al 2020 the sparse gauges in the extensive western china will lead to unreliable evaluation results however the actual performance of the products should be higher than the results in this paper 2 the rpes used in this study have coarser resolution compared to cmpa imerg gsmap we resampled the rpes to 0 1 resolution using bilinear interpolation the mismatch resolution and the interpolation procedure could affect the evaluation results taking 2015 as an example we compared the original and resampled merra and cfsr respectively from the perspectives of annual maximum precipitation annual average precipitation and average daily standard variation the results were showed in supplemental figs s1 and s2 the results indicated that the bilinear interpolation can basically maintain the spatial characteristics of climate while dividing the original products into smaller grids the c c in 2015 was taken as an example to test how the resampling procedure would affect the evaluating results the results of resampling coarse resolution products to high resolution ones or resample high resolution products to coarser resolution ones are shown in supplemental table s2 the results show that both the two resampling strategies will bring errors however since the difference of c c between the products are larger than the error caused by the resampling procedure in table 5 indicating that the difference in spatial scale is not the dominant source of error in rpes therefore we believe it is acceptable to use the bilinear interpolated datasets for evaluation 4 2 data quality of spes and rpes the results of this study demonstrate that the spe precipitation series of the whole year have better overall performance than that of the rpes figs 3 4 however if the precipitation series is divided into seasons the rpes exhibit a higher accuracy in winter lu and yong 2020 reported that the performance of the gpm series products was poorest in winter and tang et al 2020 revealed reanalysis products to perform better in winter than other product types this indicated the necessity of choosing precipitation products according to the season or even month the spatial distribution of accuracy of spes and rpes is also different the rpes are more accurate in the northern plain region while the spes exhibited a higher accuracy in the southern humid area among the sub regions basins the bias in precipitation estimation in cb is the largest and merra is the best performing product in cb this indicates the ability of merra to correct the influence of the high latitude mountainous climate on precipitation estimations convective precipitation is one of the major precipitation types in the middle and low latitude regions of china e g prb swb serb the middle and lower reaches of the ytzrb our results indicate the spes to have a stronger ability in capturing summer convective precipitation while the rpes exhibit large uncertainties this was especially evident in the representation of diurnal cycle due to the strong diurnal changes in thermodynamics and solar radiation the rapidly established near noon convection caused the precipitation diurnal cycle in the afternoon to midnight over land previous studies on the precipitation diurnal cycle base on reanalysis products or large scale atmospheric models consistently revealed early peak and weak amplitude cui et al 2021 itterly et al 2018 watters et al 2021 in this study rpes showed consistent deficiency in representing summer diurnal cycle in mainland china in atmospheric models the uncertainties in diurnal cycle reproduction appear to be linked to the models convective parameterizations and how the schemes interact with the land surface the boundary layer and clouds dynamics itterly et al 2018 randall et al 2003 rpe s consistent early peak may be related to the premature onset of cumulus convection cui et al 2021 watters et al 2021 since the rpes assessed in this paper have coarser resolution than the spes their averaged finer grid 0 1 precipitation are not expected to reflect the intensity or rapid changes in local conditions associated with small scale storms reichle et al 2017 however the performance of rpes in diurnal cycle are more likely to linked to the convection scheme at coarser scale pearson et al 2014 the performance of merra and cfsr showed large differences in other aspects according to fig 10 in this paper merra and cfsr have larger pod and far compared to spes indicating an overproduction of cloud for both rpes pearson et al 2014 however the false bias of cfsr in fig 11 is generally much higher than that of merra and the other two spes which directly leads to an overestimated precipitation of cfsr the differences between cfsr and merra are likely due to differences in radiative cooling for the atmosphere in their respective analysis and for which heating related to precipitation provides the balancing component zhang et al 2012b 4 3 the difference in improvements fig 14 depicts the improvement of the four products in winter and summer from 2008 to 2017 the results indicated obvious differences of product improvement between winter and summer as for the rpes their improvement might be related to the improvement of data quality of input assimilation data of reanalysis system in recent years however the weak improvement in summer also indicated that the reanalysis products still need to be further improved to cope with wet season convection previous evaluation of gauge adjusted and non adjusted imerg gsmap in mainland china showed better performance of gauge adjusted data sets and the adjust procedure has more significant improvement in winter than in summer lu and yong 2020 tang et al 2020 the results of tang et al 2020 indicated that the improvement due to gauge adjustment is greater than the improvement due to satellite sensors which might also be the same for the improvement in gsmap the differences in improvement in winter and summer of gpcc cpc may be part of the reason why spes have better improvement in winter of course cpc also affects the performance of two rpes in this study 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the performance of four gridded precipitation products including two reanalysis precipitation products and two satellite precipitation products our results revealed large variations in the satellite and reanalysis precipitations across different seasons and climate zones at the hourly scale the overall annual performance of the spes surpasses that of the rpes with imerg exhibiting the best performance average c c of mainland china reaching 0 426 however inter season characteristic of the spes and rpes are different the average accuracy of rpe products in winter is greater than those of the spes and vice versa for summer the analysis of the hourly precipitation accuracy demonstrated the positive bias for all products compared to gauge precipitation the bias decomposition reveals that the rpe error generally originates from false bias especially for light precipitation while the spe bias is a result of miss bias the diurnal cycle captured by the rpes is generally inferior than that of the spes rpes tend to reproduce early peaks and weaker magnitude as depicted in the results of diurnal cycle at the daily scale merra has the best overall performance and cfsr improve a lot than at hourly scale in terms of extreme weather the rpes ability to capture sub daily extreme precipitation is inferior to that of the spes especially when reproducing extreme heavy precipitation we further investigated how the gridded products have improved within the last decades spes improved precipitation in the humid regions and rpe improves precipitation in areas with less precipitation in mid to high latitude plains for all products the improvement in winter is greater than in summer furthermore the difficulties in identifying precipitation clouds in high latitude mountainous areas results in large biases for all gridded products this study presents a detailed assessment of the performance of satellite based and reanalysis precipitation products under multi temporal scales and extreme weather the results can provide a theoretical basis for potential users of the precipitation products in areas such as hydrological and meteorological simulations furthermore our study can act as guidance for the application and improvement of global precipitation products declaration of competing

3792,the yangtze river tidal reach yrtr is one of the most important land sea transition zones in china the yrtr is 640 km long and the adjacent land area of 220 000 km2 has a population of ca 150 million even though the effect of three gorges dam tgd on its downstream has been extensively studied a comprehensive understanding of natural and dam induced changes in the yrtr is still a challenging task here we use a digital elevation model and a numerical model to identify the causes of channel changes in the yrtr our analysis highlighted three main points 1 changes in the tidal range caused an increase in the ebb maximum discharge and led to an increase in channel width depth and cross section area however the channel depth abruptly starts to dwindle at the transition zone where unidirectional ebb flow changes to bidirectional ebb flood flows 2 dam interception has reduced the sediment supply into the yrtr causing a change from deposition to erosion in the river bed an increase of one billion m3 in reservoir capacity cut down annual suspended sediment supply by 2 26 million tons and scoured 1 54 million tons of riverbed sediment annually from the yrtr into the estuary 3 dam storage caused an increase of ca 3800 m3 s runoff into the yrtr in the spring season during 2001 2013 compared with the same period in 1959 1970 this caused an average increase of ca 10 in the water diversion rate into the branch and an increase in flow velocity in flood plains and branch channels of 2 9 and 2 5 times that in the trunk channels such hydrodynamic increases have accelerated erosion of the branches and flood plains in recent decades especially post tgd the study presents original insights into the tidal channel longitudinal abrupt changes induced by shift of natural flow regime and riverbed changes from deposition to erosion induced by reservoirs and indicates the likely response of the yrtr to further decline in sediment load in the future keywords dam reservoir interception and adjustment tidal reach tide range channel deformation 1 introduction increasing human demands on rivers such as for shipping flood control electricity generation and irrigation have led to the construction of an estimated 2 8 million dams with reservoir areas 103m2 in the world over the past century moreover 77 of the world s rivers are diverted and regulated grill et al 2019 the construction of dams in river basins has become a major activity globally which has seriously altered natural river processes and channel connectivity resulting in fragmentation of river basins disconnection of channels from their floodplains and the destruction of natural stability and equilibrium in runoff and sediment transport dynesius and nilsson 1994 nilsson et al 2005 latrubesse et al 2017 the changes in runoff and sediment transport have caused degradation in geomorphological ecological and environmental conditions schmidt and wilcock 2008 fan et al 2015 many studies have investigated the effects of damming a river on downstream flow and channel development e g petts 1979 williams and wolman 1984 lane et al 1996 milliman 1997 brandt 2000 graf 2006 schmidt and wilcock 2008 yang et al 2014 fan et al 2015 much work has also been done attempting to understand the global effects of river engineering on estuaries and deltas some instances are the mekong river anthony 2015 yangtze river yang et al 2003 luan et al 2016 gange brahmaputra shearman et al 2013 rahman et al 2018 and mississippi atchafalaya river system rosen and xu 2013 wang and xu 2018 collectively these studies have demonstrated the strong influence of riverine processes on estuarine and near shore morphodynamics comparably however little is known of the effects in the tidal reach affected by both the river and tidal flows shearman et al 2013 zheng et al 2018a the reach between the tidal limit and the limit of saline intrusion is often densely populated and has a vital role in the river sea system due to its crucial role in the exchange of water and sediments hoitink and jay 2016 torres 2017 yang et al 2017 yuan et al 2020a the tidal reaches of some large rivers such as the yangtze mekong and hudson rivers generally extend hundreds of kilometers upstream of the estuary mouth and the tidal limit is the point upstream in the river where the tidal fluctuations are negligible therefore this tidal reach area is the key zone of land sea interactions affecting the surrounding land and the resident population evaluating the impact of dams on the tidal reach has become a research focus in recent years ralston and geyer 2017 wang and xu 2018 the yangtze river yr is the third longest river 6300 km in the world milliman and farnsworth 2011 fig 1 a and its final 640 km tidal reach yrtr is china s most important waterway for goods transport from inland to the sea an important zone of land sea interactions 150 million peoples live within this area of 220 000 km2 with industries commercial centers and some of the world s largest ports https www ndrc gov cn xxgk zcfb ghwb 201606 fig 1b the yrtr contains many in channel islands and has a typical meandering planform with some areas periodically inundated by floods fig 1b the annual sediment load of the yangtze river has decreased from 470 million tons in the 1960s to 200 million tons in the 2010s due mainly to the construction of more than 50 000 dams in the river basin yang et al 2018 in 2003 the construction of the world s largest hydropower dam the three gorges dam tgd spanning across the upper yangtze river was completed creating a 660 km long and 1 1 km wide reservoir upstream by trapping sediment in the reservoir the dam has favored channel erosion downstream up to the yangtze mouth since its closure dai and liu 2013 yang et al 2014 guo et al 2018 lyu et al 2020 however despite the attempts to highlight the dam induced changes at the mouth of the yangtze river some details and key processes have not yet been fully understood a recent study showed that the channel depth of the yr estuary abruptly increased at ca 230 km downstream of wusong station zheng et al 2018b such a phenomenon has also reported for the lowermost mississippi river wang and xu 2018 there is little discussion about the mechanism of this depth jump and what role the tide may have played although previous studies have analyzed the characteristics of deposition and erosion patterns in the yrtr caused by the closure of the tgd zheng et al 2018a zheng et al 2018b yuan et al 2020a no quantitative relationship has been determined between riverbed deformation and sediment decline it is not yet known how the different geomorphological units such as trunk channel floodplains and branch channel respond to reservoir driven adjustments of flow and sediment discharge it remains a matter of debate just how far and how long the tgd can affect the river downstream of the dam some research has indicated that the riverbed incision can only extend 400 km below the tgd lai et al 2017 and this obviously differs from the government s previous feasibility studies in this study we examine the 484 km yangtze river estuary reach from datong tidal limit in the dry season to xuliujing salt water limit in the dry season zheng et al 2018a fig 1b we aim to gain insights into the mechanism of the abrupt change of channel depth relationships between channel deposition erosion and sediment flux patterns of degradation gradual vs abrupt and the role of reservoir induced discharge adjustment reducing flood peaks vs increasing dry season runoff in different geomorphological changes the study builds on previous analyses of channel form and sediment dynamics zheng et al 2018a zheng et al 2018b yuan et al 2020a with a focus on the terminal reaches downstream from the dam 2 methodology 2 1 historical channel charts and determination of riverbed change monthly water and sediment discharge dams and reservoirs considering resolution availability and typicality of chart navigation charts of the 484 km yrtr on the 1 40 000 scale were collected for the publication years of 1963 1972 2002 and 2014 and the actual observation years of the charts were 1959 1970 2000 and 2013 respectively the charts for 1959 1970 and 2000 were published by the navigation guarantee department of the chinese navy headquarters and the 2013 chart was published by the changjiang waterway bureau cwb 2014 the charts of the study area were digitized in a geographic information system gis by arc gis esri redlands ca the study area was divided into twenty one geomorphological river reaches for quantifying net erosion and siltation within each sector fig 1b digital elevation models dems were used to analyze riverbed deformation due to other matrix models of bedform such as raster grid and vector triangulated irregular network tin which are rarely used and absent in the most popular gis software packages using dems we calculated mean depth mean width mean cross section area and deposition erosion budgets in each reach for the periods from 1959 to 1970 from 1970 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2013 specifically 1 arc gis was used to calibrate scanned charts 2 the charts were digitized to form an elevation database 3 the surfer software golden software llc was used to create dems and to evaluate the features of each reach namely the mean depth the mean width and the mean across section area 4 changes in riverbed volume were quantified by calculating the difference in dem between two periods a positive change indicated deposition while a negative change meant erosion 5 the sediment mass change in metric tons was quantified by multiplying the changed volumes with a riverbed

changjiang covering the period 1955 2015 cwrcmwr changjiang water resource commission of the ministry of water resource 1955 2015 located 640 km upstream of the yangtze river s mouth the datong station is the most downstream hydrological gauging station with long term continuous discharge records the data of dams and reservoirs in the yangtze river catchment has been sourced from the icold international commission on large dams world register of dams http www icold cigb org gb world register world register asp there are 1170 dams in the list and each reservoir has a capacity greater than one million m3 fig 1a 2 3 hydrodynamics modeling of the yrtr hydrodynamic numerical model hnm is derived from the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations nse which express the physical principle of conservation of volume mass and momentum related to hydrostatic and non hydrostatic free surface flow on a structured or unstructured grid to cover complicated geometry klingbeil et al 2018 mike 21 uses triangular grid and finite volume discretization technique and an effective split explicit scheme that make it suitable to simulate physical processes in rivers lagoons coastal seas estuaries and lakes sleigh et al 1998 hou et al 2013 shumilova et al 2018 dhi danish hydraulic institute 2019 therefore the study employ mike21 to simulate hydrodynamic processes of the yrtr the governing equations their parameters and the methods of how to calculate and assign values have all been carried out following the instruction manual of mike 21 dhi 2019 specifically in order to understand the natural tidal hydrodynamics of the longitudinal change of channel shape mike 21 was used to simulate the distribution of tidal range ebb tide duration and ebb tide maximum discharge along the channel while input runoff was kept at average annual discharge in order to understand the hydrodynamic effects of reservoir adjustments to discharge on different channel geomorphic areas mike 21 was used to model the change of water diversion rate into branch channels when the reservoir was releasing water in the dry season mike 21 was also used to simulate the change in flow velocity in the trunk channel the flood plains and the branch channel during the release of water from the reservoir in the dry season following the main framework of mike 21 the finite element mesh was developed for the yrtr shown in fig 2 representing the river region with triangular elements of different size and shape a total of 187 160 nodes and 356 505 triangular cells were used to represent the model domain with high spatial resolution up to 30 m the model bathymetry was digitized using the 2013 nautical chart of the yrtr and the sets of orther main parameters such as datum courant

the observed and simulated time series of water levels at wuhu and maanshan stations data sourced form cwb 2014 located in the middle of the yrtr fig 2a the model validation period was from january 24 2020 to january 27 2020 and there were 59 water levels validated the model performance was evaluated using average absolute difference aad and a non dimensionalized parameter γ2 the aad and γ2 were used to measure the bias between the observations and model output which are defined as urrego blanco and sheng 2012 thompson and sheng 1997 a a d 1 n i 1 n o i m i γ 2 var o m var o where o and m denote the water level values from the observations and model simulations respectively subscript i denotes the ith hour step in a total of n hour steps var is the variance operator aad quantifies the mean error of model simulations in the units of the variables being validated zhang and sheng 2015 in addition γ2 is a nondimensional parameter that measures the fit of the model output to observations and where γ2 is less than 0 01 model performance is high thompson and sheng 1997 results of model validation show a close agreement between the observations and model simulations aad values are mostly smaller than 0 1 m and more importantly γ2 are all less than 0 01 fig 2b this implies that the model is able to effectively reproduce discharge and flow velocity variability in the yrtr 3 results 3 1 longitudinal distribution of channel forms abrupt and gradual change from 1959 to 2013 the distribution of channel forms along the yrtr generally were very similar and consistent however the longitudinal change of channel mean width depth and cross section area all have obvious abrupt changes the mean width gradually increased from ca 2 1 km at reach 1 to ca 3 0 km at reach 16 and abruptly increased to ca 9 km at reach 21 fig 3 a the mean cross section area also gradually increased from ca 22 106 m2 at reach 1 to ca 32 106 m2 at reach 16 and then abruptly increased to ca 80 106 m2 at reach 21 fig 3b the mean depth also gradually increased from ca 7m at reach 1 to ca 20 m at reach 16 followed by a decrease to ca 10 m at reach 21 fig 3c obviously reach 16 is a zone of abrupt change of channel forms the distance from reach 1 to reach 16 is ca 320 km and from reach 16 to reach 21 is 170 km 3 2 sediment transformation from deposition to erosion over the past 55 years the yrtr experienced an obvious transformation from deposition to erosion in the 12 years from 1959 to 1970 72 of the trunk channel bed i e 15 out of the 21 reaches had a deposition of 947 2 million tons mt of sediment with an average annual rate of 78 9 mt fig 4 a in the following 30 years from 1971 to 2000 most of the trunk channel bed i e 67 or 14 out of 21 reaches continued having deposition but with a much lower average annual rate of 19 6 mt total of 589 4 mt fig 4b in the last 13 years from 2001 to 2013 however deposition continued in only 8 out of the 21 reaches i e 38 all the other reaches 62 experienced erosion with a total of 1519 8 million tons this large amount of sediment scored from the yrtr indicated an annual supply of 116 9 million tons to the river mouth fig 4c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of tidal regime on the rate of change of channel forms dem analysis found channel width and cross section area gradually increased downstream to reach 16 located 230 km from the mouth where an abrupt increase began fig 1b in early research studies channel features such as width depth velocity and sediment load were found to be a power law function of a dominant discharge at any given cross section arguing that sediment carrying capacity is the essential determinant factor of river channel forms such relationships between channel geometry and discharge were described as hydraulic geometry lacey 1930 leopold and maddock 1953 lane 1955 singh et al 2003 wohl 2004 we also argue here that changes of longitudinal channel forms in the yrtr are also essentially determined by changes in dominant discharge however the calculation of the dominant discharge in tidal rivers is difficult due to constant changes in runoff along the river channel affected by tides considering the annual average discharge could represent dominant discharge in river channel then when the discharge into tidal river channel keep annual average value the longitudinal maximum ebb tide discharge qemax could represent dominant discharge in tidal channel in this study we used mike 21 to calculate the tidal range of each reach when flow at datong station is the annual average flow ca 30000 m3 s specificllly the tidal ranges between 0 m at reach 1 and 3 5 m at reach 21 we then calculated the qemax of each reach and defined qemax as the dominant discharge of each reach results showed that qemax gradually increased from 30000 m3 s at reach 1 to 40000 m3 s at reach 16 and then abruptly increased reaching 78000 m3 s at reach 21 fig 5 a the concurrent increase of longitudinal tidal range and qemax revealed that tidal range change caused increase of maximum ebb tide discharge on the other hand the proportion of ebb flow duration in a complete tidal cycle was 1 0 at reach 16 decreasing to 0 62 at reach 21 which indicates that the hydraulic regime abruptly changed from ebb unidirectional flow to ebb flood bidirectional flow at reach 16 fig 5a regression analysis shows that channel width and cross section area are both significantly positively correlated with qemax as their regression coefficients all exceed 0 7 fig 5b 5c this shows that the distribution of channel width and cross section area are essentially dominated by qemax change along the yrtr however the dynamics of the longitudinal change in channel depth cannot be simply related to qemax as the channel depth does not increase consistently downstream but abruptly begins to decrease at reach 16 regression analysis also shows that channel depth is positively related to qemax from reach 1 to reach 16 but is negatively related to qemax downstream from reach 16 fig 5d the question then is what factor other than qemax causes the abrupt change in channel depth at reach 16 overall consideration where the hydraulic regime from unidirectional flow to bidirectional flow at reach 16 neither channel width nor cross section area has abrupt change but channel depth has the abrupt change from increase trend to decrease trend fig 5 therefore we contend that the hydraulic regime shift from unidirectional flow to bidirectional flow is the dominating factor causing channel depth to change abruptly fig 5a on the other hand the dem of the yrtr showed that upstream of reach 16 there are some low relief hills mostly less than 200 m which limit any increase in channel width resulting in the observed increase in channel depth in fig 3c below reach 16 the channel abruptly enters the alluvial plain where the elevation is mainly below 5 m here the channel width increases allowing the channel depth to be reduced fig 1b to sum up above reach 16 qemax increases downstream the ebb has a unidirectional flow regime and the constraint caused by the low hills that border the channel together cause channel width cross section area and depth to increase only gradually below reach 16 the downstream increase in qemax causes the increase in channel width and cross section area but the bidirectional flow regime and lack of restraint on channel widening allows the depth to decrease given above considerations we think the changes of tide and landforms together shape the distribution of the gradual and the abrupt changes in channel forms 4 2 relationships between dams sediment supply and deposition erosion in the past the most significant change of sediment regime was shifted from deposition to erosion in the yrtr channel fig 4 specifically the deposited sediment is quickly eroded in downstream tidal reach this trend is taken as a new example of dams induced effects in the upper river basin other large rivers such as the hudson and mississippi have experienced deposition in their tidal reaches following the construction of dams in their basins ralston and geyer 2017 wang and xu 2018 some previous studies also found such sedimentary transformation in the yrtr and also discussed the effect of the three gorge dam on such transformation zheng et al 2018a zheng et al 2018b yuan et al 2020a but they did not produce quantitative relationships between catchment dams the sediment decline and riverbed deformation in the yrtr in this study we attempt to quantify the effects of dams on riverbed transformation in the yrtr currently there are 1170 large dams each with a capacity greater than one million m3 in the yangtze river basin fig 1a the total capacity of the dammed reservoirs in the basin has increased from 22 0 billion m3 in 1970 to 64 8 billion m3 in 2000 and 195 0 billion m3 in 2015 fig 6 a over the same period the sediment flux into the yrtr declined from an annual average of 490 mt in 1955 1970 to 390 mt in 1971 2000 and then further declined to 200 mt in 2001 2015 although the annual discharge at datong had no obvious trend over the period 1959 2013 fig 6b the annual decrease of sediment flux in the yrtr is strongly negatively correlated with the annual increase in total reservoir capacity in the river basin fig 6c this indicates that an increase of one billion m3 of reservoir capacity in the yangtze river basin leads to a decrease of 2 26 million tons of sediment supply into the yrtr per year the relationship further reveals that dam interception dominates the decrease of sediment flux into the yrtr fig 6c this sediment interception due to dam closure leads to river degradation downstream according to the hydrological data record the sediment discharge sd difference value between average sediment discharge in 1959 1970 and that in other period increased from 13 6 mt month in 1971 2002 to 25 6 mt month in 2001 2013 thus the sediment discharge sn approximately doubled over the 1971 2013 period fig 6d the sd increase made erosion the dominant process in 1959 2013 thus favouring river degradation and the sd surplus is essentially attributed to dam closures yang et al 2003 syvitski et al 2009 milliman and farnsworth 2011 luan et al 2016 chen et al 2020 further regression analysis shows that annual deposition erosion volume in the yrtr is directly positively correlated with annual sediment supply at datong dt and the slope of the regression line and the coefficient of determination were 0 57 and 0 99 this result indicates a decrease of one mt of sediment supply into the yrtr could cause the riverbed to be scoured of 0 57 million m3 0 68 mt of sediment which is then supplied to the estuary fig 6e furthermore the correlations of deformation in each reach with sediment supply at dt and the results show deformations in 71 reaches 15 21 were significantly related to sediment supply decrease at dt with the relationship coefficients all more than 0 5 fig 6f all in all the dorp in the sediment supply is likely to have impacted on the geomorphology of the yrtr channel these relationships provide quantitative measures of the effect of catchment dams on the terminal tidal river channel deformation that is each increased of one billion m3 of reservoir capacity in the catchment decreased the sediment supply into the tidal river by 2 26 mt per year then caused the yrtr channel bed to be scoured and supplied 1 54 mt per year of sediment into the estuary there are many methods to perform a regression in the study we used the empirical linear regression equation to predict sediment flux change related to channel evolutionary trends proved to be especially suitable for channel features leopold and maddock 1953 despite its simple framework the method resulted in reaching high regression coefficients greater than 0 8 4 3 effect of reservoir interception on erosion of branch channels and flood plains the other impressive change observed here was in the flood plains and branch channels where deposition shifted to erosion and where erosion was stronger than in the trunk channel of the yrtr fig 4 these relationships confirm that reservoir interception essentially dominated the yrtr channel sediment transformation from deposition to erosion in this study we used the mike 21 model try to find out the reason for the accelerated erosion of the branch and flood plains because we hypothesize that such erosion acceleration in the shallow water areas should be closely related to water and sediment adjustments induced by upstream dams it is well known that catchment dams significantly intercept water and sediment and bring obvious changes in the downstream behavior of water and sediment yang et al 2015 yuan et al 2012 our statistical analyses found that while dam adjustment induced sediment flux decline in all seasons in 1959 2013 the percentage sediment flux in the dry season increased by 10 21 whereas that of flood season decreased by 10 21 at the same time the discharge in spring increased 3801 m3 s 3 94 and in summer decreased 2820 m3 s 1 18 table 1 considering such adjustments especially the obvious increases of the percentage of discharge and sediment in the spring season we argue that the acceleration of erosion in shallow water is induced by water and sediment adjustments especially in the spring season the mike model results showed that the increase in discharge in the dry season induced hydrodynamic accelerations in the shallow water areas during the period the discharge increased from 15800 m3 s to 19500 m3 s δ 3700 m3 s fig 7 a the water diversion rate in the branch of bifurcated reaches all showed an accelerated increase in the range 0 84 29 2 with an average of 10 29 fig 7b this indicates the discharge of branch channels on average increased ca 10 when discharge increased 3801 m3 s in the spring season in 2000 2013 compared with 1959 1970 on the other hand with accelerated discharge increases in channel branches the runoff velocities in different areas all increased in the spring season and the velocity increase rates in flood plains and branch channels were obviously greater than that in the trunk channel the velocity increase rates in flood plains and branch channels were 1 3 8 0 times 3 9 average times and 1 1 6 0 times 2 5 average times respectively more than that in trunk channels fig 7c that shows that the flow velocities in flood plains and branch channels on average increased 2 9 and 2 5 times more than that in trunk channels when dt runoff increased to 3800 m3 s in the spring season the increases of discharge and velocities accelerated the erosion of branches and flood plains in past decades especially after the construction of the three gorges dam although traditional theories of riverbed evolution argue that the dominant discharge in the flood season is the most significant hydrodynamic to shape channel form pickup and warner 1976 carling 1988 czech et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 this study found the increase of discharge in the dry season caused by dam operations have more and more effects on channel evolution the discharge increase prompts erosion acceleration in shallow water areas such as flood plains and branch channels 4 4 model limitations the present approach was able to capture some of the morphodynamic processes occurring at the mouth of the yangtze river after dam closure clearly the evolution of the yangtze river tidal reach depends also on other factors that were not included in this framework we briefly recall here these effects first of all although it is generally believed that the average sea level has risen by 0 158 m in the past hundred years ipcc ar6 https www ipcc ch report ar6 wg1 some new researches found accelerating sea level rise were likely to increase the trapping ratio of the sediment in the yangtze river estuary yuan et al 2020b and resulted in more sediment supply from subaqueous delta to the estuary and the delta continued their deposition and expansion yang et al 2021 that means the sea level rise in fact have not caused to erosion in the yrtr in recent decades second bank revetment activities in middle and low reach of the yangtze river some studies found the levee construction and bank revetment would contribute to the channel erosion li et al 2007 yao et al 2012 5 conclusions the yangtze river tidal reach is one of the largest interaction zones between continent and ocean owing to its length 640 km and the population 150 million living there given the natural and human induced effects on the system the evolution of channel forms shows three characteristics the natural increase of maximum ebb tide discharge dominated channel width and cross section area increase along the channel however the unidirectional ebb flow changes to bidirectional ebb flood flows and abrupt change in landform from low hills to alluvial plain caused an abrupt change in channel depth from increasing to decreasing at reach 16 fig 8 see ① process the founding innovatively illustrated the flow regime shift from ebb to ebb flood caused the tidal channel longitudinal depth abrupt change from increase trend to decrease trend such abrupt change are widely found in tidal estuaries the construction of dams in the catchment dominated the decline in sediment supply into the yrtr leading to a change from deposition to erosion fig 8 see ② process the founding furtherly quantified the relationship between sediment transition from deposition to erosion in tidal channel and sediment impoundment in catchment reservoirs the increase of discharge in the spring season adjusted by dams and the increase of hydrodynamics led ultimately to accelerated erosion of the branches and flood plains in past decades fig 8 see ③ process the founding innovatively demonstrated the contribution of discharge increase in dry season on the erosion of the tidal channel the above patterns are different from previous knowledge of tidal channel morphodynamic we think above patterns from the case study of yrtr are with general application to other river system due to the physical mechanisms of tidal channel evolution related to upstream adjustment by reservoirs are similar however this study is still limited in quantifying the different

3792,the yangtze river tidal reach yrtr is one of the most important land sea transition zones in china the yrtr is 640 km long and the adjacent land area of 220 000 km2 has a population of ca 150 million even though the effect of three gorges dam tgd on its downstream has been extensively studied a comprehensive understanding of natural and dam induced changes in the yrtr is still a challenging task here we use a digital elevation model and a numerical model to identify the causes of channel changes in the yrtr our analysis highlighted three main points 1 changes in the tidal range caused an increase in the ebb maximum discharge and led to an increase in channel width depth and cross section area however the channel depth abruptly starts to dwindle at the transition zone where unidirectional ebb flow changes to bidirectional ebb flood flows 2 dam interception has reduced the sediment supply into the yrtr causing a change from deposition to erosion in the river bed an increase of one billion m3 in reservoir capacity cut down annual suspended sediment supply by 2 26 million tons and scoured 1 54 million tons of riverbed sediment annually from the yrtr into the estuary 3 dam storage caused an increase of ca 3800 m3 s runoff into the yrtr in the spring season during 2001 2013 compared with the same period in 1959 1970 this caused an average increase of ca 10 in the water diversion rate into the branch and an increase in flow velocity in flood plains and branch channels of 2 9 and 2 5 times that in the trunk channels such hydrodynamic increases have accelerated erosion of the branches and flood plains in recent decades especially post tgd the study presents original insights into the tidal channel longitudinal abrupt changes induced by shift of natural flow regime and riverbed changes from deposition to erosion induced by reservoirs and indicates the likely response of the yrtr to further decline in sediment load in the future keywords dam reservoir interception and adjustment tidal reach tide range channel deformation 1 introduction increasing human demands on rivers such as for shipping flood control electricity generation and irrigation have led to the construction of an estimated 2 8 million dams with reservoir areas 103m2 in the world over the past century moreover 77 of the world s rivers are diverted and regulated grill et al 2019 the construction of dams in river basins has become a major activity globally which has seriously altered natural river processes and channel connectivity resulting in fragmentation of river basins disconnection of channels from their floodplains and the destruction of natural stability and equilibrium in runoff and sediment transport dynesius and nilsson 1994 nilsson et al 2005 latrubesse et al 2017 the changes in runoff and sediment transport have caused degradation in geomorphological ecological and environmental conditions schmidt and wilcock 2008 fan et al 2015 many studies have investigated the effects of damming a river on downstream flow and channel development e g petts 1979 williams and wolman 1984 lane et al 1996 milliman 1997 brandt 2000 graf 2006 schmidt and wilcock 2008 yang et al 2014 fan et al 2015 much work has also been done attempting to understand the global effects of river engineering on estuaries and deltas some instances are the mekong river anthony 2015 yangtze river yang et al 2003 luan et al 2016 gange brahmaputra shearman et al 2013 rahman et al 2018 and mississippi atchafalaya river system rosen and xu 2013 wang and xu 2018 collectively these studies have demonstrated the strong influence of riverine processes on estuarine and near shore morphodynamics comparably however little is known of the effects in the tidal reach affected by both the river and tidal flows shearman et al 2013 zheng et al 2018a the reach between the tidal limit and the limit of saline intrusion is often densely populated and has a vital role in the river sea system due to its crucial role in the exchange of water and sediments hoitink and jay 2016 torres 2017 yang et al 2017 yuan et al 2020a the tidal reaches of some large rivers such as the yangtze mekong and hudson rivers generally extend hundreds of kilometers upstream of the estuary mouth and the tidal limit is the point upstream in the river where the tidal fluctuations are negligible therefore this tidal reach area is the key zone of land sea interactions affecting the surrounding land and the resident population evaluating the impact of dams on the tidal reach has become a research focus in recent years ralston and geyer 2017 wang and xu 2018 the yangtze river yr is the third longest river 6300 km in the world milliman and farnsworth 2011 fig 1 a and its final 640 km tidal reach yrtr is china s most important waterway for goods transport from inland to the sea an important zone of land sea interactions 150 million peoples live within this area of 220 000 km2 with industries commercial centers and some of the world s largest ports https www ndrc gov cn xxgk zcfb ghwb 201606 fig 1b the yrtr contains many in channel islands and has a typical meandering planform with some areas periodically inundated by floods fig 1b the annual sediment load of the yangtze river has decreased from 470 million tons in the 1960s to 200 million tons in the 2010s due mainly to the construction of more than 50 000 dams in the river basin yang et al 2018 in 2003 the construction of the world s largest hydropower dam the three gorges dam tgd spanning across the upper yangtze river was completed creating a 660 km long and 1 1 km wide reservoir upstream by trapping sediment in the reservoir the dam has favored channel erosion downstream up to the yangtze mouth since its closure dai and liu 2013 yang et al 2014 guo et al 2018 lyu et al 2020 however despite the attempts to highlight the dam induced changes at the mouth of the yangtze river some details and key processes have not yet been fully understood a recent study showed that the channel depth of the yr estuary abruptly increased at ca 230 km downstream of wusong station zheng et al 2018b such a phenomenon has also reported for the lowermost mississippi river wang and xu 2018 there is little discussion about the mechanism of this depth jump and what role the tide may have played although previous studies have analyzed the characteristics of deposition and erosion patterns in the yrtr caused by the closure of the tgd zheng et al 2018a zheng et al 2018b yuan et al 2020a no quantitative relationship has been determined between riverbed deformation and sediment decline it is not yet known how the different geomorphological units such as trunk channel floodplains and branch channel respond to reservoir driven adjustments of flow and sediment discharge it remains a matter of debate just how far and how long the tgd can affect the river downstream of the dam some research has indicated that the riverbed incision can only extend 400 km below the tgd lai et al 2017 and this obviously differs from the government s previous feasibility studies in this study we examine the 484 km yangtze river estuary reach from datong tidal limit in the dry season to xuliujing salt water limit in the dry season zheng et al 2018a fig 1b we aim to gain insights into the mechanism of the abrupt change of channel depth relationships between channel deposition erosion and sediment flux patterns of degradation gradual vs abrupt and the role of reservoir induced discharge adjustment reducing flood peaks vs increasing dry season runoff in different geomorphological changes the study builds on previous analyses of channel form and sediment dynamics zheng et al 2018a zheng et al 2018b yuan et al 2020a with a focus on the terminal reaches downstream from the dam 2 methodology 2 1 historical channel charts and determination of riverbed change monthly water and sediment discharge dams and reservoirs considering resolution availability and typicality of chart navigation charts of the 484 km yrtr on the 1 40 000 scale were collected for the publication years of 1963 1972 2002 and 2014 and the actual observation years of the charts were 1959 1970 2000 and 2013 respectively the charts for 1959 1970 and 2000 were published by the navigation guarantee department of the chinese navy headquarters and the 2013 chart was published by the changjiang waterway bureau cwb 2014 the charts of the study area were digitized in a geographic information system gis by arc gis esri redlands ca the study area was divided into twenty one geomorphological river reaches for quantifying net erosion and siltation within each sector fig 1b digital elevation models dems were used to analyze riverbed deformation due to other matrix models of bedform such as raster grid and vector triangulated irregular network tin which are rarely used and absent in the most popular gis software packages using dems we calculated mean depth mean width mean cross section area and deposition erosion budgets in each reach for the periods from 1959 to 1970 from 1970 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2013 specifically 1 arc gis was used to calibrate scanned charts 2 the charts were digitized to form an elevation database 3 the surfer software golden software llc was used to create dems and to evaluate the features of each reach namely the mean depth the mean width and the mean across section area 4 changes in riverbed volume were quantified by calculating the difference in dem between two periods a positive change indicated deposition while a negative change meant erosion 5 the sediment mass change in metric tons was quantified by multiplying the changed volumes with a riverbed

changjiang covering the period 1955 2015 cwrcmwr changjiang water resource commission of the ministry of water resource 1955 2015 located 640 km upstream of the yangtze river s mouth the datong station is the most downstream hydrological gauging station with long term continuous discharge records the data of dams and reservoirs in the yangtze river catchment has been sourced from the icold international commission on large dams world register of dams http www icold cigb org gb world register world register asp there are 1170 dams in the list and each reservoir has a capacity greater than one million m3 fig 1a 2 3 hydrodynamics modeling of the yrtr hydrodynamic numerical model hnm is derived from the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations nse which express the physical principle of conservation of volume mass and momentum related to hydrostatic and non hydrostatic free surface flow on a structured or unstructured grid to cover complicated geometry klingbeil et al 2018 mike 21 uses triangular grid and finite volume discretization technique and an effective split explicit scheme that make it suitable to simulate physical processes in rivers lagoons coastal seas estuaries and lakes sleigh et al 1998 hou et al 2013 shumilova et al 2018 dhi danish hydraulic institute 2019 therefore the study employ mike21 to simulate hydrodynamic processes of the yrtr the governing equations their parameters and the methods of how to calculate and assign values have all been carried out following the instruction manual of mike 21 dhi 2019 specifically in order to understand the natural tidal hydrodynamics of the longitudinal change of channel shape mike 21 was used to simulate the distribution of tidal range ebb tide duration and ebb tide maximum discharge along the channel while input runoff was kept at average annual discharge in order to understand the hydrodynamic effects of reservoir adjustments to discharge on different channel geomorphic areas mike 21 was used to model the change of water diversion rate into branch channels when the reservoir was releasing water in the dry season mike 21 was also used to simulate the change in flow velocity in the trunk channel the flood plains and the branch channel during the release of water from the reservoir in the dry season following the main framework of mike 21 the finite element mesh was developed for the yrtr shown in fig 2 representing the river region with triangular elements of different size and shape a total of 187 160 nodes and 356 505 triangular cells were used to represent the model domain with high spatial resolution up to 30 m the model bathymetry was digitized using the 2013 nautical chart of the yrtr and the sets of orther main parameters such as datum courant

the observed and simulated time series of water levels at wuhu and maanshan stations data sourced form cwb 2014 located in the middle of the yrtr fig 2a the model validation period was from january 24 2020 to january 27 2020 and there were 59 water levels validated the model performance was evaluated using average absolute difference aad and a non dimensionalized parameter γ2 the aad and γ2 were used to measure the bias between the observations and model output which are defined as urrego blanco and sheng 2012 thompson and sheng 1997 a a d 1 n i 1 n o i m i γ 2 var o m var o where o and m denote the water level values from the observations and model simulations respectively subscript i denotes the ith hour step in a total of n hour steps var is the variance operator aad quantifies the mean error of model simulations in the units of the variables being validated zhang and sheng 2015 in addition γ2 is a nondimensional parameter that measures the fit of the model output to observations and where γ2 is less than 0 01 model performance is high thompson and sheng 1997 results of model validation show a close agreement between the observations and model simulations aad values are mostly smaller than 0 1 m and more importantly γ2 are all less than 0 01 fig 2b this implies that the model is able to effectively reproduce discharge and flow velocity variability in the yrtr 3 results 3 1 longitudinal distribution of channel forms abrupt and gradual change from 1959 to 2013 the distribution of channel forms along the yrtr generally were very similar and consistent however the longitudinal change of channel mean width depth and cross section area all have obvious abrupt changes the mean width gradually increased from ca 2 1 km at reach 1 to ca 3 0 km at reach 16 and abruptly increased to ca 9 km at reach 21 fig 3 a the mean cross section area also gradually increased from ca 22 106 m2 at reach 1 to ca 32 106 m2 at reach 16 and then abruptly increased to ca 80 106 m2 at reach 21 fig 3b the mean depth also gradually increased from ca 7m at reach 1 to ca 20 m at reach 16 followed by a decrease to ca 10 m at reach 21 fig 3c obviously reach 16 is a zone of abrupt change of channel forms the distance from reach 1 to reach 16 is ca 320 km and from reach 16 to reach 21 is 170 km 3 2 sediment transformation from deposition to erosion over the past 55 years the yrtr experienced an obvious transformation from deposition to erosion in the 12 years from 1959 to 1970 72 of the trunk channel bed i e 15 out of the 21 reaches had a deposition of 947 2 million tons mt of sediment with an average annual rate of 78 9 mt fig 4 a in the following 30 years from 1971 to 2000 most of the trunk channel bed i e 67 or 14 out of 21 reaches continued having deposition but with a much lower average annual rate of 19 6 mt total of 589 4 mt fig 4b in the last 13 years from 2001 to 2013 however deposition continued in only 8 out of the 21 reaches i e 38 all the other reaches 62 experienced erosion with a total of 1519 8 million tons this large amount of sediment scored from the yrtr indicated an annual supply of 116 9 million tons to the river mouth fig 4c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of tidal regime on the rate of change of channel forms dem analysis found channel width and cross section area gradually increased downstream to reach 16 located 230 km from the mouth where an abrupt increase began fig 1b in early research studies channel features such as width depth velocity and sediment load were found to be a power law function of a dominant discharge at any given cross section arguing that sediment carrying capacity is the essential determinant factor of river channel forms such relationships between channel geometry and discharge were described as hydraulic geometry lacey 1930 leopold and maddock 1953 lane 1955 singh et al 2003 wohl 2004 we also argue here that changes of longitudinal channel forms in the yrtr are also essentially determined by changes in dominant discharge however the calculation of the dominant discharge in tidal rivers is difficult due to constant changes in runoff along the river channel affected by tides considering the annual average discharge could represent dominant discharge in river channel then when the discharge into tidal river channel keep annual average value the longitudinal maximum ebb tide discharge qemax could represent dominant discharge in tidal channel in this study we used mike 21 to calculate the tidal range of each reach when flow at datong station is the annual average flow ca 30000 m3 s specificllly the tidal ranges between 0 m at reach 1 and 3 5 m at reach 21 we then calculated the qemax of each reach and defined qemax as the dominant discharge of each reach results showed that qemax gradually increased from 30000 m3 s at reach 1 to 40000 m3 s at reach 16 and then abruptly increased reaching 78000 m3 s at reach 21 fig 5 a the concurrent increase of longitudinal tidal range and qemax revealed that tidal range change caused increase of maximum ebb tide discharge on the other hand the proportion of ebb flow duration in a complete tidal cycle was 1 0 at reach 16 decreasing to 0 62 at reach 21 which indicates that the hydraulic regime abruptly changed from ebb unidirectional flow to ebb flood bidirectional flow at reach 16 fig 5a regression analysis shows that channel width and cross section area are both significantly positively correlated with qemax as their regression coefficients all exceed 0 7 fig 5b 5c this shows that the distribution of channel width and cross section area are essentially dominated by qemax change along the yrtr however the dynamics of the longitudinal change in channel depth cannot be simply related to qemax as the channel depth does not increase consistently downstream but abruptly begins to decrease at reach 16 regression analysis also shows that channel depth is positively related to qemax from reach 1 to reach 16 but is negatively related to qemax downstream from reach 16 fig 5d the question then is what factor other than qemax causes the abrupt change in channel depth at reach 16 overall consideration where the hydraulic regime from unidirectional flow to bidirectional flow at reach 16 neither channel width nor cross section area has abrupt change but channel depth has the abrupt change from increase trend to decrease trend fig 5 therefore we contend that the hydraulic regime shift from unidirectional flow to bidirectional flow is the dominating factor causing channel depth to change abruptly fig 5a on the other hand the dem of the yrtr showed that upstream of reach 16 there are some low relief hills mostly less than 200 m which limit any increase in channel width resulting in the observed increase in channel depth in fig 3c below reach 16 the channel abruptly enters the alluvial plain where the elevation is mainly below 5 m here the channel width increases allowing the channel depth to be reduced fig 1b to sum up above reach 16 qemax increases downstream the ebb has a unidirectional flow regime and the constraint caused by the low hills that border the channel together cause channel width cross section area and depth to increase only gradually below reach 16 the downstream increase in qemax causes the increase in channel width and cross section area but the bidirectional flow regime and lack of restraint on channel widening allows the depth to decrease given above considerations we think the changes of tide and landforms together shape the distribution of the gradual and the abrupt changes in channel forms 4 2 relationships between dams sediment supply and deposition erosion in the past the most significant change of sediment regime was shifted from deposition to erosion in the yrtr channel fig 4 specifically the deposited sediment is quickly eroded in downstream tidal reach this trend is taken as a new example of dams induced effects in the upper river basin other large rivers such as the hudson and mississippi have experienced deposition in their tidal reaches following the construction of dams in their basins ralston and geyer 2017 wang and xu 2018 some previous studies also found such sedimentary transformation in the yrtr and also discussed the effect of the three gorge dam on such transformation zheng et al 2018a zheng et al 2018b yuan et al 2020a but they did not produce quantitative relationships between catchment dams the sediment decline and riverbed deformation in the yrtr in this study we attempt to quantify the effects of dams on riverbed transformation in the yrtr currently there are 1170 large dams each with a capacity greater than one million m3 in the yangtze river basin fig 1a the total capacity of the dammed reservoirs in the basin has increased from 22 0 billion m3 in 1970 to 64 8 billion m3 in 2000 and 195 0 billion m3 in 2015 fig 6 a over the same period the sediment flux into the yrtr declined from an annual average of 490 mt in 1955 1970 to 390 mt in 1971 2000 and then further declined to 200 mt in 2001 2015 although the annual discharge at datong had no obvious trend over the period 1959 2013 fig 6b the annual decrease of sediment flux in the yrtr is strongly negatively correlated with the annual increase in total reservoir capacity in the river basin fig 6c this indicates that an increase of one billion m3 of reservoir capacity in the yangtze river basin leads to a decrease of 2 26 million tons of sediment supply into the yrtr per year the relationship further reveals that dam interception dominates the decrease of sediment flux into the yrtr fig 6c this sediment interception due to dam closure leads to river degradation downstream according to the hydrological data record the sediment discharge sd difference value between average sediment discharge in 1959 1970 and that in other period increased from 13 6 mt month in 1971 2002 to 25 6 mt month in 2001 2013 thus the sediment discharge sn approximately doubled over the 1971 2013 period fig 6d the sd increase made erosion the dominant process in 1959 2013 thus favouring river degradation and the sd surplus is essentially attributed to dam closures yang et al 2003 syvitski et al 2009 milliman and farnsworth 2011 luan et al 2016 chen et al 2020 further regression analysis shows that annual deposition erosion volume in the yrtr is directly positively correlated with annual sediment supply at datong dt and the slope of the regression line and the coefficient of determination were 0 57 and 0 99 this result indicates a decrease of one mt of sediment supply into the yrtr could cause the riverbed to be scoured of 0 57 million m3 0 68 mt of sediment which is then supplied to the estuary fig 6e furthermore the correlations of deformation in each reach with sediment supply at dt and the results show deformations in 71 reaches 15 21 were significantly related to sediment supply decrease at dt with the relationship coefficients all more than 0 5 fig 6f all in all the dorp in the sediment supply is likely to have impacted on the geomorphology of the yrtr channel these relationships provide quantitative measures of the effect of catchment dams on the terminal tidal river channel deformation that is each increased of one billion m3 of reservoir capacity in the catchment decreased the sediment supply into the tidal river by 2 26 mt per year then caused the yrtr channel bed to be scoured and supplied 1 54 mt per year of sediment into the estuary there are many methods to perform a regression in the study we used the empirical linear regression equation to predict sediment flux change related to channel evolutionary trends proved to be especially suitable for channel features leopold and maddock 1953 despite its simple framework the method resulted in reaching high regression coefficients greater than 0 8 4 3 effect of reservoir interception on erosion of branch channels and flood plains the other impressive change observed here was in the flood plains and branch channels where deposition shifted to erosion and where erosion was stronger than in the trunk channel of the yrtr fig 4 these relationships confirm that reservoir interception essentially dominated the yrtr channel sediment transformation from deposition to erosion in this study we used the mike 21 model try to find out the reason for the accelerated erosion of the branch and flood plains because we hypothesize that such erosion acceleration in the shallow water areas should be closely related to water and sediment adjustments induced by upstream dams it is well known that catchment dams significantly intercept water and sediment and bring obvious changes in the downstream behavior of water and sediment yang et al 2015 yuan et al 2012 our statistical analyses found that while dam adjustment induced sediment flux decline in all seasons in 1959 2013 the percentage sediment flux in the dry season increased by 10 21 whereas that of flood season decreased by 10 21 at the same time the discharge in spring increased 3801 m3 s 3 94 and in summer decreased 2820 m3 s 1 18 table 1 considering such adjustments especially the obvious increases of the percentage of discharge and sediment in the spring season we argue that the acceleration of erosion in shallow water is induced by water and sediment adjustments especially in the spring season the mike model results showed that the increase in discharge in the dry season induced hydrodynamic accelerations in the shallow water areas during the period the discharge increased from 15800 m3 s to 19500 m3 s δ 3700 m3 s fig 7 a the water diversion rate in the branch of bifurcated reaches all showed an accelerated increase in the range 0 84 29 2 with an average of 10 29 fig 7b this indicates the discharge of branch channels on average increased ca 10 when discharge increased 3801 m3 s in the spring season in 2000 2013 compared with 1959 1970 on the other hand with accelerated discharge increases in channel branches the runoff velocities in different areas all increased in the spring season and the velocity increase rates in flood plains and branch channels were obviously greater than that in the trunk channel the velocity increase rates in flood plains and branch channels were 1 3 8 0 times 3 9 average times and 1 1 6 0 times 2 5 average times respectively more than that in trunk channels fig 7c that shows that the flow velocities in flood plains and branch channels on average increased 2 9 and 2 5 times more than that in trunk channels when dt runoff increased to 3800 m3 s in the spring season the increases of discharge and velocities accelerated the erosion of branches and flood plains in past decades especially after the construction of the three gorges dam although traditional theories of riverbed evolution argue that the dominant discharge in the flood season is the most significant hydrodynamic to shape channel form pickup and warner 1976 carling 1988 czech et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 this study found the increase of discharge in the dry season caused by dam operations have more and more effects on channel evolution the discharge increase prompts erosion acceleration in shallow water areas such as flood plains and branch channels 4 4 model limitations the present approach was able to capture some of the morphodynamic processes occurring at the mouth of the yangtze river after dam closure clearly the evolution of the yangtze river tidal reach depends also on other factors that were not included in this framework we briefly recall here these effects first of all although it is generally believed that the average sea level has risen by 0 158 m in the past hundred years ipcc ar6 https www ipcc ch report ar6 wg1 some new researches found accelerating sea level rise were likely to increase the trapping ratio of the sediment in the yangtze river estuary yuan et al 2020b and resulted in more sediment supply from subaqueous delta to the estuary and the delta continued their deposition and expansion yang et al 2021 that means the sea level rise in fact have not caused to erosion in the yrtr in recent decades second bank revetment activities in middle and low reach of the yangtze river some studies found the levee construction and bank revetment would contribute to the channel erosion li et al 2007 yao et al 2012 5 conclusions the yangtze river tidal reach is one of the largest interaction zones between continent and ocean owing to its length 640 km and the population 150 million living there given the natural and human induced effects on the system the evolution of channel forms shows three characteristics the natural increase of maximum ebb tide discharge dominated channel width and cross section area increase along the channel however the unidirectional ebb flow changes to bidirectional ebb flood flows and abrupt change in landform from low hills to alluvial plain caused an abrupt change in channel depth from increasing to decreasing at reach 16 fig 8 see ① process the founding innovatively illustrated the flow regime shift from ebb to ebb flood caused the tidal channel longitudinal depth abrupt change from increase trend to decrease trend such abrupt change are widely found in tidal estuaries the construction of dams in the catchment dominated the decline in sediment supply into the yrtr leading to a change from deposition to erosion fig 8 see ② process the founding furtherly quantified the relationship between sediment transition from deposition to erosion in tidal channel and sediment impoundment in catchment reservoirs the increase of discharge in the spring season adjusted by dams and the increase of hydrodynamics led ultimately to accelerated erosion of the branches and flood plains in past decades fig 8 see ③ process the founding innovatively demonstrated the contribution of discharge increase in dry season on the erosion of the tidal channel the above patterns are different from previous knowledge of tidal channel morphodynamic we think above patterns from the case study of yrtr are with general application to other river system due to the physical mechanisms of tidal channel evolution related to upstream adjustment by reservoirs are similar however this study is still limited in quantifying the different contribution of sediment decrease and discharge decrease on the channel erosion such problem should be improved in future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

3793,a quarter of the world s population uses groundwater from karst aquifers a range of emerging organic contaminants eocs are considered a potential threat to water resources and dependant ecosystems and karst aquifers are the most vulnerable groundwater systems to anthropogenic pollution this paper provides the first global compilation based on 50 studies of eocs in karst aquifers and explores eoc occurrence and the use of eocs to understand karst systems of the 144 compounds detected in the reviewed studies the vast majority in karst groundwater are pharmaceuticals and pesticides maximum concentrations of compounds varied over five orders of magnitude and nearly half of the detected compounds exceed 100 ng l karst groundwater is shown to have lower frequency of detection and lower concentrations compared to surface waters and local shallow intergranular aquifers but overall higher concentrations compared to other major aquifer types a growing number of studies have demonstrated the utility of eocs and some legacy compounds for groundwater quality assessment and as tracers for characterising karst systems they can improve understanding of vulnerability storage attenuation mechanisms and in some cases have been used to assist with catchment delineation this is a growing research area for karst hydrogeology and more research is needed to understand eoc contamination of karst aquifers and to develop eocs as tracers within karst to improve our understanding of this critical water resource keywords emerging organic contaminants karst groundwater vulnerability aquifer characterisation tracers 1 introduction emerging organic contaminants eocs are anthropogenic chemicals e g pharmaceuticals personal care products and lifestyle compounds pcp ls pesticide compounds and per and polyfluoroalkyls that have been detected in the environment due to advances in analytical techniques muter and bartkevics 2020 richardson and kimura 2020 schmidt 2018 and for which there are growing concerns regarding their potential harmful impact on the environment however most eocs are not regulated in the environment or routinely monitored in groundwater lapworth et al 2019 their properties environmental behaviour and toxicological effects are still poorly understood brack 2012 halden 2015 kurwadkar 2014 lapworth et al 2019 norman 2019 pal et al 2014 petrie et al 2015 poynton and vulpe 2009 sauvé and mélanie 2014 schriks et al 2010 stuart et al 2012 thomaidi et al 2015 there are 30 000 to 70 000 registered chemicals in daily used products schwarzenbach et al 2006 and about 4000 new chemicals are registered every day dulio et al 2018 there are many newly emerging substances present in the environment which may have adverse impacts on human health and ecosystems for which limited occurrence data are available bolong et al 2009 brack et al 2015 brion et al 2019 freeling et al 2019 gavrilescu et al 2015 geissen et al 2015 legradi et al 2018 lindsey et al 2001 stefanakis and becker 2016 micro plastics are also a potentially important emerging organic contaminant group in groundwater this topic was recently reviewed by re 2019 and broader reviews by wong et al 2020 and stock et al 2020 groundwater is a vital global water resource and is under increasing pressure from contamination due to anthropogenic activities collet et al 2015 gleeson et al 2012 lapworth et al 2017 lukač reberski et al 2019 simonffy 2012 taylor et al 2012 groundwater is generally less vulnerable to contamination by eocs than surface water white et al 2019 but trace concentrations of many pollutants including eocs are still commonly detected in groundwater cabeza et al 2012 lapworth et al 2012 2019 lopez et al 2015 moreau et al 2019 moreover some substances present in groundwater are persistent and difficult to treat many studies of eocs in aquatic environments have been undertaken for wastewater ww effluents bueno et al 2012 petrović et al 2003 and surface waters houtman 2010 loos et al 2009 matamoros et al 2012 fewer studies have been undertaken for groundwater bexfield et al 2019 lapworth et al 2012 loos et al 2010 sanchez vila et al 2015 stuart et al 2012 sui et al 2015 karst aquifers are a particularly important source of groundwater with approximately 14 of the earth s land surface covered by karst bgr et al 2017 and 25 of the global population completely or partially dependent on drinking water from karst aquifers chen et al 2017 hartmann et al 2014 compared to other rock types karst aquifers are especially vulnerable to pollution due to direct infiltration via stream sinks shafts and caves ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 groundwater flow can be rapid over long distances as shown by the median velocity of 1940 m d from 3015 karst tracer tests between stream sinks and springs from 34 countries with 595 over distances of 10 km worthington and ford 2009 it might therefore be expected that karst aquifers are more impacted by eocs than some other aquifer types there have been some previous studies that have reviewed eocs in karst aquifers notably mahler and musgrove 2019 provide a very useful introduction to different types of emerging contaminants pharmaceuticals personal care products and hormones flame retardants perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl compounds nanoparticles and microplastics together with an overview of studies that have detected these different types of emerging contaminants in karst groundwater they highlight the vulnerability of the edwards aquifer in texas to pollution from emerging contaminants and recommend future work to investigate this padilla and vesper 2018 provide a comprehensive review of contaminant transport processes and modelling approaches within karst aquifers with a focus on the transport of both legacy and emerging contaminants phthalates the initial objective of this paper is to provide the first compilation of eoc data from previous studies of eocs in karst aquifers and review how the types and concentrations of eocs present compare to their occurrence in surface water and other types of groundwater system in the second part of the paper we review how eocs can assist with karst hydrogeological characterisation for example through contributing to understanding of aquifer vulnerability and rapid groundwater flow identifying connecting with wastewater identifying pollutant sources delineating catchments and investigating contaminant attenuation mechanisms 2 methods an extensive literature search was undertaken using google scholar web of science sciencedirect researchgate and microsoft academic supplementary material figure s1 10 000 published papers relating to groundwater and eocs were identified covering a range of topics and groups of eocs fig 1 using the following key word combinations karst groundwater contaminants of emerging concern pcp ls industrials emerging pollutants pharmaceuticals emerging organic contaminants the review and searches were limited to dissolved organic compounds nano materials and micro plastics were not considered in this paper as there are very few studies on these new types of contaminants in karst systems e g panno et al 2019 and their fate and behaviour in groundwater may be quite different compared to dissolved compounds see re 2019 the literature search was also limited to english publications several hundred papers were initially evaluated based on a brief survey of titles key words and abstracts of which 50 publications related specifically to karst aquifers and containing eoc occurrence data were selected and form the basis of this review in previous research on emerging organic contaminants different authors include different ranges of compounds and classified them differently lapworth et al 2012 mahler and musgrove 2019 zhao et al 2018 bunting et al 2021 this is partly because the status of a compound as emerging is regionally dependant and may change with time thus newer studies may include compounds that were classified as emerging many years ago however there are also a wide range of compounds that are routinely measured as part of the analysis suite for emerging contaminants even though some of these compounds have been around for a long time and would not be defined as emerging this may be partly because some types of emerging contaminant classes include both new and legacy compounds e g some pesticides and the analytical suites e g lc ms ms used to look for these compounds include both legacy and more recently added compounds such as pharmaceuticals new compounds are being manufactured and utilised all the time the eocs of today will be legacy contaminants in the future in some countries compounds suspected of harmful health impacts are put on the watch list and are monitored for several years after which they are either transferred to the priority list or removed from that list european commission directive 2006 118 ec lapworth et al 2019 https www epa gov dwucmr 2021 another challenge is the differences in legislation in different countries when regulated microorganics are not regulated globally but at the country and sometimes regional level in the eu pesticides are regulated both as an entire group and on an individual basis in some cases wfd 2006 118 ce annex i however there are many other parts of the world where this is not the case for example atrazine widely considered a legacy compound in europe is regulated in only 28 of the 104 countries that belong to the world health organisation who 2018 and is not banned from use in parts of north america given the focus of this study is a global data compilation we have used the current who guidelines who 2018 as the benchmark for defining if a contaminant is emerging or not all compounds with a who guideline value or deemed not to need a limit because concentrations found in groundwater are too low to be considered a health concern are excluded from the data compilation part of this paper all degradation compounds of pesticides are considered eocs some former eocs e g atrazine are discussed in the second part of the paper in relation to the review of the applications of eocs in karst hydrogeology for the data compilation eocs were divided into four broader groups pharmaceuticals comprising hormones human and animal drugs personal care products and lifestyle compounds pcp ls comprising fragrances cosmetics artificial sweeteners stimulants and their metabolites industrial compounds comprising flame retardants and plasticisers and agricultural products comprising pesticides herbicides fungicides algicides and their metabolites some of the compounds have multiple uses in which case they are classified according to the most common use the list of compounds is in the supplementary material table s1 maximum concentrations of compounds are used in the data presentation as this was the only parameter that was consistently available from the studies reviewed there are limitations to this approach due to the presence of outliers but we were not able to use a more suitable measures such as the 90th or 95th percentile due to limited reporting in the reviewed literature and lack of access to the raw data from the majority of studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of eocs in karst aquifers the 50 publications of eocs in karst were from studies in 21 countries fig 2 in some countries more research has been done sometimes in the same location e g germany and in some countries extensive regional monitoring has been carried out in many locations e g usa uk france china most studies have been carried out in europe and the usa with few or no studies in many other parts of the world the different types of karst covered by the investigations of eocs included in this study differ significantly in age and degree of karstification they range chronostratigraphically from the older karst of palaeozoic age characterised by low matrix porosity to younger cenozoic karst with high matrix porosity comparative hydrological characteristics of some of the springs or karst regions they belong to can be found in the wokas database olarinoye et al 2020 despite the relatively small number of studies in karst areas they provide key insights into patterns of eocs in karst aquifers and have been used for a wide range of applications table 1 many other studies e g d alessio and ray 2016 dong et al 2018 gavrilescu et al 2015 lopez et al 2015 meffe and de bustamante 2014 moreau et al 2019 murray et al 2010 postigo and barceló 2015 sampled eocs from karst but karst samples were not distinguishable from other lithologies and they are therefore not included in table 1 a total of 144 compounds from different groups of contaminants were identified in studies of karst aquifers data are available in supplementary material most were pharmaceutical and pesticide compounds used in agriculture with fewer industrial compounds and personal care products and lifestyle compounds detected table 1 fig 3 carbamazepine anticonvulsant and caffeine stimulant were the most frequently detected compounds whilst many compounds were detected in just a single study see supplementary material table s1 most studies aimed to determine the occurrence type and concentrations of emerging contaminants however the number of sample locations and sample frequencies and the number type and group of analysed compounds for particular investigations varied greatly between studies the way the results of the analyses were reported varied as well some studies reported medians some mean values thus maximum concentrations were used for comparison as the only data available in all studies this review highlights the need to report high percentiles such as the 95th percentile and for studies to make the full set of results available so that these can be calculated as these would help to avoid the issue of small numbers of outliers skewing results maximum concentrations of compounds varied over 5 orders of magnitude fig 4 and nearly half of the detected compounds exceed 100 ng l the current eu drinking water limit for individual pesticides many of the highest concentrations were industrial compounds fig 4 although the highest concentration was of the antibiotic sulphanilamide 6 5 108 ng l not included in fig 4 to retain the clarity of the figure which was detected in the chalk aquifer beneath a chemical plant in the uk bennett et al 2017 bisphenol a bpa paracetamol and 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam are among the top 20 compounds in terms of both concentration and detection frequency and hence indicate the greatest risk to karst aquatic ecosystem individual compounds in karst aquifers are typically found in concentrations that are considered too low by several orders of magnitude to cause acute toxicity effects e g costanzo et al 2007 kim et al 2009 nunes et al 2005 in exceptional circumstances detections in relation to some point sources can lead to high concentrations in groundwater that approach or exceed acute toxicity thresholds e g bennett et al 2017 one recent study by geiger et al 2016 found that mixtures of pharmaceuticals were more toxic to algae inhibiting algal growth than single compounds however the concentrations used are not representative of typical environmental concentrations and further work is needed using more realistic concentrations which reflect environmental exposure by organisms there is little information on the impact of mixtures of eocs on chronic responses in organisms but some studies have shown chronic exposure effects are predicted at levels found in karst groundwater in this review e g berninger and brooks 2010 in fig 5 maximum concentrations of eocs in karst aquifers are compared with values found in a range of aquifers globally lapworth et al 2012 and surface waters in europe loos et al 2009 maximum concentrations depend upon the presence and nature of contaminant sources within the catchment which was not assessed in this literature review however maximum concentrations appear lower in karst groundwater compared to other aquifer types for carbamazepine caffeine ibuprofen nonylphenol hormones but are higher for sucralose metoprolol tetracycline and are comparable for paracetamol oxazepam and 1h benzotriazole fig 5 while overall maximum concentrations appear lower in karst groundwater nearly 25 of compounds had comparable or greater maximum concentrations in karst compared to other aquifers fig 5 maximum concentrations reported in lapworth et al 2012 were often from shallow alluvial aquifers and as such represent highly vulnerable groundwater systems that are often at least periodically in hydraulic continuity with surface waters and hence may have high concentrations of microorganic contamination much like karst systems mcmanus et al 2017 found significant differences and a lower detection frequency in fractured karstified limestones compared to overlying shallower intergranular aquifers but showed that many of the substances reached the deeper karst aquifers as well e g pesticides and their metabolites extensive national monitoring of hormones and pharmaceuticals conducted in the united states bexfield et al 2019 showed that at least one compound was detected to a greater extent in samples from carbonate rocks 26 compared to non carbonate rock rocks 19 but concentrations and frequency of detections of most compounds were higher in non carbonate rocks results from a large national study in england and wales manamsa et al 2016b showed that chalk and jurassic limestone carbonate aquifers with some karstification had higher maximum concentrations for most microorganic contaminants including eocs compared to other important aquifer types e g permo triassic sandstone and greensand the percentage frequency of detections for the different aquifer types varied depending on the compound but was overall comparable for the karst and sandstone aquifers and was typically below 5 manamsa et al 2016b comparing the results of two investigations of karst groundwater with surface water detection frequency and concentrations of all detected ppcps were higher in surface water compared to karst groundwater except for fenofibrate zemann et al 2015 and acesulfame k doummar and aoun 2018b it appears that eocs may have a lower frequency of detection and lower concentrations in karst groundwater compared to surface waters and local shallow intergranular aquifers but higher concentrations than other major aquifer types such as sandstones and other unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers however systematic sampling studies are needed to confirm more conclusively how eoc occurrence in karst groundwater compares to surface waters and other aquifers and in all springs abstractions the occurrence and magnitude of eoc contamination will vary substantially depending on the type of catchment and pollution sources found within them and timing of sampling the flow characteristics of spring sources it is clear that karst is highly vulnerable to eoc contamination with potentially serious impacts on both drinking water supplies and karst dependent ecosystems however the limited number of studies undertaken in karst globally currently restricts our understanding of the extent of pollution from eocs in this vulnerable setting 3 2 applications of eocs in karst hydrogeology the increasing number and presence of eocs in groundwater present many challenges due to the detrimental impacts on the quality of water used for supply and which sustains rivers and ecosystems however eocs can also provide information to assist with karst hydrogeological studies in this section the use of these compounds in karst hydrogeological studies are considered with a summary of the applications in table 3 understanding the degradation properties of eocs is a prerequisite for their use in aquifer characterisation and therefore in this section studies on the degradation properties of compounds are reviewed section 3 2 1 the use of eocs in characterising vulnerability is then discussed section 3 2 2 followed by the use of eocs for identifying longer term storage section 3 2 3 eocs have also been used to investigate attenuation mechanisms within karst aquifers and these studies are discussed in section 3 2 4 the final section 3 2 5 discusses the use of eocs as a tool for better defining catchment areas 3 2 1 degradation properties of eocs the presence of rapidly degrading compounds is a useful indicator of rapid groundwater flow and vulnerabilty studies of compound degradation are summarized in table 2 caffeine has been observed to degrade relatively rapidly with half lives of less than 104 h dvory et al 2018b hillebrand et al 2012a hillebrand et al 2015 table 2 and an estimate of 12 days for degradation in a lake buerge et al 2003 however hillebrand et al 2012b suggested wastewater leakage and the subsurface redox condition may have contributed to the high biodegradation of caffeine that they observed and longer degradation times of 30 to 69 days have been estimated for caffeine in intergranular aquifers gonçalves et al 2017 koroša et al 2020 other compounds have also been found to have high degradation rates a study of the uk chalk aquifer beneath a pharmaceutical factory found sulfanilamide concentrations decreased from 650 to 10 mg l over a distance of about 500 m 56 of this reduction was attributed to biodegradation processes and 42 to processes within the aquifer such as dilution and dispersion bennett et al 2017 some papers suggested biodegradation as the main cause of decreasing concentrations of caffeine in groundwater dvory et al 2018b and hillebrand et al 2015 heinz et al 2009 suggest the same process for plasticizers flame retardants and ppcps some studies have suggested that nonchlorinated organophosphates degrade more rapidly than chlorinated ones andresen et al 2004 heinz et al 2009 meyer and bester 2004 and that substances with higher octanol water partition coefficient kow values have higher degradation some compounds such as carbamazepine table 2 and atrazine hillebrand et al 2014 morasch 2013 schiperski et al 2015 are more resistant to degradation atrazine has been found in karst aquifers many years after it was banned in europe chen et al 2019 lapworth and gooddy 2006 persistence in karst aquifers was also evident for a range of eocs acesulfame doummar and aoun 2018b zirlewagen et al 2016 phthalates padilla and vesper 2018 sucralose gemfibrozil iohexol doummar and aoun 2018b primidone tamoxifen and analgesic phenazone which had a particularly high detection frequency even though it has not recently been prescribed in significant quantities reh et al 2013 overall it appears that eocs have very variable degradation properties eoc compounds like caffeine ibuprofen atenolol which degrade more rapidly in groundwater hillebrand et al 2012b hillebrand et al 2015 reh et al 2013 could be used as evidence of rapid groundwater flow and high vulnerability in contrast others e g carbamazepine acesulfame and the former eoc atrazine are more persistent however the degradation properties of eocs are still poorly understood and the extent to which observations reflect degradation or other attenuation processes such as sorption and dilution is often unclear and there have been few laboratory studies of eoc properties further work on the properties of current and former eocs would be very useful to improve understanding of their persistence in groundwater in addition the degradation products of eocs can potentially be as toxic and persistent as parent compounds and this topic has also received little attention 3 2 2 investigating vulnerability using eocs a useful potential application of eocs in karst hydrogeology is for assessing the vulnerability of a spring or abstraction in karst aquifers indicators such as rapidly fluctuating spring discharge butscher and huggenberger 2008 high turbidity fournier et al 2006 or high coliforms mahler et al 2000 are used as evidence that springs or abstractions have high vulnerability eocs provide further evidence of vulnerability if rapidly degrading compounds are present indicating rapid groundwater flow and low residence times where particularly high concentrations of eoc compounds are present meffe and de bustamante 2014 or where there are a wide range of different types of eoc compounds there are examples of studies that have demonstrated high vulnerability using eocs high vulnerability from fast flow events in a karst aquifer with a leaking sewage pipe was identified using carbamazepine and caffeine by dvory et al 2018a sorenson et al 2015 found that deep groundwater in a karst aquifer was more vulnerable than previously thought clay rich superficials were thought to provide significant groundwater protection to the karst aquifer but high concentrations of deet with more than a five fold increase after the wet season showed that contaminants can transit rapidly from the surface to the bedrock aquifer in some cases eocs have been used in conjunction with other parameters for vulnerability assessment for example doummar and aoun 2018b found that the mass flux of turbidity and chlorides were strongly correlated with those of the two artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame k schiperski et al 2015 obtained good correlations between atrazine metazachlor cyclamate and sec and turbidity in hysteresis plots although the presence of eocs can indicate rapid groundwater flow and high vulnerability the absence of eocs does not necessarily indicate low vulnerability if there are limited sources of eoc contaminants in the catchment the large numbers of eoc compounds that can be measured including some that indicate short residence times are clearly useful as indicators of vulnerability these are best used in conjunction with other evidence such as turbidity coliforms and discharge variability and a good understanding of the land use in the catchment to enable assessment of the likely contaminant loads that could impact the spring or abstraction 3 2 3 identification of longer term storage in karst karst aquifers have extremely high hydraulic conductivities and generally have large components of short residence time groundwater ford and williams 2007 nevertheless even in highly karstified aquifers there may be a substantial component of longer term storage ford and williams 2007 atkinson 1977 smart and friederich 1986 understanding longer term storage in karst aquifers is an important component of aquifer characterisation and eocs could contribute to this understanding in some locations banned substances such as atrazine can provide evidence that karst aquifers could have significant contaminant storage and or longer residence time pathways einsiedl et al 2010 hillebrand et al 2014 reh et al 2013 schiperski et al 2015 zirlewagen et al 2016 for example even though atrazine was prohibited in europe 20 years ago it is still widely detected in karst aquifers hertzman 2017 iker et al 2010 lapworth and gooddy 2006 morasch 2013 it has been suggested that this is because atrazine is stored and persists in the matrix which slowly leaks into the fracture and conduit flow system hillebrand et al 2014 morasch 2013 schiperski et al 2015 atrazine and its metabolites have been detected at ng l μg l concentrations in a range of karst studies and it appears that it may pose a continued risk to humans and microbiological communities long after it has been banned from use huang et al 2019 qin et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 in other cases the start date for the use of a particular eoc such as artificial sugars or pharmaceuticals can be obtained for a particular country or region and may help constrain the residence time of the groundwater system under investigation zemann et al 2015 found the most frequently detected compounds in karst groundwater samples were two standard substances used in x ray diagnostics diatrizoic acid da whose use has been significantly reduced since 2008 and iopamidol ip which is the usual replacement for da during this five year investigation da was detected only a few times in wastewater and ip occurred more commonly in wastewater and groundwater suggesting a more recent wastewater input to groundwater the low but continuous da concentrations in groundwater suggest that there is also a longer term storage component with the residual concentrations of da in the matrix of the unsaturated zone being slowly being released into the more permeable parts of the karst system solutional fractures and conduits 3 2 4 attenuation mechanisms in karst aquifers within aquifers a range of processes such as dilution dispersion diffusion and sorption are important for controlling natural attenuation conduit rich karst is generally thought to have poor attenuation capabilities due to rapid and focussed groundwater inputs via streams sinks and rapid groundwater flow which can exceed a velocity of 30 km d petrič et al 2020 and because they are oligotrophic gibert et al 1994 hirsch 1986 however even in highly karstified aquifers contaminants can be attenuated studies of eocs have contributed to understanding of attenuation mechanisms einsiedl et al 2010 hillebrand et al 2012b zemann et al 2015 in particular studies have considered attenuation via diffusion between different void types e g conduits fissures and fractures dvory et al 2018a 2018b einsiedl et al 2010 other studies have indirectly provided information on attenuation processes bekele et al 2009 doummar and aoun 2018b heinz et al 2009 hillebrand et al 2012b 2015 katz et al 2010 reh et al 2013 zemann et al 2015 einsiedl et al 2010 used two pharmaceuticals diclofenac and ibuprofen from wastewater effluents in springs to compliment modelling and tracer testing studies of attenuation they concluded that contaminant transport is significantly influenced by diffusion between the mobile fracture flow component of the aquifer and groundwater in the matrix dvory et al 2018a investigated attenuation processes by simulating carbamazepine transport in the saturated and unsaturated zones of a karst aquifer to investigate processes during fast flow events and baseflow the modeling results suggested low solute exchange and less diffusion of contaminant into the matrix during fast flow events with more carbamazepine reaching the saturated zone from the unsaturated zone in contrast during low flow conditions high storage in the porous matrix of the unsaturated zone was thought to provide a continuous supply of carbamazepine to the saturated zone 3 2 5 identifying pollutant sources eocs can help identify the origin of pollution stuart et al 2014 kiefer et al 2021 unlike many conventional indicators e g inorganic ions electrical conductivity they do not have natural background concentrations some eocs also have a unique source type which makes them particularly useful source specific indicators when used in combination with other tracers and tools they may provide useful insights into the sources of pollution in the catchment eocs are particularly useful for identifying connectivity with wastewater and the compounds that have been most useful for this are discussed in section 3 2 5 1 their use for identification of other pollutant sources are discussed in section 3 2 5 2 3 2 5 1 identifying connectivity with wastewater effluents wastewater ww poses a major risk to groundwater especially in vulnerable karst areas eocs have been successfully used to provide information on how effective ww treatments are and detect pollution incidents and specific indicators are reviewed below carbamazepine several studies have shown that carbamazepine is a conservative indicator for both treated and untreated wastewater clara et al 2004 dvory et al 2018b fenz et al 2005 gasser et al 2010 however carbamazepine concentrations in effluent are often relatively low and therefore may be a poor indicator where only small quantities of ww are discharged into highly diluting systems hillebrand et al 2012a caffeine and its metabolites many surface water investigations found caffeine to be a good ww indicator buerge et al 2003 2006 edwards et al 2015 gonçalves et al 2017 caffeine has also been used as a ww indicator in karst groundwater systems caffeine degrades in groundwater section 3 2 1 and is not a good indicator in systems with long transit times but can determine recent ww inputs hillebrand et al 2012a it is especially useful where carbamazepine concentrations are low dvory et al 2018b because ww can contain caffeine concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than carbamazepine miao et al 2005 in one study a positive correlation of caffeine with its predominantly human metabolite paraxanthine suggested a connection with domestic ww hillebrand et al 2012a while in another it has been used as an indicator of the impact of tourism on water quality in an area of the yucatan leal bautista et al 2011 hillebrand et al 2012b used caffeine concentrations in spring water and untreated ww water consumption rates and spring discharge data to calculate that the average amount of domestic ww discharging at a karst spring was approximately 0 4 of the total amount of ww within the spring catchment this is a relatively low fraction compared to those calculated by rutsch et al 2006 for other catchments which were found to be in the range of 1 13 doummar and aoun 2018a suggested that compounds more resistant to high degradation would be more suitable for estimating exfiltration rates of ww into the environment using a mixing model based on chloride mass fluxes they defined exfiltration rates in a karst catchment of 0 7 4 in low to medium flow and 5 10 at high flow cyclamate cyclamate cyc could be used as a tracer of raw ww sources zirlewagen et al 2016 it has similar concentrations in ww to caffeine and was shown to be a more sensitive indicator for untreated ww than caffeine because it is less degradable however its detection does not necessarily indicate a recent input of ww to karst systems and therefore the combined use of caffeine and cyclamate may be useful hillebrand et al 2015 zirlewagen et al 2016 suggested using the ratio of cyclamate and another much more persistent artificial sweetener acesulfame ace as indicator for raw wastewater as it is not affected by uncertainties associated with dilution the high cyc ace ratio indicates fresh inputs of untreated ww in the same investigation concentration curves of cyclamate were similar to those of the faecal indicator bacteria suggesting that they had the same origin and that ww is the main source of bacterial pollution in the catchment other eoc tracers other eocs that have been shown to be good wastewater indicators are acesulfame k gemfibrozil iohexol doummar and aoun 2018a sucralose doummar and aoun 2018b deet caffeine metabolites theophylline triclosan and atenolol upton et al 2020 and chlorinated organophosphate tris 2 chloro 1 chloromethyl ethyl phosphate heinz et al 2009 acesulfame k gemfibrozil and iohexol may be indicators of domestic ww effluents or pollution from specific point sources such as poultry farms and hospitals doummar and aoun 2018a sucralose has a high detection limit of 100 μg l but it has still been detected and indicated the presence of wastewater in a karst groundwater system doummar and aoun 2018b there is inconclusive evidence on whether diclofenac is a good ww tracer reh et al 2013 suggested that diclofenac has high attenuation however einsiedl et al 2010 reported frequent detections of diclofenac which they attributed to high concentrations in treated ww effluent widespread long term use and low sorption properties ibuprofen was thought to be poor ww indicator in a study by einsiedl et al 2010 due to its low detection in karst samples despite its high concentrations in raw ww high biodegradation rates were suggested as the most likely explanation for this 3 2 5 2 identifying other sources of pollution eocs and other legacy microorganic pollutants also point to other non ww sources of pollution in karst i e agriculture chiffre et al 2016 dong et al 2018 hillebrand et al 2014 morasch 2013 reh et al 2013 or industrial activities dong et al 2018 reh et al 2013 separated different sources of pollutants using ternary diagrams of triazines atrazine and its degradation products dea and dia samples from agricultural areas had high fractions of dea whilst those from urban areas had a higher dia fraction chiffre et al 2016 detected pharmaceuticals at sample locations in rural sparsely populated areas not just downstream of ww treatment plant as expected but upstream as well a good example of the application of eocs as source specific indicators is the study where sources of groundwater nitrate pollution were identified by correlation with diatrizoic acid zemann et al 2015 it is well known that nitrate can reach groundwater from various sources such as sewage and agriculture however as diatrizoic acid had not been used in agriculture but is found in urban ww it was most likely that ww was the source of nitrate in the groundwater much like stuart et al 2014 and more recently keifer et al 2021 they identified pharmaceutical detection rates as a suitable tool for fingerprinting different sources of anthropogenic pollution 3 2 6 catchment delineation catchment delineation in karst can be challenging due to the high heterogeneity and changes in groundwater divides under different water level conditions many eocs have limited numbers of potential sources and the occurrence of specific eocs at a groundwater abstraction could indicate connectivity with a particular contaminant source and thereby demonstrate that it is in the catchment for example by intensive monitoring of micropollutants pharmaceuticals corrosion inhibitor pesticides morash 2013 found that the main source of the pollutants at two observed springs in a swiss karst catchment was a swallow hole draining an agricultural plain indicating that this site is within the spring catchment area in another example reh et al 2014 used detections of triazines to help with catchment delineation by distinguishing agricultural and urban pollutant sources while in areas with multiple potential sources and high levels of contamination it may be difficult to determine the exact source of a contaminant lapworth et al 2015 reh et al 2013 the use of statistical methods e g correlations clustering can help to determine pollutant sources and thus catchment areas dodgen et al 2017 huang et al 2019 stuart et al 2014 although by definition eocs are contaminants and should not be knowingly introduced to groundwater some newly measured compounds could have suitable properties for use as artificial tracers if they are non toxic artificial tracers should be conservative absent from but readily soluble in water easy to detect quantitatively inexpensive and easy to handle goldscheider and drew 2007 käss 1998 karst groundwater tracer tests have been conducted using caffeine and results were obtained hillebrand et al 2012b hillebrand et al 2015 caffeine is cheap but is degradable and present in the environment so is not an ideal tracer but it could possibly be useful for tracer tests to delineate catchments in small highly karstified areas in the case of known or low background concentrations 4 conclusions this paper reviewed 50 studies on eocs in karst from 21 countries eocs are clearly an important threat to karst groundwater quality which could impact drinking water sources rivers and other dependant ecosystems a total of 144 compounds were detected in spring and groundwater samples the most frequently detected compounds were pharmaceutical products as well as pesticides used in agriculture with fewer industrial compounds and personal care products and lifestyle compounds pcp ls detected carbamazepine and caffeine were the most frequently detected compounds whilst many compounds were detected in just a single study maximum concentrations of compounds varied over 5 orders of magnitude and nearly half of the detected compounds exceed 100 ng l the current eu drinking water limit for individual pesticides many of the highest concentrations were industrial compounds although the highest concentration was of the antibiotic sulphanilamide 6 5 108 ng l this review suggests that overall eocs may have a lower frequency of detection and lower concentrations in karst groundwater compared to surface waters and local shallow alluvial aquifers but higher concentrations compared to other major aquifer types such as sandstones this paper also reviews the use of eocs in karst hydrogeological studies eocs represent a potentially very large range of anthropogenically introduced tracers with a wide range of physical and chemical properties and different subsequent fate in karst the presence of rapidly degrading eocs e g caffeine can be an indicator of rapid groundwater flow and vulnerability and aquifer vulnerability is also indicated by high concentrations of eocs or a wide range of different eocs at a site in contrast persistent former eocs that are banned or no longer used e g atrazine diatrizoic acid can indicate a component of longer term storage in karst aquifers furthermore the transport of eocs in karst may help improve understanding of attenuation mechanisms for example exchange between the matrix fractures and larger conduits eocs are useful to identify sources of pollution in karst several eoc compounds have been shown to be good indicators of connectivity with wastewater more persistent compounds e g carbamazepine acesulfame can be used as indicators for both treated and untreated wastewater while readily degradable compounds e g caffeine cyclamate indicate more recent wastewater inputs some eocs also have a unique source which makes them particularly useful for source identification and catchment delineation 5 future outlook studies of eocs in karst are a fairly new area of research the relatively small number of studies 50 found in our review highlights the need for further research on eocs in karst aquifers to improve understanding of their impacts on karst environments and to develop their use for karst aquifer characterisation more studies employing more frequent monitoring are required to assess temporal changes particularly important for dynamic karst systems and more sensitive analytical methods are also required to improve assessments of eoc contamination the lack of data on microplastics in karst groundwaters is also an important area requiring future research the data compiled here are limited because the only parameter that was consistently reported in the studies reviewed was maximum concentration a collaborative project with a full analysis of all the eoc data in karst aquifers would be extremely useful to provide more robust conclusions on eocs in karst aquifers the relationships between eoc occurrence and other drivers of stress and the prevalence of anti microbial resistance should be further assessed in these highly vulnerable in many ways sentinel karst groundwaters systems given the role of karst as a host for a range of important stygofauna maurice et al 2016 it is also recommended that further research is done to assess the fate of hazardous eocs as well as their interaction and potential accumulation in dependant ecosystems within karst selected eocs are now beginning to be included more widely within some national monitoring plans glassmeyer et al 2017 bunting et al 2021 a recent example being the introduction of a groundwater watch list in europe lapworth et al 2019 however as this review has shown even in karst which are amongst the most vulnerable groundwater systems there are relatively few studies that have been undertaken on eocs there is a requirement for more research and monitoring of eocs in karst and a need for better prioritisation of screening for eocs in groundwater and dependant ecosystems e g gaston et al 2019 particularly given the importance of karst for drinking water supplies globally and its role as a unique and vulnerable ecosystem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

3793,a quarter of the world s population uses groundwater from karst aquifers a range of emerging organic contaminants eocs are considered a potential threat to water resources and dependant ecosystems and karst aquifers are the most vulnerable groundwater systems to anthropogenic pollution this paper provides the first global compilation based on 50 studies of eocs in karst aquifers and explores eoc occurrence and the use of eocs to understand karst systems of the 144 compounds detected in the reviewed studies the vast majority in karst groundwater are pharmaceuticals and pesticides maximum concentrations of compounds varied over five orders of magnitude and nearly half of the detected compounds exceed 100 ng l karst groundwater is shown to have lower frequency of detection and lower concentrations compared to surface waters and local shallow intergranular aquifers but overall higher concentrations compared to other major aquifer types a growing number of studies have demonstrated the utility of eocs and some legacy compounds for groundwater quality assessment and as tracers for characterising karst systems they can improve understanding of vulnerability storage attenuation mechanisms and in some cases have been used to assist with catchment delineation this is a growing research area for karst hydrogeology and more research is needed to understand eoc contamination of karst aquifers and to develop eocs as tracers within karst to improve our understanding of this critical water resource keywords emerging organic contaminants karst groundwater

pesticide compounds and per and polyfluoroalkyls that have been detected in the environment due to advances in analytical techniques muter and bartkevics 2020 richardson and kimura 2020 schmidt 2018 and for which there are growing concerns regarding their potential harmful impact on the environment however most eocs are not regulated in the environment or routinely monitored in groundwater

petrie et al 2015 poynton and vulpe 2009 sauvé and mélanie 2014 schriks et al 2010 stuart et al 2012 thomaidi et al 2015 there are 30 000 to 70 000 registered chemicals in daily used products schwarzenbach et al 2006 and about 4000 new chemicals are registered every day dulio et al 2018 there are many newly emerging substances present in the environment which may have adverse impacts on human health and ecosystems for which limited occurrence data are available bolong et al 2009 brack et al 2015 brion et al 2019 freeling et al 2019 gavrilescu et al 2015 geissen et al 2015 legradi et al 2018 lindsey et al 2001 stefanakis and becker 2016 micro plastics are also a potentially important emerging organic contaminant group in groundwater this topic was recently reviewed by re 2019 and broader reviews by wong et al 2020 and stock et al 2020 groundwater is a vital global water resource and is under increasing pressure from contamination due to anthropogenic activities collet et al 2015 gleeson et al 2012 lapworth et al 2017 lukač reberski et al 2019 simonffy 2012 taylor et al 2012 groundwater is generally less vulnerable to contamination by eocs than surface water white et al 2019 but trace concentrations of many pollutants including eocs are still commonly detected in groundwater cabeza et al 2012 lapworth et al 2012 2019 lopez et al 2015 moreau et al 2019 moreover some substances present in groundwater are persistent and difficult to treat many studies of eocs in aquatic environments have been undertaken for wastewater ww effluents bueno et al 2012 petrović et al 2003 and surface waters houtman 2010 loos et al 2009 matamoros et al 2012 fewer studies have been undertaken for groundwater bexfield et al 2019 lapworth et al 2012 loos et al 2010 sanchez vila et al 2015 stuart et al 2012 sui et al 2015 karst aquifers are a particularly important source of groundwater with approximately 14 of the earth s land surface covered by karst bgr et al 2017 and 25 of the global population completely or partially dependent on drinking water from karst aquifers chen et al 2017 hartmann et al 2014 compared to other rock types karst aquifers are especially vulnerable to pollution due to direct infiltration via stream sinks shafts and caves ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 groundwater flow can be rapid over long distances as shown by the median velocity of 1940 m d from 3015 karst tracer tests between stream sinks and springs from 34 countries with 595 over distances of 10 km worthington and ford 2009 it might therefore be expected that karst aquifers are more impacted by eocs than some other aquifer types there have been some previous studies that have reviewed eocs in karst aquifers notably mahler and musgrove 2019 provide a very useful introduction to different types of emerging contaminants pharmaceuticals personal care products and hormones flame retardants perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl compounds nanoparticles and microplastics together with an overview of studies that have detected these different types of emerging contaminants in karst groundwater they highlight the vulnerability of the edwards aquifer in texas to pollution from emerging contaminants and recommend future work to investigate this padilla and vesper 2018 provide a comprehensive review of contaminant transport processes and modelling approaches within karst aquifers with a focus on the transport of both legacy and emerging contaminants phthalates the initial objective of this paper is to provide the first compilation of eoc data from previous studies of eocs in karst aquifers and review how the types and concentrations of eocs present compare to their occurrence in surface water and other types of groundwater system in the second part of the paper we review how eocs can assist with karst hydrogeological characterisation for example through contributing to understanding of aquifer vulnerability and rapid groundwater flow identifying connecting with wastewater identifying pollutant sources delineating catchments and investigating contaminant attenuation mechanisms 2 methods an extensive literature search was undertaken using google scholar web of science sciencedirect researchgate and microsoft academic supplementary material figure s1 10 000 published papers relating to groundwater and eocs were identified covering a range of topics and groups of eocs fig 1 using the following key word combinations karst groundwater contaminants of emerging concern pcp ls industrials emerging pollutants pharmaceuticals emerging organic contaminants the review and searches were limited to dissolved organic compounds nano materials and micro plastics were not considered in this paper as there are very few studies on these new types of contaminants in karst systems e g panno et al 2019 and their fate and behaviour in groundwater may be quite different compared to dissolved compounds see re 2019 the literature search was also limited to english publications several hundred papers were initially evaluated based on a brief survey of titles key words and abstracts of which 50 publications related specifically to karst aquifers and containing eoc occurrence data were selected and form the basis of this review in previous research on emerging organic contaminants different authors include different ranges of compounds and classified them differently lapworth et al 2012 mahler and musgrove 2019 zhao et al 2018 bunting et al 2021 this is partly because the status of a compound as emerging is regionally dependant and may change with time thus newer studies may include compounds that were classified as emerging many years ago however there are also a wide range of compounds that are routinely measured as part of the analysis suite for emerging contaminants even though some of these compounds have been around for a long time and would not be defined as emerging this may be partly because some types of emerging contaminant classes include both new and legacy compounds e g some pesticides and the analytical suites e g lc ms ms used to look for these compounds include both legacy and more recently added compounds such as pharmaceuticals new compounds are being manufactured and utilised all the time the eocs of today will be legacy contaminants in the future in some countries compounds suspected of harmful health impacts are put on the watch list and are monitored for several years after which they are either transferred to the priority list or removed from that list european commission directive 2006 118 ec lapworth et al 2019 https www epa gov dwucmr 2021 another challenge is the differences in legislation in different countries when regulated microorganics are not regulated globally but at the country and sometimes regional level in the eu pesticides are regulated both as an entire group and on an individual basis in some cases wfd 2006 118 ce annex i however there are many other parts of the world where this is not the case for example atrazine widely considered a legacy compound in europe is regulated in only 28 of the 104 countries that belong to the world health organisation who 2018 and is not banned from use in parts of north america given the focus of this study is a global data compilation we have used the current who guidelines who 2018 as the benchmark for defining if a contaminant is emerging or not all compounds with a who guideline value or deemed not to need a limit because concentrations found in groundwater are too low to be considered a health concern are excluded from the data compilation part of this paper all degradation compounds of pesticides are considered eocs some former eocs e g atrazine are discussed in the second part of the paper in relation to the review of the applications of eocs in karst hydrogeology for the data compilation eocs were divided into four broader groups pharmaceuticals comprising hormones human and animal drugs personal care products and lifestyle compounds pcp ls comprising fragrances cosmetics artificial sweeteners stimulants and their metabolites industrial compounds comprising flame retardants and plasticisers and agricultural products comprising pesticides herbicides fungicides algicides and their metabolites some of the compounds have multiple uses in which case they are classified according to the most common use the list of compounds is in the supplementary material table s1 maximum concentrations of compounds are used in the data presentation as this was the only parameter that was consistently available from the studies reviewed there are limitations to this approach due to the presence of outliers but we were not able to use a more suitable measures such as the 90th or 95th percentile due to limited reporting in the reviewed literature and lack of access to the raw data from the majority of studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of eocs in karst aquifers the 50 publications of eocs in karst were from studies in 21 countries fig 2 in some countries more research has been done sometimes in the same location e g germany and in some countries extensive regional monitoring has been carried out in many locations e g usa uk france china most studies have been carried out in europe and the usa with few or no studies in many other parts of the world the different types of karst covered by the investigations of eocs included in this study differ significantly in age and degree of karstification they range chronostratigraphically from the older karst of palaeozoic age characterised by low matrix porosity to younger cenozoic karst with high matrix porosity comparative hydrological characteristics of some of the springs or karst regions they belong to can be found in the wokas database olarinoye et al 2020 despite the relatively small number of studies in karst areas they provide key insights into patterns of eocs in karst aquifers and have been used for a wide range of applications table 1 many other studies e g d alessio and ray 2016 dong et al 2018 gavrilescu et al 2015 lopez et al 2015 meffe and de bustamante 2014 moreau et al 2019 murray et al 2010 postigo and barceló 2015 sampled eocs from karst but karst samples were not distinguishable from other lithologies and they are therefore not included in table 1 a total of 144 compounds from different groups of contaminants were identified in studies of karst aquifers data are available in supplementary material most were pharmaceutical and pesticide compounds used in agriculture with fewer industrial compounds and personal care products and lifestyle compounds detected table 1 fig 3 carbamazepine anticonvulsant and caffeine stimulant were the most frequently detected compounds whilst many compounds were detected in just a single study see supplementary material table s1 most studies aimed to determine the occurrence type and concentrations of emerging contaminants however the number of sample locations and sample frequencies and the number type and group of analysed compounds for particular investigations varied greatly between studies the way the results of the analyses were reported varied as well some studies reported medians some mean values thus maximum concentrations were used for comparison as the only data available in all studies this review highlights the need to report high percentiles such as the 95th percentile and for studies to make the full set of results available so that these can be calculated as these would help to avoid the issue of small numbers of outliers skewing results maximum concentrations of compounds varied over 5 orders of magnitude fig 4 and nearly half of the detected compounds exceed 100 ng l the current eu drinking water limit for individual pesticides many of the highest concentrations were industrial compounds fig 4 although the highest concentration was of the antibiotic sulphanilamide 6 5 108 ng l not included in fig 4 to retain the clarity of the figure which was detected in the chalk aquifer beneath a chemical plant in the uk bennett et al 2017 bisphenol a bpa paracetamol and 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam are among the top 20 compounds in terms of both concentration and detection frequency and hence indicate the greatest risk to karst aquatic ecosystem individual compounds in karst aquifers are typically found in concentrations that are considered too low by several orders of magnitude to cause acute toxicity effects e g costanzo et al 2007 kim et al 2009 nunes et al 2005 in exceptional circumstances detections in relation to some point sources can lead to high concentrations in groundwater that approach or exceed acute toxicity thresholds e g bennett et al 2017 one recent study by geiger et al 2016 found that mixtures of pharmaceuticals were more toxic to algae inhibiting algal growth than single compounds however the concentrations used are not representative of typical environmental concentrations and further work is needed using more realistic concentrations which reflect environmental exposure by organisms there is little information on the impact of mixtures of eocs on chronic responses in organisms but some studies have shown chronic exposure effects are predicted at levels found in karst groundwater in this review e g berninger and brooks 2010 in fig 5 maximum concentrations of eocs in karst aquifers are compared with values found in a range of aquifers globally lapworth et al 2012 and surface waters in europe loos et al 2009 maximum concentrations depend upon the presence and nature of contaminant sources within the catchment which was not assessed in this literature review however maximum concentrations appear lower in karst groundwater compared to other aquifer types for carbamazepine caffeine ibuprofen nonylphenol hormones but are higher for sucralose metoprolol tetracycline and are comparable for paracetamol oxazepam and 1h benzotriazole fig 5 while overall maximum concentrations appear lower in karst groundwater nearly 25 of compounds had comparable or greater maximum concentrations in karst compared to other aquifers fig 5 maximum concentrations reported in lapworth et al 2012 were often from shallow alluvial aquifers and as such represent highly vulnerable groundwater systems that are often at least periodically in hydraulic continuity with surface waters and hence may have high concentrations of microorganic contamination much like karst systems mcmanus et al 2017 found significant differences and a lower detection frequency in fractured karstified limestones compared to overlying shallower intergranular aquifers but showed that many of the substances reached the deeper karst aquifers as well e g pesticides and their metabolites extensive national monitoring of hormones and pharmaceuticals conducted in the united states bexfield et al 2019 showed that at least one compound was detected to a greater extent in samples from carbonate rocks 26 compared to non carbonate rock rocks 19 but concentrations and frequency of detections of most compounds were higher in non carbonate rocks results from a large national study in england and wales manamsa et al 2016b showed that chalk and jurassic limestone carbonate aquifers with some karstification had higher maximum concentrations for most microorganic contaminants including eocs compared to other important aquifer types e g permo triassic sandstone and greensand the percentage frequency of detections for the different aquifer types varied depending on the compound but was overall comparable for the karst and sandstone aquifers and was typically below 5 manamsa et al 2016b comparing the results of two investigations of karst groundwater with surface water detection frequency and concentrations of all detected ppcps were higher in surface water compared to karst groundwater except for fenofibrate zemann et al 2015 and acesulfame k doummar and aoun 2018b it appears that eocs may have a lower frequency of detection and lower concentrations in karst groundwater compared to surface waters and local shallow intergranular aquifers but higher concentrations than other major aquifer types such as sandstones and other unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers however systematic sampling studies are needed to confirm more conclusively how eoc occurrence in karst groundwater compares to surface waters and other aquifers and in all springs abstractions the occurrence and magnitude of eoc contamination will vary substantially depending on the type of catchment and pollution sources found within them and timing of sampling the flow characteristics of spring sources it is clear that karst is highly vulnerable to eoc contamination with potentially serious impacts on both drinking water supplies and karst dependent ecosystems however the limited number of studies undertaken in karst globally currently restricts our understanding of the extent of pollution from eocs in this vulnerable setting 3 2 applications of eocs in karst hydrogeology the increasing number and presence of eocs in groundwater present many challenges due to the detrimental impacts on the quality of water used for supply and which sustains rivers and ecosystems however eocs can also provide information to assist with karst hydrogeological studies in this section the use of these compounds in karst hydrogeological studies are considered with a summary of the applications in table 3 understanding the degradation properties of eocs is a prerequisite for their use in aquifer characterisation and therefore in this section studies on the degradation properties of compounds are reviewed section 3 2 1 the use of eocs in characterising vulnerability is then discussed section 3 2 2 followed by the use of eocs for identifying longer term storage section 3 2 3 eocs have also been used to investigate attenuation mechanisms within karst aquifers and these studies are discussed in section 3 2 4 the final section 3 2 5 discusses the use of eocs as a tool for better defining catchment areas 3 2 1 degradation properties of eocs the presence of rapidly degrading compounds is a useful indicator of rapid groundwater flow and vulnerabilty studies of compound degradation are summarized in table 2 caffeine has been observed to degrade relatively rapidly with half lives of less than 104 h dvory et al 2018b hillebrand et al 2012a hillebrand et al 2015 table 2 and an estimate of 12 days for degradation in a lake buerge et al 2003 however hillebrand et al 2012b suggested wastewater leakage and the subsurface redox condition may have contributed to the high biodegradation of caffeine that they observed and longer degradation times of 30 to 69 days have been estimated for caffeine in intergranular aquifers gonçalves et al 2017 koroša et al 2020 other compounds have also been found to have high degradation rates a study of the uk chalk aquifer beneath a pharmaceutical factory found sulfanilamide concentrations decreased from 650 to 10 mg l over a distance of about 500 m 56 of this reduction was attributed to biodegradation processes and 42 to processes within the aquifer such as dilution and dispersion bennett et al 2017 some papers suggested biodegradation as the main cause of decreasing concentrations of caffeine in groundwater dvory et al 2018b and hillebrand et al 2015 heinz et al 2009 suggest the same process for plasticizers flame retardants and ppcps some studies have suggested that nonchlorinated organophosphates degrade more rapidly than chlorinated ones andresen et al 2004 heinz et al 2009 meyer and bester 2004 and that substances with higher octanol water partition coefficient kow values have higher degradation some compounds such as carbamazepine table 2 and atrazine hillebrand et al 2014 morasch 2013 schiperski et al 2015 are more resistant to degradation atrazine has been found in karst aquifers many years after it was banned in europe chen et al 2019 lapworth and gooddy 2006 persistence in karst aquifers was also evident for a range of eocs acesulfame doummar and aoun 2018b zirlewagen et al 2016 phthalates padilla and vesper 2018 sucralose gemfibrozil iohexol doummar and aoun 2018b primidone tamoxifen and analgesic phenazone which had a particularly high detection frequency even though it has not recently been prescribed in significant quantities reh et al 2013 overall it appears that eocs have very variable degradation properties eoc compounds like caffeine ibuprofen atenolol which degrade more rapidly in groundwater hillebrand et al 2012b hillebrand et al 2015 reh et al 2013 could be used as evidence of rapid groundwater flow and high vulnerability in contrast others e g carbamazepine acesulfame and the former eoc atrazine are more persistent however the degradation properties of eocs are still poorly understood and the extent to which observations reflect degradation or other attenuation processes such as sorption and dilution is often unclear and there have been few laboratory studies of eoc properties further work on the properties of current and former eocs would be very useful to improve understanding of their persistence in groundwater in addition the degradation products of eocs can potentially be as toxic and persistent as parent compounds and this topic has also received little attention 3 2 2 investigating vulnerability using eocs a useful potential application of eocs in karst hydrogeology is for assessing the vulnerability of a spring or abstraction in karst aquifers indicators such as rapidly fluctuating spring discharge butscher and huggenberger 2008 high turbidity fournier et al 2006 or high coliforms mahler et al 2000 are used as evidence that springs or abstractions have high vulnerability eocs provide further evidence of vulnerability if rapidly degrading compounds are present indicating rapid groundwater flow and low residence times where particularly high concentrations of eoc compounds are present meffe and de bustamante 2014 or where there are a wide range of different types of eoc compounds there are examples of studies that have demonstrated high vulnerability using eocs high vulnerability from fast flow events in a karst aquifer with a leaking sewage pipe was identified using carbamazepine and caffeine by dvory et al 2018a sorenson et al 2015 found that deep groundwater in a karst aquifer was more vulnerable than previously thought clay rich superficials were thought to provide significant groundwater protection to the karst aquifer but high concentrations of deet with more than a five fold increase after the wet season showed that contaminants can transit rapidly from the surface to the bedrock aquifer in some cases eocs have been used in conjunction with other parameters for vulnerability assessment for example doummar and aoun 2018b found that the mass flux of turbidity and chlorides were strongly correlated with those of the two artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame k schiperski et al 2015 obtained good correlations between atrazine metazachlor cyclamate and sec and turbidity in hysteresis plots although the presence of eocs can indicate rapid groundwater flow and high vulnerability the absence of eocs does not necessarily indicate low vulnerability if there are limited sources of eoc contaminants in the catchment the large numbers of eoc compounds that can be measured including some that indicate short residence times are clearly useful as indicators of vulnerability these are best used in conjunction with other evidence such as turbidity coliforms and discharge variability and a good understanding of the land use in the catchment to enable assessment of the likely contaminant loads that could impact the spring or abstraction 3 2 3 identification of longer term storage in karst karst aquifers have extremely high hydraulic conductivities and generally have large components of short residence time groundwater ford and williams 2007 nevertheless even in highly karstified aquifers there may be a substantial component of longer term storage ford and williams 2007 atkinson 1977 smart and friederich 1986 understanding longer term storage in karst aquifers is an important component of aquifer characterisation and eocs could contribute to this understanding in some locations banned substances such as atrazine can provide evidence that karst aquifers could have significant contaminant storage and or longer residence time pathways einsiedl et al 2010 hillebrand et al 2014 reh et al 2013 schiperski et al 2015 zirlewagen et al 2016 for example even though atrazine was prohibited in europe 20 years ago it is still widely detected in karst aquifers hertzman 2017 iker et al 2010 lapworth and gooddy 2006 morasch 2013 it has been suggested that this is because atrazine is stored and persists in the matrix which slowly leaks into the fracture and conduit flow system hillebrand et al 2014 morasch 2013 schiperski et al 2015 atrazine and its metabolites have been detected at ng l μg l concentrations in a range of karst studies and it appears that it may pose a continued risk to humans and microbiological communities long after it has been banned from use huang et al 2019 qin et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 in other cases the start date for the use of a particular eoc such as artificial sugars or pharmaceuticals can be obtained for a particular country or region and may help constrain the residence time of the groundwater system under investigation zemann et al 2015 found the most frequently detected compounds in karst groundwater samples were two standard substances used in x ray diagnostics diatrizoic acid da whose use has been significantly reduced since 2008 and iopamidol ip which is the usual replacement for da during this five year investigation da was detected only a few times in wastewater and ip occurred more commonly in wastewater and groundwater suggesting a more recent wastewater input to groundwater the low but continuous da concentrations in groundwater suggest that there is also a longer term storage component with the residual concentrations of da in the matrix of the unsaturated zone being slowly being released into the more permeable parts of the karst system solutional fractures and conduits 3 2 4 attenuation mechanisms in karst aquifers within aquifers a range of processes such as dilution dispersion diffusion and sorption are important for controlling natural attenuation conduit rich karst is generally thought to have poor attenuation capabilities due to rapid and focussed groundwater inputs via streams sinks and rapid groundwater flow which can exceed a velocity of 30 km d petrič et al 2020 and because they are oligotrophic gibert et al 1994 hirsch 1986 however even in highly karstified aquifers contaminants can be attenuated studies of eocs have contributed to understanding of attenuation mechanisms einsiedl et al 2010 hillebrand et al 2012b zemann et al 2015 in particular studies have considered attenuation via diffusion between different void types e g conduits fissures and fractures dvory et al 2018a 2018b einsiedl et al 2010 other studies have indirectly provided information on attenuation processes bekele et al 2009 doummar and aoun 2018b heinz et al 2009 hillebrand et al 2012b 2015 katz et al 2010 reh et al 2013 zemann et al 2015 einsiedl et al 2010 used two pharmaceuticals diclofenac and ibuprofen from wastewater effluents in springs to compliment modelling and tracer testing studies of attenuation they concluded that contaminant transport is significantly influenced by diffusion between the mobile fracture flow component of the aquifer and groundwater in the matrix dvory et al 2018a investigated attenuation processes by simulating carbamazepine transport in the saturated and unsaturated zones of a karst aquifer to investigate processes during fast flow events and baseflow the modeling results suggested low solute exchange and less diffusion of contaminant into the matrix during fast flow events with more carbamazepine reaching the saturated zone from the unsaturated zone in contrast during low flow conditions high storage in the porous matrix of the unsaturated zone was thought to provide a continuous supply of carbamazepine to the saturated zone 3 2 5 identifying pollutant sources eocs can help identify the origin of pollution stuart et al 2014 kiefer et al 2021 unlike many conventional indicators e g inorganic ions electrical conductivity they do not have natural background concentrations some eocs also have a unique source type which makes them particularly useful source specific indicators when used in combination with other tracers and tools they may provide useful insights into the sources of pollution in the catchment eocs are particularly useful for identifying connectivity with wastewater and the compounds that have been most useful for this are discussed in section 3 2 5 1 their use for identification of other pollutant sources are discussed in section 3 2 5 2 3 2 5 1 identifying connectivity with wastewater effluents wastewater ww poses a major risk to groundwater especially in vulnerable karst areas eocs have been successfully used to provide information on how effective ww treatments are and detect pollution incidents and specific indicators are reviewed below carbamazepine several studies have shown that carbamazepine is a conservative indicator for both treated and untreated wastewater clara et al 2004 dvory et al 2018b fenz et al 2005 gasser et al 2010 however carbamazepine concentrations in effluent are often relatively low and therefore may be a poor indicator where only small quantities of ww are discharged into highly diluting systems hillebrand et al 2012a caffeine and its metabolites many surface water investigations found caffeine to be a good ww indicator buerge et al 2003 2006 edwards et al 2015 gonçalves et al 2017 caffeine has also been used as a ww indicator in karst groundwater systems caffeine degrades in groundwater section 3 2 1 and is not a good indicator in systems with long transit times but can determine recent ww inputs hillebrand et al 2012a it is especially useful where carbamazepine concentrations are low dvory et al 2018b because ww can contain caffeine concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than carbamazepine miao et al 2005 in one study a positive correlation of caffeine with its predominantly human metabolite paraxanthine suggested a connection with domestic ww hillebrand et al 2012a while in another it has been used as an indicator of the impact of tourism on water quality in an area of the yucatan leal bautista et al 2011 hillebrand et al 2012b used caffeine concentrations in spring water and untreated ww water consumption rates and spring discharge data to calculate that the average amount of domestic ww discharging at a karst spring was approximately 0 4 of the total amount of ww within the spring catchment this is a relatively low fraction compared to those calculated by rutsch et al 2006 for other catchments which were found to be in the range of 1 13 doummar and aoun 2018a suggested that compounds more resistant to high degradation would be more suitable for estimating exfiltration rates of ww into the environment using a mixing model based on chloride mass fluxes they defined exfiltration rates in a karst catchment of 0 7 4 in low to medium flow and 5 10 at high flow cyclamate cyclamate cyc could be used as a tracer of raw ww sources zirlewagen et al 2016 it has similar concentrations in ww to caffeine and was shown to be a more sensitive indicator for untreated ww than caffeine because it is less degradable however its detection does not necessarily indicate a recent input of ww to karst systems and therefore the combined use of caffeine and cyclamate may be useful hillebrand et al 2015 zirlewagen et al 2016 suggested using the ratio of cyclamate and another much more persistent artificial sweetener acesulfame ace as indicator for raw wastewater as it is not affected by uncertainties associated with dilution the high cyc ace ratio indicates fresh inputs of untreated ww in the same investigation concentration curves of cyclamate were similar to those of the faecal indicator bacteria suggesting that they had the same origin and that ww is the main source of bacterial pollution in the catchment other eoc tracers other eocs that have been shown to be good wastewater indicators are acesulfame k gemfibrozil iohexol doummar and aoun 2018a sucralose doummar and aoun 2018b deet caffeine metabolites theophylline triclosan and atenolol upton et al 2020 and chlorinated organophosphate tris 2 chloro 1 chloromethyl ethyl phosphate heinz et al 2009 acesulfame k gemfibrozil and iohexol may be indicators of domestic ww effluents or pollution from specific point sources such as poultry farms and hospitals doummar and aoun 2018a sucralose has a high detection limit of 100 μg l but it has still been detected and indicated the presence of wastewater in a karst groundwater system doummar and aoun 2018b there is inconclusive evidence on whether diclofenac is a good ww tracer reh et al 2013 suggested that diclofenac has high attenuation however einsiedl et al 2010 reported frequent detections of diclofenac which they attributed to high concentrations in treated ww effluent widespread long term use and low sorption properties ibuprofen was thought to be poor ww indicator in a study by einsiedl et al 2010 due to its low detection in karst samples despite its high concentrations in raw ww high biodegradation rates were suggested as the most likely explanation for this 3 2 5 2 identifying other sources of pollution eocs and other legacy microorganic pollutants also point to other non ww sources of pollution in karst i e agriculture chiffre et al 2016 dong et al 2018 hillebrand et al 2014 morasch 2013 reh et al 2013 or industrial activities dong et al 2018 reh et al 2013 separated different sources of pollutants using ternary diagrams of triazines atrazine and its degradation products dea and dia samples from agricultural areas had high fractions of dea whilst those from urban areas had a higher dia fraction chiffre et al 2016 detected pharmaceuticals at sample locations in rural sparsely populated areas not just downstream of ww treatment plant as expected but upstream as well a good example of the application of eocs as source specific indicators is the study where sources of groundwater nitrate pollution were identified by correlation with diatrizoic acid zemann et al 2015 it is well known that nitrate can reach groundwater from various sources such as sewage and agriculture however as diatrizoic acid had not been used in agriculture but is found in urban ww it was most likely that ww was the source of nitrate in the groundwater much like stuart et al 2014 and more recently keifer et al 2021 they identified pharmaceutical detection rates as a suitable tool for fingerprinting different sources of anthropogenic pollution 3 2 6 catchment delineation catchment delineation in karst can be challenging due to the high heterogeneity and changes in groundwater divides under different water level conditions many eocs have limited numbers of potential sources and the occurrence of specific eocs at a groundwater abstraction could indicate connectivity with a particular contaminant source and thereby demonstrate that it is in the catchment for example by intensive monitoring of micropollutants pharmaceuticals corrosion inhibitor pesticides morash 2013 found that the main source of the pollutants at two observed springs in a swiss karst catchment was a swallow hole draining an agricultural plain indicating that this site is within the spring catchment area in another example reh et al 2014 used detections of triazines to help with catchment delineation by distinguishing agricultural and urban pollutant sources while in areas with multiple potential sources and high levels of contamination it may be difficult to determine the exact source of a contaminant lapworth et al 2015 reh et al 2013 the use of statistical methods e g correlations clustering can help to determine pollutant sources and thus catchment areas dodgen et al 2017 huang et al 2019 stuart et al 2014 although by definition eocs are contaminants and should not be knowingly introduced to groundwater some newly measured compounds could have suitable properties for use as artificial tracers if they are non toxic artificial tracers should be conservative absent from but readily soluble in water easy to detect quantitatively inexpensive and easy to handle goldscheider and drew 2007 käss 1998 karst groundwater tracer tests have been conducted using caffeine and results were obtained hillebrand et al 2012b hillebrand et al 2015 caffeine is cheap but is degradable and present in the environment so is not an ideal tracer but it could possibly be useful for tracer tests to delineate catchments in small highly karstified areas in the case of known or low background concentrations 4 conclusions this paper reviewed 50 studies on eocs in karst from 21 countries eocs are clearly an important threat to karst groundwater quality which could impact drinking water sources rivers and other dependant ecosystems a total of 144 compounds were detected in spring and groundwater samples the most frequently detected compounds were pharmaceutical products as well as pesticides used in agriculture with fewer industrial compounds and personal care products and lifestyle compounds pcp ls detected carbamazepine and caffeine were the most frequently detected compounds whilst many compounds were detected in just a single study maximum concentrations of compounds varied over 5 orders of magnitude and nearly half of the detected compounds exceed 100 ng l the current eu drinking water limit for individual pesticides many of the highest concentrations were industrial compounds although the highest concentration was of the antibiotic sulphanilamide 6 5 108 ng l this review suggests that overall eocs may have a lower frequency of detection and lower concentrations in karst groundwater compared to surface waters and local shallow alluvial aquifers but higher concentrations compared to other major aquifer types such as sandstones this paper also reviews the use of eocs in karst hydrogeological studies eocs represent a potentially very large range of anthropogenically introduced tracers with a wide range of physical and chemical properties and different subsequent fate in karst the presence of rapidly degrading eocs e g caffeine can be an indicator of rapid groundwater flow and vulnerability and aquifer vulnerability is also indicated by high concentrations of eocs or a wide range of different eocs at a site in contrast persistent former eocs that are banned or no longer used e g atrazine diatrizoic acid can indicate a component of longer term storage in karst aquifers furthermore the transport of eocs in karst may help improve understanding of attenuation mechanisms for example exchange between the matrix fractures and larger conduits eocs are useful to identify sources of pollution in karst several eoc compounds have been shown to be good indicators of connectivity with wastewater more persistent compounds e g carbamazepine acesulfame can be used as indicators for both treated and untreated wastewater while readily degradable compounds e g caffeine cyclamate indicate more recent wastewater inputs some eocs also have a unique source which makes them particularly useful for source identification and catchment delineation 5 future outlook studies of eocs in karst are a fairly new area of research the relatively small number of studies 50 found in our review highlights the need for further research on eocs in karst aquifers to improve understanding of their impacts on karst environments and to develop their use for karst aquifer characterisation more studies employing more frequent monitoring are required to assess temporal changes particularly important for dynamic karst systems and more sensitive analytical methods are also required to improve assessments of eoc contamination the lack of data on microplastics in karst groundwaters is also an important area requiring future research the data compiled here are limited because the only parameter that was consistently reported in the studies reviewed was maximum concentration a collaborative project with a full analysis of all the eoc data in karst aquifers would be extremely useful to provide more robust conclusions on eocs in karst aquifers the relationships between eoc occurrence and other drivers of stress and the prevalence of anti microbial resistance should be further assessed in these highly vulnerable in many ways sentinel karst groundwaters systems given the role of karst as a host for a range of important stygofauna maurice et al 2016 it is also recommended that further research is done to assess the fate of hazardous eocs as well as their interaction and potential accumulation in dependant ecosystems within karst selected eocs are now beginning to be included more widely within some national monitoring plans glassmeyer et al 2017 bunting et al 2021 a recent example being the introduction of a groundwater watch list in europe lapworth et al 2019 however as this review has shown even in karst which are amongst the most vulnerable groundwater systems there are relatively few studies that have been undertaken on eocs there is a requirement for more research and monitoring of eocs in karst and a need for better prioritisation of screening for eocs in groundwater and dependant ecosystems e g gaston et al 2019 particularly given the importance of karst for drinking water supplies globally and its role as a unique and vulnerable ecosystem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

3794,making accurate and reliable probability density forecasts of flood processes is fundamentally challenging for machine learning techniques especially when prediction targets are outside the range of training data conceptual hydrological models can reduce rainfall runoff modelling errors with efficient quasi physical mechanisms the monotone composite quantile regression neural network mcqrnn is used for the first time to make probability density forecasts of flood processes and serves as a benchmark model whereas it confronts the drawbacks of overfitting and biased prediction here we propose an integrated model i e xaj mcqrnn that incorporates xinanjiang conceptual model xaj and mcqrnn to overcome the phenomena of error propagation and accumulation encountered in multi step ahead flood probability density forecasts we consider flood forecasts as a function of rainfall factors and runoff data the models are evaluated by long term 2009 2015 3 hour streamflow series of the jianxi river catchment in china and rainfall products of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts results demonstrated that the proposed xaj mcqrnn model can not only outperform the mcqrnn model but also prominently enhance the accuracy and reliability of multi step ahead probability density forecasts of flood process regarding short term forecasts in testing stages at four horizons the xaj mcqrnn model achieved higher nash sutcliffe efficiency but lower root mean square error values while improving coverage ratio and relative bandwidth values in comparison to the mcqrnn model consequently the improvement can benefit the mitigation of the impacts associated with uncertainties of extreme flood and rainfall events as well as promote the accuracy and reliability of flood forecasting and early warning keywords short term flood forecast probability density forecast monotone composite quantile regression conceptual model machine learning 1 introduction floods are among the world s costliest disasters and climate and anthropogenic changes have made catastrophic floods much more likely happen over the past century floods accounted for about 30 of natural disasters claiming more than 19 of the total fatalities and more than 48 of the total number of people affected adikari and yoshitani 2009 takeuchi et al 2018 flood forecasting and early warning play a pivotal role in geohazard mitigation floodplain management design and management of infrastructure projects agricultural cultivation and human daily life liu et al 2018 giuliani et al 2019 therefore accurate and reliable forecasting of flood processes during rainstorm events is extremely crucial and beneficial for a country or catchment whose prosperity is largely dependent on the optimum use of water resources and flood level control to date a wide variety of modelling frameworks have been introduced to model the complicated nonlinear rainfall runoff process sood and smakhtin 2015 shen 2018 kan et al 2020 in general these modelling frameworks can be categorized into three groups conceptual physically based and machine learning models a conceptual hydrological model typically includes prior knowledge as a necessary part of conceptual components possessing quasi physical mechanisms li et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 there are all sorts of spatially lumped and distributed conceptual models available with deterministic and stochastic parameter values for a given point or region a physically based model usually establishes a simplified catchment system and expresses the internal hydrological processes through several mathematical equations considering the spatial variability of rainfall and parameters li et al 2019 li and willems 2020 however physically based models encounter a much higher challenge when trying to achieve the required prediction accuracy due to limited watershed information an alternative the machine learning model constructs a direct mapping between rainfall and runoff variables and extracts their relationship according to the historical observations by machine learning algorithms without a piece of prior knowledge in relation to internal hydrological processes feng et al 2020 kao et al 2020 li et al 2020 lin et al 2020 nearing et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge the growth in machine learning for hydrological sciences is tied to advances in computing power as well as the vast increase of hydrological observations however machine learning models are purely data driven and do not have any physical mechanisms which easily lead to overfitting and biased predictions especially when prediction targets are unobserved and outside the range of rainfall runoff data adopted for model training hunter et al 2018 xie et al 2021 typically at longer forecast horizons the non availability of antecedent streamflow data makes it fundamentally challenging to maintain the forecast accuracy of data driven models such weakness imposes limitations on the applicability of data driven models in rainfall runoff studies schmidt et al 2020 zahura et al 2020 in comparison to physically based models conceptual models have been widely applied in rainfall runoff modelling owing to the practical and simple manner formulation of conceptual models signifies only a partial set of the real hydrological cycle processes this triggers several constraints like model calibration and parameter transferability difficulties humphrey et al 2016 kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 in cases where forecasters and decision makers usually require prior knowledge for calibrating and running conceptual models to achieve reasonable accuracy of flood forecasts bandai and ghezzehei 2020 gu et al 2020 although conceptual and data driven models are derived from different philosophies they can help remedy and enhance each other with regard to their inherent limitations and strengths tian et al 2018 sun et al 2019 chadalawada et al 2020 hence a hybridization of both models is an attractive and effective approach for rainfall runoff modelling yong et al 2017 kurian et al 2019 ghaseminejad and uddameri 2020 for instance yang et al 2019 evaluated the integration of machine learning and conceptual models for flood simulation at 1032 streamflow gauging stations worldwide farfan et al 2020 adopted streamflow series forecasts made by a conceptual model as input data of back propagation neural networks to forecast streamflow data hitokoto and sakuraba 2020 integrated a rainfall runoff model and a feed forward artificial neural network to predict real time water level processes hosseiny et al 2020 integrated a two dimensional hydraulic model a random forest classification and a multilayer perceptron for modeling flood depth of the river segment of the flaming gorge dam in the northeast corner of utah in the us konapala et al 2020 verified hybrid models constructed by combining a conceptual model with a long short term memory neural network on their capability to simulate streamflow series in hundreds of catchments across the us the above mentioned studies explored hybrid models for flood prediction in watersheds with diverse climate conditions by means of point forecasts this study is the first to apply conceptual models with artificial neural networks incorporating flood probability density fpd forecasting for a humid subtropical climate exploration of conceptual and machine learning models for fpd forecasting in this study is owing to the following reasons first conceptual models possess superior operability while machine learning models possess efficient computation power and second physically based models usually have bottlenecks of low prediction accuracy and time consuming due to the limitation of available data or quality on the physical properties of watersheds liu et al 2018 li et al 2020 cui et al 2021 kao et al 2021 previous research regarding hybrid models mainly concentrated on point forecasts or interval predictions of flood processes by integrating conceptual models with single output artificial neural networks whereas to date no study has involved fpd forecasting point forecasting the most frequently used approach can provide a point estimate of the future flood as precisely as possible for each forecast horizon rather than offering single valued forecasts interval prediction approaches attempt to create well calibrated lower and upper bounds of each future prediction subject to a prescribed confidence level furthermore fpd forecasting can provide flood forecasts in the form of quantile point forecasts confidence interval forecasts and probability density functions although it needs extra efforts to calculate the probability for each possible prediction additional information gained is highly helpful to promote the full understanding of flood predictability fpd forecasting not only effectively quantifies the uncertainties in input datasets but also has the ability to construct the complete conditional probability density curves of future flood processes consequently there is a noticeable migration from point forecasts and interval predictions towards fpd forecasts where modelers seek to characterize the full probability distribution of flood events among machine learning techniques the monotone composite quantile regression neural network mcqrnn is a special type of multi output artificial neural networks ann that can effectively estimate multiple non crossing and nonlinear quantile functions simultaneously it is a novel and appealing approach for probability density forecasting as compared with other multi output anns like support vector machine and long short term memory cannon 2018 since mcqrnn applications do not exist in fpd forecasts it would be important and interesting to explore in depth conceptual hydrological models to decrease the uncertainty of multi output ann e g mcqrnn for fpd forecasting the novelty of this study relies on the integration of the xinanjiang xaj conceptual model and the innovative mcqrnn with a multi output task meanwhile this is the first application of the integrated xaj mcqrnn model for fpd forecasting there are three main steps in this approach first the conceptual hydrological model for rainfall runoff simulation was constructed to create point forecasts of flood processes and the outputs were used as inputs of the machine learning model second the multi output machine learning model for fpd forecasting was built to further create interval forecasts of flood processes after being supplied with point forecasts by the conceptual model third the training process of the hybrid model was optimized by an evolutionary optimization algorithm

the gradient based nonlinear optimization algorithm kingma and ba 2015 cannon 2018 was used to optimize the weight w sj h w mj h w nj h and w jk o in eqs 1 a and 1 b and intercept b j h and b k o in eqs 1 a and 1 b parameters of the mcqrnn while the training process of the xaj mcqrnn was performed after being supplied with point forecasts by the xaj at the same time furthermore the genetic

rate η fig 2 illustrates the flow chart of the xaj mcqrnn training process the implementation procedure is described as follows step 1 randomly generate an initial population x0 of size ipop with respect to the hyperparameters integer coded and real coded solutions are adopted for hyperparameters imax and j as well as for hyperparameters λ h λ o and η respectively the search spaces of imax j λ h λ o and α are set to be 200 500 1 30 0 001 0 01 0 001 0 01 and 0 001 0 05 respectively step 2 perform the gradient based nonlinear optimization algorithm for optimizing weight and intercept

of the mcqrnn is based on the freely available qrnn package https cran r project org package qrnn as river streamflow data are time series this study applied the root mean square error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the mutual information mi to evaluate the point forecast results of the two mcqrnn models the rmse value indicates the error between forecasts and observations and its value ranges from 0 to infinity legates and mccabe 1999 the nse is commonly employed to evaluate the forecast accuracy of hydrological models and its value ranges from negative infinity to 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 considering that the upper bound 1 of the nse doesn t leave much room for improvement a logarithm conversion for the nse lnse is used instead of an unbounded quality indicator to evaluate model accuracy the mi value suggests the goodness of fit between forecasts and observations and its value ranges from 0 to infinity shannon 1948 a model with low rmse and high lnse and mi values suggests it can produce high forecast accuracy the computations of rmse lnse and mi values are described below 5 r m s e 1 d t 1 d q t t q m o d e l τ k t t 2 6 l n s e ln 1 n s e l n t 1 d q t

2020 the coverage ratio cr of the forecast interval relative to observations and the relative bandwidth rb of the forecast interval xiong and o connor 2008 were used to evaluate the accuracy of the forecast interval results in this study the cr represents the coverage interval of the forecasts and its value ranges from 0 to 100 the rb represents the width of the forecast interval and its value ranges from 0 to infinity a model with its cr value closer to 100 and its rb closer to 0 implies it can forecast more accurately the computations of cr and rb values are depicted as follows 8 c r 1 d

horizon t with respect to a given confidence level e g 90 respectively e g l 5 u 95 the θ t values are either one or zero in which one implies the observed data fall within its forecast intervals while zero implies the observed data fall outside of its forecast intervals at t time 3 study area and materials 3 1 study area the jianxi river catchment with an area of 14787 km2 is located in southern china fig 3 the catchment climate is affected by the southwest indian ocean and southeast pacific ocean subtropical monsoons and regional landforms lin et al 2020 the annual rainfall ranges from 1800 mm to 2200 mm and the annual runoff ranges from 950 to 1700 mm the highest amount 74 of which occurs within six months april september due to the moist and rainy features as well as red yellow and paddy soils runoff production of this catchment is dominated by the runoff generation on repletion of storage which is in line with the typical rainfall runoff characteristics in southern china 3 2 materials this study collected the data associated with flood events during the flood season april 1st september 30th including the 3 hour time step rainfall data of 16 gauge stations the 3 hour evaporation of 3 gauge stations and the 3 hour streamflow data of the qilijie hydrological station from 2009 to 2015 and the 3 hour forecast rainfall of era interim datasets of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf from 2014 to 2015 the spatial resolution of each grid in era interim is 0 125 e 0 125 n while 32 grid points are required to fully cover the jianxi river catchment fig 3 more details on the era interim datasets of the ecmwf can be found in berrisford et al 2011 the areal mean value of observed rainfall data was calculated by using the datasets of 16 gauge stations colored in green fig 3 the areal mean value of observed evaporation data was calculated by using the datasets of 3 gauge stations colored in purple fig 3 and the areal mean value of forecast rainfall data was calculated by using the datasets of 32 grid points through the thiessen polygon method thiessen 1911 a total of 20 448 8 time step 365 days 6 non leap years 8 time step 366 days 1 leap year time series values were divided into three datasets for model training 8760 from 2009 to 2011 validation 5848 from 2012 to 2013 and testing 5840 from 2014 to 2015 the training dataset was applied to adjusting the parameters weights and intercepts of the xaj model the mcqrnn model the validation dataset was applied to checking whether a prediction model is overfitted or undertrained the test dataset was applied to evaluating the model prediction accuracy 3 3 model construction a 12 hour forecast horizon has been considered in this study since the longest transform time in the rainfall runoff processes is 12 h in this catchment besides the current forecast horizon at the qilijie station is only 6 h inducing the demand for improving the lead time and forecast accuracy in the light of the observed 3 hour rainfall runoff datasets of the jianxi river catchment the model output was set to be t 1 horizon 3 h up to t 4 horizon 12 h time step ahead streamflow where t is the current time as aforementioned the ga was performed to determine the optimal hyperparameters in association with mcqrnn models at four horizons the optimal values of the maximal iteration imax the number of nodes j the regulation coefficients λ h and λ o and the learning rate η were 300 12 0 006 0 004 and 0 009 respectively while the weight and intercept parameters optimized by the gradient based nonlinear optimization algorithm within the qrnn package were adopted in this study this study adopted the partial mutual information and partial weights pmi pw method sharma et al 2016 to quantify the contribution of input combination to model performance table 1 to estimate the input variables weights for constructing the mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models the following framework was adopted apart from the observed streamflow and rainfall data traced back to the previous 12 h the rainfall of the era interim during horizon t 1 up to t 4 was used to train validate and test the former while the forecast streamflow of the xaj model during horizon t 1 up to t 4 was used to train validate and test the latter 4 results to improve the predictability and reliability of fpd forecasts this study intends to explore and evaluate the accuracy of the xaj model coupled with the mcqrnn on short term 12 h flood forecasts at different horizons the results findings and discussion were as follows 4 1 reliability of xaj and mcqrnn models on point forecasts of flood processes the point forecasts of floods under the circumstance of the quantile τ k 0 5 i e median forecasts were specified to test the reliability of the constructed models table 2 summarizes the rmse lnse and mi values of the xaj mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models in training validation and testing stages at four horizons it is apparent from this table that the xaj mcqrnn model performs better than the xaj and mcqrnn models in the three stages at four horizons take the testing stage for example the lnse and mi values of the xaj mcqrnn model exceed 0 90 and 22 respectively while the rmse values are 140 m3 s two main results are acquired from the table 2 firstly the comparison of the xaj mcqrnn and xaj models in the testing stage reveals that there are significant differences in the improvement rates of rmse and nse values at four horizons the improvement rates of rmse lnse mi for median flood forecasting reach 4 7 9 0 4 3 and 5 2 17 0 6 1 at horizons t 1 and t 2 respectively while they increased to 6 6 22 2 8 8 and 8 1 28 4 11 2 at horizons t 3 and t 4 respectively secondly the comparison of the xaj mcqrnn and mcqrnn models in the testing stage points out that the former can provide stable forecast results after being supplied with point forecasts by the xaj model either at shorter horizons t 1 and t 2 or at longer horizons t 3 and t 4 that is to say the xaj mcqrnn model can effectively extract the dependence between rainfall and runoff processes even in the case of the12 hour forecast horizon the fluctuations of forecast rainfalls are stronger at long horizons t 3 and t 4 than at short horizons t 1 and t 2 higher fluctuations of forecast rainfall data are easy to induce overfitting problems which would demand more complex models to mimic the relationship between rainfall and runoff this is considered as a driver to improve the forecast of the xaj mcqrnn model to further evaluate the forecast accuracy of mcqrnn models for making median forecasts of floods the regression analysis of the observed and forecast streamflow data is presented in fig 4 it is too hard to judge the difference in model quality when the correlation between observations and forecasts is high however this is different for the case of low correlation where the gap between the regression and 45 degree lines is large a large gap denotes a significant biased prediction from the standpoint of correlation fig 4 the xaj mcqrnn model can more adequately alleviate the biased prediction phenomenon under prediction in our case because of the larger values of the coefficient of determination r2 as well as the smaller gaps between the regression and 45 degree lines compared to the mcqrnn model as expected there are higher correlations between observations and forecasts at horizons t 1 and t 2 whereas larger improvements of the correlation between observations and forecasts occur at horizons t 3 and t 4 the hybrid model still consistently underestimates most flood processes fig 4 the back fitting algorithm with the autoregressive strategy zhang et al 2018 was performed to correct the systematic bias of point forecasts of the hybrid model after implementing bias correction table 3 summarizes the kolmogorov smirnov ks test results from the standpoint of density distribution due to the high variation of flood datasets streamflow value 1000 m3 s the observations at each horizon are divided into three parts part i 1000 m3 s value 3000 m3 s part ii 3000 m3 s value 9000 m3 s and part iii value 9000 m3 s to effectively examine the predictability of the proposed model at various flood magnitudes the larger ks test indicator values suggest smaller difference between observed and forecast distributions and better model performance interestingly the xaj mcqrnn model creates a pretty good similarity between observed and forecast distributions of the three parts at all horizons whereas the mcqrnn model only performs well when flood magnitudes are small part i from the table we can see that the probability density distribution of the forecasts acquired from the xaj mcqrnn model is more similar in shape to that of observations at each horizon in other words the values of the forecasts obtained from the xaj mcqrnn model in three parts are closer to those of observations in comparison to the forecasts obtained from the mcqrnn model the results demonstrate that the xaj mcqrnn model can not only sufficiently forecast the probability density distribution of flood data but also accurately forecast different flood magnitudes at four horizons in brief the point i e median forecasts of floods made by the xaj mcqrnn model offered solid evidence of good model performance and favorable stability in multi step ahead flood forecasting the next subsection is concerned with the comparison of the mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models for making interval forecasts of floods 4 2 reliability of mcqrnn models on interval forecasts of flood processes the interval forecasts of floods for the case of the quantiles 0 01 τ k 0 99 with an increment of 0 01 were employed to test the reliability of the two models mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn the back fitting algorithm with the autoregressive strategy zhang et al 2018 was also executed to correct the systematic bias of interval forecasts of the hybrid model table 4 provides the rb and cr values of the mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models in three stages at four horizons the results indicate that the xaj mcqrnn model acquires pretty good forecast accuracy at all the horizons whereas the mcqrnn model only performs well at shorter horizons of t 1 and t 2 cr is higher than 92 but rb is lower than 12 for 12 hour forecasts the xaj mcqrnn model can enhance the cr value by 1 5 up to 5 9 and decrease the rb values by 8 8 up to 25 7 in the testing stages as compared with the mcqrnn model this means the xaj mcqrnn model can not only significantly improve probabilistic forecast accuracy in terms of a narrow prediction interval as represented by cr values but also adequately eliminate the impacts of flood magnitudes on the bandwidth of the prediction intervals as represented by rb values the 12 hour forecast accuracy of the xaj mcqrnn model is superior to that of the mcqrnn model since the xaj mcqrnn model utilizes the streamflow forecasts made by the xaj model to reduce the uncertainties of the rainfall forecasts from the ecmwf whereas the mcqrnn model adopts the rainfall forecasts of the ecmwf to make multi step ahead flood forecasts in testing stages moreover to clearly determine the predictabilities of the mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models the three flood events a high flood magnitude with total precipitation of 134 mm and maximal streamflow of 14400 m3 s maximum streamflow with a return period of 45a b medium flood magnitude with total rainfall of 60 mm and maximal streamflow of 10100 m3 s the return period of this peak is 20a and c low flood magnitude with total rainfall of 26 mm and maximal streamflow of 5200 m3 s the return period of this peak is 10a were selected to examine both models by assessing whether the observed streamflow data fall within the 90 prediction interval i e 5 quantile 95 quantile at horizon t 4 in testing stages as illustrated in fig 5 three interesting results are acquired first the 90 prediction intervals made by the xaj mcqrnn model can cover the majority of the observed streamflow data in comparison to those of the mcqrnn model second the xaj mcqrnn model can create a predictive distribution narrower than that of the mcqrnn model in each flood event third the xaj mcqrnn model can largely mitigate the biased prediction phenomenon under prediction in our case the prediction interval aims to promote the sharpness of the predictive distributions as much as possible where sharpness is used to represent the concentration of the predictive distributions concerning short term forecasts the xaj mcqrnn model can raise the concentration of the predictive distributions while obtaining high coverage of the observed streamflow data in all cases the density distribution i e violin plot is also adopted to evaluate the reliability of interval forecasts fig 6 illustrates the predictive violin plots of the flood peaks of the above specified flood events at horizon t 4 in testing stages in each violin plot the probability density distribution of the forecasts made by the mcqrnn xaj mcqrnn model is located at the left right part while the statistical boxplot of all forecasts is located at the central part the violin plots point out that the difference between the forecasts acquired from mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models displays a trend climbing from the low the medium to the high values of flood peaks at horizon t 4 the bandwidths of the prediction intervals are notably larger in the medium high flood peaks than in the low flood peak due to the larger fluctuations of flood magnitudes in the former interestingly the range of kernel density functions corresponding to the xaj mcqrnn model is significantly narrower than that of the mcqrnn model while the central locations orange dashed lines of kernel density functions related to the xaj mcqrnn model are closer to the observed flood peaks purple points in all cases that means the xaj mcqrnn model produces higher sharpness and predictions with smaller bias than the mcqrnn model briefly the xaj mcqrnn model not only can produce more accurate and reliable probability density forecasts but also can alleviate the biased prediction phenomenon associated with the extreme flood events through integrating the data driven and conceptual based mechanisms for rainfall runoff modelling 5 conclusions and discussion the demand for the hybridization of machine learning and conceptual models is motivated by real world applications in the best interests of enhancing the accuracy and reliability of short term fpd forecasting this study proposed a hybrid rainfall runoff model i e xaj mcqrnn that integrated the xinanjiang xaj conceptual model and the mcqrnn to make short term fpd forecasts its capability of efficient learning and accurate forecasting is tested and verified with the long term 2009 2015 flood events at the jianxi river catchment in china the mcqrnn model is constructed and used for comparison purpose the results of median point forecasts on flood processes reveal that the proposed xaj mcqrnn model performs distinguishably better than the mcqrnn model in short term 12 h flood forecasting with higher nse and lower rmse values as well as a better goodness of fit to observed flood processes the results of interval forecasts of flood processes further demonstrate that the xaj mcqrnn model is superior to the mcqrnn model at four horizons the xaj mcqrnn model has smaller rb larger cr values and higher sharpness of the predictive distribution these achievements provide solid evidence that the xaj mcqrnn model can make considerably more reliable and accurate point and interval forecasts of flood processes at long forecast horizons and can more effectively overcome the phenomena of overfitting and time shift than the mcqrnn model moreover the reason that the xaj mcqrnn model is successful in obtaining superb probability density forecast results is attributed to the pivotal strategy that the xaj conceptual model supplements the point forecasts of flood processes through training the mcqrnn model to alleviate predictive uncertainty therefore the xaj mcqrnn by virtue of data driven and conceptual based hydrological models can provide forecasting and early warning of flood processes thus reducing flood risks associated with the extreme rainstorm phenomenon this study is a good demonstration of the hybrid approach which unites two different groups of scientists including data scientists and disciplinary scientists e g hydrologists to use the strength of various point forecasts meanwhile alleviating their weaknesses model combinations in the form of hybridization e g zhang et al 2018 lin et al 2020 hosseiny et al 2020 konapala et al 2020 kao et al 2021 have been applied to making short term flood point forecasts for basins with humid subtropical climate this is the first study to apply conceptual models with artificial neural networks for flood probability density fdp forecasting for such basins notwithstanding these promising achievements further research can be conducted to investigate the far reaching effects of short term and even long term flood probability forecasting and warning on flood prevention and water resources management in humid semi humid and arid areas by combining more hybrid

3794,making accurate and reliable probability density forecasts of flood processes is fundamentally challenging for machine learning techniques especially when prediction targets are outside the range of training data conceptual hydrological models can reduce rainfall runoff modelling errors with efficient quasi physical mechanisms the monotone composite quantile regression neural network mcqrnn is used for the first time to make probability density forecasts of flood processes and serves as a benchmark model whereas it confronts the drawbacks of overfitting and biased prediction here we propose an integrated model i e xaj mcqrnn that incorporates xinanjiang conceptual model xaj and mcqrnn to overcome the phenomena of error propagation and accumulation encountered in multi step ahead flood probability density forecasts we consider flood forecasts as a function of rainfall factors and runoff data the models are evaluated by long term 2009 2015 3 hour streamflow series of the jianxi river catchment in china and rainfall products of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts results demonstrated that the proposed xaj mcqrnn model can not only outperform the mcqrnn model but also prominently enhance the accuracy and reliability of multi step ahead probability density forecasts of flood process regarding short term forecasts in testing stages at four horizons the xaj mcqrnn model achieved higher nash sutcliffe efficiency but lower root mean square error values while improving coverage ratio and relative bandwidth values in comparison to the mcqrnn model consequently the improvement can benefit the mitigation of the impacts associated with uncertainties of extreme flood and rainfall events as well as promote the accuracy and reliability of flood forecasting and early warning keywords short term flood forecast probability density forecast monotone composite quantile regression conceptual model machine learning 1 introduction floods are among the world s costliest disasters and climate and anthropogenic changes have made catastrophic floods much more likely happen over the past century floods accounted for about 30 of natural disasters claiming more than 19 of the total fatalities and more than 48 of the total number of people affected adikari and yoshitani 2009 takeuchi et al 2018 flood forecasting and early warning play a pivotal role in geohazard mitigation floodplain management design and management of infrastructure projects agricultural cultivation and human daily life liu et al 2018 giuliani et al 2019 therefore accurate and reliable forecasting of flood processes during rainstorm events is extremely crucial and beneficial for a country or catchment whose prosperity is largely dependent on the optimum use of water resources and flood level control to date a wide variety of modelling frameworks have been introduced to model the complicated nonlinear rainfall runoff process sood and smakhtin 2015 shen 2018 kan et al 2020 in general these modelling frameworks can be categorized into three groups conceptual physically based and machine learning models a conceptual hydrological model typically includes prior knowledge as a necessary part of conceptual components possessing quasi physical mechanisms li et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 there are all sorts of spatially lumped and distributed conceptual models available with deterministic and stochastic parameter values for a given point or region a physically based model usually establishes a simplified catchment system and expresses the internal hydrological processes through several mathematical equations considering the spatial variability of rainfall and parameters li et al 2019 li and willems 2020 however physically based models encounter a much higher challenge when trying to achieve the required prediction accuracy due to limited watershed information an alternative the machine learning model constructs a direct mapping between rainfall and runoff variables and extracts their relationship according to the historical observations by machine learning algorithms without a piece of prior knowledge in relation to internal hydrological processes feng et al 2020 kao et al 2020 li et al 2020 lin et al 2020 nearing et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge the growth in machine learning for hydrological sciences is tied to advances in computing power as well as the vast increase of hydrological observations however machine learning models are purely data driven and do not have any physical mechanisms which easily lead to overfitting and biased predictions especially when prediction targets are unobserved and outside the range of rainfall runoff data adopted for model training hunter et al 2018 xie et al 2021 typically at longer forecast horizons the non availability of antecedent streamflow data makes it fundamentally challenging to maintain the forecast accuracy of data driven models such weakness imposes limitations on the applicability of data driven models in rainfall runoff studies schmidt et al 2020 zahura et al 2020 in comparison to physically based models conceptual models have been widely applied in rainfall runoff modelling owing to the practical and simple manner formulation of conceptual models signifies only a partial set of the real hydrological cycle processes this triggers several constraints like model calibration and parameter transferability difficulties humphrey et al 2016 kumanlioglu and fistikoglu 2019 in cases where forecasters and decision makers usually require prior knowledge for calibrating and running conceptual models to achieve reasonable accuracy of flood forecasts bandai and ghezzehei 2020 gu et al 2020 although conceptual and data driven models are derived from different philosophies they can help remedy and enhance each other with regard to their inherent limitations and strengths tian et al 2018 sun et al 2019 chadalawada et al 2020 hence a hybridization of both models is an attractive and effective approach for rainfall runoff modelling yong et al 2017 kurian et al 2019 ghaseminejad and uddameri 2020 for instance yang et al 2019 evaluated the integration of machine learning and conceptual models for flood simulation at 1032 streamflow gauging stations worldwide farfan et al 2020 adopted streamflow series forecasts made by a conceptual model as input data of back propagation neural networks to forecast streamflow data hitokoto and sakuraba 2020 integrated a rainfall runoff model and a feed forward artificial neural network to predict real time water level processes hosseiny et al 2020 integrated a two dimensional hydraulic model a random forest classification and a multilayer perceptron for modeling flood depth of the river segment of the flaming gorge dam in the northeast corner of utah in the us konapala et al 2020 verified hybrid models constructed by combining a conceptual model with a long short term memory neural network on their capability to simulate streamflow series in hundreds of catchments across the us the above mentioned studies explored hybrid models for flood prediction in watersheds with diverse climate conditions by means of point forecasts this study is the first to apply conceptual models with artificial neural networks incorporating flood probability density fpd forecasting for a humid subtropical climate exploration of conceptual and machine learning models for fpd forecasting in this study is owing to the following reasons first conceptual models possess superior operability while machine learning models possess efficient computation power and second physically based models usually have bottlenecks of low prediction accuracy and time consuming due to the limitation of available data or quality on the physical properties of watersheds liu et al 2018 li et al 2020 cui et al 2021 kao et al 2021 previous research regarding hybrid models mainly concentrated on point forecasts or interval predictions of flood processes by integrating conceptual models with single output artificial neural networks whereas to date no study has involved fpd forecasting point forecasting the most frequently used approach can provide a point estimate of the future flood as precisely as possible for each forecast horizon rather than offering single valued forecasts interval prediction approaches attempt to create well calibrated lower and upper bounds of each future prediction subject to a prescribed confidence level furthermore fpd forecasting can provide flood forecasts in the form of quantile point forecasts confidence interval forecasts and probability density functions although it needs extra efforts to calculate the probability for each possible prediction additional information gained is highly helpful to promote the full understanding of flood predictability fpd forecasting not only effectively quantifies the uncertainties in input datasets but also has the ability to construct the complete conditional probability density curves of future flood processes consequently there is a noticeable migration from point forecasts and interval predictions towards fpd forecasts where modelers seek to characterize the full probability distribution of flood events among machine learning techniques the monotone composite quantile regression neural network mcqrnn is a special type of multi output artificial neural networks ann that can effectively estimate multiple non crossing and nonlinear quantile functions simultaneously it is a novel and appealing approach for probability density forecasting as compared with other multi output anns like support vector machine and long short term memory cannon 2018 since mcqrnn applications do not exist in fpd forecasts it would be important and interesting to explore in depth conceptual hydrological models to decrease the uncertainty of multi output ann e g mcqrnn for fpd forecasting the novelty of this study relies on the integration of the xinanjiang xaj conceptual model and the innovative mcqrnn with a multi output task meanwhile this is the first application of the integrated xaj mcqrnn model for fpd forecasting there are three main steps in this approach first the conceptual hydrological model for rainfall runoff simulation was constructed to create point forecasts of flood processes and the outputs were used as inputs of the machine learning model second the multi output machine learning model for fpd forecasting was built to further create interval forecasts of flood processes after being supplied with point forecasts by the conceptual model third the training process of the hybrid model was optimized by an evolutionary optimization algorithm and the predictability of the hybrid model was tested by using medium range numeric rainfall forecast products the jianxi river catchment of china constituted the case study 2 methods this study aims to integrate the xaj and mcqrnn models for raising the accuracy and reliability of short term fpd forecasts fig 1 presents the main architectures utilized in this study the mcqrnn fig 1a and the proposed xaj mcqrnn model that combines xaj with mcqrnn models fig 1b 2 1 monotone composite quantile regression neural network mcqrnn the mcqrnn has been developed to effectively estimate multiple quantile functions for making probabilistic density forecasts of time series cannon 2018 in comparison to the quantile regression neural network qrnn taylor 2000 the monotone qrnn cannon 2011 and the composite qrnn xu et al 2017 the merit of the mcqrnn model is that it can estimate multiple non crossing non linear conditional quantile functions can allow for the constraints of optional

the gradient based nonlinear optimization algorithm kingma and ba 2015 cannon 2018 was used to optimize the weight w sj h w mj h w nj h and w jk o in eqs 1 a and 1 b and intercept b j h and b k o in eqs 1 a and 1 b parameters of the mcqrnn while the training process of the xaj mcqrnn was performed after being supplied with point forecasts by the xaj at the same time furthermore the genetic

rate η fig 2 illustrates the flow chart of the xaj mcqrnn training process the implementation procedure is described as follows step 1 randomly generate an initial population x0 of size ipop with respect to the hyperparameters integer coded and real coded solutions are adopted for hyperparameters imax and j as well as for hyperparameters λ h λ o and η respectively the search spaces of imax j λ h λ o and α are set to be 200 500 1 30 0 001 0 01 0 001 0 01 and 0 001 0 05 respectively step 2 perform the gradient based nonlinear optimization algorithm for optimizing weight and intercept

of the mcqrnn is based on the freely available qrnn package https cran r project org package qrnn as river streamflow data are time series this study applied the root mean square error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the mutual information mi to evaluate the point forecast results of the two mcqrnn models the rmse value indicates the error between forecasts and observations and its value ranges from 0 to infinity legates and mccabe 1999 the nse is commonly employed to evaluate the forecast accuracy of hydrological models and its value ranges from negative infinity to 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 considering that the upper bound 1 of the nse doesn t leave much room for improvement a logarithm conversion for the nse lnse is used instead of an unbounded quality indicator to evaluate model accuracy the mi value suggests the goodness of fit between forecasts and observations and its value ranges from 0 to infinity shannon 1948 a model with low rmse and high lnse and mi

2020 the coverage ratio cr of the forecast interval relative to observations and the relative bandwidth rb of the forecast interval xiong and o connor 2008 were used to evaluate the accuracy of the forecast interval results in this study the cr represents the coverage interval of the forecasts and its value ranges from 0 to 100 the rb represents the width of the forecast interval and its value ranges from 0 to infinity a model with its cr value closer to 100 and its rb closer to 0 implies it can forecast more accurately the computations of cr and rb values are depicted as follows 8 c r 1 d

horizon t with respect to a given confidence level e g 90 respectively e g l 5 u 95 the θ t values are either one or zero in which one implies the observed data fall within its forecast intervals while zero implies the observed data fall outside of its forecast intervals at t time 3 study area and materials 3 1 study area the jianxi river catchment with an area of 14787 km2 is located in southern china fig 3 the catchment climate is affected by the southwest indian ocean and southeast pacific ocean subtropical monsoons and regional landforms lin et al 2020 the annual rainfall ranges from 1800 mm to 2200 mm and the annual runoff ranges from 950 to 1700 mm the highest amount 74 of which occurs within six months april september due to the moist and rainy features as well as red yellow and paddy soils runoff production of this catchment is dominated by the runoff generation on repletion of storage which is in line with the typical rainfall runoff characteristics in southern china 3 2 materials this study collected the data associated with flood events during the flood season april 1st september 30th including the 3 hour time step rainfall data of 16 gauge stations the 3 hour evaporation of 3 gauge stations and the 3 hour streamflow data of the qilijie hydrological station from 2009 to 2015 and the 3 hour forecast rainfall of era interim datasets of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf from 2014 to 2015 the spatial resolution of each grid in era interim is 0 125 e 0 125 n while 32 grid points are required to fully cover the jianxi river catchment fig 3 more details on the era interim datasets of the ecmwf can be found in berrisford et al 2011 the areal mean value of observed rainfall data was calculated by using the datasets of 16 gauge stations colored in green fig 3 the areal mean value of observed evaporation data was calculated by using the datasets of 3 gauge stations colored in purple fig 3 and the areal mean value of forecast rainfall data was calculated by using the datasets of 32 grid points through the thiessen polygon method thiessen 1911 a total of 20 448 8 time step 365 days 6 non leap years 8 time step 366 days 1 leap year time series values were divided into three datasets for model training 8760 from 2009 to 2011 validation 5848 from 2012 to 2013 and testing 5840 from 2014 to 2015 the training dataset was applied to adjusting the parameters weights and intercepts of the xaj model the mcqrnn model the validation dataset was applied to checking whether a prediction model is overfitted or undertrained the test dataset was applied to evaluating the model prediction accuracy 3 3 model construction a 12 hour forecast horizon has been considered in this study since the longest transform time in the rainfall runoff processes is 12 h in this catchment besides the current forecast horizon at the qilijie station is only 6 h inducing the demand for improving the lead time and forecast accuracy in the light of the observed 3 hour rainfall runoff datasets of the jianxi river catchment the model output was set to be t 1 horizon 3 h up to t 4 horizon 12 h time step ahead streamflow where t is the current time as aforementioned the ga was performed to determine the optimal hyperparameters in association with mcqrnn models at four horizons the optimal values of the maximal iteration imax the number of nodes j the regulation coefficients λ h and λ o and the learning rate η were 300 12 0 006 0 004 and 0 009 respectively while the weight and intercept parameters optimized by the gradient based nonlinear optimization algorithm within the qrnn package were adopted in this study this study adopted the partial mutual information and partial weights pmi pw method sharma et al 2016 to quantify the contribution of input combination to model performance table 1 to estimate the input variables weights for constructing the mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models the following framework was adopted apart from the observed streamflow and rainfall data traced back to the previous 12 h the rainfall of the era interim during horizon t 1 up to t 4 was used to train validate and test the former while the forecast streamflow of the xaj model during horizon t 1 up to t 4 was used to train validate and test the latter 4 results to improve the predictability and reliability of fpd forecasts this study intends to explore and evaluate the accuracy of the xaj model coupled with the mcqrnn on short term 12 h flood forecasts at different horizons the results findings and discussion were as follows 4 1 reliability of xaj and mcqrnn models on point forecasts of flood processes the point forecasts of floods under the circumstance of the quantile τ k 0 5 i e median forecasts were specified to test the reliability of the constructed models table 2 summarizes the rmse lnse and mi values of the xaj mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models in training validation and testing stages at four horizons it is apparent from this table that the xaj mcqrnn model performs better than the xaj and mcqrnn models in the three stages at four horizons take the testing stage for example the lnse and mi values of the xaj mcqrnn model exceed 0 90 and 22 respectively while the rmse values are 140 m3 s two main results are acquired from the table 2 firstly the comparison of the xaj mcqrnn and xaj models in the testing stage reveals that there are significant differences in the improvement rates of rmse and nse values at four horizons the improvement rates of rmse lnse mi for median flood forecasting reach 4 7 9 0 4 3 and 5 2 17 0 6 1 at horizons t 1 and t 2 respectively while they increased to 6 6 22 2 8 8 and 8 1 28 4 11 2 at horizons t 3 and t 4 respectively secondly the comparison of the xaj mcqrnn and mcqrnn models in the testing stage points out that the former can provide stable forecast results after being supplied with point forecasts by the xaj model either at shorter horizons t 1 and t 2 or at longer horizons t 3 and t 4 that is to say the xaj mcqrnn model can effectively extract the dependence between rainfall and runoff processes even in the case of the12 hour forecast horizon the fluctuations of forecast rainfalls are stronger at long horizons t 3 and t 4 than at short horizons t 1 and t 2 higher fluctuations of forecast rainfall data are easy to induce overfitting problems which would demand more complex models to mimic the relationship between rainfall and runoff this is considered as a driver to improve the forecast of the xaj mcqrnn model to further evaluate the forecast accuracy of mcqrnn models for making median forecasts of floods the regression analysis of the observed and forecast streamflow data is presented in fig 4 it is too hard to judge the difference in model quality when the correlation between observations and forecasts is high however this is different for the case of low correlation where the gap between the regression and 45 degree lines is large a large gap denotes a significant biased prediction from the standpoint of correlation fig 4 the xaj mcqrnn model can more adequately alleviate the biased prediction phenomenon under prediction in our case because of the larger values of the coefficient of determination r2 as well as the smaller gaps between the regression and 45 degree lines compared to the mcqrnn model as expected there are higher correlations between observations and forecasts at horizons t 1 and t 2 whereas larger improvements of the correlation between observations and forecasts occur at horizons t 3 and t 4 the hybrid model still consistently underestimates most flood processes fig 4 the back fitting algorithm with the autoregressive strategy zhang et al 2018 was performed to correct the systematic bias of point forecasts of the hybrid model after implementing bias correction table 3 summarizes the kolmogorov smirnov ks test results from the standpoint of density distribution due to the high variation of flood datasets streamflow value 1000 m3 s the observations at each horizon are divided into three parts part i 1000 m3 s value 3000 m3 s part ii 3000 m3 s value 9000 m3 s and part iii value 9000 m3 s to effectively examine the predictability of the proposed model at various flood magnitudes the larger ks test indicator values suggest smaller difference between observed and forecast distributions and better model performance interestingly the xaj mcqrnn model creates a pretty good similarity between observed and forecast distributions of the three parts at all horizons whereas the mcqrnn model only performs well when flood magnitudes are small part i from the table we can see that the probability density distribution of the forecasts acquired from the xaj mcqrnn model is more similar in shape to that of observations at each horizon in other words the values of the forecasts obtained from the xaj mcqrnn model in three parts are closer to those of observations in comparison to the forecasts obtained from the mcqrnn model the results demonstrate that the xaj mcqrnn model can not only sufficiently forecast the probability density distribution of flood data but also accurately forecast different flood magnitudes at four horizons in brief the point i e median forecasts of floods made by the xaj mcqrnn model offered solid evidence of good model performance and favorable stability in multi step ahead flood forecasting the next subsection is concerned with the comparison of the mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models for making interval forecasts of floods 4 2 reliability of mcqrnn models on interval forecasts of flood processes the interval forecasts of floods for the case of the quantiles 0 01 τ k 0 99 with an increment of 0 01 were employed to test the reliability of the two models mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn the back fitting algorithm with the autoregressive strategy zhang et al 2018 was also executed to correct the systematic bias of interval forecasts of the hybrid model table 4 provides the rb and cr values of the mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models in three stages at four horizons the results indicate that the xaj mcqrnn model acquires pretty good forecast accuracy at all the horizons whereas the mcqrnn model only performs well at shorter horizons of t 1 and t 2 cr is higher than 92 but rb is lower than 12 for 12 hour forecasts the xaj mcqrnn model can enhance the cr value by 1 5 up to 5 9 and decrease the rb values by 8 8 up to 25 7 in the testing stages as compared with the mcqrnn model this means the xaj mcqrnn model can not only significantly improve probabilistic forecast accuracy in terms of a narrow prediction interval as represented by cr values but also adequately eliminate the impacts of flood magnitudes on the bandwidth of the prediction intervals as represented by rb values the 12 hour forecast accuracy of the xaj mcqrnn model is superior to that of the mcqrnn model since the xaj mcqrnn model utilizes the streamflow forecasts made by the xaj model to reduce the uncertainties of the rainfall forecasts from the ecmwf whereas the mcqrnn model adopts the rainfall forecasts of the ecmwf to make multi step ahead flood forecasts in testing stages moreover to clearly determine the predictabilities of the mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models the three flood events a high flood magnitude with total precipitation of 134 mm and maximal streamflow of 14400 m3 s maximum streamflow with a return period of 45a b medium flood magnitude with total rainfall of 60 mm and maximal streamflow of 10100 m3 s the return period of this peak is 20a and c low flood magnitude with total rainfall of 26 mm and maximal streamflow of 5200 m3 s the return period of this peak is 10a were selected to examine both models by assessing whether the observed streamflow data fall within the 90 prediction interval i e 5 quantile 95 quantile at horizon t 4 in testing stages as illustrated in fig 5 three interesting results are acquired first the 90 prediction intervals made by the xaj mcqrnn model can cover the majority of the observed streamflow data in comparison to those of the mcqrnn model second the xaj mcqrnn model can create a predictive distribution narrower than that of the mcqrnn model in each flood event third the xaj mcqrnn model can largely mitigate the biased prediction phenomenon under prediction in our case the prediction interval aims to promote the sharpness of the predictive distributions as much as possible where sharpness is used to represent the concentration of the predictive distributions concerning short term forecasts the xaj mcqrnn model can raise the concentration of the predictive distributions while obtaining high coverage of the observed streamflow data in all cases the density distribution i e violin plot is also adopted to evaluate the reliability of interval forecasts fig 6 illustrates the predictive violin plots of the flood peaks of the above specified flood events at horizon t 4 in testing stages in each violin plot the probability density distribution of the forecasts made by the mcqrnn xaj mcqrnn model is located at the left right part while the statistical boxplot of all forecasts is located at the central part the violin plots point out that the difference between the forecasts acquired from mcqrnn and xaj mcqrnn models displays a trend climbing from the low the medium to the high values of flood peaks at horizon t 4 the bandwidths of the prediction intervals are notably larger in the medium high flood peaks than in the low flood peak due to the larger fluctuations of flood magnitudes in the former interestingly the range of kernel density functions corresponding to the xaj mcqrnn model is significantly narrower than that of the mcqrnn model while the central locations orange dashed lines of kernel density functions related to the xaj mcqrnn model are closer to the observed flood peaks purple points in all cases that means the xaj mcqrnn model produces higher sharpness and predictions with smaller bias than the mcqrnn model briefly the xaj mcqrnn model not only can produce more accurate and reliable probability density forecasts but also can alleviate the biased prediction phenomenon associated with the extreme flood events through integrating the data driven and conceptual based mechanisms for rainfall runoff modelling 5 conclusions and discussion the demand for the hybridization of machine learning and conceptual models is motivated by real world applications in the best interests of enhancing the accuracy and reliability of short term fpd forecasting this study proposed a hybrid rainfall runoff model i e xaj mcqrnn that integrated the xinanjiang xaj conceptual model and the mcqrnn to make short term fpd forecasts its capability of efficient learning and accurate forecasting is tested and verified with the long term 2009 2015 flood events at the jianxi river catchment in china the mcqrnn model is constructed and used for comparison purpose the results of median point forecasts on flood processes reveal that the proposed xaj mcqrnn model performs distinguishably better than the mcqrnn model in short term 12 h flood forecasting with higher nse and lower rmse values as well as a better goodness of fit to observed flood processes the results of interval forecasts of flood processes further demonstrate that the xaj mcqrnn model is superior to the mcqrnn model at four horizons the xaj mcqrnn model has smaller rb larger cr values and higher sharpness of the predictive distribution these achievements provide solid evidence that the xaj mcqrnn model can make considerably more reliable and accurate point and interval forecasts of flood processes at long forecast horizons and can more effectively overcome the phenomena of overfitting and time shift than the mcqrnn model moreover the reason that the xaj mcqrnn model is successful in obtaining superb probability density forecast results is attributed to the pivotal strategy that the xaj conceptual model supplements the point forecasts of flood processes through training the mcqrnn model to alleviate predictive uncertainty therefore the xaj mcqrnn by virtue of data driven and conceptual based hydrological models can provide forecasting and early warning of flood processes thus reducing flood risks associated with the extreme rainstorm phenomenon this study is a good demonstration of the hybrid approach which unites two different groups of scientists including data scientists and disciplinary scientists e g hydrologists to use the strength of various point forecasts meanwhile alleviating their weaknesses model combinations in the form of hybridization e g zhang et al 2018 lin et al 2020 hosseiny et al 2020 konapala et al 2020 kao et al 2021 have been applied to making short term flood point forecasts for basins with humid subtropical climate this is the first study to apply conceptual models with artificial neural networks for flood probability density fdp forecasting for such basins notwithstanding these promising achievements further research can be conducted to investigate the far reaching effects of short term and even long term flood probability forecasting and warning on flood prevention and water resources management in humid semi humid and arid areas by combining more hybrid
