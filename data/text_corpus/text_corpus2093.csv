10465,tomato solanum lycopersicum l is a globally important vegetable recognized for its positive health benefits as most of the vegetable production tomato require significant amount of agronomic inputs however recent shifts in climate patterns in terms of timing and amount in rainfall patterns in air temperature and the associated extreme events have caused harm and disruption to the agricultural sector worldwide the objective of this study was to i evaluate the ability of a crop simulation model to simulate yield and growth parameter of a processing tomato in south west italy ii quantify the impacts of projected climate on business as usual agronomic practices iii understand the role of projected changes and increased co2 on the water and nutrient efficiency field trials from an open field at sele valley 40 35 03 8 n 14 58 48 6 e salerno south west italy during a two year period 2004 2005 were used baseline climate data 1984 2018 were available and four contrasting projections were selected as function of their spread in terms of changes in growing season rainfall and temperature respect to the baseline the crop model dssat decision support system of agrotechnology transfer was used for this study the model was able to simulate tomato response to n fertilization with acceptable error levels respect to the ones reported in literature the projected increase in air temperature and changes in rainfall caused a shortening ranging from 1 5 to 3 days in tomato phenology causing an overall 15 reduction in tomato yield to offset the negative impact of rainfall and temperature changes additional irrigation water from 85 to 110 mm and nitrogen rate from 20 to 30 kg n ha 1 is needed however the increase in irrigation water does not translate in significant yield increase and caused an increase in water and nitrogen use efficiency of less than 10 keywords yield tomato modelling drought irrigation fertilization 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l is a globally important vegetable that has been recognized for his positive health benefits being rich in antioxidants and low in cholesterol saturated fats and sodium capanoglu et al 2010 friedman et al 2000 2010 migliori et al 2017 there are two types of cultivated tomato the one for fresh consumption and the one used for industrial transformation processing which is usually grown under field conditions the global production of processing tomato in 2019 was about 3 7 million metric tons faostat 2020 wptc 2019 italy is the biggest eu producer of processing tomato contributing by 13 of the global processing tomato wptc 2019 as most of the vegetable production tomato require significant amount of agronomic inputs ronga et al 2019a b stated that the amount of irrigation water needed by the crop ranges between 400 and 600 mm the requirement for nitrogen n fertilization varies during the growing season with the highest demand during the vegetative phase and an overall uptake of about 300 kg n ha 1 ronga et al 2017 while past research has focused on optimizing the amount of water and n that maximize yield and quality recent studies have shown how deficit irrigation and partial root zone irrigation can produce similar yield levels and better nutritional qualities with respect to the full irrigation wei et al 2018 n management is a factor impacting plant growth photosynthesis and quality of the fruits and is generally applied at small doses during the growing season for avoiding excessive n losses and often in fertigation with irrigated water wang et al 2010 ronga et al 2015 however recent shifts in climate patterns in terms of timing and amount in rainfall patterns in air temperature and the associated extreme events have caused harm and disruption to the agricultural sector worldwide this will also cause problems to the processing tomato industry for optimizing water and n managements in addition atmospheric carbon dioxide aco2 has been increasing over the years reaching the present value of 413 ppm tans and keeling 2020 the aco2 plays an important role in leaf photosynthesis crop growth and yield ainsworth and long 2005 the interaction of increased aco2 changes in air temperature rainfall and their impacts on the processing tomato has been quantified in few modelling studies in the mediterranean basin giuliani et al 2020 rinaldi et al 2007 ventrella et al 2011 crop growth models are computerized representations of the dynamic interaction between the soil plant atmosphere continuums and have been extensively used in climate change impact studies cammarano et al 2019 asseng et al 2014 the application of crop growth models for impact studies on tomato is limited rinaldi et al 2007 found that a combination of deficit irrigation in the amount of 400 mm for a growing season along with n fertilization of 200 kg n ha 1 optimizes tomato production in the foggia growing area south east italy in addition the impact of climate change in the same area causes an acceleration in phenology decreasing dry matter dm production and reducing crop yield however the optimization of irrigation and fertilization strategies would offset some of the negative impacts of climate ventrella et al 2011 in most climate change impact studies researchers chose one or few global climate models gcm and made climate impacts assumptions based on those climate outputs ruane and mcdermid 2017 showed how among the gcms their response in terms of temperature and rainfall interactions is rather diverse with some having peculiar behavior picking few or the ensemble of them without considering the uncertainty around the projections can lead to inconsistencies ruane and mcdermid 2017 comparing the obtained results against other studies from different geographical areas is often biased because of the chosen gcm in fact the approach suggested by ruane and mcdermid 2017 can be used to subset a number of gcms into a smaller subset in relation to the information that are important to maintain such information can be decided a priori and can help to quantify the climate change impacts in a uniform way across different geographical regions cammarano et al 2020 2019 ruane et al 2015 therefore in order to make an informed assessment of climate change impacts on agricultural crop the abovementioned approach would be the optimal solution the south west of italy is an important area of tomato production ronga et al 2015 with a different climate than the eastern zone and no impact studies in this area exist the objective of this study was to i evaluate the ability of a crop simulation model to simulate yield and growth parameter of a processing tomato produced in south west italy ii quantify the impacts of projected climate on business as usual agronomic practices iii understand the role of projected changes and increased co2 on the water and nutrient efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design field trials were carried out in an open field at sele valley 40 35 03 8 n 14 58 48 6 e salerno south west italy during a two year period 2004 2005 in a typical haploxerepts soil soil survey staff 2014 the soil had the following characteristics sand 26 8 silt 40 8 clay 32 4 limestone 2 4 ph 7 8 organic matter 1 6 total nitrogen 1 3 p 55 mg kg 1 and k 271 mg kg 1 lambers and barrow 2020 2 1 1 crop production the cultivar messapico nunhems s agata bolognese bo italy with elongated fruit was transplanted with a density of 3 seedlings m 2 plants were transplanted the 5th of may 2004 and 9th of may 2005 using twin rows with of 0 35 m between each row of the twin and 0 35 m between plants in the row while the distance between the twin rows was 1 7 m the total p2o5 and k2o rates were calculated according to the soil analysis and administered at ploughing regarding n fertilization six rates were considered 0 50 100 150 200 and 250 kg of n ha 1 with the 250 kg n ha 1 lower than the rate used by farmers 290 kg n ha 1 a randomized complete block design was used using four replicates each of 4 0 m 5 1 m irrigation scheduling was based on crop evapotranspiration etc and calculated as etc eto kc where eto reference evapotranspiration was determined as suggested by hargreaves and samani 1985 and kc crop coefficient for tomato crop was adjusted considering the environmental conditions and the crop growth stage allen et al 1998 in each plot 100 etc was restored when 40 of the total available water was depleted in accordance to doorenbos and pruitt 1977 totals of 255 and 294 mm of water were applied in 2004 and 2005 respectively by drip irrigation weed control and plant protection were done according to the cultivation protocols of the campania region italy a single harvest was done the 9th of aug 2004 and 5th of aug 2005 when the ripe fruits accounted for approximately 85 of the total 2 1 2 parameters recorded in open field the main physiological and morphological parameters were biweekly assessed in five in 2004 and four in 2005 sampling times on two plants per plot in the first growing season 2004 the sampling corresponded to the following physiological stages 1 beginning of flowering stage 6 1 meier 2001 2 full flowering stage 6 3 3 beginning of fruit development stage 7 1 4 fruit and seed ripening stage 8 1 5 fully ripe stage 8 9 meier 2001 while in the second growing season 2005 sampling started at full flowering stage until fully ripe stage for the destructive parameters two plants were collected at each time point leaving at least another two neighboring plants on each side by digging plants to a soil depth of 40 cm then washing away the soil from the roots the leaf fruit ripe and un ripe and total biomass dry weights were recorded in addition leaf area index lai was measured using a subsample of fresh leaves that was run through an li 3000a leaf area meter li cor lincoln ne usa and this was linked to the leaf dry weight the mean values and the standard deviation of the parameters recorded in the open field were used in the manuscript when referring to the observed data table 1 2 2 climate data the baseline climate data was obtained from the weather station located directly in the experimental farm where the open filed study was carried out and included daily weather data from 1984 to 2018 daily incoming solar radiation mj d 1 m 2 maximum and minimum air temperature c and rainfall mm the climate projections to near future 2010 2040 were computed forty global climate models gcms were used to compute the changes in monthly temperatures and monthly rainfalls resulting in 40 future weather scenarios the climate model projections were from the global couple model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 for this study rcp 4 5 was used where the rcps are a greenhouse gas concentration trajectory which are consistent with the ranges of possible changes of greenhouse gas emissions for example the rcp 4 5 assumed that the greenhouse gas emission peaks around 2040 and then decline further details of the rcps and methodology can be found on the ipcc website intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2019 a corresponding elevated co2 eco2 level of 538 ppm was used when simulating crop response for the mid century the baseline level of co2 380 ppm was used when simulating the baseline period 1980 2010 the baseline weather data was perturbed using the dssat perturb software www climsystems com the software used the baseline weather data of the weather station available in the experimental farm where the open field study was performed and the cmip5 gcm projections to generate 40 daily weather files using the algorithms and approaches described in details in yin et al 2013 following the approach of ruane and mcdermid 2017 the percent change in growing season rainfall april to august and the absolute changes in air temperature april to august respect to the baseline were calculated and resulting data plotted using the same methodology described in ruane and mcdermid 2017 however in this study it was decided to select 4 gcms representing the different position in the rain temperature change spaces the aim was to select 4 gcms gcm1 gcm2 gcm3 and gcm4 with contrasting combinations of rain and temperature changes respect to the spread of the gcms table 2 2 3 crop simulation model the crop model dssat decision support system of agrotechnology transfer version 4 7 was used for this study jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2012 the crop model has many different modules that communicate with each other to simulate the daily interactions of soil plant climate agronomic management the main crop growth models within the dssat framework are the ceres based models used often to simulate cereals and the cropgro based models originally developed for legume crops boote et al 1998 the cropgro was a generic crop model that has been adapted to a variety of crops along with tomato koo 2002 the soil water is simulated with a tipping bucket approach in which precipitation and or irrigation is the run off infiltrated evaporated uptake by crop or lost by drainage as described in detail in ritchie 1998 the crop was subjected to water stress when the ratio between potential crop transpiration demand and potential root water uptake uptake fell below a certain threshold ritchie 1998 water stress impacts different processes from expansive growth to photosynthesis any of these processes have a threshold value of the demand uptake ratio for this study we considered the impact of water stress on expansive growth processes because they are the ones most sensitive to water deficit the index ranges between 0 no stress to 1 maximum stress boote et al 2008 the soil n module simulated the mineralization immobilization processes n leaching nitrification denitrification volatilization and all the different crop n uptake and redistribution of n in the crop jones et al 2003 crop n uptake was simulated matching the potential supply of soil n with crop n demand the crop n demand was made of a deficiency demand that is the quantity of n required to restore the actual n concentration to the critical n concentration in addition the crop n demand was also made of a component that is needed for new growth godwin and singh 1998 the input data consisted in the daily weather data soil data agronomic management in terms of timing and input amount and the amount of soil water and soil mineral n prior sowing initial conditions the model was calibrated using the highest fertilized treatment 250 n of both 2004 and 2005 growing seasons and evaluated on the other treatments the amount of irrigation and fertilization for the baseline simulations was chosen in order to minimize the water stress on expansive growth it was aimed at keeping the water stress index somewhere below 0 5 but not to 0 because with deficit irrigation techniques a small amount of stress that would not negatively affect growth is allowed the n fertilization was applied at key stages when also water was applied the amounts found in this way were referred to baseline next the crop model was run with the selected gcms but with the same irrigation fertilization amount and aco2 concentration as the baseline bco2 birr then with elevated atmospheric co2 concentration eco2 and baseline irrigation fertilization amount eco2 birr and finally with the elevated atmospheric co2 concentration and adjusted irrigation fertilization amount to keep the water stress factor below the 0 5 threshold eco2 eirr table 2 2 4 data analysis the simulated and observed values were evaluated using the root mean square error that is calculated as follows 1 r m s e i 1 o i s i 2 n where o i were the observations s i the simulations and n was the number of comparisons a second index used to evaluate the crop model respect to the observation was the wilmott index of agreement d index with values ranging between 0 poor fit and 1 indicating a good fit usually d index values above 0 5 are to be considered acceptable the d index expressed the measure of the goodness of fit and has been used as cross comparison method between models wilmott 1982 martre et al 2015 cammarano et al 2019 2 d 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o s i o 2 where o is the mean of the observed values the relative change in terms of yield water nitrogen and transpiration use efficiencies respect to the baseline was calculated as follows 3 r c s f g i s b i s b i 100 where s f g i was the simulated s value as predicted by the gcm g for a given growing season i and s b g i was the baseline b value simulated for the growing season i the box and whiskers plots were used to plot the relative changes and the horizontal line in the box represented the median the box was the 25th and the 75th percentiles the whiskers the 10th and 90th percentiles all the figures were made using ggplot2 wickham 2016 3 results 3 1 observed data the observed lai values ranged between 0 7 and 5 1 across the years and treatments for which there were statistical significant differences table 1 there was a difference in the values between the growing season 2004 and 2005 at different n levels with the 0 n showing overall higher values in 2004 than 2005 and the 250 n showing higher values in 2005 table 1 overall the leaf weight values statistically significant and were higher for the growing season 2004 with values ranging between 534 and 2328 kg dm ha 1 while in 2005 they ranged between 354 and 1534 kg dm ha 1 table 1 aboveground biomass and tomato yield showed similar patterns with values higher for the growing season 2004 among all the treatments both parameters were not statistically different among treatments and years table 1 the standard deviations of the measured parameters increased at higher n fertilization levels for both years when comparing the same sampling date for example the standard deviation of the tomato yield at harvest in 2005 was 172 6 kg dm ha 1 for the n0 and 1081 kg dm ha 1 for the 250 n table 1 from the observed patterns the tomato dry yield in 2005 was lower than in 2004 but with higher standard deviation table 1 this also resulted in different yield peaks to n inputs with the maximum yield in 2004 and 2005 achieved at 250 and 150 kg n ha 1 respectively 3 2 climate data the historical long term 1984 2018 maximum and minimum air temperatures and rainfall were shown in fig 1 the maximum air temperature showed an increasing trend for the month of april which was usually the tomato transplanting time with an annual increase of 0 07 c while for the other months the increase was much smaller fig 1a the minimum air temperature showed a similar pattern of the maximum air temperature with april begin the month of the higher annual increase with a 0 054 c fig 1b the cumulative rainfall for the month of april to august showed an increase for each month except for april where the cumulative rainfall from 1984 to 2018 decreased fig 1c the 40 gcms and their growing season precipitation and temperature changes were reported in fig 2 while the full list is shown in supplemental table 1 the range of rainfall change varied between 43 and 5 respect to the baseline growing season rainfall fig 2 while the growing season temperature was higher between 0 8 and 2 4 c than the baseline fig 2 the selection of the 4 gcm used in this study were shown with the circle in fig 2 and where defined with respect to the general spread of the gcms their range of temperature and rainfall changes respect to the baseline was reported in table 2 they were identified i gcm1 with 42 6 rain and 1 3 c table 1 and blue circle in fig 2 ii gcm2 with 22 7 rain and 2 4 c table 1 and red circle in fig 2 iii gcm3 with 2 7 rain and 0 8 c table 1 and green circle in fig 2 and iv gcm4 with 7 4 rain and 1 5 c table 1 and black circle in fig 2 3 3 crop model calibration and evaluation the results of the calibration were shown in fig 3 and the crop parameters in supplemental table 2 the simulated lai showed a rmse of 0 95 and a d index of 0 69 while the simulated leaf weight showed a rmse of 449 kg dm ha 1 and a d index of 0 67 fig 3a b aboveground biomass and tomato yield showed good agreement between observed and simulated results with a rmse of 1584 kg dm ha 1 and 1039 kg dm ha 1 and a d index of 0 93 and 0 95 respectively fig 3c d overall these rmse values correspond to 14 of the maximum yield and biomass values the evaluation of the dssat tomato on the remaining experiments was shown in fig 4 overall the rmses were 0 68 415 kg dm ha 1 1648 kg dm ha 1 and 1008 kg dm ha 1 for lai leaf weight aboveground biomass and yield respectively while the d index was 0 85 for lai 0 72 for leaf weight 0 91 for aboveground biomass and 0 94 for yield fig 4 similarly the rmse values for yield and biomass correspond to 13 and 15 of their maximum values respectively the observed crop flowering date was 7 jun for both years while the simulated was 9 jun 2004 and 6 jun 2004 data not shown the crop coefficients calibrated for the cropgro tomato were shown in supplemental material table 2 3 4 climate change impacts the relationship between simulated days to flowering and mean air temperature for the different gcms was shown in fig 5 overall the increase in temperature caused a shortening in phenology of 1 5 days for the gcm3 and of 3 days for the gcm2 fig 5a the impact of the different gcms and irrigation co2 combinations are shown in fig 5b overall the baseline processing tomato yield varied between 7000 9000 kg dm ha 1 depending on mean air temperature values there was a statistically significant difference among the simulated yields under different gcm and management combination p 0 001 the impact of the changes in rainfall and temperature given the same aco2 and irrigation caused a decrease in tomato yield for all the four different gcms fig 5b the impact of elevated co2 caused an increase of simulated yield for the gcm3 gcm1 and gcm4 but the gcm2 scenario showed a statistical significant decrease in simulated yield especially when the mean air temperature was above 25 c in this condition both the bco2 birr and eco2 birr showed a drastic decrease in simulated yield to values ranging between 2900 and 3200 kg dm ha 1 fig 5b when the irrigation and the fertilization were adjusted there was a positive impact on the simulated yield black dots in fig 5b which was evident for the gcm3 gcm1 and gcm4 the gcm2 showed that at mean air temperatures between 23 and 25 c the yields might increase but above that threshold even the new irrigation amount was not able to offset the shortening of the phenology fig 5a and b the baseline irrigation amount was 435 mm and the fertilization was 299 kg n ha 1 under the 4 projected climate the additional amount of irrigation water would be 110 93 85 and 85 mm for the gcm1 gcm2 gcm3 and gcm4 respectively fig 6 a furthermore the additional amount of n fertilizer was 20 kg n ha 1 for the gcm1 scenario and 30 kg n ha 1 for the others fig 6b most of the additional water and n inputs were given between transplanting to flowering about 30 days after transplanting data not shown the relative changes of simulated yield nitrogen use efficiency nue water use efficiency wue and transpiration use efficiency teff were shown in fig 7 the impact of rainfall and temperature changes without considering changing in aco2 and irrigation water and fertilization bco2 birr showed a negative yield change between across the 4 gcms ranging between 5 and 25 fig 7 in addition the nue wue and teff showed reductions from 5 to 30 in efficiency under the bco2 birr the impact of elevated co2 on baseline irrigation and fertilization eco2 birr showed a mean 10 increase in yield under the gcm1 gcm3 and gcm4 fig 7 however the gcm2 showed contrasting results with a mean change of 0 and a response from 20 to 20 in yield fig 7 the nue was increased under the gcm1 gcm3 and gcm4 scenarios by about 12 but it showed a similar pattern of the yield changes for the gcm2 fig 7 the wue for the gcm2 showed negative results for the eco2 birr with a mean decrease of about 13 fig 7 the relative transpiration efficiency change was negative for gcm1 gcm3 and gcm4 with mean values ranging between 10 and 25 fig 7 when the agronomic management was adjusted irrigation and fertilization eco2 eirr the relative yield showed some minimal but statistically significant p 0 001 increase respect to the eco2 birr with some positive impact on the gcm4 however the nue decreased under all the 4 gcms and wue and teff did not show significant increases fig 7 4 discussions projected changes in growing season show a reduction of rainfall and an increase of the temperatures indicating a considerable increase in irrigation water and n fertilization impacting on the processing tomato sustainability 4 1 observed data the observed treatments showed a positive response to the highest n fertilization 250 n where the highest lai and aboveground biomass were observed for both growing seasons table 1 these results agree with findings of scholberg et al 2000 and farneselli et al 2013 and for different crop in similar environments by tedone et al 2014 and conversa et al 2019 ronga et al 2019 demonstrated how the increase in n rates will affect aboveground biomass accumulation without impacting the allocation to the different organs 4 2 climate data the use of historical weather data showed that during the tomato growing season april to august the transplanting month april is getting hotter and drier this means that the current climate variability is already impacting the amount of water that needs to be provided after transplanting previous studies have reported the impacts of agronomic management on tomato yield but neglecting the climate impacts higashide and heuvelink 2009 migliori et al 2017 rinaldi et al 2007 using 53 years of historical weather data from foggia south east italy found the total amount of water that would optimize environmental and economic tomato productivity the results of that study showed a seasonal water amount of about 400 mm while in this study it was found that 435 mm as the optimal amount the main difference is driven by the drier april in south west italy meaning more water was needed during the vegetative stage the generated gcms showed a spread respect to the baseline as also shown in ruane and mcdermid 2017 and cammarano et al 2019 2020 the way of displaying and choosing gcms makes impact studies comparable across countries and cropping systems as showed in rosenzweig and hillel 2015 and in the updated version of that project https agmip org regional integrated assessments 2 ventrella et al 2011 used projected climate to quantify the impacts of climate change on tomato water and fertilization but they used the a2 sres scenarios and only one gcm the same authors used this gcm to produce two anomalies in terms of temperature changes in the present study the cmip5 with four contrasting gcms was used the main difference is that the previous study one gcm outputs were changed only in terms of their temperature anomaly while in the present study the selected gcms had interactive impacts of rainfall and temperature changes the selection of the different extremes produced a set of 4 gcms with contrasting rain and temperature behaviors 4 3 crop model calibration and evaluation the calibration and evaluation indices of the dssat tomato model were in line to the ones published elsewhere boote et al 2012 rinaldi et al 2007 and elsayed et al 2017 reported for tomato grown in different environmental conditions and treatments values of rmse and d index in line to the ones reported here the poor matching of lai values for one growing season and not for the other was also reported in boote et al 2012 the authors concluded that this might be due to not reproducing accurately the decline in lai associated with both senescence and n remobilization 4 4 climate impacts the different gcms which represent different combinations of temperature and rainfall caused a different crop response in terms of phenology and crop production the results of the present study agree with the findings of ventrella et al 2011 that an increase in temperature caused a shortening of the phenology however the authors modified the weather data to obtain a temperature anomaly of both 2 and 5 c in our study the range of temperature changes respect to the baseline were between 0 8 and 2 4 c which means the most extreme temperature change in the gcm2 was not as high as the one reported by ventrella et al 2011 in that study ventrella et al 2011 used a longer time frame 2099 and therefore higher absolute temperature increase respect to this study in addition boote et al 2012 have subsequently adjusted the cardinal temperature of the crop model to different thresholds meaning that the comparison of the simulated impacts with older studies will be less relevant the overall reduction of future tomato yield and the amount of water required is in line with the ones reported by giuliani et al 2020 the gcm2 caused the fastest reduction in phenology and lower yield that the other projections however the gcm1 was the one requiring more irrigation water than the other projections this means that in the future in the growing area of south west italy the amount of water needed to irrigate the tomato will increase by 25 which might not be a viable option in a future that will see a reduction in rainfall and an increased demand for extra agricultural use of water in addition the increased demand for human consumption will exacerbate the debate of future water allocation current water saving techniques such as deficit irrigation provide a documented reduction in water use with minimum effects on yield and could compensate the negative projection in fact as reported by giuliani et al 2016 the adoption of the regulated deficit irrigation strategy can allow to save 27 of irrigation water preserving value of water use efficiency with an increase of fruit yield and quality among the available innovative agronomic techniques ronga et al 2020 showed that the synergy effect of digestate and biochar can improve the processing tomato yield enhancing water and nutrient plant uptakes in addition bowles et al 2016 suggested that the combined use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and deficit irrigation can increase crop yield and wue and thus having an important role in coping the increased demand of irrigation water as well as observed in the present study for the increasing temperature and reduced rainfall predicted by most gcms investigated in the present study biostimulant can be used to reduce the effects of these abiotic stresses on processing tomato production goñi et al 2018 hernández et al 2016 another important abiotic stress in tomato production is chilling ronga et al 2018 the low rainfall occurred in april and the fastest reduction in phenology showed during the growing season might suggest an earlier seedling transplant however chilling events can occur to overcome chilling damages caradonia et al 2019 reported that tomato seedlings inoculated with funneliformis mosseae reduced the cell membrane injuries and highlighted a better seedling regrowth after the chilling stress the impact of the eco2 on the crop physiological efficiencies was positive for the nue and wue but these efficiencies decreased when the irrigation and fertilization was optimized on wheat c3 crop like tomato it was found that the increase of co2 lead to an increase in yield from 8 to 31 and in wue between 5 and 38 depending on the co2 concentrations cammarano et al 2016 the results of the present study showed that the increase in simulated yield across the 4 gcms was about 15 in line with the reported values for wheat for the wue the results were mostly in line with previous studies except the gcm2 that showed a negative wue on the other hand results of this study showed that under the hot conditions the high acceleration of phenology caused a decrease in yields which in turns caused a lower efficiency in terms of water and nitrogen the simulated transpiration efficiency was slightly offset by the increase in co2 concentration however it remained mostly negative under the climate projections from this point of view research in tomato physiology will play an important role to quantify the adaptation of tomato genotypes to climate change in addition studies on dm production and its distribution between the different organs like root stem leaf and fruit can provide useful information for the best application of the agronomic techniques heuvelink 1996 mori et al 2008 ronga et al 2017 during the growing season some physiological parameters are mainly affected by water irrigation such as wue and teff that are also affected by soil atmosphere plant interactions and playing a principal role in crop yield and quality barrios masias and jackson 2014 elia and conversa 2012 hagassou et al 2019 ronga et al 2019 in addition teff also influences wue sinclair et al 2005 in fact in our research results of teff and wue showed a similar trend in all the investigated gcms furthermore it is interesting to note that in gcms 2 and 4 under eco2 eirr were displayed greater values of wue and teff and lower value of nue than that recorded under eco2 birr these results were mainly ascribed to the higher volume of irrigation water applied under eco2 eirr than eco2 birr causing a nitrogen dilution in the soil hence plants grown in gcms 2 and 4 under eco2 eirr with a higher teff probably tried to cope nutritional stress increasing the uptake of mineral nutrients from the soil as already reported by barati et al 2015 in barley production however further studies are needed to corroborate this hypothesis to give useful information that could be considered in the future breeding programs able to increase tomato yield overcoming climate change impacts 5 conclusion in conclusion future production of processing tomato might be hampered by the projected changes in climatic conditions the reduction in growing season rainfall and increase of growing season air temperature will cause a shortening of the tomato development and a lowering in yield with the additional impact on the increased amounts of irrigation water and n fertilization in a future where water resources will be scarce even an increased amount of irrigation by deficit irrigation systems would not be sustainable processing tomato require whole field growing conditions and are not suitable for indoor led based solution as it could be the case for fresh tomato in addition work on the processing tomato

10465,tomato solanum lycopersicum l is a globally important vegetable recognized for its positive health benefits as most of the vegetable production tomato require significant amount of agronomic inputs however recent shifts in climate patterns in terms of timing and amount in rainfall patterns in air temperature and the associated extreme events have caused harm and disruption to the agricultural sector worldwide the objective of this study was to i evaluate the ability of a crop simulation model to simulate yield and growth parameter of a processing tomato in south west italy ii quantify the impacts of projected climate on business as usual agronomic practices iii understand the role of projected changes and increased co2 on the water and nutrient efficiency field trials from an open field at sele valley 40 35 03 8 n 14 58 48 6 e salerno south west italy during a two year period 2004 2005 were used baseline climate data 1984 2018 were available and four contrasting projections were selected as function of their spread in terms of changes in growing season rainfall and temperature respect to the baseline the crop model dssat decision support system of agrotechnology transfer was used for this study the model was able to simulate tomato response to n fertilization with acceptable error levels respect to the ones reported in literature the projected increase in air temperature and changes in rainfall caused a shortening ranging from 1 5 to 3 days in tomato phenology causing an overall 15 reduction in tomato yield to offset the negative impact of rainfall and temperature changes additional irrigation water from 85 to 110 mm and nitrogen rate from 20 to 30 kg n ha 1 is needed however the increase in irrigation water does not translate in significant yield increase and caused an increase in water and nitrogen use efficiency of less than 10 keywords yield tomato modelling drought irrigation fertilization 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l is a globally important vegetable that has been recognized for his positive health benefits being rich in antioxidants and low in cholesterol saturated fats and sodium capanoglu et al 2010 friedman et al 2000 2010 migliori et al 2017 there are two types of cultivated tomato the one for fresh consumption and the one used for industrial transformation processing which is usually grown under field conditions the global production of processing tomato in 2019 was about 3 7 million metric tons faostat 2020 wptc 2019 italy is the biggest eu producer of processing tomato contributing by 13 of the global processing tomato wptc 2019 as most of the vegetable production tomato require significant amount of agronomic inputs ronga et al 2019a b stated that the amount of irrigation water needed by the crop ranges between 400 and 600 mm the requirement for nitrogen n fertilization varies during the growing season with the highest demand during the vegetative phase and an overall uptake of about 300 kg n ha 1 ronga et al 2017 while past research has focused on optimizing the amount of water and n that maximize yield and quality recent studies have shown how deficit irrigation and partial root zone irrigation can produce similar yield levels and better nutritional qualities with respect to the full irrigation wei et al 2018 n management is a factor impacting plant growth photosynthesis and quality of the fruits and is generally applied at small doses during the growing season for avoiding excessive n losses and often in fertigation with irrigated water wang et al 2010 ronga et al 2015 however recent shifts in climate patterns in terms of timing and amount in rainfall patterns in air temperature and the associated extreme events have caused harm and disruption to the agricultural sector worldwide this will also cause problems to the processing tomato industry for optimizing water and n managements in addition atmospheric carbon dioxide aco2 has been increasing over the years reaching the present value of 413 ppm tans and keeling 2020 the aco2 plays an important role in leaf photosynthesis crop growth and yield ainsworth and long 2005 the interaction of increased aco2 changes in air temperature rainfall and their impacts on the processing tomato has been quantified in few modelling studies in the mediterranean basin giuliani et al 2020 rinaldi et al 2007 ventrella et al 2011 crop growth models are computerized representations of the dynamic interaction between the soil plant atmosphere continuums and have been extensively used in climate change impact studies cammarano et al 2019 asseng et al 2014 the application of crop growth models for impact studies on tomato is limited rinaldi et al 2007 found that a combination of deficit irrigation in the amount of 400 mm for a growing season along with n fertilization of 200 kg n ha 1 optimizes tomato production in the foggia growing area south east italy in addition the impact of climate change in the same area causes an acceleration in phenology decreasing dry matter dm production and reducing crop yield however the optimization of irrigation and fertilization strategies would offset some of the negative impacts of climate ventrella et al 2011 in most climate change impact studies researchers chose one or few global climate models gcm and made climate impacts assumptions based on those climate outputs ruane and mcdermid 2017 showed how among the gcms their response in terms of temperature and rainfall interactions is rather diverse with some having peculiar behavior picking few or the ensemble of them without considering the uncertainty around the projections can lead to inconsistencies ruane and mcdermid 2017 comparing the obtained results against other studies from different geographical areas is often biased because of the chosen gcm in fact the approach suggested by ruane and mcdermid 2017 can be used to subset a number of gcms into a smaller subset in relation to the information that are important to maintain such information can be decided a priori and can help to quantify the climate change impacts in a uniform way across different geographical regions cammarano et al 2020 2019 ruane et al 2015 therefore in order to make an informed assessment of climate change impacts on agricultural crop the abovementioned approach would be the optimal solution the south west of italy is an important area of tomato production ronga et al 2015 with a different climate than the eastern zone and no impact studies in this area exist the objective of this study was to i evaluate the ability of a crop simulation model to simulate yield and growth parameter of a processing tomato produced in south west italy ii quantify the impacts of projected climate on business as usual agronomic practices iii understand the role of projected changes and increased co2 on the water and nutrient efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design field trials were carried out in an open field at sele valley 40 35 03 8 n 14 58 48 6 e salerno south west italy during a two year period 2004 2005 in a typical haploxerepts soil soil survey staff 2014 the soil had the following characteristics sand 26 8 silt 40 8 clay 32 4 limestone 2 4 ph 7 8 organic matter 1 6 total nitrogen 1 3 p 55 mg kg 1 and k 271 mg kg 1 lambers and barrow 2020 2 1 1 crop production the cultivar messapico nunhems s agata bolognese bo italy with elongated fruit was transplanted with a density of 3 seedlings m 2 plants were transplanted the 5th of may 2004 and 9th of may 2005 using twin rows with of 0 35 m between each row of the twin and 0 35 m between plants in the row while the distance between the twin rows was 1 7 m the total p2o5 and k2o rates were calculated according to the soil analysis and administered at ploughing regarding n fertilization six rates were considered 0 50 100 150 200 and 250 kg of n ha 1 with the 250 kg n ha 1 lower than the rate used by farmers 290 kg n ha 1 a randomized complete block design was used using four replicates each of 4 0 m 5 1 m irrigation scheduling was based on crop evapotranspiration etc and calculated as etc eto kc where eto reference evapotranspiration was determined as suggested by hargreaves and samani 1985 and kc crop coefficient for tomato crop was adjusted considering the environmental conditions and the crop growth stage allen et al 1998 in each plot 100 etc was restored when 40 of the total available water was depleted in accordance to doorenbos and pruitt 1977 totals of 255 and 294 mm of water were applied in 2004 and 2005 respectively by drip irrigation weed control and plant protection were done according to the cultivation protocols of the campania region italy a single harvest was done the 9th of aug 2004 and 5th of aug 2005 when the ripe fruits accounted for approximately 85 of the total 2 1 2 parameters recorded in open field the main physiological and morphological parameters were biweekly assessed in five in 2004 and four in 2005 sampling times on two plants per plot in the first growing season 2004 the sampling corresponded to the following physiological stages 1 beginning of flowering stage 6 1 meier 2001 2 full flowering stage 6 3 3 beginning of fruit development stage 7 1 4 fruit and seed ripening stage 8 1 5 fully ripe stage 8 9 meier 2001 while in the second growing season 2005 sampling started at full flowering stage until fully ripe stage for the destructive parameters two plants were collected at each time point leaving at least another two neighboring plants on each side by digging plants to a soil depth of 40 cm then washing away the soil from the roots the leaf fruit ripe and un ripe and total biomass dry weights were recorded in addition leaf area index lai was measured using a subsample of fresh leaves that was run through an li 3000a leaf area meter li cor lincoln ne usa and this was linked to the leaf dry weight the mean values and the standard deviation of the parameters recorded in the open field were used in the manuscript when referring to the observed data table 1 2 2 climate data the baseline climate data was obtained from the weather station located directly in the experimental farm where the open filed study was carried out and included daily weather data from 1984 to 2018 daily incoming solar radiation mj d 1 m 2 maximum and minimum air temperature c and rainfall mm the climate projections to near future 2010 2040 were computed forty global climate models gcms were used to compute the changes in monthly temperatures and monthly rainfalls resulting in 40 future weather scenarios the climate model projections were from the global couple model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 for this study rcp 4 5 was used where the rcps are a greenhouse gas concentration trajectory which are consistent with the ranges of possible changes of greenhouse gas emissions for example the rcp 4 5 assumed that the greenhouse gas emission peaks around 2040 and then decline further details of the rcps and methodology can be found on the ipcc website intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2019 a corresponding elevated co2 eco2 level of 538 ppm was used when simulating crop response for the mid century the baseline level of co2 380 ppm was used when simulating the baseline period 1980 2010 the baseline weather data was perturbed using the dssat perturb software www climsystems com the software used the baseline weather data of the weather station available in the experimental farm where the open field study was performed and the cmip5 gcm projections to generate 40 daily weather files using the algorithms and approaches described in details in yin et al 2013 following the approach of ruane and mcdermid 2017 the percent change in growing season rainfall april to august and the absolute changes in air temperature april to august respect to the baseline were calculated and resulting data plotted using the same methodology described in ruane and mcdermid 2017 however in this study it was decided to select 4 gcms representing the different position in the rain temperature change spaces the aim was to select 4 gcms gcm1 gcm2 gcm3 and gcm4 with contrasting combinations of rain and temperature changes respect to the spread of the gcms table 2 2 3 crop simulation model the crop model dssat decision support system of agrotechnology transfer version 4 7 was used for this study jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2012 the crop model has many different modules that communicate with each other to simulate the daily interactions of soil plant climate agronomic management the main crop growth models within the dssat framework are the ceres based models used often to simulate cereals and the cropgro based models originally developed for legume crops boote et al 1998 the cropgro was a generic crop model that has been adapted to a variety of crops along with tomato koo 2002 the soil water is simulated with a tipping bucket approach in which precipitation and or irrigation is the run off infiltrated evaporated uptake by crop or lost by drainage as described in detail in ritchie 1998 the crop was subjected to water stress when the ratio between potential crop transpiration demand and potential root water uptake uptake fell below a certain threshold ritchie 1998 water stress impacts different processes from expansive growth to photosynthesis any of these processes have a threshold value of the demand uptake ratio for this study we considered the impact of water stress on expansive growth processes because they are the ones most sensitive to water deficit the index ranges between 0 no stress to 1 maximum stress boote et al 2008 the soil n module simulated the mineralization immobilization processes n leaching nitrification denitrification volatilization and all the different crop n uptake and redistribution of n in the crop jones et al 2003 crop n uptake was simulated matching the potential supply of soil n with crop n demand the crop n demand was made of a deficiency demand that is the quantity of n required to restore the actual n concentration to the critical n concentration in addition the crop n demand was also made of a component that is needed for new growth godwin and singh 1998 the input data consisted in the daily weather data soil data agronomic management in terms of timing and input amount and the amount of soil water and soil mineral n prior sowing initial conditions the model was calibrated using the highest fertilized treatment 250 n of both 2004 and 2005 growing seasons and evaluated on the other treatments the amount of irrigation and fertilization for the baseline simulations was chosen in order to minimize the water stress on expansive growth it was aimed at keeping the water stress index somewhere below 0 5 but not to 0 because with deficit irrigation techniques a small amount of stress that would not negatively affect growth is allowed the n fertilization was applied at key stages when also water was applied the amounts found in this way were referred to baseline next the crop model was run with the selected gcms but with the same irrigation fertilization amount and aco2 concentration as the baseline bco2 birr then with elevated atmospheric co2 concentration eco2 and baseline irrigation fertilization amount eco2 birr and finally with the elevated atmospheric co2 concentration and adjusted irrigation fertilization amount to keep the water stress factor below the 0 5 threshold eco2 eirr table 2 2 4 data analysis the simulated and observed values were evaluated using the root mean square error that is calculated as follows 1 r m s e i 1 o i s i 2 n where o i were the observations s i the simulations and n was the number of comparisons a second index used to evaluate the crop model respect to the observation was the wilmott index of agreement d index with values ranging between 0 poor fit and 1 indicating a good fit usually d index values above 0 5 are to be considered acceptable the d index expressed the measure of the goodness of fit and has been used as cross comparison method between models wilmott 1982 martre et al 2015 cammarano et al 2019 2 d 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o s i o 2 where o is the mean of the observed values the relative change in terms of yield water nitrogen and transpiration use efficiencies respect to the baseline was calculated as follows 3 r c s f g i s b i s b i 100 where s f g i was the simulated s value as predicted by the gcm g for a given growing season i and s b g i was the baseline b value simulated for the growing season i the box and whiskers plots were used to plot the relative changes and the horizontal line in the box represented the median the box was the 25th and the 75th percentiles the whiskers the 10th and 90th percentiles all the figures were made using ggplot2 wickham 2016 3 results 3 1 observed data the observed lai values ranged between 0 7 and 5 1 across the years and treatments for which there were statistical significant differences table 1 there was a difference in the values between the growing season 2004 and 2005 at different n levels with the 0 n showing overall higher values in 2004 than 2005 and the 250 n showing higher values in 2005 table 1 overall the leaf weight values statistically significant and were higher for the growing season 2004 with values ranging between 534 and 2328 kg dm ha 1 while in 2005 they ranged between 354 and 1534 kg dm ha 1 table 1 aboveground biomass and tomato yield showed similar patterns with values higher for the growing season 2004 among all the treatments both parameters were not statistically different among treatments and years table 1 the standard deviations of the measured parameters increased at higher n fertilization levels for both years when comparing the same sampling date for example the standard deviation of the tomato yield at harvest in 2005 was 172 6 kg dm ha 1 for the n0 and 1081 kg dm ha 1 for the 250 n table 1 from the observed patterns the tomato dry yield in 2005 was lower than in 2004 but with higher standard deviation table 1 this also resulted in different yield peaks to n inputs with the maximum yield in 2004 and 2005 achieved at 250 and 150 kg n ha 1 respectively 3 2 climate data the historical long term 1984 2018 maximum and minimum air temperatures and rainfall were shown in fig 1 the maximum air temperature showed an increasing trend for the month of april which was usually the tomato transplanting time with an annual increase of 0 07 c while for the other months the increase was much smaller fig 1a the minimum air temperature showed a similar pattern of the maximum air temperature with april begin the month of the higher annual increase with a 0 054 c fig 1b the cumulative rainfall for the month of april to august showed an increase for each month except for april where the cumulative rainfall from 1984 to 2018 decreased fig 1c the 40 gcms and their growing season precipitation and temperature changes were reported in fig 2 while the full list is shown in supplemental table 1 the range of rainfall change varied between 43 and 5 respect to the baseline growing season rainfall fig 2 while the growing season temperature was higher between 0 8 and 2 4 c than the baseline fig 2 the selection of the 4 gcm used in this study were shown with the circle in fig 2 and where defined with respect to the general spread of the gcms their range of temperature and rainfall changes respect to the baseline was reported in table 2 they were identified i gcm1 with 42 6 rain and 1 3 c table 1 and blue circle in fig 2 ii gcm2 with 22 7 rain and 2 4 c table 1 and red circle in fig 2 iii gcm3 with 2 7 rain and 0 8 c table 1 and green circle in fig 2 and iv gcm4 with 7 4 rain and 1 5 c table 1 and black circle in fig 2 3 3 crop model calibration and evaluation the results of the calibration were shown in fig 3 and the crop parameters in supplemental table 2 the simulated lai showed a rmse of 0 95 and a d index of 0 69 while the simulated leaf weight showed a rmse of 449 kg dm ha 1 and a d index of 0 67 fig 3a b aboveground biomass and tomato yield showed good agreement between observed and simulated results with a rmse of 1584 kg dm ha 1 and 1039 kg dm ha 1 and a d index of 0 93 and 0 95 respectively fig 3c d overall these rmse values correspond to 14 of the maximum yield and biomass values the evaluation of the dssat tomato on the remaining experiments was shown in fig 4 overall the rmses were 0 68 415 kg dm ha 1 1648 kg dm ha 1 and 1008 kg dm ha 1 for lai leaf weight aboveground biomass and yield respectively while the d index was 0 85 for lai 0 72 for leaf weight 0 91 for aboveground biomass and 0 94 for yield fig 4 similarly the rmse values for yield and biomass correspond to 13 and 15 of their maximum values respectively the observed crop flowering date was 7 jun for both years while the simulated was 9 jun 2004 and 6 jun 2004 data not shown the crop coefficients calibrated for the cropgro tomato were shown in supplemental material table 2 3 4 climate change impacts the relationship between simulated days to flowering and mean air temperature for the different gcms was shown in fig 5 overall the increase in temperature caused a shortening in phenology of 1 5 days for the gcm3 and of 3 days for the gcm2 fig 5a the impact of the different gcms and irrigation co2 combinations are shown in fig 5b overall the baseline processing tomato yield varied between 7000 9000 kg dm ha 1 depending on mean air temperature values there was a statistically significant difference among the simulated yields under different gcm and management combination p 0 001 the impact of the changes in rainfall and temperature given the same aco2 and irrigation caused a decrease in tomato yield for all the four different gcms fig 5b the impact of elevated co2 caused an increase of simulated yield for the gcm3 gcm1 and gcm4 but the gcm2 scenario showed a statistical significant decrease in simulated yield especially when the mean air temperature was above 25 c in this condition both the bco2 birr and eco2 birr showed a drastic decrease in simulated yield to values ranging between 2900 and 3200 kg dm ha 1 fig 5b when the irrigation and the fertilization were adjusted there was a positive impact on the simulated yield black dots in fig 5b which was evident for the gcm3 gcm1 and gcm4 the gcm2 showed that at mean air temperatures between 23 and 25 c the yields might increase but above that threshold even the new irrigation amount was not able to offset the shortening of the phenology fig 5a and b the baseline irrigation amount was 435 mm and the fertilization was 299 kg n ha 1 under the 4 projected climate the additional amount of irrigation water would be 110 93 85 and 85 mm for the gcm1 gcm2 gcm3 and gcm4 respectively fig 6 a furthermore the additional amount of n fertilizer was 20 kg n ha 1 for the gcm1 scenario and 30 kg n ha 1 for the others fig 6b most of the additional water and n inputs were given between transplanting to flowering about 30 days after transplanting data not shown the relative changes of simulated yield nitrogen use efficiency nue water use efficiency wue and transpiration use efficiency teff were shown in fig 7 the impact of rainfall and temperature changes without considering changing in aco2 and irrigation water and fertilization bco2 birr showed a negative yield change between across the 4 gcms ranging between 5 and 25 fig 7 in addition the nue wue and teff showed reductions from 5 to 30 in efficiency under the bco2 birr the impact of elevated co2 on baseline irrigation and fertilization eco2 birr showed a mean 10 increase in yield under the gcm1 gcm3 and gcm4 fig 7 however the gcm2 showed contrasting results with a mean change of 0 and a response from 20 to 20 in yield fig 7 the nue was increased under the gcm1 gcm3 and gcm4 scenarios by about 12 but it showed a similar pattern of the yield changes for the gcm2 fig 7 the wue for the gcm2 showed negative results for the eco2 birr with a mean decrease of about 13 fig 7 the relative transpiration efficiency change was negative for gcm1 gcm3 and gcm4 with mean values ranging between 10 and 25 fig 7 when the agronomic management was adjusted irrigation and fertilization eco2 eirr the relative yield showed some minimal but statistically significant p 0 001 increase respect to the eco2 birr with some positive impact on the gcm4 however the nue decreased under all the 4 gcms and wue and teff did not show significant increases fig 7 4 discussions projected changes in growing season show a reduction of rainfall and an increase of the temperatures indicating a considerable increase in irrigation water and n fertilization impacting on the processing tomato sustainability 4 1 observed data the observed treatments showed a positive response to the highest n fertilization 250 n where the highest lai and aboveground biomass were observed for both growing seasons table 1 these results agree with findings of scholberg et al 2000 and farneselli et al 2013 and for different crop in similar environments by tedone et al 2014 and conversa et al 2019 ronga et al 2019 demonstrated how the increase in n rates will affect aboveground biomass accumulation without impacting the allocation to the different organs 4 2 climate data the use of historical weather data showed that during the tomato growing season april to august the transplanting month april is getting hotter and drier this means that the current climate variability is already impacting the amount of water that needs to be provided after transplanting previous studies have reported the impacts of agronomic management on tomato yield but neglecting the climate impacts higashide and heuvelink 2009 migliori et al 2017 rinaldi et al 2007 using 53 years of historical weather data from foggia south east italy found the total amount of water that would optimize environmental and economic tomato productivity the results of that study showed a seasonal water amount of about 400 mm while in this study it was found that 435 mm as the optimal amount the main difference is driven by the drier april in south west italy meaning more water was needed during the vegetative stage the generated gcms showed a spread respect to the baseline as also shown in ruane and mcdermid 2017 and cammarano et al 2019 2020 the way of displaying and choosing gcms makes impact studies comparable across countries and cropping systems as showed in rosenzweig and hillel 2015 and in the updated version of that project https agmip org regional integrated assessments 2 ventrella et al 2011 used projected climate to quantify the impacts of climate change on tomato water and fertilization but they used the a2 sres scenarios and only one gcm the same authors used this gcm to produce two anomalies in terms of temperature changes in the present study the cmip5 with four contrasting gcms was used the main difference is that the previous study one gcm outputs were changed only in terms of their temperature anomaly while in the present study the selected gcms had interactive impacts of rainfall and temperature changes the selection of the different extremes produced a set of 4 gcms with contrasting rain and temperature behaviors 4 3 crop model calibration and evaluation the calibration and evaluation indices of the dssat tomato model were in line to the ones published elsewhere boote et al 2012 rinaldi et al 2007 and elsayed et al 2017 reported for tomato grown in different environmental conditions and treatments values of rmse and d index in line to the ones reported here the poor matching of lai values for one growing season and not for the other was also reported in boote et al 2012 the authors concluded that this might be due to not reproducing accurately the decline in lai associated with both senescence and n remobilization 4 4 climate impacts the different gcms which represent different combinations of temperature and rainfall caused a different crop response in terms of phenology and crop production the results of the present study agree with the findings of ventrella et al 2011 that an increase in temperature caused a shortening of the phenology however the authors modified the weather data to obtain a temperature anomaly of both 2 and 5 c in our study the range of temperature changes respect to the baseline were between 0 8 and 2 4 c which means the most extreme temperature change in the gcm2 was not as high as the one reported by ventrella et al 2011 in that study ventrella et al 2011 used a longer time frame 2099 and therefore higher absolute temperature increase respect to this study in addition boote et al 2012 have subsequently adjusted the cardinal temperature of the crop model to different thresholds meaning that the comparison of the simulated impacts with older studies will be less relevant the overall reduction of future tomato yield and the amount of water required is in line with the ones reported by giuliani et al 2020 the gcm2 caused the fastest reduction in phenology and lower yield that the other projections however the gcm1 was the one requiring more irrigation water than the other projections this means that in the future in the growing area of south west italy the amount of water needed to irrigate the tomato will increase by 25 which might not be a viable option in a future that will see a reduction in rainfall and an increased demand for extra agricultural use of water in addition the increased demand for human consumption will exacerbate the debate of future water allocation current water saving techniques such as deficit irrigation provide a documented reduction in water use with minimum effects on yield and could compensate the negative projection in fact as reported by giuliani et al 2016 the adoption of the regulated deficit irrigation strategy can allow to save 27 of irrigation water preserving value of water use efficiency with an increase of fruit yield and quality among the available innovative agronomic techniques ronga et al 2020 showed that the synergy effect of digestate and biochar can improve the processing tomato yield enhancing water and nutrient plant uptakes in addition bowles et al 2016 suggested that the combined use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and deficit irrigation can increase crop yield and wue and thus having an important role in coping the increased demand of irrigation water as well as observed in the present study for the increasing temperature and reduced rainfall predicted by most gcms investigated in the present study biostimulant can be used to reduce the effects of these abiotic stresses on processing tomato production goñi et al 2018 hernández et al 2016 another important abiotic stress in tomato production is chilling ronga et al 2018 the low rainfall occurred in april and the fastest reduction in phenology showed during the growing season might suggest an earlier seedling transplant however chilling events can occur to overcome chilling damages caradonia et al 2019 reported that tomato seedlings inoculated with funneliformis mosseae reduced the cell membrane injuries and highlighted a better seedling regrowth after the chilling stress the impact of the eco2 on the crop physiological efficiencies was positive for the nue and wue but these efficiencies decreased when the irrigation and fertilization was optimized on wheat c3 crop like tomato it was found that the increase of co2 lead to an increase in yield from 8 to 31 and in wue between 5 and 38 depending on the co2 concentrations cammarano et al 2016 the results of the present study showed that the increase in simulated yield across the 4 gcms was about 15 in line with the reported values for wheat for the wue the results were mostly in line with previous studies except the gcm2 that showed a negative wue on the other hand results of this study showed that under the hot conditions the high acceleration of phenology caused a decrease in yields which in turns caused a lower efficiency in terms of water and nitrogen the simulated transpiration efficiency was slightly offset by the increase in co2 concentration however it remained mostly negative under the climate projections from this point of view research in tomato physiology will play an important role to quantify the adaptation of tomato genotypes to climate change in addition studies on dm production and its distribution between the different organs like root stem leaf and fruit can provide useful information for the best application of the agronomic techniques heuvelink 1996 mori et al 2008 ronga et al 2017 during the growing season some physiological parameters are mainly affected by water irrigation such as wue and teff that are also affected by soil atmosphere plant interactions and playing a principal role in crop yield and quality barrios masias and jackson 2014 elia and conversa 2012 hagassou et al 2019 ronga et al 2019 in addition teff also influences wue sinclair et al 2005 in fact in our research results of teff and wue showed a similar trend in all the investigated gcms furthermore it is interesting to note that in gcms 2 and 4 under eco2 eirr were displayed greater values of wue and teff and lower value of nue than that recorded under eco2 birr these results were mainly ascribed to the higher volume of irrigation water applied under eco2 eirr than eco2 birr causing a nitrogen dilution in the soil hence plants grown in gcms 2 and 4 under eco2 eirr with a higher teff probably tried to cope nutritional stress increasing the uptake of mineral nutrients from the soil as already reported by barati et al 2015 in barley production however further studies are needed to corroborate this hypothesis to give useful information that could be considered in the future breeding programs able to increase tomato yield overcoming climate change impacts 5 conclusion in conclusion future production of processing tomato might be hampered by the projected changes in climatic conditions the reduction in growing season rainfall and increase of growing season air temperature will cause a shortening of the tomato development and a lowering in yield with the additional impact on the increased amounts of irrigation water and n fertilization in a future where water resources will be scarce even an increased amount of irrigation by deficit irrigation systems would not be sustainable processing tomato require whole field growing conditions and are not suitable for indoor led based solution as it could be the case for fresh tomato in addition work on the processing tomato

10466,the são marcos catchment sam encompasses one of the largest center pivot areas in the southern hemisphere irrigation at sam is highly dependent on small on farm reservoirs sr specifically at the headwater sub catchments where large center pivot irrigation areas are evident however the capacity and hydrological performance of those sr are largely unknown as their hydrological characteristics have not been widely assessed the objective of this work was to establish a method to assess the impact of the sr network over dry season water availability at sam for this purpose a model was developed to test the hypothesis that sr increase water availability at the local sub catchment and catchment scales to this end sr were mapped with sub metric satellite images and their volumes estimated by linear regression with other on farm reservoirs with known volumes streamflow based on four gauged historical data was regionalized in a monthly time step for 4161 sub catchments subsequently sr were modelled individually at the local scale and as a group both at the sub catchment scale medium scale and at the catchment scale broad scale in scenarios using q95 and mean inflows results showed that remotely sensed surface area at full supply level fsl is the factor that caused the largest variation in the outputs which has direct correlation with the upstream drainage area discharging to each sr simulations suggested that the combination of sr storage capacities have a high proportional impact in increasing water availability at headwater sub catchments however the capacity of a single sr to augment local water availability is more pronounced when its upstream drainage area is 3 km² or greater furthermore assuming there are no inflows of water during the dry season a single sr must have a minimum fsl of 0 08 ha to result in any improvement in local water availability keywords conceptual modelling on farm reservoir water availability water balance surface

production by 70 fao 2009 godfray et al 2010 to meet food requirement by the year 2050 the irrigation area would have to increase from 2 7 to 3 9 million km2 square kilometers yoshikawa et al 2014 brazil is one of a few countries with the potential to substantially increase its overall agricultural production without threatening its environment despite having limitations for developing land in many regions across the country wendt et al 2015 the brazilian savannah cerrado the second greatest biome of brazil after the amazon represents approximately 24 of the country s land area this biome is crucial for the brazilian agriculture but has gone thru major environmental modification klink 2014 one alternative to conserve the remainder cerrado is increasing yields by land use intensification spera 2017 mainly by expanding the irrigation over 26 5 mha of underutilized pastures and rainfed agricultural land althoff and rodrigues 2019 fealq 2014 however water should be used efficiently to avoid shortages that might occur due to an expanded irrigated area wendt et al 2015 indeed many catchments within the cerrado have experienced water shortages giving rise to conflicts over water use lima et al 2007 such conflicts may worsen due to the growth of irrigation in the region a stable and reliable water supply has always been a critical factor for the success and sustainability of agribusiness tingey holyoak 2014 total water stored in large reservoirs is equivalent to around 24 of the global surface water vörösmarty et al 1997 more than half of the world s catchments have their streamflow regulated by reservoirs and the majority are catchments that encompass important economic activities like irrigation nilsson et al 2005 in this context small on farm reservoirs herein referred to as sr play an important role bringing water security to farmers by enabling irrigation in regions with erratic rainfalls schreider et al 2002 robaina et al 2009 hughes and mantel 2010 collischonn et al 2011 hessari et al 2016 berbemeier et al 2017 althoff et al 2019 many studies regarding the hydrological impact of sr in water availability can be found in the scientific literature regarding the scale of previous studies evers et al 1998 jairaj and vedula 2003 barron and okwach 2005 moradi jalal et al 2007 sattari et al 2009 and kang and park 2014 modelled the effect of single reservoirs at the local scale for irrigation purposes callow and smettem 2009 investigated the hole of off stream rainwater harvest type sr at the sub catchment scale wisser et al 2010 nathan and lowe 2012 and fowler et al 2015 modelled off stream rainwater harvest type sr at a catchment scale habets et al 2018 elaborated a comprehensive review on the sr impact over stream flow at the catchment scale however to our knowledge no study of the region has assessed the catchment the sub catchment and the local water availability considering the effects of sr as well as the relationship of each sr to the upstream drainage area sr is the main infrastructure providing reliable source of water for irrigation in the cerrado biome and as the irrigated agriculture expands in the region the more pressure it will exert over water resources for instance the total center pivot irrigation area growth between 2011 and 2015 at sam was about 29 pinhati 2017 hundreds of sr have been built in the cerrado in the past 30 years a total of 252 sr have been identified in the neighboring catchment of the rio preto river which has a drainage area of 10 500 km2 rodrigues et al 2012 most of those sr are old and do not have documentation about their construction operational and technical characteristics furthermore they have been built without coordination nor evaluation of their hydrological impact on the catchment the volume of water stored in sr in the main irrigated regions of brazil and the cerrado in particular are not widely studied and thus remain largely unknown even though this information is a requisite for proper water resources management especially in agricultural catchments rodrigues and liebe 2013 the challenge is to make the expected growth of the irrigated agriculture in the cerrado sustainable through effective management that considers the role of available water resources within the catchments including the impact of sr the sao marcos catchment sam encompasses one of the largest center pivot irrigation areas in the southern hemisphere in a single catchment with more than 105 000 ha irrigated by center pivots in 2016 pinhati 2017 producing not only commodities for export but also more valuable crops like tomatoes onions garlic potatoes and beans sam is home to one of the most important examples of conflicts over water resources in brazil between the irrigation and the hydroelectric power generation sectors silva and da hora 2015 water availability estimates have traditionally been made without considering water stored in sr resulting in underestimation of the catchment hydrological potential a direct consequence of this underestimation is that the amount of water permit concessions has been limited reducing food production growth and the economic development of the region thus understanding the effect of sr network over the water availability is fundamental for water resources planning and management at sam furthermore understanding the limits of sr expansion is also a key component to estimate future expansion of center pivot irrigation in the catchment and to deliver water and legal security to farmers the overarching objective of this work is to test the hypothesis that sr increase water availability at the local sub catchment and catchment scales when not considering consumptive usage to this end a conceptual model is proposed to estimate the impact of sr over dry season water availability at the above mentioned scales accounting with estimated water storage capacities evaporation and infiltration as losses and regionalized stream flows as inflows bypass at each sr this was partitioned in three specific objectives as follows i to map sr year of construction and surface areas then evaluate the relationship volume upstream drainage area ii to estimate water availability in m3 s 1 of a sr considering its storage capacity then add it to stream flow along the dry season to evaluate the sr effect on water availability at the local at the sub catchment and at the catchment scales and iii compare the effect of sr on the three different scales mentioned above considering stream flow with and without the sr effect in two different scenarios regarding the inflow bypass given by the q95 and by the mean flows this paper is sub divided as the following section 2 materials and methods presents the area of study 2 1 the way sr s year of construction was determined how they were mapped and how the respective upstream drainage areas were calculated 2 2 the procedures used to establish the volume area volume relationship 2 3 the inputs used in the equations that form the conceptual model 2 4 how the equations were applied to model at the three different scales 2 5 and a summary of the inputs applied in the methodology 2 6 the results are then presented in section 3 results as the outcomes of sr mapping definition of year of construction 3 1 the relationship between surface area location and upstream drainage area 3 2 the equation derived by the surface area volume relationship analyses 3 3 the effect of individual sr at the local scale 3 4 sub catchment scale 3 5 and catchment scale 3 6 and the relationship between upstream drainage area and the impact of sr on water availability 3 7 discussion and conclusions are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area based on data acquired with gis analyses sam is completely inserted within the cerrado biome it has a total drainage area of 12065 km² and holds the longest flow path of the paraná river catchment stretching for around 3400 km to the atlantic ocean fig 1 a the climate is of the type aw on the köppen geiger climate classification described by kottek et al 2006 as being equatorial savannah with dry winter with lowest rainfall below 60 mm in winter in fact the climate at sam has strong seasonality with a rainy season occurring from october to april the mean annual rainfall is 1330 mm and temperature ranges from 2 4 c to 32 c inmet 2020 the dry season occurs from may to september lasting for 153 days on average but short to medium term droughts are common during the rainy season a natural phenomenon locally called veranico which can last up to 30 sequential days especially between the months of december and february silva and ferreira 2015 at headwater sub catchments elevation reaches 1255 m and drops to 655 m at the mouth of the são marcos river fig 1b at the headwater sub catchments the topography is smooth to undulated up to 3 slope what in geomorphological terms is known as the cristalina plateau where clayed texture soils high permeable red yellowish oxisols prevail these regions are extensive and economically productive holding 84 of the irrigated area by center pivots in the sam the sub catchments in this plateau have shallow valleys with flat bottoms where occurs a landform known as veredas tubelis 2009 the veredas have linear form and they occur over plinthosols and they are commonly flooded for the construction of sr during the dry season the agricultural production at sam relies on irrigation which depends on streamflow with base flow being the dominant component when streamflow is too low for irrigation supply farmers build sr directly in the river stream thus collecting the majority of the upstream flows to guarantee water supply for irrigation over the dry season but being obligated to let a bypass higher or equal to the q95 ana 2011 fig 1c depicts the most common configuration of the greatest center pivot irrigation projects at sam large center pivot irrigation area at headwater sub catchment on the higher plateaus relying on water stored in dams constructed perpendicular to the flowline 2 2 mapping on farm reservoirs determining year of construction and calculating drainage areas 2 2 1 mapping sr this study is based on the year 2016 the sr were identified using the most recent sub metric satellite images provided by google earth google earth 2017 the analyses are potentially well representative of the features existent in the region for the most recent year at images provided at google earth at the time calculated as the median for most parts of south america is exactly 2016 lesiv et al 2018 these are images with sub metric spatial resolution 0 3 1 0 meter in panchromatic mode and were used to identify and map the sr s surface area at full supply level fsl each sr was manually vectorized on a maximum scale of 1 1000 according to its visual fsl then the surface areas were calculated fig 1c notwithstanding some sr were below their fsl on some of the images used for mapping it is still possible to infer and map sr at their fsl within the cerrado biome because there are no large size trees hiding the margins and recurring water inundation areas around srs leave marks on the landscape that are normally easy to identify however a limitation to this technique is that it may not be possible to obtain the latest satellite image for the current year of analyses hence images from the sentinel satellite were used to update the mapping to reservoirs constructed until 2016 in such case the identification of the fsl is jeopardized because of the 10 m broader spatial resolution of the sentinel satellite images 2 2 2 calculating drainage areas the calculation of the drainage areas upstream from the dam walls of each sr was carried out using the srtm shuttle radar topographic mission digital elevation model dem with 30 m spatial resolution usgs 2020 2 2 3 determining the year of construction using landstat 5 and landsat 7 images provided by google earth the year of construction of each on farm reservoir was identified starting in 1984 this procedure was necessary for evaluation of the expansion of sr and center pivot irrigation along the years because the regionalization of stream flows would have to be based on a period of time when natural flows were more likely to occur without blockages by sr neither water abstraction for irrigation more details about stream flow regionalization is given on sub section 2 4 2 2 3 volume area relationship sr volume estimates were carried out using the relation area x volume in total 105 sr with known volumes were used within sam or in the neighboring catchments the 105 reservoirs are in a region with similar morpho climatic characteristics they are placed in the geomorphological domain of the metasedimentary caps fig 2 from the 105 reservoirs 65 are within sam or neighboring catchments ana 2017 the other 40 reservoirs were measured by rodrigues et al 2012 within the neighboring preto catchment from the total 105 reservoirs 85 were randomly chosen to be part of the area volume relationship analyses whilst the rest were separated for validation the linear regression of the log of both the fsl and the storage capacity determined the area volume relationship points in the curve situated over the 90th percentile or under the 10th percentile were classified as outliers and eliminated and the overall correlation coefficient was evaluated with the standard r² 2 4 modelling the impact of on farm reservoirs over water availability 2 4 1 scenarios to understand how networks of sr impact river flow at the local at the sub catchment and at the catchment scale it is necessary to understand the functioning of a single reservoir to provide insight into how it can have an impact on the river flow and why the impact varies in time and from one reservoir to another the water availability at sam was calculated for the dry season and for each one of its five months may june july august and september by using empirical parameters measured by althoff et al 2019 and rodrigues and dekker 2008 applied to different scenarios as follows with sr effect and without sr effect with inflows of the q95 conservative scenario and with inflows of the mean flow realistic scenario in a monthly time step months of the dry season water balance at the catchment and sub catchment scale and for each sr individually local scale 2 4 2 flow regionalization and the hydrological spatial dataset one of the most used tools in hydrology is the ﬂow duration curve fdc which provides a graphical representation of the frequency distribution of the complete ﬂow regime of a catchment using the fdc it is possible to estimate the percentage of time that a speciﬁed streamﬂow is equaled or exceeded as q95 a fdc can be easily derived from gauged river ﬂow data at daily time scale the data are ranked in descending order and each ordered value is associated with an exceedance probability for example through a plotting position formula the lack of stream gauges and the limited amount of streamﬂow observations characterize several geographical areas around the world and from this point of view sam is not an exception predicting hydrological variables in ungauged catchments has been singled out as one of the major issues in the hydrological sciences sivapalan 2003 transferring information from neighboring catchments to the catchment of interest is generally accomplished by hydrological regionalization methods he et al 2011 numerous regionalization methods have been proposed in the literature bloschl 2005 among the most widely used techniques are regressions between the model parameters and physiographic catchment attributes bloschl 2005 he et al 2011 in this work flow regionalization was carried out using a regression based analysis method based on area ratio transformation in order to evaluate the effect of sr without accounting with consumptive usage we opted to use stream flows prior to the center pivot irrigation expansion and the accompanying sr construction hence observed flows from august 1966 to december 1984 from 4 gauging stations within sam were used fig 2 the use of the natural flows is more suitable for modelling reservoirs when water abstraction is not considered otherwise using historical gauging flow data that already is biased by water abstractions would affect the objectives of this study in another words quantifying and understanding the natural streamflow regime defined as expected streamflow that would occur in the absence of anthropogenic modification to the hydrologic system is critically important for the development of water management strategies aimed at growth in agriculture water balance models have been applied frequently to assess the amount of water still available for new users so if we do not use natural flow rates we would be considering the demands e g agriculture demands twice the general approach used in this study for estimating natural ﬂows is based on the reference condition concept miller et al 2018 and application of statistical models regionalization model developed using observed streamﬂow and climatological physiographic data the reference condition concept makes use of data from a network of reference sites deﬁned as stream sites that are least disturbed by human activities in the present or in the past as calibration data to develop models that are then applied to all stream reaches a synthetic hydrographic spatial dataset was created using the digital elevation model dem from the srtm with 30 meter spatial resolution the dem was hydrologically enforced with the drainage lines provided by the national water agency of brazil ana which was created in a scale of 1 100000 this process generated the sub catchments which were subsequently codified using the pfafstetter codification method verdin and verdin 1999 a process that can be executed using the pghydro plug in for qgis 2 18 teixeira 2018 then using the hydrological data generated by the pghydro plug in it was possible to incorporate the monthly flow regionalization to each sub catchment according to its respective upstream drainage area the final product of this process was a gis polygonal shape vectorial dataset representing the sam catchment sub divided into 4161 sub catchments associated to a tabular monthly flow data referred to the months of may june july august and september individually and for the entire 153 days representing the dry season featuring both the q95 and mean flows corresponding to each sub catchment when presenting the equations bellow the q95 and mean flows obtained by the regionalization process are used as the qx parameter either being represented by the q95 streamflow in the conservative scenario or by the mean flows on the realistic scenario 2 4 3 water balance water availability was calculated for 1 one dry season by eq 1 considering the average time of the year when there is no rain i e 1 may to 30 september eq 1 was also applied for a monthly time step from may to september 1 d n e t a v a i l a b i l i t y i d g r o s s i e s t a i i s t a i where dnet availabillity i net water availability m3 s 1 dgross i gross water availability

that at the beginning of the dry season every sr is at fsl the dry season and monthly dgross i were calculated by the eq 3 3 d g r o s s i q i q x where q i average water availability in the sr or sub catchment with order i and qx average water inflows in the reservoir or sub catchment q95 or mean flows both terms above depend on the the time passed since 1st of may as the analysis refers to a monthly time step until the end of the dry season considered being as 31st of september m3 s 1 the q i has been calculated with the eq 4 4 q i v i t d r y where v i storage volume of sr m³ and t d r y

to simulate a trapezoid in which the surface area is always greater than the area of the lake bottom where most of the water infiltration occurs we do not consider lateral infiltration in the reservoirs in this study the i a v e r used was equal to 5 2 mm day 1 corresponding to an average infiltration rate in the reservoirs rodrigues and dekker 2008 the effect of a sr over water availability at the local scale is given by eqs 7 and 8 7 w h i l e d n e t a v a i l a b i l i t y i 0 s r s t i l l c o n t r i b u t e t o l o c a l w a t e r a v a i l a b i l i t y 8 e l s e d n

that their full capacities add to the river streamflow 2 5 modelling on farm reservoirs impact at three different scales 2 5 1 sub catchment scale for the impact of sr over water availability at the sub catchment scale the impacts of individual sr were aggregated by considering the cumulative effect of all sr to do so each sr received the pfafstetter code of the respective sub catchment according to the location of the center of their dam wall a procedure carried out in gis afterwards using a python code into a gis routine the equation given by the area x volume relationship was applied to calculate the estimated volume of each sr and the resulting volumes added up per sub catchment sequentially the sub catchments were hydrologically modelled with the equations from 1 to 6 for this scale of analysis the average evaporation values used are the average monthly values shown at table 1 and the infiltration a constant value of 5 2 mm s 1 finally the above procedure accounted for the losses by infiltration and evaporation and inflows given by the q95 and mean flows at a monthly time step 2 5 2 local and catchment scales for the local and for the catchment scale analyses tabular data containing just the estimated volumes and upstream drainage areas of each sr were exported from gis to a spreadsheet format subsequently eqs 1 6 were applied but the only difference being that no q x was added on eq 3 hence the equations were applied at a monthly time step focusing on reservoirs individually for the local scale analyses and as a bulk storage net of sr for the catchment scale analyses for both scales of analysis the average evaporation values used are the average monthly values shown at table 1 and the constant infiltration value of 5 2 mm s 1 finally the above procedure accounted for the losses by infiltration and evaporation and the results showing the condition of sr by the end of the dry season 2 6 summary of methodological inputs the inputs described at the material and methods section 2 are summarized in table 2 3 results 3 1 identification and year of construction in total 458 sr were identified fig 3 a from which 39 were identified at the 1984 landsat 5 images a boom of sr construction was verified between 1998 and 2004 with 50 4 of the sr built during that time just 14 sr were not identified in images from the google earth platform therefore being identified using images of the sentinel satellite the sr have their fsl ranging from 0 1 ha to 198 ha mean 11 6 ha standard deviation 24 2 ha whereas 85 8 n 393 of the sr have a fsl smaller than 10 ha fig 3b the sum of the 458 sr is 5348 ha which corresponds to 0 44 compared to the area of sam 3 2 surface area location and drainage area relationship in this study the relationship between upstream drainage area and quantity of sr as well as sr s average storage volume has been investigated the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate this relationship the r2 can range from zero no linear relationship to 1 0 perfect relationship analysis show that 53 of the sr are in sub catchments with 7 km2 or less in drainage areas fig 4 a the coefficient of determination r2 for the relationship between percentage of farm dams and upstream drainage area showed a negative correlation of 0 67 the results of sr s surface area volume relationship will be covered at section 3 3 but it s needful to highlight the fact that from the 193 hm³ of water stored in sr at sam 25 9 hm³ 13 4 of that water is stored in sr with upstream drainage areas less or equal to 7 km2 average of 0 05 hm³ per sr in contrast sr located in regions with upstream drainage areas greater or equal to 100 km² represents just 4 1 of the total number of sr but represent 23 2 of the total water stored in sr average of 2 49 hm³ per sr fig 4b illustrates the relation between upstream drainage area and the average storage capacity per sr showing a good positive correlation with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 74 typical sr system configurations that occurs at sam can be seen in fig 5 on its upper row it illustrates three common sr system configurations where the upstream drainage area is the main factor of differentiation fig 5a depicts three small sr closely in cascade respective volumes from upstream to downstream 0 8 hm³ 1 2 hm³ 0 2 hm³ which are the source of water for center pivots summing 974 ha fig 5b shows a sr with an estimated volume of 8 4 hm³ that provides water for irrigation of 854 ha fig 5c illustrate a sr with estimated volume of 3 3 hm³ being able to deliver water for the irrigation of 790 ha including an open irrigation channel deriving from it conveying water to one center pivot located at more than 2 km from the dam wall on the bottom row of each figure is shown the drainage area of each sr which are 6 7 km2 fig 5a 519 km2 fig 5b and 126 km2 fig 5c respectively 3 3 surface area volume relationship despite the variety of shapes of the 85 sr chosen for the regression analyses and after the exclusion of 21 reservoirs considered outliers for being above the 90th or under the 10th percentiles the derived equation area volume eq 9 for the whole sam based on 64 sr was satisfactory fitting observed data fig 6 with a r2 of 0 93 9 v 0 019 a 1 1762 estimation of volumes of the 64 sr using eq 9 had a correlation of 0 90 with their known volumes the difference between the observed and the estimated volumes was some 17 less for the estimated volumes and this may represent a tendency of underestimation of the sr actual volumes the total estimated volume for the 458 sr was equal to 193 hm³ or 19 3 billion liters the validation of eq 9 was carried out using 20 sr chosen from the entire population of 105 sr with known volumes fig 6b after the exclusion of 2 sr considered outliers it is noticeable that the potential curve adjusted based on the known volumes is close to the potential curve of the estimated volumes calculated with the eq 9 the root mean square error is 0 84 and the correlation between the observed and the estimated volumes is 0 91 after applying eq 9 to estimate the storage capacity of sr at sam the results show that the storage capacities range from 0 00008 hm3 to 9 5 hm3 with average capacity of 0 42 hm3 standard deviation 1 hm3 there are 449 sr with maximum storage capacity bellow 3 hm³ meaning that only roughly 2 of the sr n 9 are within the limit used by hanasaki et al 2010 and yoshikawa et al 2014 to define a medium size reservoir fig 5b and c meaning that all the other sr n 449 are bellow this limit 3 4 effect at the local scale net water availability for each sr as a function of its fsl at the end of the dry season is presented in fig 7 fig 7 suggests that a sr must have a capacity at fsl greater than 0 08 ha to be able to contribute to the local water availability along the entire dry season if not accounting with any input of rain or stream flow that is at some point along the 153 days of the dry season smaller sr do not improve local water availability because losses by evaporation and infiltration exceeds their storage capacity hence our results show that sr with fsl greater than 800 m² have storage capacities around 974 m³ which is the threshold volume a sr must have to be able to exert an improvement in terms of local water availability along the entire dry season fig 8 exemplifies the role of evaporation and infiltration over all sr between the start of the dry season in may and in a monthly timescale until the end of the dry season in september fig 8a and b depict the influence of infiltration on the monthly volume of all sr and on the sr below 0 25 ha respectivelly while infiltration slightly affects volume depletion in overall terms evaporation has a stronger influence and reduces sr storage volumes in a more intensive way fig 8c show the effect of evaporation on all sr along the dry season while fig 8d only on sr 0 25 ha fig 8e demonstrates the effect of infiltration and evaporation on the water depletion process on all sr whilst fig 8f focus on sr 0 25 ha some of the lowest capacity sr have a complete depletion of their volume after the fourth month of the dry season in the end of august while 8 of the sr 1 7 have a complete depletion in the end of the dry season in september in other words at the beginning of the dry season sr start with 193 hm³ of stored water from which 43 hm³ 22 is depleted by evaporation and 21 hm³ 11 is depleted by infiltration dropping to 129 hm3 the total amount of water stored in sr at sam by the end of the dry season rainfall usually starts in october commonly re filling sr with water until they reach their fsl prior to the dry season of the next hydrological period 3 5 effect at the sub catchment scale the regionalization of flows using the area ratio transformation method generates a q95 natural streamflow at the mouth of the river são marcos ranging from 92 8 m3 s 1 in may to 32 m3 s 1 in september while the mean natural streamflow in the same location is 183 3 m3 s 1 in may and 71 5 m3 s 1 in september the 458 sr were spatially joined to sub catchments resulting in 319 sub catchments containing sr ranging from 1 to 8 sr per sub catchment average of 1 44 sr per sub catchment in one hand results show that the average may to september q95 and mean water availability increased at the 319 sub catchments with sr fig 9 a and b when compared with stream flows without the sr effect that is accounting with the sr effect q95 net water availability had a relative increase of 72 4 and 44 4 in may and september respectively while mean flows increased 43 4 and 20 0 on the other hand net water availability percentage increase generated by sr is even higher when considering just the 180 headwater sub catchments containing sr for both q95 and mean flows fig 9c and d respectively that is at the 180 headwater sub catchments containing sr the sum of sr volumes yields a 162 increase in net water availability 0 08 to 0 21 m³ s 1 when considering the q95 flows and 86 increase in net water availability 0 15 to 0 28 m³ s 1 when considering mean flows both related to the beginning of the dry season in may sequentially fig 10 geographically depicts the sr impact at the sub catchment scale shown at fig 9 considering the q95 flows 10a and mean flows 10e over the 4161 sub catchments that form sam fig 10b and 10f depicts that in percentage terms the impact of sr exerts a higher influence over water availability at headwater sub catchments specially when sr is built closely in cascade within the same sub catchment indeed it is possible to verify that the impact of sr over water availability at the sub catchment scale is more pronounced at the q95 scenario fig 10b and 10d than at the mean flows scenario fig 10f and 10h thus in relative terms sr have greater positive impact over water availability in scenarios with lower stream flows 3 6 effect at the catchment scale the net storage of water in sr is depleted by infiltration and evaporation throughout the 153 days of the dry season the individual impact of each input used in this model is presented at fig 11 it can be noted that evaporation red line causes the greatest variability on water availability which can deplete net sr volume by up to 21 between day 0 and day 153 furthermore considering the lumped volume depletion of sr by infiltration green line and infiltration net water stored in sr diminishes 41 by the start and the end of the dry season black line although infiltration is a loss at the local scale the water is not lost from the overall catchment streamflow as it is mostly diverted habets et al 2018 feeding base flow and increasing the volume of surface water downstream fig 11 shows that the net storage of water in sr is 193 hm³ at the catchment scale when converted to streamflow by dividing this volume for the 153 days of the dry season the water stored in sr corresponds to 14 6 m3 s 1 at the catchment scale this represent a potential increment to the flow of about 8 in the beginning of the dry season considering that the mean flow at the mouth of the são marcos river is equivalent to 183 m3 s 1 in may however assuming that water stored in sr is depleted only by evaporation and infiltration the total stored volume would lower to 135 hm3 at the end of the dry season converting this volume to streamflow by the end of the dry season it would be equivalent to more 9 m3 s 1 of water flowing at the mouth of sam representing 13 of the mean stream flow and 28 of the q95 flow in september which are 71 m3 s 1 and 32 m3 s 1 respectively 3 7 upstream drainage area and impact on water availability upstream drainage area in relation to the sr dam walls is not a direct input in our conceptual model but it is a variable that can be related to the location of the majority of sr at sam as shown in fig 4a in addition fig 7 illustrates that at the local scale a single sr must have a fsl greater than 0 08 ha to be able to increase local water availability along the entire dry season and figs 9 and 10 demonstrate that the lumped storage capacities of sr closely built in cascade can considerably augment water availability especially at headwater sub catchments regions to this end fig 5a denotes the common practice at sam of building sr closely in cascade to overcome low water availability at these regions finally when converting water stored in sr to stream flow fig 12 illustrates that sr with greater drainage areas tend to exert a greater impact over water availability that is the relationship between the average net water availability of sr separated in groups by ranges of upstream drainage areas shows the good coefficient of determination r2 of 0 76 fig 12 also denotes that in addition to the minimum fsl of 0 08 ha a single sr at sam tends to exert greater increases in local water availability providing it is in a region with more than 3 km² of upstream drainage area this is is related to the fact that the greater the upstream drainage area the greater the sr average storage capacity as show at fig 4b 4 discussion growth in agriculture has been responsible for much of the loss of biodiversity and habitats and of regulating ecosystem services better water management can mitigate many of the negative consequences iwmi 2007 to this end this study presented an extensive methodology to investigate the impact of sr an important contribution for water resources planning and management 4 1 model conceptualization the model presented in this paper represents a theory influenced empirical grey box process based conceptual model which relies on ordinary differential equations regarding the classification proposed by jakeman et al 2006 and janssen et al 2015 it is designed with a linear structure using constant coefficients infiltration and evaporation applied in a spatially heterogeneous environment with time varying characteristics monthly heterogeneous streamflow along the dry season within the well defined boundaries of sam as well as the boundaries of its 4161 sub catchments basically this model ignores water abstraction for consumptive usage but relies on three input data linearly related for the local and catchment scales sr volume given by surface areas at full supply level fsl evaporation and infiltration whereas at the sub catchment scale one more input data is added to the three listed above stream flow the estimation of the effect of large reservoirs in continental streamflow calculated by biemans et al 2011 and ouyang et al 2011 and the review paper of habets et al 2018 have presented comprehensive studies on the impact of reservoirs on streamflow and irrigation water supply but to the knowledge of the authors this study is the first to investigate and assess the role of a spatially explicit representation network of sr in a single catchment and its sub divisions in sub catchments then modelling the way sr affect water availability at three different scales catchment sub catchment and local scales 4 2 uncertainties fowler et al 2015 mention that the largest source of uncertainty in sr modelling is the specification of the relationship between flow at a gauge and inflow into a given sr whereas a secondary source of uncertainty is accounting for missed sr that do not appear in data sources such as topographic maps hence in one hand the regionalization of measured flow by the area ratio transformation is a potential source of uncertainty even though this is a method that can be highly efficient for predicting stream flow in ungauged catchments mohammed et al 2019 on the other hand the spatial representation of sr in this conceptual model is remarkable for it represents sr mapped at scales as detailed as 1 1000 allowing the inclusion of sr with surface areas of as little as 100 m² in addition the identification and mapping of sr on fsl represent a minor uncertainty because sr storage level have little variation along the year at sam notwithstanding the detailed spatial representation of sr their storage capacity estimation is probably the greater source of uncertainty despite the good coefficient of determination r2 acquired in the area fsl volume relationship firstly considering that evaporation and infiltration are a function of the fsl of each sr eqs 5 and 6 it is expected a marginal overestimation of both evaporation and infiltration rates because the values of fsl remain static along the entire time steps used in this model monthly and seasonal to overcome this problem the model would have to consider a gradual decrease in both volumes lost by infiltration and evaporation along the time secondly the general relationship by linear regression between sr with measured volumes and their surface area at full supply level fsl showed good agreement but the lack of bigger reservoirs storage capacity 3 hm3 with known volumes was detrimental for volume estimation of larger sr hence the model could account with two or more regression equations to estimate volumes of sr based on different groups separated by similar fsl but this method is conditioned to the existence of a dataset containing enough examples of sr with known storage capacities representing the distinct groups of fsl for this reason investments in bathymetry over a set of representative sr is a worthwhile alternative to get better results with this method of sr volume estimation thirdly river damming provokes an increase of the water retention time wang et al 2019 allowing sediments in suspension in the water to settle down at the bottom of reservoirs decreasing their storage capacity globally this effect causes the retention of more than 50 of the sediment flux in regulated catchments vörösmarty et al 2003 hence this conceptual model still needs to evolve to consider the sedimentation processes in sr 4 3 upstream drainage areas and sr closely in cascade habets et al 2018 stated that the estimated upstream drainage area of sr is a key morphological characteristic nathan and lowe 2012 also acknowledge it mentioning that the volume of water harvested from off stream farm dams is dependent on the amount of catchment runoff entering the dam our research explored the relationship between upstream drainage area against number of sr per range of upstream drainage area fig 4a and against stored volume in sr fig 4b these figures imply that farms at headwater sub catchments tend to have more sr than farms located at downstream sub catchments this is because farms at the former locations have ideal topography for mechanization allowing the installation of a great number of center pivots but the presence of larger sr is prevented by local physical constraints what is handled with a greater number of smaller sr despite this data not being used as input in the model it is an important characteristic related to the location where sr are more likely to be built and the size capacity of srs which is a valuable information for planning purposes for example fig 12 show that two reservoirs with similar size capacity have different impacts according to their location along the stream network this is because headwater sub catchments have lower stream flows in consequence of their smaller upstream drainage areas what generates discharges with lower erosive energy this fact leads to shallow valleys a detrimental landform for sr construction considering that the erosive power of a stream is related to its discharge amonsgst other variables bagnold 1960 and discharge is a function of drainage area finlayson and montgomery 2003 there is a tendency to the formation of deeper valleys at downstream sub catchments meaning that these type of sub catchments are more likely to have the physical characteristics allowing the construction of larger reservoirs for this reason in one hand farmers at headwater sub catchments build a number of smaller srs closely in cascade fig 5a to overcome the local physical limitations furthermore when building sr closely in cascade their volumes can be added up at the sub catchment scale because farmers have full control of the imediate upstream sr hence releasing water to the downstream sr when necessary on the other hand farmers at downstream sub catchments can opt to build one single bigger sr fig 5b and c to fulfill their requirements of water for irrigation 4 4 effect on water availability most previous studies have evaluated the cumulative impacts of many reservoirs in a catchment in which the modifications are induced by a set of reservoirs or reservoir network taken as a whole in this case the total impact is therefore equal to the sum of the impacts of the developments and to interaction effects of such reservoirs on hydrology adding to that nathan and lowe 2012 state that the factors influencing the impact of sr on stream hydrology include the total volume of upstream dams the magnitude of extractions to supply on farm demand the seasonal pattern of these abstractions relative to the local pattern of runoff and the proportion of a given catchment area that is impounded by farm dams furthermore ouyang et al 2011 calculated the cascade impact of eight dams in the yellow river and found that the yearly volume difference between the inlet and outlet dropped by 33 as a direct consequence of the operation of the dams which includes water abstraction for irrigation and habets et al 2018 mentioned water abstraction as a component of water balance therefore causing lower stream flows downstream thus there are very few studies showing the effect of non operated small reservoirs on stream flows in this paper sr act as a tank storing water disregarding any withdrawal evaporation or infiltration the volume of water inflow in the sr will eventually be the outflow in the same amount a similar approach was adopted by biemans et al 2011 who considered that the total monthly inflow into reservoirs was released to downstream when the reservoir was not built for irrigation purposes based on these assumptions there is no reason for the sr to decrease the flow in the river sr will then act as a water buffer during the dry season regulating the river discharge for instance if river discharge decrease inflow to reservoir the outflow will keep the same for a period of time depending on the size of the reservoir this fact does not happen in a river without reservoir in another words sr helps to maintain the river flow as a consequence the increase on the number of reservoirs can increase the amount of water usage in the catchment either by the increase in evaporation or in water withdrawal the infiltrated water has a different behavior as it keeps in the water system and can be used downstream this paper focused on assessing the impact of sr on water availability catchment hydrological functioning particularly runoff temporal and spatial variability is out of scope of our research at this stage in this respect we considered a distinction between hydrology and available water resources made by beran 1986 the former deals with evaluating the total resource naturalized river flow whilst the latter requires the quantification of the exploitable amount hence it would be more appropriate to compare the present study with those that dealt with the socioeconomic impact several authors have investigated how the impact of sr on hydrology can be reduced by the presence of small reservoirs that are having positive socioeconomic impacts on the local population blanc and strobl 2013 acheampong et al 2014 lasage and verburg 2015 for instance focus on the social benefit of small sand reservoirs to secure water access in the context of climate change the increase in pressure to construct small reservoirs van der zaag and gupta 2008 thomas et al 2011 clearly shows this improvement from a socioeconomic perspective this increase is driven for the part of the global population that will experience water scarcity which is projected to increase with climate change ipcc 2014 as poussin et al 2015 and berbemeier et al 2017 mentioned small reservoirs are important for both food and water security to that we add that sr can also play a role in environmental security when promoting agricultural land use intensification by irrigation thus relieving pressure over native vegetation despite the trade off with the loss of biodiversity when flooding riparian vegetation 4 5 the brazilian legislation for water permits in brazil reference flows are used as the basis for defining available water resources and determining whether water is available for allocation or not such as when making decisions on issuing water permits the minimum streamflows q95 have been used to define the limit of authorization of water use water permits by the national water agency of brazil ana 2011 hence this is the reason the q95 scenario has been used in this study however as demands increase as expected in sam more flexible approaches could offer greater capacity to maximize the benefits available from the river system therefore a scenario with the mean flow was also considered to represent an alternative 4 6 insights and future work this work is part of a larger on going modeling framework that uses a novel methodology to simulate the expansion of center pivot irrigation at sam 5 conclusion the impact of a single sr over water availability is proportional to its size but it is also related to its location in the catchment given the tendency that the greater the upstream drainage area the bigger its storage capacity will be indeed individual sr with upstream drainage areas 3 km2 were shown to exert little impact on local water availability for instance sr with fsl 0 08 ha do not contribute any increase in local water availability during the entire dry season thus irrigators at sam have traditionally addressed the low water availability at headwater sub catchments by building srs closely in cascade apart from local climate rainfall and evaporation and local physical characteristics such as geology and type of soils the ability of sr to augment water availability is mainly determined by the inflow the number of sr closely built in cascade if that is the case and their volumetric capacity which is a function of their size and depth yet all these parameters can be related to sr s upstream drainage areas information about these relationships can be acquired with mapping combined with measurements of sr at their fsl based on periodic free of charge high and medium resolution satellite images in conclusion the methodology presented in this study means that sr for which detailed information has been lacking can be included in water management thus incorporating important data into hydrological analyses for a range of different purposes declaration of competing interest none

10466,the são marcos catchment sam encompasses one of the largest center pivot areas in the southern hemisphere irrigation at sam is highly dependent on small on farm reservoirs sr specifically at the headwater sub catchments where large center pivot irrigation areas are evident however the capacity and hydrological performance of those sr are largely unknown as their hydrological characteristics have not been widely assessed the objective of this work was to establish a method to assess the impact of the sr network over dry season water availability at sam for this purpose a model was developed to test the hypothesis that sr increase water availability at the local sub catchment and catchment scales to this end sr were mapped with sub metric satellite images and their volumes estimated by linear regression with other on farm reservoirs with known volumes streamflow based on four gauged historical data was regionalized in a monthly time step for 4161 sub catchments subsequently sr were modelled individually at the local scale and as a group both at the sub catchment scale medium scale and at the catchment scale broad scale in scenarios using q95 and mean inflows results showed that remotely sensed surface area at full supply level fsl is the factor that caused the largest variation in the outputs which has direct correlation with the upstream drainage area discharging to each sr simulations suggested that the combination of sr storage capacities have a high proportional impact in increasing water availability at headwater sub catchments however the capacity of a single sr to augment local water availability is more pronounced when its upstream drainage area is 3 km² or greater furthermore assuming there are no inflows of water during the dry season a single sr must have a minimum fsl of 0 08 ha to result in any improvement in local water availability keywords conceptual modelling on farm reservoir water availability water balance surface area storage capacity relationship upstream drainage area storage capacity relationship gis 1 introduction estimates show that to meet the 2050 global food demand it is necessary to increase food production by 70 fao 2009 godfray et al 2010 to meet food requirement by the year 2050 the irrigation area would have to increase from 2 7 to 3 9 million km2 square kilometers yoshikawa et al 2014 brazil is one of a few countries with the potential to substantially increase its overall agricultural production without threatening its environment despite having limitations for developing land in many regions across the country wendt et al 2015 the brazilian savannah cerrado the second greatest biome of brazil after the amazon represents approximately 24 of the country s land area this biome is crucial for the brazilian agriculture but has gone thru major environmental modification klink 2014 one alternative to conserve the remainder cerrado is increasing yields by land use intensification spera 2017 mainly by expanding the irrigation over 26 5 mha of underutilized pastures and rainfed agricultural land althoff and rodrigues 2019 fealq 2014 however water should be used efficiently to avoid shortages that might occur due to an expanded irrigated area wendt et al 2015 indeed many catchments within the cerrado have experienced water shortages giving rise to conflicts over water use lima et al 2007 such conflicts may worsen due to the growth of irrigation in the region a stable and reliable water supply has always been a critical factor for the success and sustainability of agribusiness tingey holyoak 2014 total water stored in large reservoirs is equivalent to around 24 of the global surface water vörösmarty et al 1997 more than half of the world s catchments have their streamflow regulated by reservoirs and the majority are catchments that encompass important economic activities like irrigation nilsson et al 2005 in this context small on farm reservoirs herein referred to as sr play an important role bringing water security to farmers by enabling irrigation in regions with erratic rainfalls schreider et al 2002 robaina et al 2009 hughes and mantel 2010 collischonn et al 2011 hessari et al 2016 berbemeier et al 2017 althoff et al 2019 many studies regarding the hydrological impact of sr in water availability can be found in the scientific literature regarding the scale of previous studies evers et al 1998 jairaj and vedula 2003 barron and okwach 2005 moradi jalal et al 2007 sattari et al 2009 and kang and park 2014 modelled the effect of single reservoirs at the local scale for irrigation purposes callow and smettem 2009 investigated the hole of off stream rainwater harvest type sr at the sub catchment scale wisser et al 2010 nathan and lowe 2012 and fowler et al 2015 modelled off stream rainwater harvest type sr at a catchment scale habets et al 2018 elaborated a comprehensive review on the sr impact over stream flow at the catchment scale however to our knowledge no study of the region has assessed the catchment the sub catchment and the local water availability considering the effects of sr as well as the relationship of each sr to the upstream drainage area sr is the main infrastructure providing reliable source of water for irrigation in the cerrado biome and as the irrigated agriculture expands in the region the more pressure it will exert over water resources for instance the total center pivot irrigation area growth between 2011 and 2015 at sam was about 29 pinhati 2017 hundreds of sr have been built in the cerrado in the past 30 years a total of 252 sr have been identified in the neighboring catchment of the rio preto river which has a drainage area of 10 500 km2 rodrigues et al 2012 most of those sr are old and do not have documentation about their construction operational and technical characteristics furthermore they have been built without coordination nor evaluation of their hydrological impact on the catchment the volume of water stored in sr in the main irrigated regions of brazil and the cerrado in particular are not widely studied and thus remain largely unknown even though this information is a requisite for proper water resources management especially in agricultural catchments rodrigues and liebe 2013 the challenge is to make the expected growth of the irrigated agriculture in the cerrado sustainable through effective management that considers the role of available water resources within the catchments including the impact of sr the sao marcos catchment sam encompasses one of the largest center pivot irrigation areas in the southern hemisphere in a single catchment with more than 105 000 ha irrigated by center pivots in 2016 pinhati 2017 producing not only commodities for export but also more valuable crops like tomatoes onions garlic potatoes and beans sam is home to one of the most important examples of conflicts over water resources in brazil between the irrigation and the hydroelectric power generation sectors silva and da hora 2015 water availability estimates have traditionally been made without considering water stored in sr resulting in underestimation of the catchment hydrological potential a direct consequence of this underestimation is that the amount of water permit concessions has been limited reducing food production growth and the economic development of the region thus understanding the effect of sr network over the water availability is fundamental for water resources planning and management at sam furthermore understanding the limits of sr expansion is also a key component to estimate future expansion of center pivot irrigation in the catchment and to deliver water and legal security to farmers the overarching objective of this work is to test the hypothesis that sr increase water availability at the local sub catchment and catchment scales when not considering consumptive usage to this end a conceptual model is proposed to estimate the impact of sr over dry season water availability at the above mentioned scales accounting with estimated water storage capacities evaporation and infiltration as losses and regionalized stream flows as inflows bypass at each sr this was partitioned in three specific objectives as follows i to map sr year of construction and surface areas then evaluate the relationship volume upstream drainage area ii to estimate water availability in m3 s 1 of a sr considering its storage capacity then add it to stream flow along the dry season to evaluate the sr effect on water availability at the local at the sub catchment and at the catchment scales and iii compare the effect of sr on the three different scales mentioned above considering stream flow with and without the sr effect in two different scenarios regarding the inflow bypass given by the q95 and by the mean flows this paper is sub divided as the following section 2 materials and methods presents the area of study 2 1 the way sr s year of construction was determined how they were mapped and how the respective upstream drainage areas were calculated 2 2 the procedures used to establish the volume area volume relationship 2 3 the inputs used in the equations that form the conceptual model 2 4 how the equations were applied to model at the three different scales 2 5 and a summary of the inputs applied in the methodology 2 6 the results are then presented in section 3 results as the outcomes of sr mapping definition of year of construction 3 1 the relationship between surface area location and upstream drainage area 3 2 the equation derived by the surface area volume relationship analyses 3 3 the effect of individual sr at the local scale 3 4 sub catchment scale 3 5 and catchment scale 3 6 and the relationship between upstream drainage area and the impact of sr on water availability 3 7 discussion and conclusions are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area based on data acquired with gis analyses sam is completely inserted within the cerrado biome it has a total drainage area of 12065 km² and holds the longest flow path of the paraná river catchment stretching for around 3400 km to the atlantic ocean fig 1 a the climate is of the type aw on the köppen geiger climate classification described by kottek et al 2006 as being equatorial savannah with dry winter with lowest rainfall below 60 mm in winter in fact the climate at sam has strong seasonality with a rainy season occurring from october to april the mean annual rainfall is 1330 mm and temperature ranges from 2 4 c to 32 c inmet 2020 the dry season occurs from may to september lasting for 153 days on average but short to medium term droughts are common during the rainy season a natural phenomenon locally called veranico which can last up to 30 sequential days especially between the months of december and february silva and ferreira 2015 at headwater sub catchments elevation reaches 1255 m and drops to 655 m at the mouth of the são marcos river fig 1b at the headwater sub catchments the topography is smooth to undulated up to 3 slope what in geomorphological terms is known as the cristalina plateau where clayed texture soils high permeable red yellowish oxisols prevail these regions are extensive and economically productive holding 84 of the irrigated area by center pivots in the sam the sub catchments in this plateau have shallow valleys with flat bottoms where occurs a landform known as veredas tubelis 2009 the veredas have linear form and they occur over plinthosols and they are commonly flooded for the construction of sr during the dry season the agricultural production at sam relies on irrigation which depends on streamflow with base flow being the dominant component when streamflow is too low for irrigation supply farmers build sr directly in the river stream thus collecting the majority of the upstream flows to guarantee water supply for irrigation over the dry season but being obligated to let a bypass higher or equal to the q95 ana 2011 fig 1c depicts the most common configuration of the greatest center pivot irrigation projects at sam large center pivot irrigation area at headwater sub catchment on the higher plateaus relying on water stored in dams constructed perpendicular to the flowline 2 2 mapping on farm reservoirs determining year of construction and calculating drainage areas 2 2 1 mapping sr this study is based on the year 2016 the sr were identified using the most recent sub metric satellite images provided by google earth google earth 2017 the analyses are potentially well representative of the features existent in the region for the most recent year at images provided at google earth at the time calculated as the median for most parts of south america is exactly 2016 lesiv et al 2018 these are images with sub metric spatial resolution 0 3 1 0 meter in panchromatic mode and were used to identify and map the sr s surface area at full supply level fsl each sr was manually vectorized on a maximum scale of 1 1000 according to its visual fsl then the surface areas were calculated fig 1c notwithstanding some sr were below their fsl on some of the images used for mapping it is still possible to infer and map sr at their fsl within the cerrado biome because there are no large size trees hiding the margins and recurring water inundation areas around srs leave marks on the landscape that are normally easy to identify however a limitation to this technique is that it may not be possible to obtain the latest satellite image for the current year of analyses hence images from the sentinel satellite were used to update the mapping to reservoirs constructed until 2016 in such case the identification of the fsl is jeopardized because of the 10 m broader spatial resolution of the sentinel satellite images 2 2 2 calculating drainage areas the calculation of the drainage areas upstream from the dam walls of each sr was carried out using the srtm shuttle radar topographic mission digital elevation model dem with 30 m spatial resolution usgs 2020 2 2 3 determining the year of construction using landstat 5 and landsat 7 images provided by google earth the year of construction of each on farm reservoir was identified starting in 1984 this procedure was necessary for evaluation of the expansion of sr and center pivot irrigation along the years because the regionalization of stream flows would have to be based on a period of time when natural flows were more likely to occur without blockages by sr neither water abstraction for irrigation more details about stream flow regionalization is given on sub section 2 4 2 2 3 volume area relationship sr volume estimates were carried out using the relation area x volume in total 105 sr with known volumes were used within sam or in the neighboring catchments the 105 reservoirs are in a region with similar morpho climatic characteristics they are placed in the geomorphological domain of the metasedimentary caps fig 2 from the 105 reservoirs 65 are within sam or neighboring catchments ana 2017 the other 40 reservoirs were measured by rodrigues et al 2012 within the neighboring preto catchment from the total 105 reservoirs 85 were randomly chosen to be part of the area volume relationship analyses whilst the rest were separated for validation the linear regression of the log of both the fsl and the storage capacity determined the area volume relationship points in the curve situated over the 90th percentile or under the 10th percentile were classified as outliers and eliminated and the overall correlation coefficient was evaluated with the standard r² 2 4 modelling the impact of on farm reservoirs over water availability 2 4 1 scenarios to understand how networks of sr impact river flow at the local at the sub catchment and at the catchment scale it is necessary to understand the functioning of a single reservoir to provide insight into how it can have an impact on the river flow and why the impact varies in time and from one reservoir to another the water availability at sam was calculated for the dry season and for each one of its five months may june july august and september by using empirical parameters measured by althoff et al 2019 and rodrigues and dekker 2008 applied to different scenarios as follows with sr effect and without sr effect with inflows of the q95 conservative scenario and with inflows of the mean flow realistic scenario in a monthly time step months of the dry season water balance at the catchment and sub catchment scale and for each sr individually local scale 2 4 2 flow regionalization and the hydrological spatial dataset one of the most used tools in hydrology is the ﬂow duration curve fdc which provides a graphical representation of the frequency distribution of the complete ﬂow regime of a catchment using the fdc it is possible to estimate the percentage of time that a speciﬁed streamﬂow is equaled or exceeded as q95 a fdc can be easily derived from gauged river ﬂow data at daily time scale the data are ranked in descending order and each ordered value is associated with an exceedance probability for example through a plotting position formula the lack of stream gauges and the limited amount of streamﬂow observations characterize several geographical areas around the world and from this point of view sam is not an exception predicting hydrological variables in ungauged catchments has been singled out as one of the major issues in the hydrological sciences sivapalan 2003 transferring information from neighboring catchments to the catchment of interest is generally accomplished by hydrological regionalization methods he et al 2011 numerous regionalization methods have been proposed in the literature bloschl 2005 among the most widely used techniques are regressions between the model parameters and physiographic catchment attributes bloschl 2005 he et al 2011 in this work flow regionalization was carried out using a regression based analysis method based on area ratio transformation in order to evaluate the effect of sr without accounting with consumptive usage we opted to use stream flows prior to the center pivot irrigation expansion and the accompanying sr construction hence observed flows from august 1966 to december 1984 from 4 gauging stations within sam were used fig 2 the use of the natural flows is more suitable for modelling reservoirs when water abstraction is not considered otherwise using historical gauging flow data that already is biased by water abstractions would affect the objectives of this study in another words quantifying and understanding the natural streamflow regime defined as expected streamflow that would occur in the absence of anthropogenic modification to the hydrologic system is critically important for the development of water management strategies aimed at growth in agriculture water balance models have been applied frequently to assess the amount of water still available for new users so if we do not use natural flow rates we would be considering the demands e g agriculture demands twice the general approach used in this study for estimating natural ﬂows is based on the reference condition concept miller et al 2018 and application of statistical models regionalization model developed using observed streamﬂow and climatological physiographic data the reference condition concept makes use of data from a network of reference sites deﬁned as stream sites that are least disturbed by human activities in the present or in the past as calibration data to develop models that are then applied to all stream reaches a synthetic hydrographic spatial dataset was created using the digital elevation model dem from the srtm with 30 meter spatial resolution the dem was hydrologically enforced with the drainage lines provided by the national water agency of brazil ana which was created in a scale of 1 100000 this process generated the sub catchments which were subsequently codified using the pfafstetter codification method verdin and verdin 1999 a process that can be executed using the pghydro plug in for qgis 2 18 teixeira 2018 then using the hydrological data generated by the pghydro plug in it was possible to incorporate the monthly flow regionalization to each sub catchment according to its respective upstream drainage area the final product of this process was a gis polygonal shape vectorial dataset representing the sam catchment sub divided into 4161 sub catchments associated to a tabular monthly flow data referred to the months of may june july august and september individually and for the entire 153 days representing the dry season featuring both the q95 and mean flows corresponding to each sub catchment when presenting the equations bellow the q95 and mean flows obtained by the regionalization process are used as the qx parameter either being represented by the q95 streamflow in the conservative scenario or by the mean flows on the realistic scenario 2

catchment with order i and qx average water inflows in the reservoir or sub catchment q95 or mean flows both terms above depend on the the time passed since 1st of may as the analysis refers to a

to simulate a trapezoid in which the surface area is always greater than the area of the lake bottom where most of the water infiltration occurs we do not consider lateral infiltration in the reservoirs in this study the i a v e r used was equal to 5 2 mm day 1 corresponding to an average infiltration rate in the reservoirs rodrigues and dekker 2008 the effect of a sr over water availability at the local scale is given by eqs 7 and 8 7 w h i l e d n e t a v a i l a b i l i t y i 0 s r s t i l l c o n t r i b u t e t o l o c a l w a t e r a v a i l a b i l i t y 8 e l s e d n

that their full capacities add to the river streamflow 2 5 modelling on farm reservoirs impact at three different scales 2 5 1 sub catchment scale for the impact of sr over water availability at the sub catchment scale the impacts of individual sr were aggregated by considering the cumulative effect of all sr to do so each sr received the pfafstetter code of the respective sub catchment according to the location of the center of their dam wall a procedure carried out in gis afterwards using a python code into a gis routine the equation given by the area x volume relationship was applied to calculate the estimated volume of each sr and the resulting volumes added up per sub catchment sequentially the sub catchments were hydrologically modelled with the equations from 1 to 6 for this scale of analysis the average evaporation values used are the average monthly values shown at table 1 and the infiltration a constant value of 5 2 mm s 1 finally the above procedure accounted for the losses by infiltration and evaporation and inflows given by the q95 and mean flows at a monthly time step 2 5 2 local and catchment scales for the local and for the catchment scale analyses tabular data containing just the estimated volumes and upstream drainage areas of each sr were exported from gis to a spreadsheet format subsequently eqs 1 6 were applied but the only difference being that no q x was added on eq 3 hence the equations were applied at a monthly time step focusing on reservoirs individually for the local scale analyses and as a bulk storage net of sr for the catchment scale analyses for both scales of analysis the average evaporation values used are the average monthly values shown at table 1 and the constant infiltration value of 5 2 mm s 1 finally the above procedure accounted for the losses by infiltration and evaporation and the results showing the condition of sr by the end of the dry season 2 6 summary of methodological inputs the inputs described at the material and methods section 2 are summarized in table 2 3 results 3 1 identification and year of construction in total 458 sr were identified fig 3 a from which 39 were identified at the 1984 landsat 5 images a boom of sr construction was verified between 1998 and 2004 with 50 4 of the sr built during that time just 14 sr were not identified in images from the google earth platform therefore being identified using images of the sentinel satellite the sr have their fsl ranging from 0 1 ha to 198 ha mean 11 6 ha standard deviation 24 2 ha whereas 85 8 n 393 of the sr have a fsl smaller than 10 ha fig 3b the sum of the 458 sr is 5348 ha which corresponds to 0 44 compared to the area of sam 3 2 surface area location and drainage area relationship in this study the relationship between upstream drainage area and quantity of sr as well as sr s average storage volume has been investigated the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate this relationship the r2 can range from zero no linear relationship to 1 0 perfect relationship analysis show that 53 of the sr are in sub catchments with 7 km2 or less in drainage areas fig 4 a the coefficient of determination r2 for the relationship between percentage of farm dams and upstream drainage area showed a negative correlation of 0 67 the results of sr s surface area volume relationship will be covered at section 3 3 but it s needful to highlight the fact that from the 193 hm³ of water stored in sr at sam 25 9 hm³ 13 4 of that water is stored in sr with upstream drainage areas less or equal to 7 km2 average of 0 05 hm³ per sr in contrast sr located in regions with upstream drainage areas greater or equal to 100 km² represents just 4 1 of the total number of sr but represent 23 2 of the total water stored in sr average of 2 49 hm³ per sr fig 4b illustrates the relation between upstream drainage area and the average storage capacity per sr showing a good positive correlation with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 74 typical sr system configurations that occurs at sam can be seen in fig 5 on its upper row it illustrates three common sr system configurations where the upstream drainage area is the main factor of differentiation fig 5a depicts three small sr closely in cascade respective volumes from upstream to downstream 0 8 hm³ 1 2 hm³ 0 2 hm³ which are the source of water for center pivots summing 974 ha fig 5b shows a sr with an estimated volume of 8 4 hm³ that provides water for irrigation of 854 ha fig 5c illustrate a sr with estimated volume of 3 3 hm³ being able to deliver water for the irrigation of 790 ha including an open irrigation channel deriving from it conveying water to one center pivot located at more than 2 km from the dam wall on the bottom row of each figure is shown the drainage area of each sr which are 6 7 km2 fig 5a 519 km2 fig 5b and 126 km2 fig 5c respectively 3 3 surface area volume relationship despite the variety of shapes of the 85 sr chosen for the regression analyses and after the exclusion of 21 reservoirs considered outliers for being above the 90th or under the 10th percentiles the derived equation area volume eq 9 for the whole sam based on 64 sr was satisfactory fitting observed data fig 6 with a r2 of 0 93 9 v 0 019 a 1 1762 estimation of volumes of the 64 sr using eq 9 had a correlation of 0 90 with their known volumes the difference between the observed and the estimated volumes was some 17 less for the estimated volumes and this may represent a tendency of underestimation of the sr actual volumes the total estimated volume for the 458 sr was equal to 193 hm³ or 19 3 billion liters the validation of eq 9 was carried out using 20 sr chosen from the entire population of 105 sr with known volumes fig 6b after the exclusion of 2 sr considered outliers it is noticeable that the potential curve adjusted based on the known volumes is close to the potential curve of the estimated volumes calculated with the eq 9 the root mean square error is 0 84 and the correlation between the observed and the estimated volumes is 0 91 after applying eq 9 to estimate the storage capacity of sr at sam the results show that the storage capacities range from 0 00008 hm3 to 9 5 hm3 with average capacity of 0 42 hm3 standard deviation 1 hm3 there are 449 sr with maximum storage capacity bellow 3 hm³ meaning that only roughly 2 of the sr n 9 are within the limit used by hanasaki et al 2010 and yoshikawa et al 2014 to define a medium size reservoir fig 5b and c meaning that all the other sr n 449 are bellow this limit 3 4 effect at the local scale net water availability for each sr as a function of its fsl at the end of the dry season is presented in fig 7 fig 7 suggests that a sr must have a capacity at fsl greater than 0 08 ha to be able to contribute to the local water availability along the entire dry season if not accounting with any input of rain or stream flow that is at some point along the 153 days of the dry season smaller sr do not improve local water availability because losses by evaporation and infiltration exceeds their storage capacity hence our results show that sr with fsl greater than 800 m² have storage capacities around 974 m³ which is the threshold volume a sr must have to be able to exert an improvement in terms of local water availability along the entire dry season fig 8 exemplifies the role of evaporation and infiltration over all sr between the start of the dry season in may and in a monthly timescale until the end of the dry season in september fig 8a and b depict the influence of infiltration on the monthly volume of all sr and on the sr below 0 25 ha respectivelly while infiltration slightly affects volume depletion in overall terms evaporation has a stronger influence and reduces sr storage volumes in a more intensive way fig 8c show the effect of evaporation on all sr along the dry season while fig 8d only on sr 0 25 ha fig 8e demonstrates the effect of infiltration and evaporation on the water depletion process on all sr whilst fig 8f focus on sr 0 25 ha some of the lowest capacity sr have a complete depletion of their volume after the fourth month of the dry season in the end of august while 8 of the sr 1 7 have a complete depletion in the end of the dry season in september in other words at the beginning of the dry season sr start with 193 hm³ of stored water from which 43 hm³ 22 is depleted by evaporation and 21 hm³ 11 is depleted by infiltration dropping to 129 hm3 the total amount of water stored in sr at sam by the end of the dry season rainfall usually starts in october commonly re filling sr with water until they reach their fsl prior to the dry season of the next hydrological period 3 5 effect at the sub catchment scale the regionalization of flows using the area ratio transformation method generates a q95 natural streamflow at the mouth of the river são marcos ranging from 92 8 m3 s 1 in may to 32 m3 s 1 in september while the mean natural streamflow in the same location is 183 3 m3 s 1 in may and 71 5 m3 s 1 in september the 458 sr were spatially joined to sub catchments resulting in 319 sub catchments containing sr ranging from 1 to 8 sr per sub catchment average of 1 44 sr per sub catchment in one hand results show that the average may to september q95 and mean water availability increased at the 319 sub catchments with sr fig 9 a and b when compared with stream flows without the sr effect that is accounting with the sr effect q95 net water availability had a relative increase of 72 4 and 44 4 in may and september respectively while mean flows increased 43 4 and 20 0 on the other hand net water availability percentage increase generated by sr is even higher when considering just the 180 headwater sub catchments containing sr for both q95 and mean flows fig 9c and d respectively that is at the 180 headwater sub catchments containing sr the sum of sr volumes yields a 162 increase in net water availability 0 08 to 0 21 m³ s 1 when considering the q95 flows and 86 increase in net water availability 0 15 to 0 28 m³ s 1 when considering mean flows both related to the beginning of the dry season in may sequentially fig 10 geographically depicts the sr impact at the sub catchment scale shown at fig 9 considering the q95 flows 10a and mean flows 10e over the 4161 sub catchments that form sam fig 10b and 10f depicts that in percentage terms the impact of sr exerts a higher influence over water availability at headwater sub catchments specially when sr is built closely in cascade within the same sub catchment indeed it is possible to verify that the impact of sr over water availability at the sub catchment scale is more pronounced at the q95 scenario fig 10b and 10d than at the mean flows scenario fig 10f and 10h thus in relative terms sr have greater positive impact over water availability in scenarios with lower stream flows 3 6 effect at the catchment scale the net storage of water in sr is depleted by infiltration and evaporation throughout the 153 days of the dry season the individual impact of each input used in this model is presented at fig 11 it can be noted that evaporation red line causes the greatest variability on water availability which can deplete net sr volume by up to 21 between day 0 and day 153 furthermore considering the lumped volume depletion of sr by infiltration green line and infiltration net water stored in sr diminishes 41 by the start and the end of the dry season black line although infiltration is a loss at the local scale the water is not lost from the overall catchment streamflow as it is mostly diverted habets et al 2018 feeding base flow and increasing the volume of surface water downstream fig 11 shows that the net storage of water in sr is 193 hm³ at the catchment scale when converted to streamflow by dividing this volume for the 153 days of the dry season the water stored in sr corresponds to 14 6 m3 s 1 at the catchment scale this represent a potential increment to the flow of about 8 in the beginning of the dry season considering that the mean flow at the mouth of the são marcos river is equivalent to 183 m3 s 1 in may however assuming that water stored in sr is depleted only by evaporation and infiltration the total stored volume would lower to 135 hm3 at the end of the dry season converting this volume to streamflow by the end of the dry season it would be equivalent to more 9 m3 s 1 of water flowing at the mouth of sam representing 13 of the mean stream flow and 28 of the q95 flow in september which are 71 m3 s 1 and 32 m3 s 1 respectively 3 7 upstream drainage area and impact on water availability upstream drainage area in relation to the sr dam walls is not a direct input in our conceptual model but it is a variable that can be related to the location of the majority of sr at sam as shown in fig 4a in addition fig 7 illustrates that at the local scale a single sr must have a fsl greater than 0 08 ha to be able to increase local water availability along the entire dry season and figs 9 and 10 demonstrate that the lumped storage capacities of sr closely built in cascade can considerably augment water availability especially at headwater sub catchments regions to this end fig 5a denotes the common practice at sam of building sr closely in cascade to overcome low water availability at these regions finally when converting water stored in sr to stream flow fig 12 illustrates that sr with greater drainage areas tend to exert a greater impact over water availability that is the relationship between the average net water availability of sr separated in groups by ranges of upstream drainage areas shows the good coefficient of determination r2 of 0 76 fig 12 also denotes that in addition to the minimum fsl of 0 08 ha a single sr at sam tends to exert greater increases in local water availability providing it is in a region with more than 3 km² of upstream drainage area this is is related to the fact that the greater the upstream drainage area the greater the sr average storage capacity as show at fig 4b 4 discussion growth in agriculture has been responsible for much of the loss of biodiversity and habitats and of regulating ecosystem services better water management can mitigate many of the negative consequences iwmi 2007 to this end this study presented an extensive methodology to investigate the impact of sr an important contribution for water resources planning and management 4 1 model conceptualization the model presented in this paper represents a theory influenced empirical grey box process based conceptual model which relies on ordinary differential equations regarding the classification proposed by jakeman et al 2006 and janssen et al 2015 it is designed with a linear structure using constant coefficients infiltration and evaporation applied in a spatially heterogeneous environment with time varying characteristics monthly heterogeneous streamflow along the dry season within the well defined boundaries of sam as well as the boundaries of its 4161 sub catchments basically this model ignores water abstraction for consumptive usage but relies on three input data linearly related for the local and catchment scales sr volume given by surface areas at full supply level fsl evaporation and infiltration whereas at the sub catchment scale one more input data is added to the three listed above stream flow the estimation of the effect of large reservoirs in continental streamflow calculated by biemans et al 2011 and ouyang et al 2011 and the review paper of habets et al 2018 have presented comprehensive studies on the impact of reservoirs on streamflow and irrigation water supply but to the knowledge of the authors this study is the first to investigate and assess the role of a spatially explicit representation network of sr in a single catchment and its sub divisions in sub catchments then modelling the way sr affect water availability at three different scales catchment sub catchment and local scales 4 2 uncertainties fowler et al 2015 mention that the largest source of uncertainty in sr modelling is the specification of the relationship between flow at a gauge and inflow into a given sr whereas a secondary source of uncertainty is accounting for missed sr that do not appear in data sources such as topographic maps hence in one hand the regionalization of measured flow by the area ratio transformation is a potential source of uncertainty even though this is a method that can be highly efficient for predicting stream flow in ungauged catchments mohammed et al 2019 on the other hand the spatial representation of sr in this conceptual model is remarkable for it represents sr mapped at scales as detailed as 1 1000 allowing the inclusion of sr with surface areas of as little as 100 m² in addition the identification and mapping of sr on fsl represent a minor uncertainty because sr storage level have little variation along the year at sam notwithstanding the detailed spatial representation of sr their storage capacity estimation is probably the greater source of uncertainty despite the good coefficient of determination r2 acquired in the area fsl volume relationship firstly considering that evaporation and infiltration are a function of the fsl of each sr eqs 5 and 6 it is expected a marginal overestimation of both evaporation and infiltration rates because the values of fsl remain static along the entire time steps used in this model monthly and seasonal to overcome this problem the model would have to consider a gradual decrease in both volumes lost by infiltration and evaporation along the time secondly the general relationship by linear regression between sr with measured volumes and their surface area at full supply level fsl showed good agreement but the lack of bigger reservoirs storage capacity 3 hm3 with known volumes was detrimental for volume estimation of larger sr hence the model could account with two or more regression equations to estimate volumes of sr based on different groups separated by similar fsl but this method is conditioned to the existence of a dataset containing enough examples of sr with known storage capacities representing the distinct groups of fsl for this reason investments in bathymetry over a set of representative sr is a worthwhile alternative to get better results with this method of sr volume estimation thirdly river damming provokes an increase of the water retention time wang et al 2019 allowing sediments in suspension in the water to settle down at the bottom of reservoirs decreasing their storage capacity globally this effect causes the retention of more than 50 of the sediment flux in regulated catchments vörösmarty et al 2003 hence this conceptual model still needs to evolve to consider the sedimentation processes in sr 4 3 upstream drainage areas and sr closely in cascade habets et al 2018 stated that the estimated upstream drainage area of sr is a key morphological characteristic nathan and lowe 2012 also acknowledge it mentioning that the volume of water harvested from off stream farm dams is dependent on the amount of catchment runoff entering the dam our research explored the relationship between upstream drainage area against number of sr per range of upstream drainage area fig 4a and against stored volume in sr fig 4b these figures imply that farms at headwater sub catchments tend to have more sr than farms located at downstream sub catchments this is because farms at the former locations have ideal topography for mechanization allowing the installation of a great number of center pivots but the presence of larger sr is prevented by local physical constraints what is handled with a greater number of smaller sr despite this data not being used as input in the model it is an important characteristic related to the location where sr are more likely to be built and the size capacity of srs which is a valuable information for planning purposes for example fig 12 show that two reservoirs with similar size capacity have different impacts according to their location along the stream network this is because headwater sub catchments have lower stream flows in consequence of their smaller upstream drainage areas what generates discharges with lower erosive energy this fact leads to shallow valleys a detrimental landform for sr construction considering that the erosive power of a stream is related to its discharge amonsgst other variables bagnold 1960 and discharge is a function of drainage area finlayson and montgomery 2003 there is a tendency to the formation of deeper valleys at downstream sub catchments meaning that these type of sub catchments are more likely to have the physical characteristics allowing the construction of larger reservoirs for this reason in one hand farmers at headwater sub catchments build a number of smaller srs closely in cascade fig 5a to overcome the local physical limitations furthermore when building sr closely in cascade their volumes can be added up at the sub catchment scale because farmers have full control of the imediate upstream sr hence releasing water to the downstream sr when necessary on the other hand farmers at downstream sub catchments can opt to build one single bigger sr fig 5b and c to fulfill their requirements of water for irrigation 4 4 effect on water availability most previous studies have evaluated the cumulative impacts of many reservoirs in a catchment in which the modifications are induced by a set of reservoirs or reservoir network taken as a whole in this case the total impact is therefore equal to the sum of the impacts of the developments and to interaction effects of such reservoirs on hydrology adding to that nathan and lowe 2012 state that the factors influencing the impact of sr on stream hydrology include the total volume of upstream dams the magnitude of extractions to supply on farm demand the seasonal pattern of these abstractions relative to the local pattern of runoff and the proportion of a given catchment area that is impounded by farm dams furthermore ouyang et al 2011 calculated the cascade impact of eight dams in the yellow river and found that the yearly volume difference between the inlet and outlet dropped by 33 as a direct consequence of the operation of the dams which includes water abstraction for irrigation and habets et al 2018 mentioned water abstraction as a component of water balance therefore causing lower stream flows downstream thus there are very few studies showing the effect of non operated small reservoirs on stream flows in this paper sr act as a tank storing water disregarding any withdrawal evaporation or infiltration the volume of water inflow in the sr will eventually be the outflow in the same amount a similar approach was adopted by biemans et al 2011 who considered that the total monthly inflow into reservoirs was released to downstream when the reservoir was not built for irrigation purposes based on these assumptions there is no reason for the sr to decrease the flow in the river sr will then act as a water buffer during the dry season regulating the river discharge for instance if river discharge decrease inflow to reservoir the outflow will keep the same for a period of time depending on the size of the reservoir this fact does not happen in a river without reservoir in another words sr helps to maintain the river flow as a consequence the increase on the number of reservoirs can increase the amount of water usage in the catchment either by the increase in evaporation or in water withdrawal the infiltrated water has a different behavior as it keeps in the water system and can be used downstream this paper focused on assessing the impact of sr on water availability catchment hydrological functioning particularly runoff temporal and spatial variability is out of scope of our research at this stage in this respect we considered a distinction between hydrology and available water resources made by beran 1986 the former deals with evaluating the total resource naturalized river flow whilst the latter requires the quantification of the exploitable amount hence it would be more appropriate to compare the present study with those that dealt with the socioeconomic impact several authors have investigated how the impact of sr on hydrology can be reduced by the presence of small reservoirs that are having positive socioeconomic impacts on the local population blanc and strobl 2013 acheampong et al 2014 lasage and verburg 2015 for instance focus on the social benefit of small sand reservoirs to secure water access in the context of climate change the increase in pressure to construct small reservoirs van der zaag and gupta 2008 thomas et al 2011 clearly shows this improvement from a socioeconomic perspective this increase is driven for the part of the global population that will experience water scarcity which is projected to increase with climate change ipcc 2014 as poussin et al 2015 and berbemeier et al 2017 mentioned small reservoirs are important for both food and water security to that we add that sr can also play a role in environmental security when promoting agricultural land use intensification by irrigation thus relieving pressure over native vegetation despite the trade off with the loss of biodiversity when flooding riparian vegetation 4 5 the brazilian legislation for water permits in brazil reference flows are used as the basis for defining available water resources and determining whether water is available for allocation or not such as when making decisions on issuing water permits the minimum streamflows q95 have been used to define the limit of authorization of water use water permits by the national water agency of brazil ana 2011 hence this is the reason the q95 scenario has been used in this study however as demands increase as expected in sam more flexible approaches could offer greater capacity to maximize the benefits available from the river system therefore a scenario with the mean flow was also considered to represent an alternative 4 6 insights and future work this work is part of a larger on going modeling framework that uses a novel methodology to simulate the expansion of center pivot irrigation at sam 5 conclusion the impact of a single sr over water availability is proportional to its size but it is also related to its location in the catchment given the tendency that the greater the upstream drainage area the bigger its storage capacity will be indeed individual sr with upstream drainage areas 3 km2 were shown to exert little impact on local water availability for instance sr with fsl 0 08 ha do not contribute any increase in local water availability during the entire dry season thus irrigators at sam have traditionally addressed the low water availability at headwater sub catchments by building srs closely in cascade apart from local climate rainfall and evaporation and local physical characteristics such as geology and type of soils the ability of sr to augment water availability is mainly determined by the inflow the number of sr closely built in cascade if that is the case and their volumetric capacity which is a function of their size and depth yet all these parameters can be related to sr s upstream drainage areas information about these relationships can be acquired with mapping combined with measurements of sr at their fsl based on periodic free of charge high and medium resolution satellite images in conclusion the methodology presented in this study means that sr for which detailed information has been lacking can be included in water management thus incorporating important data into hydrological analyses for a range of different purposes declaration of competing interest none

10467,it is understood that the major transport pathways for the soluble nutrients nitrate no3 n and orthophosphorus op from cropped fields to streams in the u s cornbelt are tile drainage and groundwater seepage the relative contribution of each however has not been well quantified and can vary between fields and watersheds in this study we used intermittent grab sample water quality monitoring and tile flow measurements and the groundwater model modflow to source dissolved nutrients from a cropped field to a low order stream in the intensively drained and cropped des moines lobe landform of north central iowa based on monitoring of eight tile outlets nine groundwater wells and the receiving stream over a two year period nutrient loads from tiles were found to contribute approximately 98 of the nitrate load to hardin creek the loading pattern for op was also dominated by discharge from constructed drainage with 99 7 sourced back to field tiles results from the farm field fit within the scaling pattern observed within the des moines lobe region of iowa showing that water yields and no3 n loads are dominated by tile drainage at the field and local watershed scale loads dominated by tile flows suggest edge of field interception and treatment of tile water for mitigation of stream nutrients study results are consistent with local and regional assessments showing

combined management practices from producers within larger geographical areas e g jha et al 2010 quantifying nutrient losses from a single cropped field is less commonly done but this scale allows one

within a single iowa watershed rozemeijer et al 2010 separated tile effluent from groundwater at a field site in the netherlands and reported that tiles contributed 89 93 of the no3 n loads from a

25 is located along the calhoun and webster county line in north central iowa fig 1 hardin creek which bisects the site drains a watershed area above the site of approximately 3990 ha that is dominated by row crops of corn and soybeans 88 7 the stream is located within the dml ecoregion of iowa a recently 12 000 years bp glaciated landscape containing many drained pothole wetlands prior 1991 dominant soils include the clarion nicollet webster soil association consisting of silty and loamy soils formed in glacial till coland and cylinder soils are present along the riparian zone of the stream koppen 1981 in many areas of the cornbelt drainage districts were formed by landowners to facilitate drainage over large areas mccorvie and lant 1993 present day iowa for example includes at least 2 5 million ha that lie within more than 3000 drainage districts schilling et al 2012 hardin creek flows through the webster and calhoun joint drainage district fig 1 and the creek channel flowing through the site has been straightened and heavily altered historical photographs indicate that the straightening occurred before the 1930 s https geodata iowa gov the stream channel has a trapezoidal shape and is lined by ditch spoils as a small levee an 18 m wide riparian zone of primarily cool season grass buffers the stream from the adjacent cropped field fig 1 during the 2018 monitoring year the producer cropped the field in corn following soybeans using an n application rate of approximately 180 kg ha the 2018 corn yield for the field averaged approximately 13 500 kg ha in 2019 the field was planted in corn but planting and additional harvesting details were not available for this year 2 2 site characterization a geophysical survey was conducted using electrical resistivity er and electromagnetic terrain conductivity em methods to characterize the subsurface geology of the site with the er method an electrical current is induced into the subsurface through stainless steel electrodes at locations along a transect and the resulting electric potential is used to map the resistivity of the subsurface materials to depths of 100 m after processing and inversion of the er data results are presented as a two dimensional model representing bulk electrical resistivity values in ohm meters at depth along a surface transect for em mapping we used a geonics em 31 mk2 ground conductivity meter the em 31 maps changes in ground conductivity inverse of resistivity using an electromagnetic induction technique with an effective depth of penetration of approximately 6 m www geonics com the em 31 survey consisted of traversing survey lines oriented east west across the area values were recorded in a continuous manner and stamped with the coordinate locations using a high precision gps the survey points were contoured by kriging in arcgis monitoring wells were installed in three 3 well transects perpendicular to the stream channel fig 1 using a truck mounted giddings drilling rig the 3 8 cm diameter wells were installed in a 10 cm borehole to a depth of 4 5 m and consisted of a 3 0 m well screen a 1 5 m riser that extended the well to the land surface an additional 1 m of riser was added to the stickup at each well for sampling purposes after planting a silica sand filter pack was poured around the screen and bentonite chips were added to provide a seal following well installation the wells were developed by surging and overpumping using a waterra sampling system the wells were instrumented with a non vented minitroll transducer 30 psi in situ inc to measure hourly water table fluctuations stream stage was also monitored hourly in hardin creek from march to november 2018 using a non vented minitroll transducer 30 psi in situ inc secured to a post hand driven into the creek bed regional precipitation data were downloaded from the iowa environmental mesonet http mesonet agron iastate edu 2 3 flow and water table measurement and water sampling procedures the monitoring wells were sampled on 13 occasions from march to november in 2018 water levels in wells were measured to the nearest 0 01 foot at the time of sampling water samples were collected using a peristaltic pump and analyzed in the field for temperature specific conductance sc ph dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp using a ysi model 556 water quality meter water samples were also collected as grab samples from eight tiles when flowing and hardin creek in 2018 three tiles mapped along the field tiles 3 4 and 8 were never flowing and were not included in the analysis flow rates from the tiles at the time of sampling were estimated using a timer and a graduated 5 gal bucket for low flow tiles we measured the volume after one minute of elapsed time and for higher flows we timed the filling of the entire bucket at very high tile flows the time to fill the bucket was less than one second and the discharge value was an estimate developed from multiple measurements at a minimum bucket measurements were repeated three times to develop an average flow rate for the tile tiles could not be accessed on two occasions june 20 and september 5 because high flow in hardin creek submerged the tile outlets in 2019 eleven drainage tiles were sampled on eight occasions between april 9 to november 3 using the same methods at times no water flowed from the tiles at scheduled sampling dates and thus they were not sampled on those days 2 4 water quality analysis water samples were hand delivered to the iowa soybean association laboratory on the day of collection the iowa soybean association maintains a certified water quality testing laboratory in ankeny iowa samples were immediately analyzed on the day of collection using environmental protection agency method 300 0 pfaff 1993 quality assurance quality control protocols included analysis of blanks fortified samples spikes replicates and known concentration samples with each analytical batch concentrations of no3 n op cl and so4 are reported as mg l 2 5 groundwater flow model to estimate groundwater discharge to hardin creek from the field site a three dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed using modeling software visual modflow classic version v 4 6 0 168 a two layer model was used for the simulation layer 1 represented the oxidized loamy glacial till and alluvium with a horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 30 5 m day that is typical for loamy soil conditions layer 2 represented a confining silty clay alluvial clay or unoxidized glacial till with a horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 0 00305 m day vertical hydraulic conductivity was estimated to be 1 10 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity in both layers the local catchment divide located approximately 1500 m from the stream channel was considered a no flow boundary this was represented by de activating the grids in these regions constant head boundaries were used to simulate lateral groundwater recharge into the heavily tiled study area a total of six constant head boundaries approximately 200 m in length were created and evenly spaced along the outer perimeter of the model area hardin creek was represented as a river boundary vertical conductivity of the drainage ditch was estimated to be 0 061 m day this conductivity value is less than typical sandy sediment and reflects the accumulation of finer sediments observed in the bedload of the ditch the surface water gradient was estimated using available statewide lidar elevation data https geodata iowa gov 2 6 nutrient load calculations nutrient mass loads from the tiles to hardin creek were estimated by first calculating daily flow volume from the measured instantaneous tile flow rate this amount was then multiplied by the measured analyte concentration in a grab sample collected immediately following flow rate measurement to produce a kg day load value an average daily load was calculated from the monitoring days and then extrapolated to the entirety of the monitoring period to get an overall load kg groundwater nutrient mass was estimated by multiplying the average analyte concentration measured in the wells n 9 by the model estimated steady state groundwater discharge to the stream nitrate yields were estimated by dividing the mass load by the catchment area which was estimated by delineating the watershed area contributing to hardin creek fig 1 3 results 3 1 site geology the em mapping identified a region of higher ground resistivity 25 o m along the hardin creek channel with higher values along the southern riparian zone fig 2 higher resistivity is indicative of a greater sand content along the stream channel and the sand was particularly evident during well installation on the southern side lower resistivity is indicative of a greater fraction of silt and clay in the sediment and this was common in the tiled portion of both sides of the field the em survey indicated that the cropped portion of the site upgradient of the stream is less permeable greater fines than the sandy floodplain near the stream an er survey penetrates to a greater depth we focused on the top 30 m and was conducted along six transects perpendicular from the edge of an agricultural field to the stream fig 2 the resistivity of the sediments ranged from approximately 10 40 ohm m and based on correlations established at other sites vogelgesang et al 2020 the variations confirmed the lithologic materials suggested by the em data in the north transect line 2 the upland loamy stratigraphy transitioned to higher resistive and sandier material near the channel likewise in the south transect line 5 there was an abrupt boundary of upland loam to sandy alluvium approximately 75 m from the channel centerline overall results from the em and er surveys are consistent and suggest the upland geology consists primarily of loam whereas the riparian zone of hardin creek contains considerably more sand 3 2 hydrology precipitation was not measured at the site but 2018 annual precipitation totals in towns that triangulate around the site had values of 1337 mm ft dodge 1092 mm sac city and 1209 mm carroll all of these totals are well above normal for the region which is approximately 905 mm https www weather gov june and august were very wet months with 180 mm and 384 mm of rainfall in ft dodge during these periods respectively hardin creek approached overbank conditions in late june and early september and tiles discharging to the creek were under water during these periods precipitation was also above normal in 2019 1228 mm in ft dodge stream stage in hardin creek reflected local precipitation patterns with a series of high stage events in late may and june followed by a quiet period in july and august and a series of high flow events in september and october fig 3 tile discharge and flow rates varied considerably among individual tiles and throughout the year table 1 discharge was greatest from tile 11 ranging from 2870 m3 day on june 27 after the flood period to 12 2 m3 day approximately 40 days later on august 6 no tiles were flowing at the site on september 5 discharges from tiles 6 and 7 were also higher than the others averaging approximately 152 and 767 m3 day during 2018 average discharge from the five other tiles ranged from 9 to 73 m3 day table 1 tile discharge was slightly lower in 2019 compared to 2018 but the relative magnitude was very similar fig 4 average discharge from tiles 7 and 11 was higher than the other tiles but flows were approximately 40 less in 2019 water table depth fluctuations showed a similar pattern as stream stage and reflected periods of concentrated recharge during rainfall events and longer periods of relative quiescence and recession fig 3 greater fluctuations were observed in the near stream riparian zone wells compared to those located in the field w3 w9 water table depths were greatest in wells located nearest the channel 3 0 3 5 m deep and were shallowest in the field wells 1 5 1 9 m deep the pattern of deeper water tables in the riparian zones of incised and channelized streams compared to distal floodplain areas has previously been observed in iowa schilling et al 2004 groundwater at the site flows from the surroundings uplands to hardin creek under a horizontal hydraulic gradient of approximately 0 014 on both sides of the channel to estimate groundwater discharge into hardin creek the groundwater flow model constructed for the site was calibrated using average aquifer conditions measured in 2018 model estimated hydraulic heads were compared to measured values and the absolute residual mean in head was 0 21 m with a normalized root mean square error of 7 5 fig 5 model results suggested that groundwater under steady state mean hydraulic head conditions discharges approximately 32 4 m3 day into hardin creek within the boundaries of the farm field 3 3 water quality mean values of water quality measurements are provided in table 3 nitrate concentrations were highest in tiles 7 1 19 1 mg l and hardin creek 12 3 mg l and were lower in groundwater 7 0 mg l however mean groundwater nitrate concentrations ranged from 0 5 15 8 mg l indicating substantial variability among the nine wells table 2 in particular no3 n concentrations were much higher in the field wells w3 w6 w9 compared to the near stream and riparian zone wells high nitrate concentrations were also measured in the near stream well w7 located in sandy sediments along the south side of hardin creek fig 2 temporally no3 n concentrations were higher in groundwater and tile flow in the spring period april to july and with the exception of tile 10 were lower in late summer and fall fig 6 the no3 n concentrations in tile 10 remained high throughout the 2018 monitoring period 15 25 mg l and one sample was measured at 24 3 mg l as late as november 27 2018 in 2019 only the tiles were sampled at the field site and nitrate concentrations averaged between 6 13 3 mg l among the tile sites table 3 concentrations were approximately 1 6 mg l lower in 2019 compared to 2018 likely due to less precipitation occurring in the year mean op concentrations were also higher in tiles than groundwater and hardin creek but this was largely due to high op concentrations in tiles 10 and 1 that averaged 1 3 and 0 57 mg l respectively other tile concentrations were similar 0 15 to 0 35 mg l to mean groundwater op concentrations 0 13 to 0 35 mg l overall tile water samples had higher mean values of do orp and cl while groundwater had higher specific conductance sc and so4 table 3 surface water in hardin creek tended to have a more intermediate concentration range between the tiles and groundwater in terms of sc and major ions cl so4 but do and no3 n concentrations were similar to those measured in the tiles 3 4 nutrient loading from tiles and groundwater to hardin creek nutrient loads into hardin creek were dominated by tile discharge table 1 based on 11 measurement days throughout the 2018 field season nitrate loads from tiles ranged from 0 12 to 82 4 kg day whereas nitrate loads from groundwater discharge ranged from 0 06 to 0 41 kg day based on the fraction of total load tiles contributed approximately 98 of the nitrate n load to hardin creek within the field boundary for all measurement days except august 8 when tile discharge was substantially lower on this date the tile groundwater proportion was generally equivalent 55 vs 45 respectively the wells were not monitored in 2019 but if we assume groundwater discharge was the same steady state condition in 2019 and mean annual n concentration were also the same approximately 7 mg l the relative proportion of tile nitrate loads to hardin creek ranged from approximately 95 6 99 6 from april to july 2019 in august and september 2019 when nearly all the tiles stopped flowing groundwater seepage may have provided approximately 93 4 and 100 of the flow from the farm field to the channel the loading pattern was similar for op in 2018 table 1 for the measurement period op loads were dominated by tile discharge 99 7 for both nitrate and op the nutrient loading fractions were largely driven by differences in water flux through tiles compared to groundwater 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient export from tiles and groundwater study results indicated that tile discharge provided the vast majority of flow nitrate and op loads to the portion of hardin creek flowing through the farm field during the april november period in iowa tile contributions largely exceeded 95 99 of nitrate and op loads when they were flowing but when conditions became dry in august 2018 and august september 2019 tile flow was reduced and groundwater provided most of the discharge and loads table 1 however it is important to note that the amount of load discharged during the low flow periods was insignificant compared to the spring and early summer loads for the monitoring days in 2018 the total nitrate loads from tiles was 359 kg whereas the total groundwater load was 2 6 kg as a fraction of the total tiles contributed approximately 99 5 of the nitrate and op loads and groundwater provided 0 5 a similar proportion of tile vs groundwater nitrate loads was observed discharging to a restored oxbow site located nearby in north central iowa schilling et al 2017 at that site tile nitrate loads accounted for more than 99 of the input nitrate load to the oxbow compared to groundwater seepage the results from this farm scale study are consistent with watershed studies reporting the contributions of tiles to water and nutrient flux king et al 2015 reported that subsurface tile flow contributed 37 74 of discharge in a 389 ha subwatershed of upper big walnut creek in ohio macrae et al 2007 estimated that 42 of the basin annual discharge originated from drainage tiles in a 3 km2 watershed in ontario arenas amado et al 2017 and thomas et al 2016 estimated that tile drainage accounted for 15 43 and 39 of streamflow in two northeast iowa watersheds respectively more recently schilling et al 2019 used both analytical and numerical models to estimate tile contributions to streamflow in the nearby boone river watershed also located on the dml of iowa they reported that at basin scales ranging from 42 to 2370 km2 tile drainage accounted for approximately 44 66 of the annual water yields further they extended their analysis to the entire des moines river and reported that tile drainage flow contributed 32 of the flow in the 16 175 km2 basin it is interesting to note that our field level estimate of tile drainage flow from a 64 ha farm field fits within the scaling framework suggested by schilling et al 2019 for the dml fig 7 the term scaling refers to the transfer of information across scales blöschl and sivapalan 1995 in this case we show how the proportion of river water yields derived from tiles changes with spatial scale increasing as drainage areas get smaller within this intensely drained region nutrient concentrations measured in the wells and tiles are representative of conditions found throughout iowa and the glaciated cornbelt in tiled areas on the dml nitrate concentrations in tile water and streams routinely exceed 10 20 mg l e g ikenberry et al 2014 tomer et al 2003 groundwater quality in active farm fields is less often measured but schilling et al 2018b measured groundwater quality at eight farmed wetland sites within the dml and reported nitrate and op concentrations ranging from 2 to 40 mg l average of 16 7 mg l among all sites and 0 05 1 6 mg l average of 0 36 mg l respectively within the farm field site we observed nitrate concentrations to be reduced in the northern riparian zone of hardin creek decreasing from in field concentrations of 11 15 mg l to 1 mg l in the near stream wells table 3 this suggests that conditions in the riparian zone may be acting to naturally reduce groundwater nitrate levels e g hill 1996 clément et al 2003 however on the south side of the creek with coarse textured sediments nitrate concentrations were high in the near stream well 14 7 mg l variability in nitrate removal efficiency in riparian zones has been attributed to variable hydrogeology among sites simpkins et al 2002 devito et al 2000 nevertheless despite nitrate reduction observed in the northern riparian zone tiles bypass the natural biogeochemical processing and deliver nutrient loads directly to the stream channel schilling et al 2015 although we do not know the precise extent of tile feeding into hardin creek based on land owner information we estimated the drainage area to be approximately 89 ha extending into the neighboring field to the north fig 1 based on this estimated drainage area and the total nitrate load discharged to hardin creek in 2018 from april 1 to november 30 5507 kg over 243 days the nitrate yield is estimated to be 61 9 kg ha in 2019 over the same period the daily load was less 16 7 kg day or 3604 kg and the nitrate yield was estimated to be approximately 40 5 kg ha over the same april 1 to november 30 time period although these nitrate yields may be considered relatively high they are not unusual for the dml region ikenberry et al 2014 reported annual nitrate yields from three tile drained catchments to be 29 52 kg ha jones et al 2017 reported average annual yield for the raccoon river to be 35 kg ha over an nine year period and tomer et al 2003 reported nitrate loads as high as 60 kg ha in the dml intensely drained row crop areas have a major impact on stream nitrate loading in iowa for example jha et al 2010 reported that 92 of the no3 n load in the raccoon river was derived from tiled row crop sources and in the des moines river the percentage was even higher 95 schilling and wolter 2009 hence we consider the nutrient loads exported by tiles and groundwater from our monitored farm field to be consistent with typical dml conditions 4 2 implications for conservation targeting conservation practices for reducing nutrient losses in drainage water include improved management of fertilizer applications jaynes et al 2001 cover crops kaspar et al 2012 and drainage water management adeuya et al 2012 within the field and edge of field practices such as wetlands kovacic et al 2000 denitrification bioreactors schipper et al 2010 moorman et al 2015 and saturated buffers jaynes and isenhart 2014 among the edge of field practices there would not be sufficient area to install a wetland to capture tile flows within the study field without taking land out of production but practices such as bioreactors or saturated buffers located in the existing riparian zone have potential applicability at the site based on field monitoring data and export loads we can estimate the potential impact of various bioreactor and saturated buffer implementation scenarios to reduce nitrate export from the field table 3 based on the average nitrate concentrations and discharge conditions the estimated annual export april 1 to november 30 from the eight tiles totaled approximately 5455 kg in contrast annual groundwater export was estimated to be 52 kg assuming that a bioreactor can reduce annual nitrate loads by 43 value utilized by the iowa nutrient reduction strategy hoque and kling 2016 we quantified the overall effect on farm scale nitrate export table 3 if a bioreactor were placed at the end of tile 11 and a 43 reduction in nitrate was achieved the annual load from the tile would be reduced from 3018 kg to 1720 kg and the overall nitrate export from the field would be reduced by 24 5 if instead the bioreactor was targeted to the tile with the greatest concentration tile 10 the nitrate load would be reduced at the field by only 0 4 because the flow rate from the tile was substantially lower tile 6 is located on the south side of the field and if a bioreactor was installed to intercept export at this location the load reduction would be 4 6 finally installing two bioreactors within the field one on both sides of the creek tile 11 and tile 6 the annual nitrate load reduction would be 28 2 table 3 the estimated nitrate load reduction from a saturated buffer is considered to be 50 in the iowa nutrient reduction strategy hoque and kling 2016 although these systems are more commonly applied to discharge from a single tile new installations are connecting multiple tiles to a single saturated buffer installation t isenhart personal communication 2019 at the farm site where multiple tiles discharge along both sides of the creek we envisioned a saturated buffer installed along the north riparian buffer that intercepted nitrate loads from tiles 1 5 7 9 10 and 11 in this configuration the total annual export of nitrate from the farm field would be reduced from 5455 kg to 3105 kg or 42 8 table 3 of the two edge of field options considered herein the saturated buffer scenario would appear to offer several advantages first a potential saturated buffer would intercept loads from a greater number of tiles discharging from the field into the stream and thus provide greater overall nitrate load reductions from the site although installing a bioreactor at the site would reduce nitrate loads from a single tile there are eight tiles discharging into hardin creek within the extent of the field targeting a bioreactor to the tile with the greatest nitrate load tile 11 would have the greatest assumed benefit but the flow rate of the tile is much higher than typically considered appropriate for bioreactors when tile flow rates exceed a site specific threshold bypass systems are typically installed to divert flow around the denitrification bed schipper et al 2010 high flow rates through bioreactors also limit hydraulic retention times hrt needed to obtain nitrate removal christianson et al 2013 installing a bioreactor to reduce high nitrate concentrations from tile 10 would have little effect on overall nitrate export from the field because the flow rate is not as high overall multiple bioreactors would need to be installed at the farm site to reduce farm scale nitrate export in contrast installing a saturated buffer along the north side of the creek would take advantage of the nitrate reduction capacity of the subsurface sediments in the riparian zone groundwater monitoring along the north side of the creek indicated that the riparian sediments are reducing groundwater nitrate concentrations from approximately 11 15 mg l within the cropped field to 1 mg l near the stream table 1 like bioreactors bypass structures within the control box would divert high tile flows directly into the stream however jaynes and isenhart 2019 noted that the mass reduction of nitrate is maximized in saturated buffers when tile flows and contributing drainage areas are greatest although denitrification rates are higher in engineered bioreactors similar nitrate mass reduction is achieved because hrts are much longer in saturated buffers than in bioreactors weeks vs hours respectively jaynes and isenhart 2019 overall a saturated buffer would appear to offer greater effectiveness than a bioreactor or multiple bioreactors because it would reduce nitrate loads from multiple tiles in the same field with a single practice 4 3 sources of error and future work in this study we utilized monitoring data collected during a single year tiles and groundwater in 2018 tiles only in 2019 to quantify nutrient concentrations and loads exported from a single farm field extrapolating results beyond the single year is uncertain since year to year variability in local weather is known to affect seasonal and annual nutrient loading patterns e g jones et al 2018a loecke et al 2017 schilling and zhang 2004 however while the relative contribution of tiles and groundwater to nutrient export from the farm field may vary across the season due to weather conditions we believe that in heavily tiled regions such as those found in the dml of iowa flow and nutrient contributions from tiles will consistently dwarf the contributions from groundwater seepage schilling et al 2017 2019 more work is needed to verify these proportions in other regions across a range of tile intensity however the necessary level of instrumentation required to produce meaningful results at larger scales like fields can be cost prohibitive since flow rates and nutrient concentrations in tiles will vary across events and seasons tomer et al 2003 2010 and continuous flow measurements from tiles schilling and jones 2019 and installation of nutrient sensors jones et al 2018b is needed to improve accuracy of load estimations we overcame this inherent natural variability by extrapolating from our periodic grab sampling and measurement data to estimate annual conditions further improvements could be made to the groundwater modeling conducted to estimate the groundwater contribution to hardin creek using additional calibration across seasons and years and specific discretization of farm scale tile drainage thomas et al 2016 investigated incorporating tiling into watershed models and noted how simulating time drainage at larger scales becomes increasingly complex most surface subsurface models incorporate tiling using an equivalent medium approach de schepper et al 2015 in our study we utilized local boundary conditions calibrated to groundwater heads to estimate groundwater discharge into hardin creek similar to the approach taken by goswami et al 2010 for a tiled site in central illinois 5 conclusions in this study we estimated the nutrient load contribution of tiles and groundwater from a single cropped field to a segment of hardin creek in north central iowa based on monitoring of eight tile outlets nine groundwater wells and the receiving stream during 2018 and 2019 we found that nutrient loads into hardin creek were dominated by tile discharge nitrate n loads from tiles averaged 28 8 kg day whereas nitrate loads from groundwater discharge averaged 0 21 kg day or alternatively we can say that tile drainage accounted for approximately 95 6 99 6 of the load to the creek from april to july in both 2018 and 2019 the tile contribution was substantially less in late summer and early fall when tile flow was reduced the loading pattern was similar for op which was also dominated by tile discharge 99 7 overall the results from the single farm field fit within the scaling pattern observed within the dml region of iowa showing that water yields and nitrate loads are dominated by tile drainage at the field and local watershed scale which decreases downstream as watershed area increases although more work could be done to improve quantification of nutrient loading rates study results from just one dml farm are consistent with local and regional assessments showing the overwhelming impacts of tiling on water and nutrient export commensurate with this impact water quality solutions are needed that account for the magnitude and scale of tile drainage in the u s cornbelt region edge of field practices such as bioreactors or saturated buffers are practices that address the subsurface delivery of nitrate

10467,it is understood that the major transport pathways for the soluble nutrients nitrate no3 n and orthophosphorus op from cropped fields to streams in the u s cornbelt are tile drainage and groundwater seepage the relative contribution of each however has not been well quantified and can vary between fields and watersheds in this study we used intermittent grab sample water quality monitoring and tile flow measurements and the groundwater model modflow to source dissolved nutrients from a cropped field to a low order stream in the intensively drained and cropped des moines lobe landform of north central iowa based on monitoring of eight tile outlets nine groundwater wells and the receiving stream over a two year period nutrient loads from tiles were found to contribute approximately 98 of the nitrate load to hardin creek the loading pattern for op was also dominated by discharge from constructed drainage with 99 7 sourced back to field tiles results from the farm field fit within the scaling pattern observed within the des moines lobe region of iowa showing that water yields and no3 n loads are dominated by tile drainage at the field and local watershed scale

perforated pipes tiles tomer et al 2003 david et al 2010 schilling et al 2012 in poorly drained areas tiles are typically installed to a depth of approximately 1 2 m in cropped fields to reduce soil wetness when soils are saturated for improved crop yields singh et al 2006 stream nitrate yields are often proportional to tile flow randall et al 1997 ikenberry et al 2014 and yields from tile drained watersheds tend to exceed 20 kg n ha yr in normal rainfall years and 40 to 60 kg n ha yr during wet years jaynes et al 1999 royer et al 2006 ikenberry et al 2014 jones et al 2018a tile drainage has also been identified as an important pathway for the transport of dissolved phosphorus from farmed fields to the stream network orthophosphorus or op king et al 2015 smith et al 2015

studies offer opportunities to isolate specific treatment and management effects across statistically similar replicates e g lawlor et al 2008 randall et al 2003 whereas watershed studies integrate combined management practices from producers within larger geographical areas e g jha et al 2010 quantifying nutrient losses from a single cropped field is less commonly done but this scale allows one to focus on how nutrient export can vary across the topographic and soil conditions found in a field managed by a single producer further landowner decisions on whether or not to implement edge of

schilling et al 2017 are typically made at the field scale in the flat and intensely cropped region of the des moines lobe dml in north central iowa the primary transport pathways of nitrate and op from cropped fields to streams are via tile drainage and groundwater seepage schilling et al 2019 used analytical and numerical models to suggest that tiles accounted for 50 66 of the annual water yield in both small and large dml watersheds likewise tomer et al 2010 green et al 2006 and schilling and helmers 2008 used monitoring data and numerical models to estimate tile drainage contributions to be approximately 70 for two north central iowa watersheds at a field scale groundwater contributions to perennial streams have been quantified using longitudinal sampling campaigns cey et al 1998 along with numerical modeling goswami et al 2010 schilling and wolter 2001 combined field sampling of tiles along with analytical modeling of groundwater flow to quantify sources of nutrient loading within a single iowa watershed rozemeijer et al 2010 separated tile effluent from groundwater at a field site in the netherlands and reported that tiles contributed 89 93 of the no3 n loads from a farm field to the ditch in this study we quantified the nutrient export from tiles and groundwater to a perennial stream from a cropped field in north central iowa following tile installation in the 64 ha field we monitored eight tile outlets nine groundwater wells and the receiving stream over the course of the 2018 growing season to assess nutrient concentration and loading patterns in 2019 the tile flows were monitored again to confirm tile loading rates our specific objectives were to 1 characterize the water quality of the tiles groundwater and perennial stream in a representative iowa cropped field 2 quantify groundwater and tile discharge to the perennial stream using a groundwater flow model and field measurements 3 assess the relative nutrient load contributions from tiles and groundwater to the perennial stream and 4 estimate nutrient load reductions from potential edge of field practices 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description the site lat 42 20 14 96 long 94 23 56 25 is located along the calhoun and webster county line in north central iowa fig 1 hardin creek which bisects the site drains a watershed area above the site of approximately 3990 ha that is dominated by row crops of corn and soybeans 88 7 the stream is located within the dml ecoregion of iowa a recently 12 000 years bp glaciated landscape containing many drained pothole wetlands prior 1991 dominant soils include the clarion nicollet webster soil association consisting of silty and loamy soils formed in glacial till coland and cylinder soils are present along the riparian zone of the stream koppen 1981 in many areas of the cornbelt drainage districts were formed by landowners to facilitate drainage over large areas mccorvie and lant 1993 present day iowa for example includes at least 2 5 million ha that lie within more than 3000 drainage districts schilling et al 2012 hardin creek flows through the webster and calhoun joint drainage district fig 1 and the creek channel flowing through the site has been straightened and heavily altered historical photographs indicate that the straightening occurred before the 1930 s https geodata iowa gov the stream channel has a trapezoidal shape and is lined by ditch spoils as a small levee an 18 m wide riparian zone of primarily cool season grass buffers the stream from the adjacent cropped field fig 1 during the 2018 monitoring year the producer cropped the field in corn following soybeans using an n application rate of approximately 180 kg ha the 2018 corn yield for the field averaged approximately 13 500 kg ha in 2019 the field was planted in corn but planting and additional harvesting details were not available for this year 2 2 site characterization a geophysical survey was conducted using electrical resistivity er and electromagnetic terrain conductivity em methods to characterize the subsurface geology of the site with the er method an electrical current is induced into the subsurface through stainless steel electrodes at locations along a transect and the resulting electric potential is used to map the resistivity of the subsurface materials to depths of 100 m after processing and inversion of the er data results are presented as a two dimensional model representing bulk electrical resistivity values in ohm meters at depth along a surface transect for em mapping we used a geonics em 31 mk2 ground conductivity meter the em 31 maps changes in ground conductivity inverse of resistivity using an electromagnetic induction technique with an effective depth of penetration of approximately 6 m www geonics com the em 31 survey consisted of traversing survey lines oriented east west across the area values were recorded in a continuous manner and stamped with the coordinate locations using a high precision gps the survey points were contoured by kriging in arcgis monitoring wells were installed in three 3 well transects perpendicular to the stream channel fig 1 using a truck mounted giddings drilling rig the 3 8 cm diameter wells were installed in a 10 cm borehole to a depth of 4 5 m and consisted of a 3 0 m well screen a 1 5 m riser that extended the well to the land surface an additional 1 m of riser was added to the stickup at each well for sampling purposes after planting a silica sand filter pack was poured around the screen and bentonite chips were added to provide a seal following well installation the wells were developed by surging and overpumping using a waterra sampling system the wells were instrumented with a non vented minitroll transducer 30 psi in situ inc to measure hourly water table fluctuations stream stage was also monitored hourly in hardin creek from march to november 2018 using a non vented minitroll transducer 30 psi in situ inc secured to a post hand driven into the creek bed regional precipitation data were downloaded from the iowa environmental mesonet http mesonet agron iastate edu 2 3 flow and water table measurement and water sampling procedures the monitoring wells were sampled on 13 occasions from march to november in 2018 water levels in wells were measured to the nearest 0 01 foot at the time of sampling water samples were collected using a peristaltic pump and analyzed in the field for temperature specific conductance sc ph dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp using a ysi model 556 water quality meter water samples were also collected as grab samples from eight tiles when flowing and hardin creek in 2018 three tiles mapped along the field tiles 3 4 and 8 were never flowing and were not included in the analysis flow rates from the tiles at the time of sampling were estimated using a timer and a graduated 5 gal bucket for low flow tiles we measured the volume after one minute of elapsed time and for higher flows we timed the filling of the entire bucket at very high tile flows the time to fill the bucket was less than one second and the discharge value was an estimate developed from multiple measurements at a minimum bucket measurements were repeated three times to develop an average flow rate for the tile tiles could not be accessed on two occasions june 20 and september 5 because high flow in hardin creek submerged the tile outlets in 2019 eleven drainage tiles were sampled on eight occasions between april 9 to november 3 using the same methods at times no water flowed from the tiles at scheduled sampling dates and thus they were not sampled on those days 2 4 water quality analysis water samples were hand delivered to the iowa soybean association laboratory on the day of collection the iowa soybean association maintains a certified water quality testing laboratory in ankeny iowa samples were immediately analyzed on the day of collection using environmental protection agency method 300 0 pfaff 1993 quality assurance quality control protocols included analysis of blanks fortified samples spikes replicates and known concentration samples with each analytical batch concentrations of no3 n op cl and so4 are reported as mg l 2 5 groundwater flow model to estimate groundwater discharge to hardin creek from the field site a three dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed using modeling software visual modflow classic version v 4 6 0 168 a two layer model was used for the simulation layer 1 represented the oxidized loamy glacial till and alluvium with a horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 30 5 m day that is typical for loamy soil conditions layer 2 represented a confining silty clay alluvial clay or unoxidized glacial till with a horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 0 00305 m day vertical hydraulic conductivity was estimated to be 1 10 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity in both layers the local catchment divide located approximately 1500 m from the stream channel was considered a no flow boundary this was represented by de activating the grids in these regions constant head boundaries were used to simulate lateral groundwater recharge into the heavily tiled study area a total of six constant head boundaries approximately 200 m in length were created and evenly spaced along the outer perimeter of the model area hardin creek was represented as a river boundary vertical conductivity of the drainage ditch was estimated to be 0 061 m day this conductivity value is less than typical sandy sediment and reflects the accumulation of finer sediments observed in the bedload of the ditch the surface water gradient was estimated using available statewide lidar elevation data https geodata iowa gov 2 6 nutrient load calculations nutrient mass loads from the tiles to hardin creek were estimated by first calculating daily flow volume from the measured instantaneous tile flow rate this amount was then multiplied by the measured analyte concentration in a grab sample collected immediately following flow rate measurement to produce a kg day load value an average daily load was calculated from the monitoring days and then extrapolated to the entirety of the monitoring period to get an overall load kg groundwater nutrient mass was estimated by multiplying the average analyte concentration measured in the wells n 9 by the model estimated steady state groundwater discharge to the stream nitrate yields were estimated by dividing the mass load by the catchment area which was estimated by delineating the watershed area contributing to hardin creek fig 1 3 results 3 1 site geology the em mapping identified a region of higher ground resistivity 25 o m along the hardin creek channel with higher values along the southern riparian zone fig 2 higher resistivity is indicative of a greater sand content along the stream channel and the sand was particularly evident during well installation on the southern side lower resistivity is indicative of a greater fraction of silt and clay in the sediment and this was common in the tiled portion of both sides of the field the em survey indicated that the cropped portion of the site upgradient of the stream is less permeable greater fines than the sandy floodplain near the stream an er survey penetrates to a greater depth we focused on the top 30 m and was conducted along six transects perpendicular from the edge of an agricultural field to the stream fig 2 the resistivity of the sediments ranged from approximately 10 40 ohm m and based on correlations established at other sites vogelgesang et al 2020 the variations confirmed the lithologic materials suggested by the em data in the north transect line 2 the upland loamy stratigraphy transitioned to higher resistive and sandier material near the channel likewise in the south transect line 5 there was an abrupt boundary of upland loam to sandy alluvium approximately 75 m from the channel centerline overall results from the em and er surveys are consistent and suggest the upland geology consists primarily of loam whereas the riparian zone of hardin creek contains considerably more sand 3 2 hydrology precipitation was not measured at the site but 2018 annual precipitation totals in towns that triangulate around the site had values of 1337 mm ft dodge 1092 mm sac city and 1209 mm carroll all of these totals are well above normal for the region which is approximately 905 mm https www weather gov june and august were very wet months with 180 mm and 384 mm of rainfall in ft dodge during these periods respectively hardin creek approached overbank conditions in late june and early september and tiles discharging to the creek were under water during these periods precipitation was also above normal in 2019 1228 mm in ft dodge stream stage in hardin creek reflected local precipitation patterns with a series of high stage events in late may and june followed by a quiet period in july and august and a series of high flow events in september and october fig 3 tile discharge and flow rates varied considerably among individual tiles and throughout the year table 1 discharge was greatest from tile 11 ranging from 2870 m3 day on june 27 after the flood period to 12 2 m3 day approximately 40 days later on august 6 no tiles were flowing at the site on september 5 discharges from tiles 6 and 7 were also higher than the others averaging approximately 152 and 767 m3 day during 2018 average discharge from the five other tiles ranged from 9 to 73 m3 day table 1 tile discharge was slightly lower in 2019 compared to 2018 but the relative magnitude was very similar fig 4 average discharge from tiles 7 and 11 was higher than the other tiles but flows were approximately 40 less in 2019 water table depth fluctuations showed a similar pattern as stream stage and reflected periods of concentrated recharge during rainfall events and longer periods of relative quiescence and recession fig 3 greater fluctuations were observed in the near stream riparian zone wells compared to those located in the field w3 w9 water table depths were greatest in wells located nearest the channel 3 0 3 5 m deep and were shallowest in the field wells 1 5 1 9 m deep the pattern of deeper water tables in the riparian zones of incised and channelized streams compared to distal floodplain areas has previously been observed in iowa schilling et al 2004 groundwater at the site flows from the surroundings uplands to hardin creek under a horizontal hydraulic gradient of approximately 0 014 on both sides of the channel to estimate groundwater discharge into hardin creek the groundwater flow model constructed for the site was calibrated using average aquifer conditions measured in 2018 model estimated hydraulic heads were compared to measured values and the absolute residual mean in head was 0 21 m with a normalized root mean square error of 7 5 fig 5 model results suggested that groundwater under steady state mean hydraulic head conditions discharges approximately 32 4 m3 day into hardin creek within the boundaries of the farm field 3 3 water quality mean values of water quality measurements are provided in table 3 nitrate concentrations were highest in tiles 7 1 19 1 mg l and hardin creek 12 3 mg l and were lower in groundwater 7 0 mg l however mean groundwater nitrate concentrations ranged from 0 5 15 8 mg l indicating substantial variability among the nine wells table 2 in particular no3 n concentrations were much higher in the field wells w3 w6 w9 compared to the near stream and riparian zone wells high nitrate concentrations were also measured in the near stream well w7 located in sandy sediments along the south side of hardin creek fig 2 temporally no3 n concentrations were higher in groundwater and tile flow in the spring period april to july and with the exception of tile 10 were lower in late summer and fall fig 6 the no3 n concentrations in tile 10 remained high throughout the 2018 monitoring period 15 25 mg l and one sample was measured at 24 3 mg l as late as november 27 2018 in 2019 only the tiles were sampled at the field site and nitrate concentrations averaged between 6 13 3 mg l among the tile sites table 3 concentrations were approximately 1 6 mg l lower in 2019 compared to 2018 likely due to less precipitation occurring in the year mean op concentrations were also higher in tiles than groundwater and hardin creek but this was largely due to high op concentrations in tiles 10 and 1 that averaged 1 3 and 0 57 mg l respectively other tile concentrations were similar 0 15 to 0 35 mg l to mean groundwater op concentrations 0 13 to 0 35 mg l overall tile water samples had higher mean values of do orp and cl while groundwater had higher specific conductance sc and so4 table 3 surface water in hardin creek tended to have a more intermediate concentration range between the tiles and groundwater in terms of sc and major ions cl so4 but do and no3 n concentrations were similar to those measured in the tiles 3 4 nutrient loading from tiles and groundwater to hardin creek nutrient loads into hardin creek were dominated by tile discharge table 1 based on 11 measurement days throughout the 2018 field season nitrate loads from tiles ranged from 0 12 to 82 4 kg day whereas nitrate loads from groundwater discharge ranged from 0 06 to 0 41 kg day based on the fraction of total load tiles contributed approximately 98 of the nitrate n load to hardin creek within the field boundary for all measurement days except august 8 when tile discharge was substantially lower on this date the tile groundwater proportion was generally equivalent 55 vs 45 respectively the wells were not monitored in 2019 but if we assume groundwater discharge was the same steady state condition in 2019 and mean annual n concentration were also the same approximately 7 mg l the relative proportion of tile nitrate loads to hardin creek ranged from approximately 95 6 99 6 from april to july 2019 in august and september 2019 when nearly all the tiles stopped flowing groundwater seepage may have provided approximately 93 4 and 100 of the flow from the farm field to the channel the loading pattern was similar for op in 2018 table 1 for the measurement period op loads were dominated by tile discharge 99 7 for both nitrate and op the nutrient loading fractions were largely driven by differences in water flux through tiles compared to groundwater 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient export from tiles and groundwater study results indicated that tile discharge provided the vast majority of flow nitrate and op loads to the portion of hardin creek flowing through the farm field during the april november period in iowa tile contributions largely exceeded 95 99 of nitrate and op loads when they were flowing but when conditions became dry in august 2018 and august september 2019 tile flow was reduced and groundwater provided most of the discharge and loads table 1 however it is important to note that the amount of load discharged during the low flow periods was insignificant compared to the spring and early summer loads for the monitoring days in 2018 the total nitrate loads from tiles was 359 kg whereas the total groundwater load was 2 6 kg as a fraction of the total tiles contributed approximately 99 5 of the nitrate and op loads and groundwater provided 0 5 a similar proportion of tile vs groundwater nitrate loads was observed discharging to a restored oxbow site located nearby in north central iowa schilling et al 2017 at that site tile nitrate loads accounted for more than 99 of the input nitrate load to the oxbow compared to groundwater seepage the results from this farm scale study are consistent with watershed studies reporting the contributions of tiles to water and nutrient flux king et al 2015 reported that subsurface tile flow contributed 37 74 of discharge in a 389 ha subwatershed of upper big walnut creek in ohio macrae et al 2007 estimated that 42 of the basin annual discharge originated from drainage tiles in a 3 km2 watershed in ontario arenas amado et al 2017 and thomas et al 2016 estimated that tile drainage accounted for 15 43 and 39 of streamflow in two northeast iowa watersheds respectively more recently schilling et al 2019 used both analytical and numerical models to estimate tile contributions to streamflow in the nearby boone river watershed also located on the dml of iowa they reported that at basin scales ranging from 42 to 2370 km2 tile drainage accounted for approximately 44 66 of the annual water yields further they extended their analysis to the entire des moines river and reported that tile drainage flow contributed 32 of the flow in the 16 175 km2 basin it is interesting to note that our field level estimate of tile drainage flow from a 64 ha farm field fits within the scaling framework suggested by schilling et al 2019 for the dml fig 7 the term scaling refers to the transfer of information across scales blöschl and sivapalan 1995 in this case we show how the proportion of river water yields derived from tiles changes with spatial scale increasing as drainage areas get smaller within this intensely drained region nutrient concentrations measured in the wells and tiles are representative of conditions found throughout iowa and the glaciated cornbelt in tiled areas on the dml nitrate concentrations in tile water and streams routinely exceed 10 20 mg l e g ikenberry et al 2014 tomer et al 2003 groundwater quality in active farm fields is less often measured but schilling et al 2018b measured groundwater quality at eight farmed wetland sites within the dml and reported nitrate and op concentrations ranging from 2 to 40 mg l average of 16 7 mg l among all sites and 0 05 1 6 mg l average of 0 36 mg l respectively within the farm field site we observed nitrate concentrations to be reduced in the northern riparian zone of hardin creek decreasing from in field concentrations of 11 15 mg l to 1 mg l in the near stream wells table 3 this suggests that conditions in the riparian zone may be acting to naturally reduce groundwater nitrate levels e g hill 1996 clément et al 2003 however on the south side of the creek with coarse textured sediments nitrate concentrations were high in the near stream well 14 7 mg l variability in nitrate removal efficiency in riparian zones has been attributed to variable hydrogeology among sites simpkins et al 2002 devito et al 2000 nevertheless despite nitrate reduction observed in the northern riparian zone tiles bypass the natural biogeochemical processing and deliver nutrient loads directly to the stream channel schilling et al 2015 although we do not know the precise extent of tile feeding into hardin creek based on land owner information we estimated the drainage area to be approximately 89 ha extending into the neighboring field to the north fig 1 based on this estimated drainage area and the total nitrate load discharged to hardin creek in 2018 from april 1 to november 30 5507 kg over 243 days the nitrate yield is estimated to be 61 9 kg ha in 2019 over the same period the daily load was less 16 7 kg day or 3604 kg and the nitrate yield was estimated to be approximately 40 5 kg ha over the same april 1 to november 30 time period although these nitrate yields may be considered relatively high they are not unusual for the dml region ikenberry et al 2014 reported annual nitrate yields from three tile drained catchments to be 29 52 kg ha jones et al 2017 reported average annual yield for the raccoon river to be 35 kg ha over an nine year period and tomer et al 2003 reported nitrate loads as high as 60 kg ha in the dml intensely drained row crop areas have a major impact on stream nitrate loading in iowa for example jha et al 2010 reported that 92 of the no3 n load in the raccoon river was derived from tiled row crop sources and in the des moines river the percentage was even higher 95 schilling and wolter 2009 hence we consider the nutrient loads exported by tiles and groundwater from our monitored farm field to be consistent with typical dml conditions 4 2 implications for conservation targeting conservation practices for reducing nutrient losses in drainage water include improved management of fertilizer applications jaynes et al 2001 cover crops kaspar et al 2012 and drainage water management adeuya et al 2012 within the field and edge of field practices such as wetlands kovacic et al 2000 denitrification bioreactors schipper et al 2010 moorman et al 2015 and saturated buffers jaynes and isenhart 2014 among the edge of field practices there would not be sufficient area to install a wetland to capture tile flows within the study field without taking land out of production but practices such as bioreactors or saturated buffers located in the existing riparian zone have potential applicability at the site based on field monitoring data and export loads we can estimate the potential impact of various bioreactor and saturated buffer implementation scenarios to reduce nitrate export from the field table 3 based on the average nitrate concentrations and discharge conditions the estimated annual export april 1 to november 30 from the eight tiles totaled approximately 5455 kg in contrast annual groundwater export was estimated to be 52 kg assuming that a bioreactor can reduce annual nitrate loads by 43 value utilized by the iowa nutrient reduction strategy hoque and kling 2016 we quantified the overall effect on farm scale nitrate export table 3 if a bioreactor were placed at the end of tile 11 and a 43 reduction in nitrate was achieved the annual load from the tile would be reduced from 3018 kg to 1720 kg and the overall nitrate export from the field would be reduced by 24 5 if instead the bioreactor was targeted to the tile with the greatest concentration tile 10 the nitrate load would be reduced at the field by only 0 4 because the flow rate from the tile was substantially lower tile 6 is located on the south side of the field and if a bioreactor was installed to intercept export at this location the load reduction would be 4 6 finally installing two bioreactors within the field one on both sides of the creek tile 11 and tile 6 the annual nitrate load reduction would be 28 2 table 3 the estimated nitrate load reduction from a saturated buffer is considered to be 50 in the iowa nutrient reduction strategy hoque and kling 2016 although these systems are more commonly applied to discharge from a single tile new installations are connecting multiple tiles to a single saturated buffer installation t isenhart personal communication 2019 at the farm site where multiple tiles discharge along both sides of the creek we envisioned a saturated buffer installed along the north riparian buffer that intercepted nitrate loads from tiles 1 5 7 9 10 and 11 in this configuration the total annual export of nitrate from the farm field would be reduced from 5455 kg to 3105 kg or 42 8 table 3 of the two edge of field options considered herein the saturated buffer scenario would appear to offer several advantages first a potential saturated buffer would intercept loads from a greater number of tiles discharging from the field into the stream and thus provide greater overall nitrate load reductions from the site although installing a bioreactor at the site would reduce nitrate loads from a single tile there are eight tiles discharging into hardin creek within the extent of the field targeting a bioreactor to the tile with the greatest nitrate load tile 11 would have the greatest assumed benefit but the flow rate of the tile is much higher than typically considered appropriate for bioreactors when tile flow rates exceed a site specific threshold bypass systems are typically installed to divert flow around the denitrification bed schipper et al 2010 high flow rates through bioreactors also limit hydraulic retention times hrt needed to obtain nitrate removal christianson et al 2013 installing a bioreactor to reduce high nitrate concentrations from tile 10 would have little effect on overall nitrate export from the field because the flow rate is not as high overall multiple bioreactors would need to be installed at the farm site to reduce farm scale nitrate export in contrast installing a saturated buffer along the north side of the creek would take advantage of the nitrate reduction capacity of the subsurface sediments in the riparian zone groundwater monitoring along the north side of the creek indicated that the riparian sediments are reducing groundwater nitrate concentrations from approximately 11 15 mg l within the cropped field to 1 mg l near the stream table 1 like bioreactors bypass structures within the control box would divert high tile flows directly into the stream however jaynes and isenhart 2019 noted that the mass reduction of nitrate is maximized in saturated buffers when tile flows and contributing drainage areas are greatest although denitrification rates are higher in engineered bioreactors similar nitrate mass reduction is achieved because hrts are much longer in saturated buffers than in bioreactors weeks vs hours respectively jaynes and isenhart 2019 overall a saturated buffer would appear to offer greater effectiveness than a bioreactor or multiple bioreactors because it would reduce nitrate loads from multiple tiles in the same field with a single practice 4 3 sources of error and future work in this study we utilized monitoring data collected during a single year tiles and groundwater in 2018 tiles only in 2019 to quantify nutrient concentrations and loads exported from a single farm field extrapolating results beyond the single year is uncertain since year to year variability in local weather is known to affect seasonal and annual nutrient loading patterns e g jones et al 2018a loecke et al 2017 schilling and zhang 2004 however while the relative contribution of tiles and groundwater to nutrient export from the farm field may vary across the season due to weather conditions we believe that in heavily tiled regions such as those found in the dml of iowa flow and nutrient contributions from tiles will consistently dwarf the contributions from groundwater seepage schilling et al 2017 2019 more work is needed to verify these proportions in other regions across a range of tile intensity however the necessary level of instrumentation required to produce meaningful results at larger scales like fields can be cost prohibitive since flow rates and nutrient concentrations in tiles will vary across events and seasons tomer et al 2003 2010 and continuous flow measurements from tiles schilling and jones 2019 and installation of nutrient sensors jones et al 2018b is needed to improve accuracy of load estimations we overcame this inherent natural variability by extrapolating from our periodic grab sampling and measurement data to estimate annual conditions further improvements could be made to the groundwater modeling conducted to estimate the groundwater contribution to hardin creek using additional calibration across seasons and years and specific discretization of farm scale tile drainage thomas et al 2016 investigated incorporating tiling into watershed models and noted how simulating time drainage at larger scales becomes increasingly complex most surface subsurface models incorporate tiling using an equivalent medium approach de schepper et al 2015 in our study we utilized local boundary conditions calibrated to groundwater heads to estimate groundwater discharge into hardin creek similar to the approach taken by goswami et al 2010 for a tiled site in central illinois 5 conclusions in this study we estimated the nutrient load contribution of tiles and groundwater from a single cropped field to a segment of hardin creek in north central iowa based on monitoring of eight tile outlets nine groundwater wells and the receiving stream during 2018 and 2019 we found that nutrient loads into hardin creek were dominated by tile discharge nitrate n loads from tiles averaged 28 8 kg day whereas nitrate loads from groundwater discharge averaged 0 21 kg day or alternatively we can say that tile drainage accounted for approximately 95 6 99 6 of the load to the creek from april to july in both 2018 and 2019 the tile contribution was substantially less in late summer and early fall when tile flow was reduced the loading pattern was similar for op which was also dominated by tile discharge 99 7 overall the results from the single farm field fit within the scaling pattern observed within the dml region of iowa showing that water yields and nitrate loads are dominated by tile drainage at the field and local watershed scale which decreases downstream as watershed area increases although more work could be done to improve quantification of nutrient loading rates study results from just one dml farm are consistent with local and regional assessments showing the overwhelming impacts of tiling on water and nutrient export commensurate with this impact water quality solutions are needed that account for the magnitude and scale of tile drainage in the u s cornbelt region edge of field practices such as bioreactors or saturated buffers are practices that address the subsurface delivery of nitrate loads to surface water through tile drainage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10468,crop evapotranspiration etc is one of the most basic components of the hydrologic cycle that is effective in irrigation system design and management water resources planning and scheduling and hydrologic water balance thus precise estimation of etc is valuable for various applications of agricultural water engineering especially in developing countries such as egypt which has lack of meteorological data high cost and time to calculate etc and lack of information on future etc values to consider management scenarios and increase production potential also due to the existence of different climates in egypt the estimate of etc has become a challenge to this end the aim of this study was to estimate the etc to eliminate the limitations mentioned and analyze the long term dynamics of etc based on limited climate data and simple method three egyptian governorates namely ad daqahliyah ash sharqiyah and kafr ash shaykh of nile delta were selected as major wheat producing sites the required historical required climatic data were collected from open access data library while future data were from two extreme scenarios of the representative concentration pathways rcp i e rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the available dataset was divided into three parts i calibration from 1970 2000 ii validation from 2000 2017 and iii prediction from 2022 2035 the deep neural network dnn was employed for incorporating historical data and predicting future etc for the evaluation of generated dnn models the research finding indicates that the correlation coefficients between actual versus predicted monthly etc were found to be 0 95 0 96 and 0 97 for calibration period and 0 94 0 95 and 0 95 for validation at ad daqahliyah kafr ash shaykh and ash sharqiyah regions respectively for the simulation of future climatic data maximum temperature tmax will increased by 5 19 4 22 and 20 82 minimum temperature tmin will increased by 1 62 36 44 and 27 80 and solar radiation sr will increased by 6 53 18 74 and 28 83 for the study locations respectively moreover the dnn model exposed that the kafr ash shaykh attain the highest values of etc with an increase of 11 31 slightly increased of 1 38 for ad daqahliyah and decreased by 15 09 for ash sharqiyah in comparison to the historical data thus the proposed model of crop water use prediction effectively estimated etc of wheat and make an efficient decision the developed models produced satisfactory results for water managers to save water and achieve the sustainability of agricultural water keywords crop evapotranspiration dnn model climate change future projection 1 introduction agricultural water resources in the context of changing climate conditions are decreasing in different regions of worldwide with more emphasis in the semi arid and arid zones therefore accurate evaluation of irrigation water needs for crops is an urgent to increase the productivity and efficiency of irrigation water use farg et al 2012 in addition crop evapotranspiration etc estimates are needed to assess their temporal variability and long term trends with climate feedback mechanisms feng et al 2017 and reduce the negative effects of excess irrigation water on crop production pôças et al 2015 evapotranspiration is the integration of two sections namely evaporation and transpiration that defined as the lost water from the soil surface and crop respectively jensen and allen 2016 several mathematical models used to determine the reference evapotranspiration eto however the method of food and agriculture organization fao fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 is the most superior comparing to other gavila et al 2007 pereira et al 2014 tabari et al 2013 but it needs many climate data factors hobbins 2016 maroufpoor et al 2020 although eto can be estimated by this method most accurately large scale meteorological data requirement at specific spatiotemporal scales maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit are quite often not available in many developing countries almorox et al 2015 dadaser celik et al 2016 espadafor et al 2011 irmak et al 2012 therefore the alternate models are required for estimation of eto when the available data are either limited or insufficient so this study uses only temperature and solar radiation data as inputs to the alternative model the literature survey depicts that previously several research studies have been focused on eto estimation using remote sensing farg et al 2012 aquacrop model butler et al 2017 li et al 2016 fao cropwat surendran et al 2015 however the soft computing applications and analysis of big data techniques for actual evapotranspiration modeling are restrictive in the previous review literature numerous soft computing approaches have been widely applied to achieve the tractability robustness and provide a low cost solution with a tolerance of imprecision partial truth uncertainty and an

outcomes for estimation of evapotranspiration than the empirical models therefore it is substantial to understand the temporal distributions of evapotranspiration and its projected changes using limited meteorological data and simple method the proposed work contribute basic guidance to water users and agricultural development planners for better assessing of etc in the light of climate data availability for the proper estimation of crop water demands to project the future changes in crop actual evapotranspiration little researches have been conducted e g xiao et al 2018 used agricultural production systems simulator apsim model and found that etc decreased across all stations under the two future climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 mehdi and vienna 2010 simulated the daily and the

simulated etc based on artificial neural network ann and hadcm3 and they found that the increasing etc gradually to 2099 moreover the agricultural water demand model was applied by aladenola and madramootoo 2010 and their findings showed that the percentage difference between future and current irrigation water needs ranged from 2 to 2 furthermore sdsm was used by li et al 2012 and they found the projected increase of 4 for the period 2011 2040 chen et al 2019 simulated the impacts of climate change on hydrology and crop production using an improved soil and water assessment tool swat model their results stated that annual etc and irrigation decreased by 8 25 and 15 42 respectively under the climate change scenarios compared to the historical period these models require many climatic data and geographical information for the prediction of etc process in this study deep neural network dnn was applied based on least climatic data three climatic factors only for etc prediction in three governorates of nile delta region the most necessary issue to know about the deep learning approach is that the new features are learned and transformed through these deep neural

study it is the major winter cereal grain crop and the third major crop in terms of area planted in egypt fao 2011 accounting for 43 of the total winter crop area sayed et al 2019 in addition there is a large gap between its production and consumption abdelmageed et al 2019 furthermore to our knowledge there are no studies available in the literature that evaluate the etc of wheat at the present and future in the semi arid regions using deep learning hence the aim of this research is i to analyze the temporal distributions of etc from 1970 to 2017 and ii to project the future changes in etc from 2022 to 2035 by employing the dnn method this information is commanding to learn the impact of climate change on etc in the study region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located on the nile delta in egypt it occupies the northern part of egypt where the nile meets the mediterranean sea the total length of the nile river is approximately 7000 km and it is known as the longest river in the world the nile delta accounts for approximately 2 of the total area of egypt and contains up to 63 of the agricultural land the delta starts approximately 20 km north of cairo and continues north for 150 km the width of the delta is approximately 250 km and is bounded alexandria governorate in the west and port said in the east the annual mean maximum air temperature tmax is 24 and the annual mean minimum air temperature tmin is 16 the wind speed ws varies from 3 8 to 5 2 ms 1 and the rainfall season starts in october representing approximately 75 of the total rainfall most of the rainfalls occur in december and january which are known as the rainiest months in this region shalaby 2012 shalaby and tateishi 2007 we selected three governorates in the nile delta namely ad daqahliyah ash sharqiyah and kafr ash shaykh with a total area of 11088 km2 as shown in fig 1 wheat crop was selected for this study as one of the most important grain crops grown principally during the winter season in egypt the local production is not sufficient to supply the annual demand of the increasing population abdelmageed et al 2019 hence increasing wheat production is the most important possibility for reducing the wheat gap and reach self sufficiency of wheat production we have collected the total agricultural crop land areas of wheat for the three governorates from agriculture directorates of governorates and calculated the coverage of wheat crop in these regions we found that wheat crop covers 35 72 28 69 39 71 in the studied regions according to the food and agricultural organization fao guidelines the months for planting and harvesting wheat are from november to april the length of crop growth stages are 40 60 60 and 40 days for initial development mid and late periods respectively fao 2000 2 2 data sources for historical data the monthly data of maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin precipitation p and solar radiation sr from november to april for wheat were extracted from open access data using environmental systems research institute esri arc gis tool over the period from 1970 to 2017 with a spatial resolution of about 4 km2 for more details about open access data average maximum and minimum temperatures data were collected from climatic research unit ts 4 0 as network common data form netcdf format at 0 5 grid for the global land surface abatzoglou et al 2018 furthermore solar radiation data were collected from the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 as netcdf format kobayashi et al 2015 for future climate data projection general circulation models gcms are physical based tools that provide a reasonable basis for determining future climate data however the generated data from that tool cannot be used directly in several regions or agricultural water resources and environmental researches due to poor simulation of local scale processes masud et al 2018 thus it is necessary to make downscaling of gcm output data before application in the impact studies e g calibration of the dnn model three gcms were obtained from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex initiative this platform was developed by the world climate research program wcrp to generate high resolution climate datasets hrcd over many locations worldwide gutowski et al 2016 the tmax tmin and sr data were obtained as monthly datasets from the earth system grid federation esgf over the period from 2022 to 2035 the esgf portal allows user to discover data and create scripts to fetch the data also this system provides the full details about the selected variable and it s available as netcdf format the process for transferring a data set is for one variable for all realizations of one model for one experiment two global climate models gcms ipsl cm5alr institute pierre simon laplace and mpi esm mr max planck institute for meteorology were used as projections of climate change within the coupled model inter comparison project taylor et al 2012 besides the regional climate model rcm used was dmi hirham5 and its driving gcm was ichec ec earth luhunga et al 2018 two extreme scenarios of the representative concentration pathways i e rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were used as climate projections cordex rcm simulations for the african domain afr cordex are conducted at two different spatial resolutions the general cordex resolution of 0 44 degree afr 44 50 km 2 3 calculation of crop evapotranspiration to calculate reference evapotranspiration eto the hargreaves method hm suggested by food and agricultural organization fao was used as illustrated in eq 1 this method was used because the parameters necessary to calculate the penman monteith pm model are not available hargreaves and allen 2003 aguilar et al 2011 fooladmand and zandilak 2008 patel et al 2014 raziei and pereira 2013 the advantage of the hm over pm is that it only requires minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation data which may be easily obtained from available gis raster data 1 e t o 0 0023 r a t m e a n 17 8 t m a x t m i n 0 5 where tmean is the average temperature oc tmax is the maximum temperature oc tmin is the minimum temperature oc and ra is extraterrestrial radiation mm month we then determined the crop coefficient using the thermal unit according to eq 2 by sammis et al 1985 the equation established was equivalent to 0 12 for c value through the growing season particularly for maize crop but in this study values of c were modified to match the wheat crop c values were 0 05 for early stage 0 5 for the stem extension stage 0 63 for the heading stage and 0 38 for the late stage we also calibrated this equation over the period 1997 2007 to evaluate the performance level for calculating crop coefficients and the validation was from 2008 2017 2 k c c 0 00168 t u 2 45 10 7 t u 2 4 37 10 10 t u 3 where c is the constant depend on growth stage tu is a thermal unit as

geoda is a software package prepared to produce spatial data analysis is an open source successor to geoda geoda was designed under the auspices of the national science foundation nsf funded center for spatially integrated social science anselin et al 2006 it was used to interpret the spatial distribution of etc for the long term the collected data of minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation during 1970 2017 are interpolated to show the present spatial temporal changes for the three studied locations 2 5 projection of crop evapotranspiration historical data were divided into two segments as input variables for the artificial intelligence model from 1970 to 2000 for the training and 2001 2017 for the validating the deep neural network dnn was applied using visual gene

shaykh and ash sharqiyah respectively in addition the temporal changes of seasonal minimum temperature tmin show a mixed pattern of upward and downward trend on the studied regions during the calibrated and validated years an upward trend was recorded 15 6 and 14 87 as maximum of tmin in ad daqahliyah regions compared with other regions which were 13 35 and 14 28 for kafr ash shaykh and 13 16 14 16 for ash sharqiyah moreover the downward trends were values of 8 48 and 7 12 in ad daqahliyah 6 33 and 6 89 in kafr ash shaykh and 5 77 and 6 38 in ash sharqiyah the temporal changes of minimum and maximum temperatures affected directly on solar radiation sr values during the studied years which was reached to a high value of 11 33 mm day with a mean value of 7 45 mm day 1 in ad daqahliyah from 1970 2000 compared with other regions as well the ash sharqiyah region was the highest sr value which was 9 33 with a mean value of 6 66 during 2000 2017 the descriptive statistics of the collected data from 1970 to 2017 for the three study governorates are listed in table 1 after understanding the temporal distribution of climatic factors much important information can be provided for analyzing the trend of crop actual evapotranspiration etc based on the hargreaves method as shown in table 2 kc values of wheat were presented at different growing stages i e initial development mid and late for calibration validation and prediction periods in the three study regions then the kc values obtained from the followed method were evaluated with recommended fao kc the coefficient of determination between calculated and recommended was found to be 0 98 as shown in fig 5 the findings showed that the monthly etc values were recorded highest values in ash sharqiyah more than 80 mm fig 6 then ad daqahliyah which was more than 75 mm fig 7 comparing to the third location fig 8 furthermore we compared the predicted monthly etc with the values calculated by the hargreaves method for the validation period from 2000 2017 for the three governorates tables 3 5 the results showed that in ad daqahliyah region the highest accuracy and nse of 0 94 and 0 96 were recorded in 2015 with low

additionally for the validation period the corresponding values were 0 94 0 80 and 12 55 in ad daqahliyah 0 95 0 88 1 74 in kafr ash shaykh and 0 95 0 82 and 13 95 in ash sharqiyah respectively 3 2 projected changes in wheat evapotranspiration during 2022 2035 the projected increase in climatic factors under the average two scenarios is greater than the average of historical period from 1970 to 2017 the increase in temperature was attributed to the increase of tmax degrees from 22 29 c to 25 43 c 22 11 c 23 09 c and 22 69 c 28 66 c respectively for ad daqahliyah ash sharqiyah and kafr ash shaykh the corresponding tmin degrees also increased from 9 97 c to 11 03 c from 9 37 c to 14 75 c and from 9 68 c to 13 41 c respectively for the three regions sr values also increased from 6 43 to 7 45 mm day 1 from 6 61 to 8 13 mm day 1 and from 6 41 to 9 01 mm day 1 respectively tmax will increase by 5 19 4 22 and 20 82 for ad daqahliyah ash sharqiyah and kafr ash shaykh respectively fig 9 whereas their corresponding average values of tmin will increase by 1 62 36 44 and 27 80 respectively the highly increase in tmin and tmax data affected directly on the expected solar radiation sr values as stated by elbeltagi et al 2020b it would increase by 6 53 18 74 and 28 83 for the corresponding regions as mentioned above respectively fig 9 after the calibration and validation of the dnn model based on the climate data scenarios rcp 4 5 and 8 5 during the historical periods that incorporated to the dnn method the predicted wheat etc from 2022 2035 based on future data for the three studied regions as illustrated in table 6 the projected etc values vary due to climate variations between tmax tmin and sr in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 with averages of 1 22 1 78 and 0 91 mm day 1 the results showed that kafr ash shaykh governorate produced the highest values of etc during the future period which is averaged from 302 03 in 2024 to 329 68 in 2032 the average value of etc during 1970 2017 and 2022 2035 was 281 84 mm and 313 72 mm with an increase by 11 31 fig 10 then the ad daqahliyah was the second rank which is ranged from 262 98 in 2031 to 301 53 in 2026 the corresponding percent increased of etc is 1 38 compared to the historical data as well the lowest values of etc were in ash sharqiyah region that varied from 204 05 in 2025 to 281 47 in 2035 average across the two scenarios for the ash sharqiyah area etc would decrease by 15 09 from 285 02 mm to 242 02 mm fig 10 the results stated that the dnn model performs well in reproducing the present etc and can be used as a robust and reliable tool to project future etc using limited climate data 4 discussion crop evapotranspiration values of wheat predicted based on the followed method in this study were compared to actual during calibration and validation periods as discussed earlier in section 3 1 fao suggested the kc values for the initial development mid and late stages of the crop are 0 7 0 9 1 15 and 0 25 fao 2000 the kc values are appropriate with fao through the growing season are 0 72 0 88 1 13 and 0 32 these findings are similar to those of farg et al 2012 who indicated that the determination coefficients r2 between combination of soil adjusted vegetation index savi and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as spectral vegetation indices for estimating kc were 0 827 0 903 and 0 976 through initial mid and last growth stages respectively in addition these findings were better than pôças et al 2015 who found that the r2 between reflectance based vegetation indices and soil water balance simdual model was 0 72 our results have achieved high performance compared to anwer et al 2016 reported that the average relative error values between the approximate values of kc and fao were 36 29 in addition the results obtained are in line with elbeltagi et al 2020b who modeled kc values using tmin tmax and sr and produced satisfactory output with high accuracy and less statistical error moreover our kc results are good in comparison with mulovhedzi et al 2020 who estimated kc values based on growing degree days gdd only and found the equation was successfully validated by comparing measured against estimated kc with an r2 0 80 and mean absolute percent difference mapd 7 in addition these results imply that the reference etc is more sensitive to tmin tmax and sr which consistent with the similar studies conducted in west texas awal et al 2020 kaduna central district onwuegbunam et al 2020 pearl river basin huang et al 2020 and in the semi arid region of south india gonzalez et al 2020 in addition the current followed method for prediction of wheat etc are close to chen et al 2020 who applied the temporal convolution network model for predicting etc and generated well output with r2 ranged from 0 91 to 0 95 moreover the research findings are similar to the outputs of fuzzy genetic and regularization random forest models presented by saggi and jain 2019a they found that the models had high performance for modeling kc and etc e g rmse 0 1160 0 396 r2 0 830 0 99 acc 94 99 as well our findings are in agreement with yamaç and todorovic 2020 they employed the different machine learning ml models based on limited climate data and results reveals the satisfactory outputs of ml with r2 ranged from 0 81 to 0 97 moreover the results are in line with everton et al 2020 evaluated the performance of the simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer using missing meteorological data their findings stated that r2 ranged from 0 95 to 0 97 at missing any data of solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity additionally the developed model produced satisfactory outputs compared to maselli et al 2020 used an improved normalized difference vegetation index ndvi based on fractional vegetation cover and stated that r2 increased from 0 814 to 0 933 while rmse decreased from 1 73 to 0 57 mm also this study gave similar results with falamarzi et al 2014 outputs they estimated et based on temperature and wind speed data using artificial and wavelet neural networks wnns and found the best model produced high nse 0 79 r2 0 89 and low rmse 1 03 mm day furthermore the dnn outputs agree well with that of kisi and alizamir 2018 applied the wavelet extreme learning machine welm model for modeling evapotranspiration and found high r2as 0 97 and 0 96 for model during training and testing with the combination of solar radiation mean air temperature relative humidity and wind speed in addition the results are in line with kisi 2016 who observed that the m5 model tree produced the best alternative with high correlation with penman monteith method for estimating evapotranspiration in the absence of local input and output data besides the generated dnn results are in agreement with the findings of khoshravesh et al 2017 estimated monthly et using the multivariate fractional polynomial robust regression and bayesian regression models and concluded that all models provided a closer agreement with the calculated values for fao pm r2 0 95 and rmse 12 07 mm month 1 5 conclusions this research evaluates the effects of historical and future climate changes on wheat evapotranspiration etc using deep neural networks dnn method three egyptian governorates were selected in nile delta namely ad daqahliyah kafr ash shaykh and ash sharqiyah the monthly data of minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax and solar radiation sr were obtained from open access data over the period from 1970 to 2000 and from 2000 2017 for calibration and validation in addition the climate weather data were collected from two representative concentration pathways during 2022 2035 after generating etc by hargreaves method with historical and future weather data the historical data were entered as inputs for valuing the outputs of the generated dnn model the results showed a high correlation between actual predicted etc values for calibration and validation periods over the three study regions after generating good results from the dnn model through the historical period the future dataset was incorporated to predict the future etc the model findings indicated that kafr ash shaykh will achieve the first rank for recording a high increased by 11 31 then ad daqahliyah with an increased by 1 38 on the other hand the expected results stated that ash sharqiyah region would decrease by 15 09 compared to the historical dataset these created dnn models produced satisfactory outputs with high accuracy for the three regions therefore these models will help the water managers planners and decision makers for long term water sustainability this study is essential as an important step in supporting agricultural water management strategies for crop water modeling our recommendations can be used on large scale in all nile delta governorates as a rapid robust and reliable technique for modeling etc using limited meteorological data and simple method in the future the proposed model can be applied to other economic crops such as rice and maize for modeling etc to achieve sustainable agricultural water

10468,crop evapotranspiration etc is one of the most basic components of the hydrologic cycle that is effective in irrigation system design and management water resources planning and scheduling and hydrologic water balance thus precise estimation of etc is valuable for various applications of agricultural water engineering especially in developing countries such as egypt which has lack of meteorological data high cost and time to calculate etc and lack of information on future etc values to consider management scenarios and increase production potential also due to the existence of different climates in egypt the estimate of etc has become a challenge to this end the aim of this study was to estimate the etc to eliminate the limitations mentioned and analyze the long term dynamics of etc based on limited climate data and simple method three egyptian governorates namely ad daqahliyah ash sharqiyah and kafr ash shaykh of nile delta were selected as major wheat producing sites the required historical required climatic data were collected from open access data library while future data were from two extreme scenarios of the representative concentration pathways rcp i e rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the available dataset was divided into three parts i calibration from 1970 2000 ii validation from 2000 2017 and iii prediction from 2022 2035 the deep neural network dnn was employed for incorporating historical data and predicting future etc for the evaluation of generated dnn models the research finding indicates that the correlation coefficients between actual versus predicted monthly etc were found to be 0 95 0 96 and 0 97 for calibration period and 0 94 0 95 and 0 95 for validation at ad daqahliyah kafr ash shaykh and ash sharqiyah regions respectively for the simulation of future climatic data maximum temperature tmax will increased by 5 19 4 22 and 20 82 minimum temperature tmin will increased by 1 62 36 44 and 27 80 and solar radiation sr will increased by 6 53 18 74 and 28 83 for the study locations respectively moreover the dnn model exposed that the kafr ash shaykh attain the highest values of etc with an increase of 11 31 slightly increased of 1 38 for ad daqahliyah and decreased by 15 09 for ash sharqiyah in comparison to the historical data thus the proposed model of crop water use prediction effectively estimated etc of wheat and make an efficient decision the developed models produced satisfactory results for water managers to save water and achieve the sustainability of agricultural water keywords crop evapotranspiration dnn model climate change future projection 1 introduction agricultural water resources in the context of changing climate conditions are decreasing in different regions of worldwide with more emphasis in the semi arid and arid zones therefore accurate evaluation of irrigation water needs for crops is an urgent to increase the productivity and efficiency of irrigation water use farg et al 2012 in addition crop evapotranspiration etc estimates are needed to assess their temporal variability and long term trends with climate feedback mechanisms feng et al 2017 and reduce the negative effects of excess irrigation water on crop production pôças et al 2015 evapotranspiration is the integration of two sections namely evaporation and transpiration that defined as the lost water from the soil surface and crop respectively jensen and allen 2016 several mathematical models used to determine the reference evapotranspiration eto however the method of food and agriculture organization fao fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 is the most superior comparing to other gavila et al 2007 pereira et al 2014 tabari et al 2013 but it needs many climate data factors hobbins 2016 maroufpoor et al 2020 although eto can be estimated by this method most accurately large scale meteorological data requirement at specific spatiotemporal scales maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit are quite often not available in many developing countries almorox et al 2015 dadaser celik et al 2016 espadafor et al 2011 irmak et al 2012 therefore the alternate models are required for estimation of eto when the available data are either limited or insufficient so this study uses only temperature and solar radiation data as inputs to the alternative model the literature survey depicts that previously several research studies have been focused on eto estimation using remote sensing farg et al 2012 aquacrop model butler et al 2017 li et al 2016 fao cropwat surendran et al 2015 however the soft computing applications and analysis of big data techniques for actual evapotranspiration modeling are restrictive in the previous review literature numerous soft computing approaches have been widely applied to achieve the tractability robustness and provide a low cost solution with a tolerance of imprecision partial truth uncertainty and an approximation khoshravesh et al 2017 mehdizadeh et al 2017 motamedi et al 2015 in agriculture field analyzing big data have offered newly predictive models for eto estimation for example fuzzy genetic and regularization random forest saggi and jain 2019a firefly algorithm motamedi et al 2015 adaptive neuro fuzzy methodology gocic et al 2015 convolution neural network cnn chen et al 2020 hybrid models which use techniques such as data fusion and ensemble modeling data decomposition as well as remote sensing based hybridization chia et al 2020 data driven models kisi et al 2015 malik et al 2019 wavelet conjunction heuristic kisi and alizamir 2018 artificial and wavelet neural networks wnns based on temperature and wind speed data falamarzi et al 2014 combination of multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch time series model mehdizadeh 2018 support vector regression coupled with nature inspired algorithm mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 tikhamarine et al 2020 2019 random forest and gene expression programming wang et al 2019 the aforementioned methods produced satisfactory outcomes for estimation of evapotranspiration than the empirical models therefore it is substantial to understand the temporal distributions of evapotranspiration and its projected changes using limited meteorological data and simple method the proposed work contribute basic guidance to water users and agricultural development planners for better assessing of etc in the light of climate data availability for the proper estimation of crop water demands to project the future changes in crop actual evapotranspiration little researches have been conducted e g xiao et al 2018 used agricultural production systems simulator apsim model and found that etc decreased across all stations under the two future climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 mehdi and vienna 2010 simulated the daily and the season total crop requirements using cropwat model and found a decrease of 2 71 8 mm 21 64 mm and 6 59 mm using the statistical downscaling model sdsm with canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis cgcm1 and uk hadley centre for climate prediction and research hadcm3 using emission scenarios a2 and b2 predictors respectively for the 2050s comparing with cropwat model jeong et al 2010 simulated etc based on artificial neural network ann and hadcm3 and they found that the increasing etc gradually to 2099 moreover the agricultural water demand model was applied by aladenola and madramootoo 2010 and their findings showed that the percentage difference between future and current irrigation water needs ranged from 2 to 2 furthermore sdsm was used by li et al 2012 and they found the projected increase of 4 for the period 2011 2040 chen et al 2019 simulated the impacts of climate change on hydrology and crop production using an improved soil and water assessment tool swat model their results stated that annual etc and irrigation decreased by 8 25 and 15 42 respectively under the climate change scenarios compared to the historical period these models require many climatic data and geographical information for the prediction of etc process in this study deep neural network dnn was applied based on least climatic data three climatic factors only for etc prediction in three governorates of nile delta region the most necessary issue to know about the deep learning approach is that the new features are learned and transformed through these deep neural architectures to increase the efficiency of the overall learning dl can be used to model the complex relationship between input and output because of its high hierarchical structure model feature

study it is the major winter cereal grain crop and the third major crop in terms of area planted in egypt fao 2011 accounting for 43 of the total winter crop area sayed et al 2019 in addition there is a large gap between its production and consumption abdelmageed et al 2019 furthermore to our knowledge there are no studies available in the literature that evaluate the etc of wheat at the present and future in the semi arid regions using deep learning hence the aim of this research is i to analyze the temporal distributions of etc from 1970 to 2017 and ii to project the future changes in etc from 2022 to 2035 by employing the dnn method this information is commanding to learn the impact of climate change on etc in the study region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located on the nile delta in egypt it occupies the northern part of egypt where the nile meets the mediterranean sea the total length of the nile river is approximately 7000 km and it is known as the longest river in the world the nile delta accounts for approximately 2 of the total area of egypt and contains up to 63 of the agricultural land the delta starts approximately 20 km north of cairo and continues north for 150 km the width of the delta is approximately 250 km and is bounded alexandria governorate in the west and port said in the east the annual mean maximum air temperature tmax is 24 and the annual mean minimum air temperature tmin is 16 the wind speed ws varies from 3 8 to 5 2 ms 1 and the rainfall season starts in october representing approximately 75 of the total rainfall most of the rainfalls occur in december and january which are known as the rainiest months in this region shalaby 2012 shalaby and tateishi 2007 we selected three governorates in the nile delta namely ad daqahliyah ash sharqiyah and kafr ash shaykh with a total area of 11088 km2 as shown in fig 1 wheat crop was selected for this study as one of the most important grain crops grown principally during the winter season in egypt the local production is not sufficient to supply the annual demand of the increasing population abdelmageed et al 2019 hence increasing wheat production is the most important possibility for reducing the wheat gap and reach self sufficiency of wheat production we have collected the total agricultural crop land areas of wheat for the three governorates from agriculture directorates of governorates and calculated the coverage of wheat crop in these regions we found that wheat crop covers 35 72 28 69 39 71 in the studied regions according to the food and agricultural organization fao guidelines the months for planting and harvesting wheat are from november to april the length of crop growth stages are 40 60 60 and 40 days for initial development mid and late periods respectively fao 2000 2 2 data sources for historical data the monthly data of maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin precipitation p and solar radiation sr from november to april for wheat were extracted from open access data using environmental systems research institute esri arc gis tool over the period from 1970 to 2017 with a spatial resolution of about 4 km2 for more details about open access data average maximum and minimum temperatures data were collected from climatic research unit ts 4 0 as network common data form netcdf format at 0 5 grid for the global land surface abatzoglou et al 2018 furthermore solar radiation data were collected from the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 as netcdf format kobayashi et al 2015 for future climate data projection general circulation models gcms are physical based tools that provide a reasonable basis for determining future climate data however the generated data from that tool cannot be used directly in several regions or agricultural water resources and environmental researches due to poor simulation of local scale processes masud et al 2018 thus it is necessary to make downscaling of gcm output data before application in the impact studies e g calibration of the dnn model three gcms were obtained from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex initiative this platform was developed by the world climate research program wcrp to generate high resolution climate datasets hrcd over many locations worldwide gutowski et al 2016 the tmax tmin and sr data were obtained as monthly datasets from the earth system grid federation esgf over the period from 2022 to 2035 the esgf portal allows user to discover data and create scripts to fetch the data also this system provides the full details about the selected variable and it s available as netcdf format the process for transferring a data set is for one variable for all realizations of one model for one experiment two global climate models gcms ipsl cm5alr institute pierre simon laplace and mpi esm mr max planck institute for meteorology were used as projections of climate change within the coupled model inter comparison project taylor et al 2012 besides the regional climate model rcm used was dmi hirham5 and its driving gcm was ichec ec earth luhunga et al 2018 two extreme scenarios of the representative concentration pathways i e rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were used as climate projections cordex rcm simulations for the african domain afr cordex are conducted at two different spatial resolutions the general cordex resolution of 0 44 degree afr 44 50 km 2 3 calculation of crop evapotranspiration to calculate reference evapotranspiration eto the hargreaves method hm suggested by food and agricultural organization fao was used as illustrated in eq 1 this method was used because the parameters necessary to calculate the penman monteith pm model are not available hargreaves and allen 2003 aguilar et al 2011 fooladmand and zandilak 2008 patel et al 2014 raziei and pereira 2013 the advantage of the hm over pm is that it only requires minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation data which may be easily obtained from available gis raster data 1 e t o 0 0023 r a t m e a n 17 8 t m a x t m i n 0 5 where tmean is the average temperature oc tmax is the maximum temperature oc tmin is the minimum temperature oc and ra is extraterrestrial radiation mm month we then determined the crop coefficient using the thermal unit according to eq 2 by sammis et al 1985 the equation established was equivalent to 0 12 for c value through the growing season particularly for maize crop but in this study values of c were modified to match the wheat crop c values were 0 05 for early stage 0 5 for the stem extension stage 0 63 for the heading stage and 0 38 for the late stage we also calibrated this equation over the period 1997 2007 to evaluate the performance level for calculating crop coefficients and the validation was from 2008 2017 2 k c c 0 00168 t u 2 45 10 7 t u 2 4 37 10 10 t u 3 where c is the constant depend on growth stage tu is a thermal unit as

geoda is a software package prepared to produce spatial data analysis is an open source successor to geoda geoda was designed under the auspices of the national science foundation nsf funded center for spatially integrated social science anselin et al 2006 it was used to interpret the spatial distribution of etc for the long term the collected data of minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation during 1970 2017 are interpolated to show the present spatial temporal changes for the three studied locations 2 5 projection of crop evapotranspiration historical data were divided into two segments as input variables for the artificial intelligence model from 1970 to 2000 for the training and 2001 2017 for the validating the deep neural network dnn was applied using visual gene developer vgd software version 1 9 jung and mcdonald 2011 as shown in the interface fig 2 the dnn is designed from many types of layers 1 the input layer is the initial data for dnn 2 the hidden layers are intermediate layers between the independent input and dependent output layers where all the computations are done and 3 the output layer produces the result for the given inputs elbeltagi et al 2020a the software not only provides general functions for gene analysis and optimization along with an interactive user friendly interface but also includes unique features such as programming

data during the calibration and validation datasets are shown in fig 4 for maximum temperature tmax analysis during the calibrated years from 1970 2000 the highest temperature values are found in the ad daqahliyah region which is more than 33 while the lowest temperature values in kafr ash shaykh is less than 27 the mean maximum temperatures were 25 43 22 23 and 21 64 in ad daqahliyah kafr ash shaykh and ash sharqiyah respectively meanwhile tmax values through the validated years from 2000 2017 were 26 74 27 36 and 27 52 with an average of 22 79 23 16 and 22 59 for ad daqahliyah kafr ash shaykh and ash sharqiyah respectively in addition the temporal changes of seasonal minimum temperature tmin show a mixed pattern of upward and downward trend on the studied regions during the calibrated and validated years an upward trend was recorded 15 6 and 14 87 as maximum of tmin in ad daqahliyah regions compared with other regions which were 13 35 and 14 28 for kafr ash shaykh and 13 16 14 16 for ash sharqiyah moreover the downward trends were values of 8 48 and 7 12 in ad daqahliyah 6 33 and 6 89 in kafr ash shaykh and 5 77 and 6 38 in ash sharqiyah the temporal changes of minimum and maximum temperatures affected directly on solar radiation sr values during the studied years which was reached to a high value of 11 33 mm day with a mean value of 7 45 mm day 1 in ad daqahliyah from 1970 2000 compared with other regions as well the ash sharqiyah region was the highest sr value which was 9 33 with a mean value of 6 66 during 2000 2017 the descriptive statistics of the collected data from 1970 to 2017 for the three study governorates are listed in table 1 after understanding the temporal distribution of climatic factors much important information can be provided for analyzing the trend of crop actual evapotranspiration etc based on the hargreaves method as shown in table 2 kc values of wheat were presented at different growing stages i e initial development mid and late for calibration validation and prediction periods in the three study regions then the kc values obtained from the followed method were evaluated with recommended fao kc the coefficient of determination between calculated and recommended was found to be 0 98 as shown in fig 5 the findings showed that the monthly etc values were recorded highest values in ash sharqiyah more than 80 mm fig 6 then ad daqahliyah which was more than 75 mm fig 7 comparing to the third location fig 8 furthermore we compared the predicted monthly etc with the values calculated by the hargreaves method for the validation period from 2000 2017 for the three governorates tables 3 5 the results showed that in ad daqahliyah region the highest accuracy and nse of 0 94 and 0 96 were recorded in 2015 with low statistical error rmse 3 21 mm month 1 1 mae 2 98 mm month 1 mape 7 86 and mare 0 06 mm month 1 compared to the years of 2002 and 2003 table 3 in addition the high performance of dnn model in kafr ash shaykh was found in 2000 with 0 90 for accuracy and nse in comparison with the results of 2008 and 2010 that achieved the lowest performance table 4 for the third governorate ash sharqiyah the year of

estimated in 2002 nse 0 76 as averages of the calibration and validation years the relationship between the predicted versus actual wheat etc produced satisfactory results the coefficient of determination slope and intercept are 0 95 0 91 and 9 27 for ad daqahliyah 0 96 0 98 and 4 59 for kafr ash shaykh and 0 97 0 94 and 9 73 for ash sharqiyah respectively for the calibration period additionally for the validation period the corresponding values were 0 94 0 80 and 12 55 in ad daqahliyah 0 95 0 88 1 74 in kafr ash shaykh and 0 95 0 82 and 13 95 in ash sharqiyah respectively 3 2 projected changes in wheat evapotranspiration during 2022 2035 the projected increase in climatic factors under the average two scenarios is greater than the average of historical period from 1970 to 2017 the increase in temperature was attributed to the increase of tmax degrees from 22 29 c to 25 43 c 22 11 c 23 09 c and 22 69 c 28 66 c respectively for ad daqahliyah ash sharqiyah and kafr ash shaykh the corresponding tmin degrees also increased from 9 97 c to 11 03 c from 9 37 c to 14 75 c and from 9 68 c to 13 41 c respectively for the three regions sr values also increased from 6 43 to 7 45 mm day 1 from 6 61 to 8 13 mm day 1 and from 6 41 to 9 01 mm day 1 respectively tmax will increase by 5 19 4 22 and 20 82 for ad daqahliyah ash sharqiyah and kafr ash shaykh respectively fig 9 whereas their corresponding average values of tmin will increase by 1 62 36 44 and 27 80 respectively the highly increase in tmin and tmax data affected directly on the expected solar radiation sr values as stated by elbeltagi et al 2020b it would increase by 6 53 18 74 and 28 83 for the corresponding regions as mentioned above respectively fig 9 after the calibration and validation of the dnn model based on the climate data scenarios rcp 4 5 and 8 5 during the historical periods that incorporated to the dnn method the predicted wheat etc from 2022 2035 based on future data for the three studied regions as illustrated in table 6 the projected etc values vary due to climate variations between tmax tmin and sr in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 with averages of 1 22 1 78 and 0 91 mm day 1 the results showed that kafr ash shaykh governorate produced the highest values of etc during the future period which is averaged from 302 03 in 2024 to 329 68 in 2032 the average value of etc during 1970 2017 and 2022 2035 was 281 84 mm and 313 72 mm with an increase by 11 31 fig 10 then the ad daqahliyah was the second rank which is ranged from 262 98 in 2031 to 301 53 in 2026 the corresponding percent increased of etc is 1 38 compared to the historical data as well the lowest values of etc were in ash sharqiyah region that varied from 204 05 in 2025 to 281 47 in 2035 average across the two scenarios for the ash sharqiyah area etc would decrease by 15 09 from 285 02 mm to 242 02 mm fig 10 the results stated that the dnn model performs well in reproducing the present etc and can be used as a robust and reliable tool to project future etc using limited climate data 4 discussion crop evapotranspiration values of wheat predicted based on the followed method in this study were compared to actual during calibration and validation periods as discussed earlier in section 3 1 fao suggested the kc values for the initial development mid and late stages of the crop are 0 7 0 9 1 15 and 0 25 fao 2000 the kc values are appropriate with fao through the growing season are 0 72 0 88 1 13 and 0 32 these findings are similar to those of farg et al 2012 who indicated that the determination coefficients r2 between combination of soil adjusted vegetation index savi and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as spectral vegetation indices for estimating kc were 0 827 0 903 and 0 976 through initial mid and last growth stages respectively in addition these findings were better than pôças et al 2015 who found that the r2 between reflectance based vegetation indices and soil water balance simdual model was 0 72 our results have achieved high performance compared to anwer et al 2016 reported that the average relative error values between the approximate values of kc and fao were 36 29 in addition the results obtained are in line with elbeltagi et al 2020b who modeled kc values using tmin tmax and sr and produced satisfactory output with high accuracy and less statistical error moreover our kc results are good in comparison with mulovhedzi et al 2020 who estimated kc values based on growing degree days gdd only and found the equation was successfully validated by comparing measured against estimated kc with an r2 0 80 and mean absolute percent difference mapd 7 in addition these results imply that the reference etc is more sensitive to tmin tmax and sr which consistent with the similar studies conducted in west texas awal et al 2020 kaduna central district onwuegbunam et al 2020 pearl river basin huang et al 2020 and in the semi arid region of south india gonzalez et al 2020 in addition the current followed method for prediction of wheat etc are close to chen et al 2020 who applied the temporal convolution network model for predicting etc and generated well output with r2 ranged from 0 91 to 0 95 moreover the research findings are similar to the outputs of fuzzy genetic and regularization random forest models presented by saggi and jain 2019a they found that the models had high performance for modeling kc and etc e g rmse 0 1160 0 396 r2 0 830 0 99 acc 94 99 as well our findings are in agreement with yamaç and todorovic 2020 they employed the different machine learning ml models based on limited climate data and results reveals the satisfactory outputs of ml with r2 ranged from 0 81 to 0 97 moreover the results are in line with everton et al 2020 evaluated the performance of the simple algorithm for evapotranspiration retrieving safer using missing meteorological data their findings stated that r2 ranged from 0 95 to 0 97 at missing any data of solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity additionally the developed model produced satisfactory outputs compared to maselli et al 2020 used an improved normalized difference vegetation index ndvi based on fractional vegetation cover and stated that r2 increased from 0 814 to 0 933 while rmse decreased from 1 73 to 0 57 mm also this study gave similar results with falamarzi et al 2014 outputs they estimated et based on temperature and wind speed data using artificial and wavelet neural networks wnns and found the best model produced high nse 0 79 r2 0 89 and low rmse 1 03 mm day furthermore the dnn outputs agree well with that of kisi and alizamir 2018 applied the wavelet extreme learning machine welm model for modeling evapotranspiration and found high r2as 0 97 and 0 96 for model during training and testing with the combination of solar radiation mean air temperature relative humidity and wind speed in addition the results are in line with kisi 2016 who observed that the m5 model tree produced the best alternative with high correlation with penman monteith method for estimating evapotranspiration in the absence of local input and output data besides the generated dnn results are in agreement with the findings of khoshravesh et al 2017 estimated monthly et using the multivariate fractional polynomial robust regression and bayesian regression models and concluded that all models provided a closer agreement with the calculated values for fao pm r2 0 95 and rmse 12 07 mm month 1 5 conclusions this research evaluates the effects of historical and future climate changes on wheat evapotranspiration etc using deep neural networks dnn method three egyptian governorates were selected in nile delta namely ad daqahliyah kafr ash shaykh and ash sharqiyah the monthly data of minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax and solar radiation sr were obtained from open access data over the period from 1970 to 2000 and from 2000 2017 for calibration and validation in addition the climate weather data were collected from two representative concentration pathways during 2022 2035 after generating etc by hargreaves method with historical and future weather data the historical data were entered as inputs for valuing the outputs of the generated dnn model the results showed a high correlation between actual predicted etc values for calibration and validation periods over the three study regions after generating good results from the dnn model through the historical period the future dataset was incorporated to predict the future etc the model findings indicated that kafr ash shaykh will achieve the first rank for recording a high increased by 11 31 then ad daqahliyah with an increased by 1 38 on the other hand the expected results stated that ash sharqiyah region would decrease by 15 09 compared to the historical dataset these created dnn models produced satisfactory outputs with high accuracy for the three regions therefore these models will help the water managers planners and decision makers for long term water sustainability this study is essential as an important step in supporting agricultural water management strategies for crop water modeling our recommendations can be used on large scale in all nile delta governorates as a rapid robust and reliable technique for modeling etc using

10469,the use of moisture readings by the indirect method has been increasing in recent years such as the use of a frequency domain reflectometry capacitance fdr technology but the use of this equipment requires a calibration for the soil usually these equipments are calibrated by soil layers but the calibration of an fdr sensor by different soil tillage has never been performed therefore this study aimed to i calibrate a frequency domain reflectometry capacitance probe fdr for a ultisol udult ii evaluate the calibration by bland altman s methodology iii calibrate the equipment for the same soil by applying four different soil tillage systems conventional tillage minimum tillage minimum tillage with deep subsoiling and no tillage iv evaluate whether calibration separated by soil tillage is more effective than without separation the experiment was carried out using split pilot design on the premises of the santa fe plant municipality of ibitinga sp brazil probe calibration reached up to one meter deep and generated four regression curves one for each soil tillage system with the soil bulk density and macroporosity affecting the diviner 2000 equipment calibration manufacturer s soil calibration proved inadequate based on bland altman s methodology it was used soil tillage systems as separation factor to calibrate the equipment which increased the determination coefficient in 16 in relation to soil calibration soil tillage by modifying the structure of soil physical attributes also affected the calibration of the diviner 2000 equipment proving that in an area where different soil tillages occurs one calibration must take place for each soil tillage keywords diviner 2000 soil water storage soil moisture frequency domain reflectometry fdr 1 introduction soil water content plays an important role in the processes occurring throughout soil profile and can be quantified through different methods among which the most traditional is the gravimetric method zhai et al 2017 however indirect methods have become increasingly frequent for considering other soil attributes and involving facilitated measurement procedures at higher depths fares and alva 2000 frequency domain reflectometry sensors fdr have emerged as a much sought after indirect method over the past decade to determine soil water content for their facilitated reading and non destructive measurement fares and alva 2000 fdr sensors provide fast accurate in depth information and can be coupled into automated data reading systems enabling an increased frequency of data collection al ghobari et al 2016 hardie et al 2013 mazahrih et al 2008 described the importance of the probes inserted into the soil for a more accurate irrigation in relation to other types of sensors the authors concluded that the insertion into the ground reduces reading errors and causes minimal disturbance during installation the fdr probe consists of a pair of electrodes functioning as an electronic capacitor in addition the device activation leads the soil water air matrix to form the capacitor dielectric environment insulating capacitance increases with the accumulation of free water molecules and their dipoles respond to the electrical field created the capacitor is connected to an inductor capacitor circuit that performs frequency exchanges in the circuit the higher the capacitance the lower the frequency for the soil in turn the higher the moisture the greater the capacitance measured through a generic formula paltineanu and starr 1997 although the manufacturer company provides a universal calibration sensors need local calibration to generate more accurate water content estimates in the soil despite the high cost and labor intensive process paltineanu and starr 1997 provenzano et al 2016 chow et al 2009 studied nine sensors in sandy clayey soil in the maritime region of canada and found the value of r2 of 0 75 for the sensor with the best calibration which is considered low andrade junior et al 2007 calibrated an fdr diviner 2000 sensor for a yellow latosol in the brazilian coast of piaui and reached a high correlation r2 0 97 manufacturer s calibration is not accurate for all soils paltineanu and starr 1997 since the soil water content depends on several factors such as texture and structure in addition to changes in soil density and soil organic matter content influencing the soil capacity to retain water mitchell et al 2015 the equipment influence ranges approximately 0 10 m from the sensor shaft the closer to the tube the greater the equipment sensitivity therefore the correct installation is fundamental to prevent the formation of air bubbles between soil and tube as well as to reduce reading errors for this purpose it is recommended to use field calibrations to achieve a better accuracy regarding water volume in the soil rotimi ojo et al 2015 due to its facility or diviner 2000 equipment it is already being used in various countries and cultures among them agroforestry abdulai et al 2018 wheat schittenhelm and langkamp wedde 2019 and palm trees abdelhadi et al 2020 with this it is possible to perceive its versatility furthermore all these studies are used in depth calibration abdulai et al 2018 but in case of sugar cane the different tillages applied affect differently the physical attributes of the soil oliveira et al 2019 most authors perform single calibrations abdulai et al 2018 or subdivide them in depth with data obtained in the field as indicated by the manufacturer in situations in physically separated locations there are also local calibrations de queiroz et al 2020 but there are no in the article that evaluated by soil tillages for sugarcane therefore the authors decided to test this option but all these studies were performed for unspecified soil tillage calibrations such as by layers it is known that separating the calibration by layer generates higher r2 than using the soil without subdivision provenzano et al 2016 in addition it is now known that soil tillage due to its tillage directly affects soil quality and structure oliveira et al 2019 and other forms of conservationist management such as traffic control esteban et al 2019 affect soil structure in sugarcane areas but no work has studied whether they affect soil calibration in indirect measuring equipment so there is no calibration in the literature for this equipment to assess the soil management used therefore one of the hypotheses of this study is that tillage affects the calibration of the diviner 2000 equipment thus this study aimed to i calibrate a frequency domain reflectometry capacitance probe fdr for a ultisol udult ii evaluate the calibration by bland altman s methodology iii calibrate the equipment for the same soil by applying four different soil tillage systems conventional tillage minimum tillage minimum tillage with deep subsoiling and no tillage iv evaluate whether calibration separated by soil tillage is more effective than without separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area the study was conducted under field conditions at santa fé mill in an experimental area in the municipality of ibitinga sp 21 45 s and 48 49 w at an altitude of 455 m above sea level the region s climate is classified as tropical with dry season aw according to the köppen climate classification alvares et al 2013 with a cold and dry winter as well as a hot and rainy summer mean annual temperature of 23 c and annual precipitation of 1260 mm cepagri 2015 the experimental design contained randomized blocks with three repetitions using sunn hemp crotalaria juncea as a cover plant for the equipment calibration which allowed to isolate the sunn hemp effect on the soil structure since the cover plants affect the soil structure only at the superficial depth the sunn hemp were sown in december 2014 and conducted until april 2015 it was planted in rows by means of a 9 row no till seeder baldan modelo solo grafic 4500 and a valtra tractor model bm 125i 132 hp using 25 kg ha 1 of seeds the desiccation occured by applying a dose of 200 l ha 1 of syrup composed of 6 l ha 1 of glyphosate 70 ml ha 1 of dawn and 1 l ha 1 of mineral oil sugarcane was planted by means of furrowing and in the implantation fertilization 300 kg ha 1 of n p k 10 51 00 was applied in the plots without cover where the conventional tillage was carried out two light harrows took place using a hydraulic 36 disc harrow from baldan and a case mxm 200 hp tractor and furrowing at 0 40 m depth using a valtra bh 180 hp 4 4 tractor and a two row driade furrower in the plots where no tillage only the furrow was carried out the minimum tillage was implemented by means of a mx270 hp 4 4 case tractor and subsoiling at 0 40 m depth with the subsoiler of the stara implement line model asa laser the minimum tillage with deep subsoiling was carried out by subsoiling with an ast matic 550 implement with 5 rods 0 75 m deep with work in the 0 70 m layer using a mx270 hp 4 4 case tractor sugarcane was planted in april 2015 with a variety of ctc 4 sugarcane the stalks were distributed using a john deere 7205 j 205 hp 4 4 tractor and a dmb pcp 6000 chopped cane planter the ctc 4 variety is characterized by having medium late maturation and developing well in production environments from a to c with excellent budding including raw cane each plot consisted of six sugarcane lines of the ctc4 variety with a spacing of 1 5 m and 30 m in length encompassing an area of 300 m2 per parcel we collected the samples from the sugarcane plantation along two years the soil was classified as ultisol udult soil survey staff 1998 and argissolo vermelho according to the brazilian soil classification system santos et al 2018 particle size distribution of the soil was obtained by pipette method according to teixeira et al 2017 and values are shown in table 1 with the separation of sand in coarse and fine using a 0 053 mm mesh sieve after the end of the sugarcane cycle the organic matter content for the treatments was evaluated presented in table 2 with this because there were no differences between the treatments therefore this attribute was considered the same for all calibrations performed 2 2 capacitance probe we used a fdr frequency domain reflectometry probe model diviner 2000 sentek 2001 consisting of a data logger coupled to a probe through a cable to generate readings every 0 10 m every reading is stored in the datalogger for a fixed time 1 s and ranges 120 000 mhz water and 160 000 mhz air depending on the soil water content the equipment must be normalized before performing the measurements because of differences between probes the procedure includes recording the readings inside a pvc tube exposed separately from air and water the data output provided by the datalogger is called scaled frequency sf and is generated using the following eq 1 1 sf fa fs fa fw fa reading of the frequency in the pvc pipe fully suspended in the air fs reading of the frequency in the pvc tube in the soil fw reading of the frequency pvc pipe immersed in the water the process of equipment normalization generated values of fa and fw of 175 69 mhz and 127 33 mhz respectively considering the low accuracy degree in relative frequency readings values sf depending on the soil texture the manufacturer recommends exponential calibrating the equipment used for the relative frequency as well as soil volumetric moisture 2 3 installation of access tubes we used a manufacturer s installation kit to install the calibration tubes in the end of each tube we inserted cutting rings to facilitate the tube penetration into the soil installed perpendicularly to the ground using a level and a rubber hammer at intervals of 0 15 m upon every depth increase the soil contained in the tube was removed using an auger this installation procedure aims at reducing air pockets formation and variations in soil density adjacent to the access tube sentek 2001 after installation each tube was placed 0 04 m above the ground surface and covered with a plastic lid firmly placed on the upper end of the tube in addition to being sealed at the bottom with a rubber ring to avoid moisture inside the barrel which would damage the appliance and cause reading errors 2 4 soil readings and sampling procedure for calibration initially we performed three frequency readings in the 0 00 1 00 m layer and subsequently collected soil to determine the gravimetric moisture θw and soil bulk density bd for each 0 10 m we collected three stainless steel volumetric rings of 0 05 m in diameter and 0 05 m in height later subjected to hermetic packaging for moisture maintenance we weighted and kiln dried the rings in the laboratory 105 c for 48 h we found the gravimetric moisture through the water weight on dry soil weight and eq 2 to reach the volumetric moisture 2 θq θw bd in which θq volumetric moisture m3 m 3 a θ gravimetric moisture kg kg 1 bd soil bulk density kg dm 3 we collected the samples between dry and saturated moisture and carried out the calibration collections in august 2015 and january 2016 after the planting of sugar cane and the initial establishment of the crop between the periods of samples there was no machine traffic in the area and it can be considered that between the collections there were no differences between the physical attributes of the soil the choice for these sampling periods was due to the periods of greater drought and rain respectively thus collecting the points in the extreme moments of water and increasing the reality in the field for the collection of samples in each evaluated period the methodology suggested by the equipment manufacturer was used tubes was installed specifically for the calibration where the frequency emitted by the equipment was measured and after a trench was opened to collect the undisturbed samples with three repetitions every 0 10 m in depth to evaluate each of the frequencies read by the equipment the sampling sites for the calibration were in both collections close with a distance of 5 m between the tubes so that they represented the same location but with a distance to open the collection trenches for the deformed and undeformed samples of soil bulk density and gravimetric water content this is the methodology suggested by the manufacturer 2 5 soil physical attributes soil bulk density bd was obtained by the ratio between dry soil mass and soil sample volume macroporosity was obtained by the difference between water content of the saturated sample total porosity and water content after submitted to tension table at 6 0 kpa while microporosity was obtained from the difference between the water content obtained in 6 kpa and the dry weight of the sample teixeira et al 2017 2 6 data evaluation we assessed the significant differences between the treatments regarding the soil physical attributes of the soil through an analysis of variance anova in split plots upon significance a tukey test at 5 probability was applied we applied bland altman agreement limit aiming at verifying a possible equivalation between moisture values estimated by the probe and the standard method martin bland and altman 1986 3 results soil physical attributes are important when calibrating the diviner 2000 equipment such as soil bulk density and porosity macroporosity and microporosity for enabling to assess how different soil managements affect the structure and consequently calibrations table 3 3 1 soil physical attributes presented by different soil tillage systems we found that the treatments with minimum tillage mt no tillage nt minimum tillage with deep subsoiling mt ds and conventional tillage ct affected the soil physical attributes table 3 soil bulk density bd had no statistical differences between the soil tillage systems but had distinguished values according to depth assessed bd was lower at 0 00 0 05 m than the others such a difference was not regarded as significant considering that our study has readings performed every 0 10 m no significant differences were found in depth which was highly considered when deciding for a different calibration to each soil tillage system considering their distinguished bd and porosity values both the macroporosity and microporosity had an inversely proportional behavior including a reduced macroporosity and increased microporosity in depth table 3 the mt achieved a higher macroporosity value in relation to other tillage systems possibly a result of the bd values 3 2 soil calibration disregarding soil tillage systems fig 1 shows the regression curve obtained through soil calibration regardless of the tillage system according to a comparison between the manufacturer s calibration curve and other studies in the literature morgan et al 1999 and fares et al 2004 assessed clayey and sandy soils respectively and found equations in which the manufacturer underestimates the data for all the assessed moistures fig 1 however provenzano et al 2016 studied several soils with different textures and found an opposite behavior by comparing the curve found through the field calibration and the manufacturer s in which the values were initially underestimated through the equation local calibration was close to the value found by morgan et al 1999 until 0 20 m3 m 3 slightly higher and then lower values were revealed regarding the manufacturer s curve local curve remained high up to a water content of 0 25 m3 m 3 the local curve remained below the calibration range in fares et al 2004 and above the value in andrade junior et al 2007 for all soil water contents the determination coefficient value found for the soil calibration curve was r2 0 82 in accordance to the values found by morgan et al 1999 with r2 0 83 and haberland et al 2015 with r2 0 81 in a medium textured soil the authors found that up to the inflection point the manufacturer s equation values underestimated the water content values in the soil upon exceeding the limit the values started to be underestimate we assessed the manufacturer s calibration equation and the calibration equation for the soil in this study through the bland altman agreement fig 2 by analyzing the agreement between two variables x and y from a scatter plot difference y x between the variables means x y 2 the equation resulting from the graphical response assesses the agreements between the methods using the same data from its bias as differences start in zero in this case the error is the dispersion of the points of differences around the mean outliers and trends mean difference was 0 0006 m3 m 3 and the dots were randomly distributed around the mean having generated unsatisfactory results fig 2 the bland altman agreement revealed lower moisture values with a tendency to underestimate the manufacturer s equation in addition with increased moisture lines intersect 0 30 m3 m 3 and values are overestimated the moisture differences assessment n 42 41 and 59 were below and above the bias respectively 3 3 calibration according to the soil tillage system in order to reach an improved determination coefficient we subdivided the calibration according to the soil tillage system in the experimental area in which higher determination coefficients were generated to calibrate the equipment table 4 the different soil tillage systems individually calibrated increased the determination coefficient r2 in relation to soil calibration fig 3 soil calibration showed a value of r2 of 0 82 considered low when assessing each soil tillage system individually which allowed to reach a value of r2 of 0 96 for mt representing an increase of 20 in relation to soil calibration in addition ct reached a value of 0 88 an increase of 7 3 the mt calibration curve exceeds the manufacturer s in approximately 0 25 m3 m 3 that is it overestimates the values up to this point and subsequently the values are underestimated fig 3 however the values generated are close to the manufacturer s which is considered adequate nt had higher soil water contents in the calibration curve than the manufacturer s until the saturation point fig 3 therefore the manufacturer s soil water content equation underestimates the actual values for this treatment in addition the manufacturer s calibration is not considered adequate mt ds the remaining soil tillage systems assessed generated the calibration curve that approached the manufacturer s the most and despite overestimating the soil moisture values it is considered adequate fig 3 in contrast ct differentiated from the manufacturer s calibration the most and overestimated the soil moisture values thus considered inappropriate 4 discussion 4 1 soil physical attributes variations in soil bulk density modify the volumetric moisture by promoting the variability of soil water mediations hu et al 2008 soil bulk density values should be used when calibrating equipment like tdr and fdr variation in bd or macroporosity ma affects electrical permissiveness and consequently the relative frequency reading through the sensor equipment namdar khojasteh et al 2012 stone and silveira 2001 assessed soil bulk density in a nt area and found an increased soil density in depth for both treatments in addition to having obtained lower depth density values for nt at 0 20 m reduced soil bulk density in the superficial layers resulted from the cultural practices performed according to souza et al 2012 another factor affecting soil bulk density is straw incorporation acting as a damper to the weight of the machine helping to reduce the forces applied in the soil in addition it should be noted that in this study the pé de grade portuguese or harrow foot effect occurred where there is an excessive compaction in the layers in which the harrow passes due to its revolving movement it compacts the lower area of the disc brannstrom and oliveira 2000 for bd values are close to those obtained by ceddia et al 1999 when studying raw sugarcane in a podzólico amarelo at 0 10 m but different ones at 0 10 0 40 m according to vischi filho et al 2015 the increase in size and weight of the machines over the years led the soil to compact and caused higher soil density and lower macroporosity it is known that in areas of sugar cane due to the different levels of soil tillage mainly in the initial phase of the crop there differences between the soil tillages are more visible especially between conventional and no tillage barbosa et al 2019 there is a tendency to reduce the differences over the cycles mainly with the harvester and transshipment traffic which are the implements that cause greater compaction guimarães júnnyor et al 2019 therefore bd is an important attribute that directly influences the calibration of the equipment because it is one of the attributes that can be most differentiated between soil tillages the influence of macroporosity on soil calibration is related to its role in the equipment frequency reading especially for the moisture content close to saturation for the treatments assessed macroporosity had lower depth according to the data verified by ceddia et al 1999 when working with raw sugarcane in the nt system such an effect results from increased clay levels in depth enhancing microporosity over macroporosity macroporosity values are affected by the management applied in the soil especially when comparing the conventional and direct planting considering the different levels of soil tillages the values are in accordance with those found by adalberto castioni et al 2018 for the macroporosity in the superficial layer of the soil 0 00 0 10 m where these values are close to 0 20 m3 m 3 which are the values recommended by the literature microporosity influenced the readings of diviner 2000 for lower moistures cherubin et al 2016 verified increased microporosity in depth but with values higher than those found for the layer 0 00 0 10 m despite being close to its lower layers 0 30 m3 m 3 microporosity values also increased in depth similarly to the findings by everton et al 2016 when working with sugarcane in the first ratoon the lowest microporosity values can be a natural soil density response the effects of compaction compromise soil calibration as they increase density and reduce porosity altering the frequency reading in the device therefore we assessed the calibrations through the soil tillage to enable the analysis of the compaction effects on the equipment calibration 4 2 calibration curve for 0 1 00 m the determination coefficients of the curve obtained proved lower in relation to the laboratory calibrations performed by other authors haberland et al 2015 provenzano et al 2016 in which the r2 values tend to be above those found in the field and regression coefficients reach r2 0 95 as found by matula et al 2016 however it may not reflect the reality found in the field the bland altmann agreement analysis revealed a confidence interval of approximately 0 03 m3 m 3 above or below the actual moisture limits range the region with a minimum of 95 regarding the differences in the averages studied the soil total porosity ranging between 0 36 m3 m 3 nt and 0 39 m3 m 3 mt and mt ds represents 8 1 and 7 5 respectively which is considered low such a result differs from the calibration performed by francisco et al 2014 who performed an effective calibration for the soil studied by using the association analysis 4 3 calibration for each tillage system the values of the determination coefficients found for the different soil tillage systems individually calibrated are in accordance with the findings by haberland et al 2015 with an increased determination coefficient from 0 81 to 0 96 for calibrations according to the soil granulometric fractions paraskevas et al 2012 performed the calibration in layers every 0 30 m and verified an increase in r2 from 0 53 to 0 96 silva da et al 2007 studied the calibration curve for an ultisol and found increased the determination coefficient from 0 93 to 0 99 when establishing the calibration in layers as the soil loses moisture it intensifies the adhesion and adsorption forces of the water molecules together with the mineral particles in addition the larger the surface area the higher the water retention hilhorst et al 2001 therefore soil bulk density and consequently soil porosity have a direct effect on water retention and is one of the most important factors for calibration ramos et al 2014 among the treatments assessed the ct showed higher bd at all depths and a comparison of its calibration equation with the manufacturer s proved it to be the least parallel to the curve and to have the lowest determination coefficient 0 88 in addition higher soil degradation signs were revealed which corroborates its greater revolting promoting a higher variability of volumetric moistures in unstructured soils fares et al 2004 in accordance with the lowest r2 0 88 mt showed the highest determination coefficient r2 0 96 in agreement with the lowest bd found mainly in the superficial layers and greater macroporosity in all the layers assessed the calibration of the diviner 2000 sensor may be linked not only to soil density but also to macroporosity with a direct influence of water movement in the soil matula et al 2016 observed that sandier soils that is with greater macroporosity had higher determination coefficients among the treatments mt not only reached the highest r2 but had the closest curve to the manufacturer s reflecting the higher macroporosity achieved similarly to the manufacturer s curve for sandy soil despite possible variations that may occur with field calibrations because of spatial variability of sampling sites paltineanu and starr 1997 the value of r2 is close to those found by provenzano et al 2016 for laboratory calibration cm showed the highest macroporosity among the treatments assessed macroporosity influences soil water movement due to the presence of large and interconnected pores cerdà 1996 which generates a negative alteration in soil water retention matula et al 2016 found that more compacted soils resulted in less errors rmse as well as values closest to the manufacturer s calibration opposite to the abovementioned study in which the ct curve was not approached by the manufacturer s calibration soil bulk density has a direct effect on the calibration of the diviner 2000 the values found for the determination coefficients of the treatments were inversely proportional to the soil bulk density mt and mt ds showed the highest r2 and the lowest bulk density while the opposite was observed for conventional tillage silva da et al 2007 studied a medium textured soil profile and found that soil density influenced the determination coefficient of the calibration curve thus the new calibration according to the soil tillage system was more representative than soil calibration the same occurred with haberland et al 2015 when assessing a diviner 2000 equipment which proved suitable for moisture measurement andrade junior et al 2007 found the curves obtained with the diviner 2000 to be representative for a yellow latosol in the coastal region of piauí brazil soil structure has a direct effect on soil calibration fares et al 2004 morgan et al 1999 therefore the differences between porosity and soil density presented in soil tillage systems affected soil calibration which made in the practice according to the treatment more effective for grouping variables with values close to the soil tillage systems the importance of macroporosity in the calibration of diviner 2000 equipment should be highlighted as this attribute due to its ability to drain water directly affects the water balance of the crop being one of its most indicator factors especially in rainy seasons ghiberto et al 2011 from the results obtained the calibration by soil tillages was successful obtaining r2 higher than those obtained with the simplified calibration of the soil however it should be noted that this calibration is more laborious and costly than the traditional one requiring more time in cases of limitations in these resources the authors consider that soil calibration can be used since in this case r2 was considered acceptable in relation to other values in the literature it is not recommended to use the device calibration as it is not representative enough for research with this it can be believed that the initial hypothesis of the study was accepted where the calibration by soil tillages was shown to have a higher r2 than that of the simplified soil now it is suggested that further research be carried out with the separation by soil tillages and depths in addition this calibration is valid for only this type of soil therefore studies on other soil textures are necessary another suggestion is that calibration be carried out in different sampling locations as it is now known that the location of the traffic of the machines directly affects soil compaction and with this its physical attributes esteban et al 2020 the innovation of this article for science is the test of a new form of calibration for equipment that has been increasingly used for agriculture due to its ease of use with this new form of calibration more accurate results will be possible possibly influencing even more the differences between the soil management applied in the sugarcane areas which is one of the most important crops in brazil 5 conclusions soil bulk density and porosity had a direct effect on the calibration of diviner 2000 the manufacturer s calibration equation is not valid for soils with high quantities of clay calibration using soil tillage systems as a separation factor increases the determination coefficient in up to 16 in relation to soil calibration based on bland altman s methodology soil calibration without treatment separation proved inadequate founding source this study was

10469,the use of moisture readings by the indirect method has been increasing in recent years such as the use of a frequency domain reflectometry capacitance fdr technology but the use of this

reached up to one meter deep and generated four regression curves one for each soil tillage system with the soil bulk density and macroporosity affecting the diviner 2000 equipment calibration manufacturer s soil calibration proved inadequate based on bland altman s methodology it was used soil tillage systems as separation factor to calibrate the equipment which increased the determination coefficient in 16 in relation to soil calibration soil tillage by modifying the structure of soil physical attributes also affected the calibration of the diviner 2000 equipment proving that in an area where different soil tillages occurs one calibration must take place for each soil tillage keywords diviner 2000 soil water storage soil moisture frequency domain reflectometry fdr 1 introduction soil water content plays an important role in the processes occurring throughout soil profile and can be quantified through different methods among which the most traditional is the gravimetric method zhai et al 2017 however indirect methods have become increasingly frequent for considering other soil attributes and involving facilitated measurement procedures at higher depths fares and alva 2000

ghobari et al 2016 hardie et al 2013 mazahrih et al 2008 described the importance of the probes inserted into the soil for a more accurate irrigation in relation to other types of sensors the authors concluded that the insertion into the ground reduces reading errors and causes minimal disturbance during installation the fdr probe consists of a pair of electrodes functioning as an electronic

not accurate for all soils paltineanu and starr 1997 since the soil water content depends on several factors such as texture and structure in addition to changes in soil density and soil organic matter content influencing the soil capacity to retain water mitchell et al 2015 the equipment influence ranges approximately 0 10 m from the sensor shaft the closer to the tube the greater the equipment sensitivity therefore the correct installation is fundamental to prevent the formation of air bubbles between soil and tube as well as to reduce reading errors for this purpose it is recommended to use field calibrations to achieve a better accuracy regarding water volume in the soil rotimi ojo et al 2015 due to its facility or diviner 2000 equipment it is already being used in

versatility furthermore all these studies are used in depth calibration abdulai et al 2018 but in case of sugar cane the different tillages applied affect differently the physical attributes of the soil oliveira et al 2019 most authors perform single calibrations abdulai et al 2018 or subdivide them in depth with data obtained in the field as indicated by the manufacturer in situations in physically separated locations there are also local calibrations de queiroz et al 2020 but there are no in the article that evaluated by soil tillages for sugarcane therefore the authors decided to test this option but all these studies were performed for unspecified soil tillage calibrations such as by layers it is known that separating the calibration by layer generates higher r2 than using the soil without subdivision provenzano et al 2016 in addition it is now known that soil tillage due to its tillage directly affects soil quality and structure oliveira et al 2019 and other forms of conservationist management such as traffic control esteban et al 2019 affect soil structure in sugarcane areas but no work has studied whether they affect soil calibration in indirect measuring equipment so there is no calibration in the literature for this equipment to assess the soil management used therefore one of the hypotheses of this study is that tillage affects the calibration of the diviner 2000 equipment thus this study aimed to i calibrate a frequency domain reflectometry capacitance probe fdr for a ultisol udult ii evaluate the calibration by bland altman s methodology iii calibrate the equipment for the same soil by applying four different soil tillage systems conventional tillage minimum tillage minimum tillage with deep subsoiling and no tillage iv evaluate whether calibration separated by soil tillage is more effective than without separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area the study was conducted under field conditions at santa fé mill in an experimental area in the municipality of ibitinga sp 21 45 s and 48 49 w at an altitude of 455 m above sea level the region s climate is classified as tropical with dry season aw according to the köppen climate classification alvares et al 2013 with a cold and dry winter as well as a hot and rainy summer mean annual temperature of 23 c and annual precipitation of 1260 mm cepagri 2015 the experimental design contained randomized blocks with three repetitions using sunn hemp crotalaria juncea as a cover plant for the equipment calibration which allowed to isolate the sunn hemp effect on the soil structure since the cover plants affect the soil structure only at the superficial depth the sunn hemp were sown in december 2014 and conducted until april 2015 it was planted in rows by means of a 9 row no till seeder baldan modelo solo grafic 4500 and a valtra tractor model bm 125i 132 hp using 25 kg ha 1 of seeds the desiccation occured by applying a dose of 200 l ha 1 of syrup composed of 6 l ha 1 of glyphosate 70 ml ha 1 of dawn and 1 l ha 1 of mineral oil sugarcane was planted by means of furrowing and in the implantation fertilization 300 kg ha 1 of n p k 10 51 00 was applied in the plots without cover where the conventional tillage was carried out two light harrows took place using a hydraulic 36 disc harrow from baldan and a case mxm 200 hp tractor and furrowing at 0 40 m depth using a valtra bh 180 hp 4 4 tractor and a two row driade furrower in the plots where no tillage only the furrow was carried out the minimum tillage was implemented by means of a mx270 hp 4 4 case tractor and subsoiling at 0 40 m depth with the subsoiler of the stara implement line model asa laser the minimum tillage with deep subsoiling was carried out by subsoiling with an ast matic 550 implement with 5 rods 0 75 m deep with work in the 0 70 m layer using a mx270 hp 4 4 case tractor sugarcane was planted in april 2015 with a variety of ctc 4 sugarcane the stalks were distributed using a john deere 7205 j 205 hp 4 4 tractor and a dmb pcp 6000 chopped cane planter the ctc 4 variety is characterized by having medium late maturation and developing well in production environments from a to c with excellent budding including raw cane each plot consisted of six sugarcane lines of the ctc4 variety with a spacing of 1 5 m and 30 m in length encompassing an area of 300 m2 per parcel we collected the samples from the sugarcane plantation along two years the soil was classified as ultisol udult soil survey staff 1998 and argissolo vermelho according to the brazilian soil classification system santos et al 2018 particle size distribution of the soil was obtained by pipette method according to teixeira et al 2017 and values are shown in table 1 with the separation of sand in coarse and fine using a 0 053 mm mesh sieve after the end of the sugarcane cycle the organic matter content for the treatments was evaluated presented in table 2 with this because there were no differences between the treatments therefore this attribute was considered the same for all calibrations performed 2 2 capacitance probe we used a fdr frequency domain reflectometry probe model diviner 2000 sentek 2001 consisting of a data logger coupled to a probe through a cable to generate readings every 0 10 m every reading is stored in the datalogger for a fixed time 1 s and ranges 120 000 mhz water and 160 000 mhz air depending on the soil water content the equipment must be normalized before performing the measurements because of differences between probes the procedure includes recording the readings inside a pvc tube exposed separately from air and water the data output provided by the datalogger is called scaled frequency sf and is generated using the following eq 1 1 sf fa fs fa fw fa reading of the frequency in the pvc pipe fully suspended in the air fs reading of the frequency in the pvc tube in the soil fw reading of the frequency pvc pipe immersed in the water the process of equipment normalization generated values of fa and fw of 175 69 mhz and 127 33 mhz respectively considering the low accuracy degree in relative frequency readings values sf depending on the soil texture the manufacturer recommends exponential calibrating the equipment used for the relative frequency as well as soil volumetric moisture 2 3 installation of access tubes we used a manufacturer s installation kit to install the calibration tubes in the end of each tube we inserted cutting rings to facilitate the tube penetration into the soil installed perpendicularly to the ground using a level and a rubber hammer at intervals of 0 15 m upon every depth increase the soil contained in the tube was removed using an auger this installation procedure aims at reducing air pockets formation and variations in soil density adjacent to the access tube sentek 2001 after installation each tube was placed 0 04 m above the ground surface and covered with a plastic lid firmly placed on the upper end of the tube in addition to being sealed at the bottom with a rubber ring to avoid moisture inside the barrel which would damage the appliance and cause reading errors 2 4 soil readings and sampling procedure for calibration initially we performed three frequency readings in the 0 00 1 00 m layer and subsequently collected soil to determine the gravimetric moisture θw and soil bulk density bd for each 0 10 m we collected three stainless steel volumetric rings of 0 05 m in diameter and 0 05 m in height later subjected to hermetic packaging for moisture maintenance we weighted and kiln dried the rings in the laboratory 105 c for 48 h we found the gravimetric moisture through the water weight on dry soil weight and eq 2 to reach the volumetric moisture 2 θq θw bd in which θq volumetric moisture m3 m 3 a θ gravimetric moisture kg kg 1 bd soil bulk density kg dm 3 we collected the samples between dry and saturated moisture and carried out the calibration collections in august 2015 and january 2016 after the planting of sugar cane and the initial establishment of the crop between the periods of samples there was no machine traffic in the area and it can be considered that between the collections there were no differences between the physical attributes of the soil the choice for these sampling periods was due to the periods of greater drought and rain respectively thus collecting the points in the extreme moments of water and increasing the reality in the field for the collection of samples in each evaluated period the methodology suggested by the equipment manufacturer was used tubes was installed specifically for the calibration where the frequency emitted by the equipment was measured and after a trench was opened to collect the undisturbed samples with three repetitions every 0 10 m in depth to evaluate each of the frequencies read by the equipment the sampling sites for the calibration were in both collections close with a distance of 5 m between the tubes so that they represented the same location but with a distance to open the collection trenches for the deformed and undeformed samples of soil bulk density and gravimetric water content this is the methodology suggested by the manufacturer 2 5 soil physical attributes soil bulk density bd was obtained by the ratio between dry soil mass and soil sample volume macroporosity was obtained by the difference between water content of the saturated sample total porosity and water content after submitted to tension table at 6 0 kpa while microporosity was obtained from the difference between the water content obtained in 6 kpa and the dry weight of the sample teixeira et al 2017 2 6 data evaluation we assessed the significant differences between the treatments regarding the soil physical attributes of the soil through an analysis of variance anova in split plots upon significance a tukey test at 5 probability was applied we applied bland altman agreement limit aiming at verifying a possible equivalation between moisture values estimated by the probe and the standard method martin bland and altman 1986 3 results soil physical attributes are important when calibrating the diviner 2000 equipment such as soil bulk density and porosity macroporosity and microporosity for enabling to assess how different soil managements affect the structure and consequently calibrations table 3 3 1 soil physical attributes presented by different soil tillage systems we found that the treatments with minimum tillage mt no tillage nt minimum tillage with deep subsoiling mt ds and conventional tillage ct affected the soil physical attributes table 3 soil bulk density bd had no statistical differences between the soil tillage systems but had distinguished values according to depth assessed bd was lower at 0 00 0 05 m than the others such a difference was not regarded as significant considering that our study has readings performed every 0 10 m no significant differences were found in depth which was highly considered when deciding for a different calibration to each soil tillage system considering their distinguished bd and porosity values both the macroporosity and microporosity had an inversely proportional behavior including a reduced macroporosity and increased microporosity in depth table 3 the mt achieved a higher macroporosity value in relation to other tillage systems possibly a result of the bd values 3 2 soil calibration disregarding soil tillage systems fig 1 shows the regression curve obtained through soil calibration regardless of the tillage system according to a comparison between the manufacturer s calibration curve and other studies in the literature morgan et al 1999 and fares et al 2004 assessed clayey and sandy soils respectively and found equations in which the manufacturer underestimates the data for all the assessed moistures fig 1 however provenzano et al 2016 studied several soils with different textures and found an opposite behavior by comparing the curve found through the field calibration and the manufacturer s in which the values were initially underestimated through the equation local calibration was close to the value found by morgan et al 1999 until 0 20 m3 m 3 slightly higher and then lower values were revealed regarding the manufacturer s curve local curve remained high up to a water content of 0 25 m3 m 3 the local curve remained below the calibration range in fares et al 2004 and above the value in andrade junior et al 2007 for all soil water contents the determination coefficient value found for the soil calibration curve was r2 0 82 in accordance to the values found by morgan et al 1999 with r2 0 83 and haberland et al 2015 with r2 0 81 in a medium textured soil the authors found that up to the inflection point the manufacturer s equation values underestimated the water content values in the soil upon exceeding the limit the values started to be underestimate we assessed the manufacturer s calibration equation and the calibration equation for the soil in this study through the bland altman agreement fig 2 by analyzing the agreement between two variables x and y from a scatter plot difference y x between the variables means x y 2 the equation resulting from the graphical response assesses the agreements between the methods using the same data from its bias as differences start in zero in this case the error is the dispersion of the points of differences around the mean outliers and trends mean difference was 0 0006 m3 m 3 and the dots were randomly distributed around the mean having generated unsatisfactory results fig 2 the bland altman agreement revealed lower moisture values with a tendency to underestimate the manufacturer s equation in addition with increased moisture lines intersect 0 30 m3 m 3 and values are overestimated the moisture differences assessment n 42 41 and 59 were below and above the bias respectively 3 3 calibration according to the soil tillage system in order to reach an improved determination coefficient we subdivided the calibration according to the soil tillage system in the experimental area in which higher determination coefficients were generated to calibrate the equipment table 4 the different soil tillage systems individually calibrated increased the determination coefficient r2 in relation to soil calibration fig 3 soil calibration showed a value of r2 of 0 82 considered low when assessing each soil tillage system individually which allowed to reach a value of r2 of 0 96 for mt representing an increase of 20 in relation to soil calibration in addition ct reached a value of 0 88 an increase of 7 3 the mt calibration curve exceeds the manufacturer s in approximately 0 25 m3 m 3 that is it overestimates the values up to this point and subsequently the values are underestimated fig 3 however the values generated are close to the manufacturer s which is considered adequate nt had higher soil water contents in the calibration curve than the manufacturer s until the saturation point fig 3 therefore the manufacturer s soil water content equation underestimates the actual values for this treatment in addition the manufacturer s calibration is not considered adequate mt ds the remaining soil tillage systems assessed generated the calibration curve that approached the manufacturer s the most and despite overestimating the soil moisture values it is considered adequate fig 3 in contrast ct differentiated from the manufacturer s calibration the most and overestimated the soil moisture values thus considered inappropriate 4 discussion 4 1 soil physical attributes variations in soil bulk density modify the volumetric moisture by promoting the variability of soil water mediations hu et al 2008 soil bulk density values should be used when calibrating equipment like tdr and fdr variation in bd or macroporosity ma affects electrical permissiveness and consequently the relative frequency reading through the sensor equipment namdar khojasteh et al 2012 stone and silveira 2001 assessed soil bulk density in a nt area and found an increased soil density in depth for both treatments in addition to having obtained lower depth density values for nt at 0 20 m reduced soil bulk density in the superficial layers resulted from the cultural practices performed according to souza et al 2012 another factor affecting soil bulk density is straw incorporation acting as a damper to the weight of the machine helping to reduce the forces applied in the soil in addition it should be noted that in this study the pé de grade portuguese or harrow foot effect occurred where there is an excessive compaction in the layers in which the harrow passes due to its revolving movement it compacts the lower area of the disc brannstrom and oliveira 2000 for bd values are close to those obtained by ceddia et al 1999 when studying raw sugarcane in a podzólico amarelo at 0 10 m but different ones at 0 10 0 40 m according to vischi filho et al 2015 the increase in size and weight of the machines over the years led the soil to compact and caused higher soil density and lower macroporosity it is known that in areas of sugar cane due to the different levels of soil tillage mainly in the initial phase of the crop there differences between the soil tillages are more visible especially between conventional and no tillage barbosa et al 2019 there is a tendency to reduce the differences over the cycles mainly with the harvester and transshipment traffic which are the implements that cause greater compaction guimarães júnnyor et al 2019 therefore bd is an important attribute that directly influences the calibration of the equipment because it is one of the attributes that can be most differentiated between soil tillages the influence of macroporosity on soil calibration is related to its role in the equipment frequency reading especially for the moisture content close to saturation for the treatments assessed macroporosity had lower depth according to the data verified by ceddia et al 1999 when working with raw sugarcane in the nt system such an effect results from increased clay levels in depth enhancing microporosity over macroporosity macroporosity values are affected by the management applied in the soil especially when comparing the conventional and direct planting considering the different levels of soil tillages the values are in accordance with those found by adalberto castioni et al 2018 for the macroporosity in the superficial layer of the soil 0 00 0 10 m where these values are close to 0 20 m3 m 3 which are the values recommended by the literature microporosity influenced the readings of diviner 2000 for lower moistures cherubin et al 2016 verified increased microporosity in depth but with values higher than those found for the layer 0 00 0 10 m despite being close to its lower layers 0 30 m3 m 3 microporosity values also increased in depth similarly to the findings by everton et al 2016 when working with sugarcane in the first ratoon the lowest microporosity values can be a natural soil density response the effects of compaction compromise soil calibration as they increase density and reduce porosity altering the frequency reading in the device therefore we assessed the calibrations through the soil tillage to enable the analysis of the compaction effects on the equipment calibration 4 2 calibration curve for 0 1 00 m the determination coefficients of the curve obtained proved lower in relation to the laboratory calibrations performed by other authors haberland et al 2015 provenzano et al 2016 in which the r2 values tend to be above those found in the field and regression coefficients reach r2 0 95 as found by matula et al 2016 however it may not reflect the reality found in the field the bland altmann agreement analysis revealed a confidence interval of approximately 0 03 m3 m 3 above or below the actual moisture limits range the region with a minimum of 95 regarding the differences in the averages studied the soil total porosity ranging between 0 36 m3 m 3 nt and 0 39 m3 m 3 mt and mt ds represents 8 1 and 7 5 respectively which is considered low such a result differs from the calibration performed by francisco et al 2014 who performed an effective calibration for the soil studied by using the association analysis 4 3 calibration for each tillage system the values of the determination coefficients found for the different soil tillage systems individually calibrated are in accordance with the findings by haberland et al 2015 with an increased determination coefficient from 0 81 to 0 96 for calibrations according to the soil granulometric fractions paraskevas et al 2012 performed the calibration in layers every 0 30 m and verified an increase in r2 from 0 53 to 0 96 silva da et al 2007 studied the calibration curve for an ultisol and found increased the determination coefficient from 0 93 to 0 99 when establishing the calibration in layers as the soil loses moisture it intensifies the adhesion and adsorption forces of the water molecules together with the mineral particles in addition the larger the surface area the higher the water retention hilhorst et al 2001 therefore soil bulk density and consequently soil porosity have a direct effect on water retention and is one of the most important factors for calibration ramos et al 2014 among the treatments assessed the ct showed higher bd at all depths and a comparison of its calibration equation with the manufacturer s proved it to be the least parallel to the curve and to have the lowest determination coefficient 0 88 in addition higher soil degradation signs were revealed which corroborates its greater revolting promoting a higher variability of volumetric moistures in unstructured soils fares et al 2004 in accordance with the lowest r2 0 88 mt showed the highest determination coefficient r2 0 96 in agreement with the lowest bd found mainly in the superficial layers and greater macroporosity in all the layers assessed the calibration of the diviner 2000 sensor may be linked not only to soil density but also to macroporosity with a direct influence of water movement in the soil matula et al 2016 observed that sandier soils that is with greater macroporosity had higher determination coefficients among the treatments mt not only reached the highest r2 but had the closest curve to the manufacturer s reflecting the higher macroporosity achieved similarly to the manufacturer s curve for sandy soil despite possible variations that may occur with field calibrations because of spatial variability of sampling sites paltineanu and starr 1997 the value of r2 is close to those found by provenzano et al 2016 for laboratory calibration cm showed the highest macroporosity among the treatments assessed macroporosity influences soil water movement due to the presence of large and interconnected pores cerdà 1996 which generates a negative alteration in soil water retention matula et al 2016 found that more compacted soils resulted in less errors rmse as well as values closest to the manufacturer s calibration opposite to the abovementioned study in which the ct curve was not approached by the manufacturer s calibration soil bulk density has a direct effect on the calibration of the diviner 2000 the values found for the determination coefficients of the treatments were inversely proportional to the soil bulk density mt and mt ds showed the highest r2 and the lowest bulk density while the opposite was observed for conventional tillage silva da et al 2007 studied a medium textured soil profile and found that soil density influenced the determination coefficient of the calibration curve thus the new calibration according to the soil tillage system was more representative than soil calibration the same occurred with haberland et al 2015 when assessing a diviner 2000 equipment which proved suitable for moisture measurement andrade junior et al 2007 found the curves obtained with the diviner 2000 to be representative for a yellow latosol in the coastal region of piauí brazil soil structure has a direct effect on soil calibration fares et al 2004 morgan et al 1999 therefore the differences between porosity and soil density presented in soil tillage systems affected soil calibration which made in the practice according to the treatment more effective for grouping variables with values close to the soil tillage systems the importance of macroporosity in the calibration of diviner 2000 equipment should be highlighted as this attribute due to its ability to drain water directly affects the water balance of the crop being one of its most indicator factors especially in rainy seasons ghiberto et al 2011 from the results obtained the calibration by soil tillages was successful obtaining r2 higher than those obtained with the simplified calibration of the soil however it should be noted that this calibration is more laborious and costly than the traditional one requiring more time in cases of limitations in these resources the authors consider that soil calibration can be used since in this case r2 was considered acceptable in relation to other values in the literature it is not recommended to use the device calibration as it is not representative enough for research with this it can be believed that the initial hypothesis of the study was accepted where the calibration by soil tillages was shown to have a higher r2 than that of the simplified soil now it is suggested that further research be carried out with the separation by soil tillages and depths in addition this calibration is valid for only this type of soil therefore studies on other soil textures are necessary another suggestion is that calibration be carried out in different sampling locations as it is now known that the location of the traffic of the machines directly affects soil compaction and with this its physical attributes esteban et al 2020 the innovation of this article for science is the test of a new form of calibration for equipment that has been increasingly used for agriculture due to its ease of use with this new form of calibration more accurate results will be possible possibly influencing even more the differences between the soil management applied in the sugarcane areas which is one of the most important crops in brazil 5 conclusions soil bulk density and porosity had a direct effect on the calibration of diviner 2000 the manufacturer s calibration equation is not valid for soils with high quantities of clay calibration using soil tillage systems as a separation factor increases the determination coefficient in up to 16 in relation to soil calibration based on bland altman s methodology soil calibration without treatment separation proved inadequate founding source this study was
