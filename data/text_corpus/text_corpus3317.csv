16585,algae blooms are of considerable concern in freshwater lakes and reservoirs worldwide in situ chlorophyll a chl a fluorometers are widely used for rapid assessments of algae biomass however accurately converting chl a fluorescence to an equivalent concentration is challenging due to natural variations in the relationship as well as nonphotochemical quenching npq which occurs commonly in surface waters during daytime this study is based on water quality data from a freshwater lake from october 2018 to december 2020 initial analysis of sonde chl a fluorescence and laboratory extracted chl a concentrations shows that the two data sets exhibit a nonlinear relationship with positive correlation and significant errors a bias correction method was next developed based on 1 concurrent sonde measurements of other water quality parameters to account for nonlinearities and 2 a bias correction approach for nonphotochemical quenching effects in surface waters the new chl a model exhibits much improved accuracy with a root mean square error rmse less than 0 95 µg l the new method facilitates accurate chl a characterization in freshwater lakes and reservoirs based on readily obtainable in situ fluorescence sonde measurements graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lakes chlorophyll a fluorescence multi parameter sonde nonphotochemical quenching 1 introduction freshwater lakes are natural habitats for a rich diversity of plants and animals and also provide important societal services including municipal industrial and agricultural water supply prime shoreline residential development opportunities and recreational boating and fishing societal services however often engender excess wastes and nutrients which if not effectively managed may overwhelm the lake assimilative capacity and lead to eutrophication problems advanced lake eutrophication increases the frequency and severity of algae blooms which have been known worldwide to elevate lake turbidity can produce toxins harmful to animals and humans lower dissolved oxygen levels and cause fish kills paerl and huisman 2008 smith 2003 chlorophyll a chl a is the major photosynthetic pigment in algae and it is used most widely as a proxy algae biomass indicator to assess lake trophic status and algal bloom extent and severity usepa 2000 conventional laboratory chl a determination involves field collection of water samples filtration extraction into an organic solvent and finally quantification by spectrophotometry lorenzen 1967 richards and thompson 1958 fluorometry arar and collins 1997 holm hansen et al 1965 or chromatography jacobson 1978 this process can provide reliable chl a estimates but it is time consuming and costly and requires experienced analysts to produce consistent and accurate results because of these requirements it cannot support continuous lake monitoring for acquisition of high resolution spatial and temporal data in situ fluorometers were introduced by lorenzen 1966 and have widely been used since then as a rapid and less costly chl a monitoring alternative to the conventional approach fluorescence chl a sensors probes are designed for field deployment and are typically part of multi parameter instruments sondes equipped to concurrently measure other water quality parameters including temperature dissolved oxygen ph turbidity specific conductivity and possibly others field measurements can quickly be made and inspected in real time at multiple water depths and or sites and automatically transferred to electronic databases for visualization and analysis notwithstanding the tangible advantages of the fluorometer technology it also has shortcomings that need to be addressed specifically the conversion accuracy of raw fluorescence measurements to equivalent chl a concentrations is impacted by environmental and biological factors such as light intensity temperature variation nutrient status and phytoplankton species composition falkowski and kiefer 1985 kiefer 1973 introducing measurement biases manufacturer fluorometer calibration is based on either pure chl a or experimental water samples that generally differ in chl a concentrations and or phytoplankton assemblages from the actual environments being monitored for this reason laboratory extracted chl a estimates from water samples at the monitored sites are typically employed to correct these biases through correlation analysis the success of this approach varies across instrument manufacturers consistent relationships have been reported in some studies using the fluoroprobe bbe moldaenke kiel germany or its online version the algae online analyzer catherine et al 2012 gregor et al 2005 gregor and maršálek 2004 izydorczyk et al 2009 whereas in samples dominated by different algae species linear relationships were found to be sample specific gregor et al 2005 relatively weaker correlations were found for the ysi exo2 sonde yellow springs instrument co inc oh usa which exhibited time dependent bowling et al 2016 chaffin et al 2018 and site specific zolfaghari et al 2020 relationships to circumvent such biases alternative methods for estimating chl a concentrations from fluorometers have been proposed based on the shape of fluorescence profiles mignot et al 2011 sauzède et al 2015 simultaneous measured irradiance profile xing et al 2011 or satellite derived chl a concentrations boss et al 2008 lavigne et al 2012 however these methods require either auxiliary measurements not commonly available in freshwater lakes or on conditions not always met another fluorometer bias is related to algal nonphotochemical quenching npq which commonly occurs in surface waters during daytime and manifests as a noticeable fluorescence reduction biermann et al 2015 falkowski and kolber 1995 o holm hansen et al 2000 lucius et al 2020 rousso et al 2021 serra et al 2009 thomalla et al 2018 xing et al 2012 phytoplankton generally receive excess sunlight than the amount which can be used for photosynthesis under high light intensity conditions because the excess sunlight can cause photooxidative damage phytoplankton has developed different mechanisms to regulate the absorption and utilization of light energy npq is a series of mechanisms employed by photosynthetic organisms to effectively dissipate excess energy that has already been absorbed as heat müller et al 2001 npq has three major components based on different relaxation kinetics 1 energy dependent quenching qe which is the predominant and most rapid component in most algae and plants relaxes within seconds to minutes and quenches chl a fluorescence by up 90 huot and babin 2010 2 state transition quenching qt which relaxes within tens of minutes and reduces chl a fluorescence by decoupling the light harvesting complex from photosystem ii and 3 photoinhibitory quenching qi which is related to photoinhibitory damage of photosystem ii and relaxes within hours the magnitude of npq can be influenced by many factors such as surface light intensity browning et al 2014 phytoplankton composition harrison et al 2018 and nutrient limitation all npq processes reduce the chl a fluorescence yield which can result in appreciable underestimation of phytoplankton biomass nighttime measurements are free of npq effects but they are inconvenient and much less common than daytime measurements thus correcting daytime fluorescence measurements for npq is critical for reliable and unbiased chl a fluorometer assessments several correction methods have been proposed including the use of photosynthetically active radiation par or other auxiliary information biermann et al 2015 o holm hansen et al 2000 moiseeva et al 2019 xing et al 2018 optical backscattering hemsley et al 2015 sackmann et al 2008 swart et al 2015 thomalla et al 2018 pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry harrison et al 2018 moiseeva et al 2019 concurrently collected environmental sensor data lucius et al 2020 or mixed layer depth mld these approaches however were either developed for ocean waters or require additional synchronous measurements not typically available in most lake studies the objective of this study is to develop a bias correction method suitable for chl a fluorometer data commonly obtained in freshwater lakes and reservoirs specifically the study aims to 1 evaluate how sonde chl a data correlate with corresponding laboratory extracted chl a concentrations 2 improve chl a estimation accuracy by making use of both sonde chl a and other sonde measured water quality data and 3 introduce and evaluate an npq bias correction approach for surface waters the study uses data collected by a ysi exo2 sonde but the approach is general and applicable to data from other instruments 2 material and methods 2 1 study site this study uses data from lake lanier a large freshwater reservoir in north georgia usa with a surface area of 150 km2 an average depth of 18 3 m and a maximum depth of 48 8 m near the outlet the lake is impounded by buford dam is fed by the chattahoochee and chestatee rivers and has a total storage of approximately 2 4 109 m3 at normal pool elevation 326 4 m lake lanier serves multiple water uses including hydropower generation flood control recreation wildlife management and water supply for metro atlanta the lake is monomictic stratifying from april to october and becoming fully mixed in the rest of year the trophic status of lake lanier is distinctly different in its southern versus its northern regions the southern lake region has higher transparency and lower nutrient concentrations than its northern region water quality data collected during 2018 2019 and 2020 showed that the secchi depth varied from 1 5 to 4 2 m in the south versus 1 to 2 m in the north and the photic zone chl a growing season average ranged from 6 to 7 µg l in the south versus 7 to 12 µg l in the north according to the lake classification by nürnberg 1996 these and other data suggest that lake lanier is mesotrophic in the south becoming eutrophic in the north furthermore according to the gwinnett daily post 2020 chl a exhibited a 20 year record high in the summer of 2019 and reported that the 2019 growing season april to october chl a increased by 3 72 μg l compared to its value in 2018 this was notable because the average increase in the preceding 20 years was only 0 17 μg l per year the chl a spike in 2019 was alarming in that it exceeded the current regulatory standard and highlighted the need for a more comprehensive and reliable chl a monitoring program to support effective lake water quality management 2 2 in situ monitoring and sampling comprehensive in situ monitoring and sampling campaigns were carried out from october 2018 to december 2020 including a in situ water quality measurements using the ysi exo2 multi parameter sonde and b field water sampling and subsequent laboratory analysis for chl a and other water quality parameters 2 2 1 in situ monitoring scheme in situ monitoring was carried out using the ysi exo2 multi parameter sonde the sonde was equipped with several sensors measuring temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen turbidity ph fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom chl a and phycocyanin blue green algae or bga all sensors were re calibrated every two to three months following the exo2 manual instructions the total algae sensor chl a and bga was calibrated for relative fluorescence units rfu using a rhodamine standard regular monthly monitoring activities were performed at four pilot coves near buford dam these included the old control cove occ new control cove ncc cove 2 c2 and cove 3 c3 the shoreline areas of pilot coves occ and ncc are fairly pristine while those of coves c2 and c3 feature dense residential developments additional sites in the southern and northern regions of lake lanier fig 1 were monitored since june 2020 expanding the geographic scope of the monitoring program table s1 shows the information of all monitoring sites and dates in each of the four pilot coves 18 locations were consistently monitored depending on the topography and bathymetry of the lake the exact latitude longitude coordinates of these locations were determined in situ using a garmin gpsmap 64st at each location depth wise sonde measurements were taken along the water column at depths spaced every 0 5 m from 0 5 m below the water surface to 0 5 m above the lake bottom at the additional sites monitoring was carried out at depths spaced every 1 m the sonde was deployed manually from a boat at each monitoring depth and a 40 s dwell time was allowed to stabilize sensor readings before data were recorded data recording took place continuously for 10 to 15 s to reduce measurement noise at each pilot cove each monitoring day involved 250 sonde measurements encompassing all locations and depths and required approximately 7 8 h to complete the monitoring order of each location and depth at each cove was consistently the same during all field campaigns throughout 2018 2020 2 2 2 field sampling and laboratory analysis in each pilot cove regular monthly water sampling was undertaken in one location but at multiple depths green dots in fig 1 as the total number of water samples was limited by laboratory capacity several additional samples were taken from sites across the northern region on july 15 2020 for model validation purposes the corresponding sampled depths at each location table s2 were determined based on typical summer temperature profiles which delineate the lake epilimnion thermocline and hypolimnion regions samples were taken with a relatively small depth spacing in the top 3 m 0 5 m and around the epilimnion thermocline and thermocline hypolimnion transition regions 1 meter and with a larger spacing 2 m in other parts of the water column the same depths were sampled during the cold season november to march when the lake is fully mixed and during the stratification season april to october water samples were collected using a 12 volt tornado plastic pump proactive environmental products florida usa the pump was tightly tied to the exo2 sonde with the filter screen being at the same position as the sensors front to ensure that water samples and sonde measurements were as spatially and temporally consistent as possible after dropping the bundled pump and sonde to each desired depth a 40 s dwell time was allowed not only for the sonde readings to stabilize before sampling but also for rinsing the pump tube to avoid potential contamination from residual water in the tube samples for chl a analysis were contained in 1 l opaque nalgene bottles and samples for other water quality parameters in 1 l white nalgene bottles grabbed water samples were immediately placed in an ice filled cooler and delivered to the laboratory water samples were analyzed for chl a at the water quality lab of gwinnett county s department of water resources following the epa 445 0 non acidification method arar and collins 1997 filters were manually grounded with glass rods and sonicated in a waterbath at 4 c for 20 min instead of mechanical grinding with a teflon tissue grinder following an environmental protection division epd approved modification a shimadzu rf 6000 spectrofluorometer with excitation emission bandwidth of 436 nm 680 nm was used for the analysis in addition duplicates were also run on the turner trilogy fluorometer to cross check the settings on the spectrofluorometer 2 3 data pre processing sonde measured data at each monitoring location were downloaded from the korexo software into excel files for each depth the average of each measured parameter over the recording time interval was computed for use in subsequent data analysis among all sonde measured parameters chl a bga and fdom fluorescence exhibit significant temperature dependence temperature compensation for these three parameters is necessary if the site temperature is significantly different from the calibration temperature ysi incorporated 2009 to investigate this dependence in addition to the samples for routine water quality analysis an extra 17 and 15 samples were collected in 2019 and 2020 respectively these samples were collected from the pilot coves at depths where chl a fluorescence was relatively high these extra samples were also immediately placed in an ice filled cooler until the time they were analyzed sample analysis was conducted in a dark room with temperature around 25 c and included the following steps first the sonde calibration cup was filled with the water sample and screwed tightly to the sonde to ensure no oxygen exchange with the ambient air occurred during the analysis then the water sample was left to warm up naturally from its initial temperature 4 c to room temperature during which sonde measurements were collected continuously at 1 s intervals over a period of 3 to 5 h sonde measurement of chl a bga fdom and temperature continued until the temperature of the water sample equalized with the room temperature linear regression analysis was next used to characterize the response of the chl a bga and fdom fluorescence to temperature variation in the range 10 to 25 c which is representative of the annual lake water temperature variation the required correction was consistent with the findings of watras et al 2017 and employed a linear function for all three parameters 1 x c x m 1 α x t m t c where x is the parameter being measured i e chl a bga or fdom fluorescence and subscripts c and m denote the corrected and measured values respectively t m is the measured water temperature and t c can be any reference temperature theoretically but in this study t c refers to the temperature of standard regents during the sensor calibration process coefficient α x is for temperature correction of parameter x and was estimated via linear regression of sonde fluorescence and temperature as the ratio of the slope and intercept specifically the computed annual temperature correction coefficients for chl a bga and fdom are 0 008 0 033 0 006 in 2019 and 0 019 0 041 0 008 in 2020 respectively the values of the coefficients in 2018 are assumed to be the same as in 2019 all sonde measured chl a bga and fdom fluorescence were corrected for temperature before model development 2 4 model development the chl a model was developed in stages guided by a error analysis b source attribution and c model complexity versus accuracy considerations 2 4 1 laboratory extracted chl a versus sonde chl a fluorescence we first evaluated the accuracy of estimating chl a concentrations laboratory extracted from sonde chl a measurements a linear regression model was developed for all data pairs of laboratory extracted and sonde measured chl a concentrations collected during 2018 and 2020 to test whether potential interannual variations of this relationships may exist we also developed three separate linear regression models for the sonde lab data pairs in different years 2 4 2 value of other synchronous sonde measured parameters next we investigated whether other synchronous sonde measurements in addition to sonde chl a could be used to improve model estimation accuracy at this stage we considered all sonde measured parameters as potential explanatory variables including sonde chl a rfu bga rfu temperature c conductivity µs cm do mg l turbidity fnu ph and fdom rfu in addition the squared and cubed sonde chl a measurements were added to the list to account for underlying nonlinearities depending on the combination of explanatory variables all possible multivariate regression models were calibrated using 236 data samples from 2018 to 2019 and validated using 240 data samples from 2020 the best performing model was then selected based on the criteria outlined in subsection 2 5 which aim to balance model accuracy with model parsimony 2 4 3 correction of npq biases in surface waters since all samples were taken approximately between 9 am and 5 pm on each monitoring day we suspected that sonde chl a fluorescence measurements in the upper part of water column were impacted by npq to assess the presence of npq impacts we first compared vertical profiles of sonde chl a fluorescence and corresponding lab extracted chl a concentrations this comparison provided convincing evidence of npq impacts and motivated the development of a procedure to i determine the depth to which npq biases existed and ii correct all sonde measurements above that depth this procedure is outlined below 1 compute the vertical change rate of the measured dissolved oxygen mg l m at each depth throughout the profile from the first measured depth 0 5 m below the surface to the last measured depth 0 5 m above the bottom 2 starting from the measurement depth nearest the surface search downward for the first depth where the oxygen change rate becomes higher than 0 2 mg l m denote and refer to this depth as the oxygen mixed layer depth omld 3 scan all chl a fluorescence measurements between the surface and omld and locate the first chl a fluorescence maximum which is strictly equal to or greater than the chl a measurements in the next 1 m depth denote and refer to this depth as the maximum fluorescence depth mfd and consider the chl a fluorescence measurement at the mfd as the true chl a fluorescence in the water column above the mfd to the surface 4 for all depths above the mfd correct the raw sonde chl a fluorescence measurements using the chl a fluorescence value measured at mfd step 3 the assumptions underlying this npq bias correction procedure are that a the chl a concentration can be considered uniform in the layer where dissolved oxygen balance is constant b the depression of fluorescence in this oxygen mixed layer is only due to npq effect and c npq does not affect the chl a measurements below the mfd the rationale of these assumptions is further discussed and validated in the supplementary material page 4 and fig s1 2 4 4 validation of npq correction approach after determining the depth affected by npq effects the data set was further classified as quenched and unquenched groups in the calibration and validation data set respectively the multivariate nonlinear regression model was then calibrated on the unquenched data from 2018 to 2019 and validated on the unquenched data from 2020 chl a concentrations for the quenched group were estimated by estimating chl a at the mfd of each location using the multivariate nonlinear model with both npq corrected and uncorrected sonde chl a fluorescence lastly to validate the npq correction method we compared estimated chl a concentrations with lab extracted chl a concentrations for all sampling periods 2 5 model selection the best performing model was selected based on the corrected akaike information criterion aicc according to hurvich 1989 2 a i c c i n l n σ i 2 2 k i n n k i 1 where i is the i t h model among all candidate models n is the number of data points used in the estimation of model parameters σ i 2 is the variance of the residuals estimated from the data set and k i is the total number of estimated parameters of the i t h model including the intercept and σ i 2 the model selection process was as follows a compute the aicc value for each candidate model b rank all candidate models based on their aicc values in ascending order and select the model with the smallest aicc value 2 6 model performance assessment all statistical analyses were performed using matlab r2020a a visualization of sample data distribution was provided by box plots adjusted coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean percent error mpe and mean absolute percent error mape were employed to assess model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of sonde measurements and laboratory chl a estimates a summary of monthly sonde measurements and lab extracted chl a concentration estimates during october 2018 to december 2020 is shown as box plots fig 2 in general all water quality parameters exhibit similar seasonal patterns but high interannual variability based on measured temperature profiles lake lanier is typically well mixed during november to march and stratified during the rest of each year water temperature ranged approximately between 10 c and 31 c during the entire sampling periods although in 2020 it was slightly lower by 1 to 3 c at each corresponding location and time of year the water temperature in may 2019 reached a value that was approximately 1 4 times higher than that in may 2020 do ranged approximately between 8 and 10 mg l in the well mixed periods and anoxia in the hypolimnion occurred during july to october in the past two years the notable difference is that do profiles exhibited a large bulge within the thermocline in may 2019 but not in 2020 fig s2 conductivity was overall higher in 2020 but fdom was higher in 2019 relatively low bga levels were measured during past two years although bga was slightly higher in 2019 higher turbidity was measured among pilot coves in 2019 than 2020 whereas in 2020 lake lanier was more turbid in the northern region as indicated by the many outliers outside the 2020 boxplot ph levels responded similarly in the past two years except that high alkaline readings ph 9 were observed within the thermocline in may 2019 fig s2 both the sonde chl a fluorescence and lab extracted chl a exhibited similar seasonal patterns in the past two years chl a was lower during november to march grew rapidly in late spring and subsided in the summer before increasing again in the fall overall chl a was relatively higher in 2019 than in 2020 with the highest chl a concentration of 19 13 µg l recorded within the metalimnion in may 2019 a deep chlorophyll maximum dcm which generally occurs in mesotrophic to oligotrophic water bodies scofield et al 2020 was widely observed in lake lanier during stratified seasons the algae bloom in may 2019 was attributed to a significant temperature increase of nearly 15 c from april to may and high light and nutrient inputs intense photosynthetic activity produced excessive do observed as a do bulge and consumed co2 in the metalimnion the ph increased due to reduction of the dissolved carbonic acid h2co3 and the concomitant increase of bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 ² the monitoring results exhibit high spatial and temporal variability corroborating the need for frequent monitoring to detect potential pollution events such as short lived algae blooms and to quantify short and long term ecosystem changes for lake management marcé et al 2016 sonde chl a fluorescence measurements can be used to characterize the overall trend in phytoplankton biomass however to assess compliance to site specific chl a concentration standards it is crucial that the sonde chl a fluorescence be accurately converted to actual chl a concentrations moreover the coincidence of high chl a with elevated temperature do and ph suggests that all these sonde measured parameters may be useful in the reliable estimation of chl a 3 2 relationships of sonde chl a fluorescence and laboratory extracted chl a estimates comparison between sonde chl a fluorescence as rfu and lab extracted chl a concentrations as µg l of all collected samples is shown in fig 3 a a fairly strong relationship exists between the sonde chl a fluorescence and the lab extracted concentration explaining 72 of the data variation comparable to that reported by o holm hansen et al 2000 however the deviations of estimated chl a concentrations from lab extracted chl a concentrations vary over a wide range from 7 28 µg l to 6 74 µg l mean percent error mpe mean absolute percent error mape and root mean square error rmse is more than 16 32 and 1 5 µg l respectively table 1 significant overestimation is shown around both low fluorescence 0 5 rfu and high fluorescence 3 rfu and a number of intermediate samples are underestimated as seen by the large data scatter above the regression line in fig 3a this suggests that the relationship between sonde chl a fluorescence and lab concentration is not homogeneous across samples slightly better relationships were found when the data set was separated into three subsets corresponding to the sampled years the errors in these relationships ranged from 2 58 µg l to 1 20 µg l for 2018 6 97 µg l to 3 72 µg l for 2019 and 5 15 µg l to 4 07 µg l for 2020 respectively fig 3b table 1 comparing the model performance year by year 2019 exhibits the highest mpe mape and rmse while 2018 the lowest different model performance in different years can be attributed to varied magnitudes of algae abundance and complexities of species composition in different sampling periods bowling et al 2016 specifically the data variation in 2018 is relatively small because the sampling program started in october with samples taken only in late october and middle december 2018 when the lake was fully mixed in the sampled locations in 2019 the samples were collected in all seasons resulting in high variance in both algae abundance levels and species diversity this is also the case in 2020 except no fluorescence of higher than 3 rfu was observed which can also explain the higher model accuracy in 2020 in addition the relationship exhibited significant interannual variability as seen by the slope and intercept change from year to year and a fair amount of horizontal scatter in the data distribution these results suggest that using sonde chl a fluorescence as a single explanatory variable to estimate equivalent lab extracted chl a concentration is unreliable as also reported by bowling et al 2016 there is thus a need to explore other modeling options to reduce the chl a estimation biases and errors 3 3 reduction of chl a estimation bias by other sonde measured parameters fig 4 a shows the calibration results of a multivariate nonlinear regression model based on the sonde chl a fluorescence and other sonde measured parameters during 2018 to 2019 clearly the multivariate nonlinear model outperforms the single predictor models this model explains up to 89 of chl a variance and the rmse is also reduced to less than 1 µg l however estimation errors range from 4 47 µg l to 3 80 µg l table 1 indicating that significant overestimation and underestimation of actual concentration values still exists the best performing model selected by aicc by the procedure described in subsection 2 4 contains seven explanatory variables sonde chl a fluorescence bga conductivity ph temperature turbidity and sonde chl a2 sonde chl a fluorescence temperature ph and sonde chl a2 are four most important variables p 0 0001 with conductivity turbidity and bga respectively having p values of 0 0525 0 0391 and 0 0201 table 2 validation of this model with 2020 data resulted in a larger rmse of 1 22 µg l and overestimation mpe 23 40 of the lab chl a concentration compared to the calibration data set fig 4b table 1 sonde chl a fluorescence is the most informative variable in the estimation of chl a concentration however these results also highlight that synchronously measured water quality data have an ability to reduce the chl a estimation bias from the single sonde chl a fluorescence one of the most noticeable parameters is the temperature which has been known as one of the primary factors light water temperature and nutrients availability to affect phytoplankton growth bouffard et al 2018 ph has a positive impact on chl a concentration which was also reported by wallace et al 2016 sonde chl a2 is selected as an important explanatory variable which indicates that intrinsic nonlinearities exist in the algae fluorescence response namely the phytoplankton response to light changes in ways that are not strictly proportional to the phytoplankton biomass density gregor and maršálek 2004 lorenzen 1966 thus the improvement of chl a estimation accuracy by the use of other sonde measured parameters partially stems from the inherent interactions between the water chemical environment and phytoplankton growth 3 4 further reduction of chl a estimation uncertainty and bias through npq correction comparison of the observed sonde chl a fluorescence profiles versus lab extracted chl a profiles shows that to varying degrees all measured sonde chl a fluorescence profiles are subjected to depression near the water surface see also falkowski and kolber 1995 gregor and maršálek 2004 o holm hansen et al 2000 lucius et al 2020 serra et al 2009 xing et al 2012 as noted all monitoring events were carried out during daytime hours next we analyzed the observed profile patterns of four measured variables sonde chl a fluorescence lab extracted chl a do and temperature in relation to the locations of the oxygen mixed layer depth omld and the maximum fluorescence depth mfd interestingly this analysis showed that all profiles at all locations and all observation times fall into one of three characteristic patterns fig 5 presents these three characteristic profile patterns together with the omld and mfd determined as described in subsection 2 4 panel a shows typical profiles of the first characteristic pattern measured on june 5 2019 in c3 this profile pattern has the following common features a the mfd and omld coincide b sonde chl a fluorescence gradually increases from the surface to 8 9 m where a deep chlorophyll maximum dcm develops and subsequently declines sharply c below the mfd both chl a fluorescence and lab chl a increase and d above the mfd lab chl a slightly increases toward the surface while sonde chl a fluorescence slightly decreases panel b depicts typical profiles of the second characteristic pattern measured on september 4 2019 in c2 the common features of this profile pattern include a mfd is located at a shallower depth than omld b lab chl a is nearly constant from the surface to 9 m depth and c sonde chl a fluorescence experiences a marked decline from mfd to the surface panel c depicts profiles of the third characteristic pattern measured on january 8 2020 in c2 this profile pattern is characterized by the following features a the omld is not located within the water column and may be assumed to be at an infinite depth b all measured variables are fairly uniform throughout the water column and c a pronounced depression occurs in the sonde chl a fluorescence above the mfd the fact that all measured profiles of our entire monitoring program fall into one of the above patterns provides assurance that our classification system based on the relative depths of mfd and omld captures an inherent phytoplankton response to the water chemical environment on this basis our npq correction approach consists of 1 identifying the underlying profile pattern type based on the four indicator variables the mfd and the omld for each of the 186 samples in 2018 2019 and 139 samples in 2020 2 estimate the chl a at mfd using the best performing model for unquenched measurements and 3 assume that from mfd to the water surface chl a has the same concentration as at mfd 3 4 1 model calibration and validation on unquenched data a multivariate nonlinear regression model for estimating chl a concentration was firstly calibrated on unquenched samples during 2018 to 2019 and exhibited the performance shown in fig 6 a and table 1 compared to the model calibrated on both quenched and unquenched data the adjusted r2 improved considerably from 0 89 to 0 95 and the rmse and mpe decreased by 0 23 µg l and 1 60 respectively the estimation error range decreased to 2 81 2 37 µg l and the error distribution fig s3a shows that the estimation is unbiased the optimal model selected by aicc includes six predictors sonde chl a fluorescence bga temperature fdom sonde chl a 2 and sonde chl a 3 based on their p values sonde chl a fluorescence temperature and sonde chl a 2 are three important explanatory variables regardless of whether the model is calibrated on quenched or unquenched data table 2 bga is again selected with a positive coefficient the likely reason for this is that cyanobacteria also contain chl a which can be detected by the laboratory fluorometer after extraction moreover the exo2 total algae sensor measures chl a in phytoplankton and phycocyanin in cyanobacteria providing a total algae biomass reading lastly this model includes fdom and sonde chl a 3 rather than conductivity ph and turbidity to account for fdom fluorescence interference and nonlinearity respectively for validation the model was employed to estimate the chl a concentrations for unquenched samples in 2020 fig 6b shows the comparison between estimated chl a concentrations and lab extracted concentrations the model exhibited high predictive accuracy r2 94 and rmse 0 76 µg l mpe 1 04 and mape 14 41 comparable to the calibration statistics table 1 the error distribution fig s3b indicates that the estimation is unbiased these results indicate that the quenched chl a fluorescence data can bias the chl a estimation procedures a common strategy used in the past to avoid the npq effects is to use night measurements for instance serra et al 2009 linearly correlated the night fluorescence measurement with high performance liquid chromatography hplc data however nighttime measurements are not practical because a fluorescence data is difficult to collect without autonomous sensor platforms lucius et al 2020 and b collecting paired lab samples at night time is costly an alternative but not quite equivalent strategy is to work only with daytime measurements taken deep enough to be free of npq effects in this regard two general methods have been used to determine the depth below which npq effects can be considered negligible the first method type is based on photosynthetic available radiation par o holm hansen et al 2000 developed different algorithms to estimate chl a based on fluorescence and photosynthetic par measurements and determined that the threshold par value for the quenching of chl a fluorescence is 40 μ mol m 1 s 1 xing et al 2018 found that the optimal npq light threshold instantaneous photosynthetically available radiation ipar is 15 μ mol m 1 s 1 thomalla et al 2018 determined the quenching depth as the shallowest minimum of the difference between mean night and day fluorescence within the euphotic zone par 1 of the surface value the unavoidable limitation of these methods however is that they additionally require par and possibly nighttime fluorescence measurements not commonly monitored in freshwater lakes the second method type utilizes the mixed layer depth mld xing et al 2012 proposed that the depth of daytime fluorescence maximum within the mld is a good indicator of the depth down to which quenching is significant the mld is determined as the depth where the density differs from the density at 15 m by more than 0 03 kg m 3 biermann et al 2015 suggested the same indicator maximum daytime fluorescence but within the euphotic zone the mld approach does not require additional information than typically available and has practical promise however it has been developed for ocean waters and it is not directly applicable to freshwater lakes where the mld is not typically determined based on density differences furthermore the existing mld estimation methods are inconsistent gray et al 2020 a lake s mld refers to the depth above which water temperature is uniform sverdrup 1953 and its correct estimation is important because it influences the outcomes of various physical chemical and biological lake processes in this study we adopted the general mld concept but investigated ways to determine the quenching depth using typical sonde measurements in freshwater lakes we found that the vertical gradient of the dissolved oxygen is a reliable mld indicator this can be attributed to the fact that oxygen variation is primarily controlled by phytoplankton metabolism and small vertical changes in oxygen concentration imply relatively uniform phytoplankton biomass distribution within the oxygen mixed layer so defined we used the depth of maximum daytime fluorescence to delineate the surface water layer impacted by quenching 3 4 2 validation of npq correction method the proposed npq correction method was validated on the quenched samples for all sampling periods chl a concentrations at depths affected by quenching were predicted by the model calibrated in subsection 3 4 1 using both uncorrected and corrected fluorescence comparisons between the predicted and lab extracted chl a concentrations are shown in fig 7 for different sampling periods the paired estimated chl a vertical profile and lab extracted concentration at discrete depths for sampled locations in 2020 can also be found in the supplement material fig 7 and table 1 show that estimated chl a concentrations using uncorrected fluorescence are biased on the low side with mpe being 31 94 in 2018 2019 and 22 60 in 2020 respectively after applying the quenching correction mpe becomes 2 00 in 2018 2019 and 8 45 in 2020 the rmse is reduced from 1 44 µg l to 0 80 µg l in 2018 2019 and from 1 35 µg l to 0 94 µg l in 2020 the mape is reduced from 35 23 to 15 51 in 2018 2019 and from 29 51 to 17 27 in 2020 the error distributions fig s4 show that systematic biases have been removed overall the results show that if not accounted for npq can cause large biases in estimating chl a concentration from sonde data this is particularly important in estimating chl a concentration in the euphotic zone which is prone to npq interference in lake lanier and many other lakes the regulatory standard requires that the average monthly mid channel chl a concentration in the euphotic zone not exceed a certain threshold more than once in a five year period the average concentration is obtained by compositing chl a readings taken over the photic zone at 1 m depth spacings the average chl a concentration is typically based on laboratory analysis of composite water samples but this effort is time consuming costly and limited to a few lake locations in situ fluorometers provide a more efficient inexpensive and reliable alternative but if not corrected for npq effects they may lead to erroneous findings and undermine regulatory compliance a number of npq correction methods have been developed for ocean waters biermann et al 2015 falkowski and kolber 1995 hemsley et al 2015 o holm hansen et al 2000 lavigne et al 2012 sackmann et al 2008 swart et al 2015 thomalla et al 2018 xing et al 2012 2018 but very few for freshwater lakes and reservoirs lucius et al 2020 moiseeva et al 2019 serra et al 2009 hemsley et al 2015 corrected the npq for day fluorescence profiles from ocean gliders using a linear relationship between night fluorescence and optical backscattering specifically they substituted the day measured optical backscattering into the regression equation to compute the fluorescence corrected within the euphotic zone however the required optical backscattering is not commonly measured in freshwater lakes and reservoirs xing et al 2012 assumed the vertical distribution of phytoplankton is uniform within the mixed layer and corrected the npq by extrapolating the fluorescence maximum toward the surface in southern ocean the mld determination in xing et al 2012 is not applicable in freshwater lakes lucius et al 2020 in follow up work xing et al 2018 improved their npq correction approach by incorporating synchronous irradiance profiles and using an empirical sigmoid function of par for depths below mld par profiles however are not typically available in lake investigations serra et al 2009 tested two in situ fluorometers in a freshwater reservoir under different light intensities and proposed npq correction equations for the water layers receiving high light irradiances the correction equations are based on the relationship between par and the difference between the in vitro and in vivo chl a concentrations similar to other par based methods this approach does not lend itself to typical freshwater lake investigations especially operationally moiseeva et al 2019 compensated the npq effects using the relationship derived between the percentage of open reaction center in photosystem ii and par in a freshwater lake however both par profiles and pulse amplitude modulation pam fluorescence parameters are not always available more recently lucius et al 2020 proposed a correction method for an oligotrophic lake using machine learning techniques random forest regression model the percent reduction of fluorescence is the output variable which was quantified by the percent difference between day fluorescence and the mean of night fluorescence input variables include raw fluorescence total solar radiation depth numerical month of the year water temperature 1 h rolling average of total radiation do saturation and solar azimuth angle while this approach is shown to be effective in the study it has conceptual and numerical issues one is the assumption that algae biomass remains essentially stationary in the water column during day and night however phytoplankton is known to rise and fall depending on solar heating internal waves and convection serra et al 2007 a second issue is the need for fairly large datasets which can take years to develop the npq correction method proposed in this study consists of a delineating the oxygen mixed layer b finding the maximum fluorescence depth mfd within this layer and c replacing the sonde fluorescence measurements above the mfd with the fluorescence measurement at the mfd this adjustment is based on commonly monitored water quality measurements and it is easily deployable operationally 3 5 model performance summary the overall bias correction procedure developed in this study combines the procedures for the correction of biases originating from various identified sources the overall procedure was cross validated and was shown to achieve a effective removal of all identified biases b high chl a estimation accuracy with a root mean square error of less than 1 µg l specifically fig 8 summarizes the performance of the bias correction procedure in comparison to the raw relationship between model estimated chl a concentration μg l using only sonde measured rfu and lab extracted chl a concentration μg l panel a panels b and c respectively correspond to chl a estimates at deep and shallow water depths demarcated by mfd the depth of maximum fluorescence this comparison shows that the bias correction procedure leads to substantially improved chl a estimates with the determination coefficient between lab extracted and model estimated chl a increasing from 0 72 to 0 95 0 87 the root mean square error decreasing from 1 55 μg l to 0 76 0 88 μg l the mean percent error decreasing from 16 04 to 0 29 2 47 and the mean absolute percent error decreasing from 32 19 to 14 29 16 26 furthermore the model is shown to exhibit high accuracy for individual seasons as well as for the entire year supplementary material this also suggests that the model captures the key factors of the underlying biophysical and observational processes 4 conclusions fluorometric probes have been widely used as a rapid means to measure chl a in inland aquatic environments however conversion of raw fluorescence to accurate and reliable chl a concentration estimates required for lake water quality management is challenging due to both instrumental biases and environmental variability this study is based on a dataset comprising sonde measurements of several water quality parameters and laboratory analyzed water samples collected over a two and a half year period the dataset has fairly high resolution both vertically throughout the water column and spatially across lake regions the main study findings are as follows lake chl a concentration estimates obtained through linear or non linear relationships between concurrent sonde and lab extracted chl a measurements contain biases and exhibit poor accuracy chl a estimation biases can be reduced through the use of concurrent sonde measurements of other water quality parameters including temperature fdom and bga in addition to chl a sonde chl a measurements near the water surface contain biases due to nonphotochemical quenching npq during daytime npq effects are significant and use of uncorrected sonde measurements can misinform regulatory compliance and other water quality assessments sonde npq biases can be reduced by replacing near surface fluorescence measurements by the maximum fluorescence within the surface oxygen mixed layer as suggested in this work the improved estimation accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of laboratory extracted chl a estimates

16585,algae blooms are of considerable concern in freshwater lakes and reservoirs worldwide in situ chlorophyll a chl a fluorometers are widely used for rapid assessments of algae biomass however accurately converting chl a fluorescence to an equivalent concentration is challenging due to natural variations in the relationship as well as nonphotochemical quenching npq which occurs commonly in surface waters during daytime this study is based on water quality data from a freshwater lake from october 2018 to december 2020 initial analysis of sonde chl a fluorescence and laboratory extracted chl a concentrations shows that the two data sets exhibit a nonlinear relationship with positive correlation and significant errors a bias correction method was next developed based on 1 concurrent sonde measurements of other water quality parameters to account for nonlinearities and 2 a bias correction approach for nonphotochemical quenching effects in surface waters the new chl a model exhibits much improved accuracy with a root mean square error rmse less than 0 95 µg l the new method facilitates accurate chl a characterization in freshwater lakes and reservoirs based on readily obtainable in situ fluorescence sonde measurements graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lakes chlorophyll a fluorescence multi parameter sonde nonphotochemical quenching 1 introduction freshwater lakes are natural habitats for a rich diversity of plants and animals and also provide important societal services including municipal industrial and agricultural water supply prime shoreline residential development opportunities and recreational boating and fishing societal services however often engender excess wastes and nutrients which if not effectively managed may overwhelm the lake assimilative capacity and lead to eutrophication problems advanced lake eutrophication increases the frequency and severity of algae blooms which have been known worldwide to elevate lake turbidity can produce toxins harmful to animals and humans lower dissolved oxygen levels and cause fish kills paerl and huisman 2008 smith 2003 chlorophyll a chl a is the major photosynthetic pigment in algae and it is used most widely as a proxy algae biomass indicator to assess lake trophic status and algal bloom extent and severity usepa 2000 conventional laboratory chl a determination involves field collection of water samples filtration extraction into an organic solvent and finally quantification by spectrophotometry lorenzen 1967 richards and thompson 1958 fluorometry arar and collins 1997 holm hansen et al 1965 or chromatography jacobson 1978 this process can provide reliable chl a estimates but it is time consuming and costly and requires experienced analysts to produce consistent and accurate results because of these requirements it cannot support continuous lake monitoring for acquisition of high resolution spatial and temporal data in situ fluorometers were introduced by lorenzen 1966 and have widely been used since then as a rapid and less costly chl a monitoring alternative to the conventional approach fluorescence chl a sensors probes are designed for field deployment and are typically part of multi parameter instruments sondes equipped to concurrently measure other water quality parameters including temperature dissolved oxygen ph turbidity specific conductivity and possibly others field measurements can quickly be made and inspected in real time at multiple water depths and or sites and automatically transferred to electronic databases for visualization and analysis notwithstanding the tangible advantages of the fluorometer technology it also has shortcomings that need to be addressed specifically the conversion accuracy of raw fluorescence measurements to equivalent chl a concentrations is impacted by environmental and biological factors such as light intensity temperature variation nutrient status and phytoplankton species composition falkowski and kiefer 1985 kiefer 1973 introducing measurement biases manufacturer fluorometer calibration is based on either pure chl a or experimental water samples that generally differ in chl a concentrations and or phytoplankton assemblages from the actual environments being monitored for this reason laboratory extracted chl a estimates from water samples at the monitored sites are typically employed to correct these biases through correlation analysis the success of this approach varies across instrument manufacturers consistent relationships have been reported in some studies using the fluoroprobe bbe moldaenke kiel germany or its online version the algae online analyzer catherine et al 2012 gregor et al 2005 gregor and maršálek 2004 izydorczyk et al 2009 whereas in samples dominated by different algae species linear relationships were found to be sample specific gregor et al 2005 relatively weaker correlations were found for the ysi exo2 sonde yellow springs instrument co inc oh usa which exhibited time dependent bowling et al 2016 chaffin et al 2018 and site specific zolfaghari et al 2020 relationships to circumvent such biases alternative methods for estimating chl a concentrations from fluorometers have been proposed based on the shape of fluorescence profiles mignot et al 2011 sauzède et al 2015 simultaneous measured irradiance profile xing et al 2011 or satellite derived chl a concentrations boss et al 2008 lavigne et al 2012 however these methods require either auxiliary measurements not commonly available in freshwater lakes or on conditions not always met another fluorometer bias is related to algal nonphotochemical quenching npq which commonly occurs in surface waters during daytime and manifests as a noticeable fluorescence reduction biermann et al 2015 falkowski and kolber 1995 o holm hansen et al 2000 lucius et al 2020 rousso et al 2021 serra et al 2009 thomalla et al 2018 xing et al 2012 phytoplankton generally receive excess sunlight than the amount which can be used for photosynthesis under high light intensity conditions because the excess sunlight can cause photooxidative damage phytoplankton has developed different mechanisms to regulate the absorption and utilization of light energy npq is a series of mechanisms employed by photosynthetic organisms to effectively dissipate excess energy that has already been absorbed as heat müller et al 2001 npq has three major components based on different relaxation kinetics 1 energy dependent quenching qe which is the predominant and most rapid component in most algae and plants relaxes within seconds to minutes and quenches chl a fluorescence by up 90 huot and babin 2010 2 state transition quenching qt which relaxes within tens of minutes and reduces chl a fluorescence by decoupling the light harvesting complex from photosystem ii and 3 photoinhibitory quenching qi which is related to photoinhibitory damage of photosystem ii and relaxes within hours the magnitude of npq can be influenced by many factors such as surface light intensity browning et al 2014 phytoplankton composition harrison et al 2018 and nutrient limitation all npq processes reduce the chl a fluorescence yield which can result in appreciable underestimation of phytoplankton biomass nighttime measurements are free of npq effects but they are inconvenient and much less common than daytime measurements thus correcting daytime fluorescence measurements for npq is critical for reliable and unbiased chl a fluorometer assessments several correction methods have been proposed including the use of photosynthetically active radiation par or other auxiliary information biermann et al 2015 o holm hansen et al 2000 moiseeva et al 2019 xing et al 2018 optical backscattering hemsley et al 2015 sackmann et al 2008 swart et al 2015 thomalla et al 2018 pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry harrison et al 2018 moiseeva et al 2019 concurrently collected environmental sensor data lucius et al 2020 or mixed layer depth mld these approaches however were either developed for ocean waters or require additional synchronous measurements not typically available in most lake studies the objective of this study is to develop a bias correction method suitable for chl a fluorometer data commonly obtained in freshwater lakes and reservoirs specifically the study aims to 1 evaluate how sonde chl a data correlate with corresponding laboratory extracted chl a concentrations 2 improve chl a estimation accuracy by making use of both sonde chl a and other sonde measured water quality data and 3 introduce and evaluate an npq bias correction approach for surface waters the study uses data collected by a ysi exo2 sonde but the approach is general and applicable to data from other instruments 2 material and methods 2 1 study site this study uses data from lake lanier a large freshwater reservoir in north georgia usa with a surface area of 150 km2 an average depth of 18 3 m and a maximum depth of 48 8 m near the outlet the lake is impounded by buford dam is fed by the chattahoochee and chestatee rivers and has a total storage of approximately 2 4 109 m3 at normal pool elevation 326 4 m lake lanier serves multiple water uses including hydropower generation flood control recreation wildlife management and water supply for metro atlanta the lake is monomictic stratifying from april to october and becoming fully mixed in the rest of year the trophic status of lake lanier is distinctly different in its southern versus its northern regions the southern lake region has higher transparency and lower nutrient concentrations than its northern region water quality data collected during 2018 2019 and 2020 showed that the secchi depth varied from 1 5 to 4 2 m in the south versus 1 to 2 m in the north and the photic zone chl a growing season average ranged from 6 to 7 µg l in the south versus 7 to 12 µg l in the north according to the lake classification by nürnberg 1996 these and other data suggest that lake lanier is mesotrophic in the south becoming eutrophic in the north furthermore according to the gwinnett daily post 2020 chl a exhibited a 20 year record high in the summer of 2019 and reported that the 2019 growing season april to october chl a increased by 3 72 μg l compared to its value in 2018 this was notable because the average increase in the preceding 20 years was only 0 17 μg l per year the chl a spike in 2019 was alarming in that it exceeded the current regulatory standard and highlighted the need for a more comprehensive and reliable chl a monitoring program to support effective lake water quality management 2 2 in situ monitoring and sampling comprehensive in situ monitoring and sampling campaigns were carried out from october 2018 to december 2020 including a in situ water quality measurements using the ysi exo2 multi parameter sonde and b field water sampling and subsequent laboratory analysis for chl a and other water quality parameters 2 2 1 in situ monitoring scheme in situ monitoring was carried out using the ysi exo2 multi parameter sonde the sonde was equipped with several sensors measuring temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen turbidity ph fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom chl a and phycocyanin blue green algae or bga all sensors were re calibrated every two to three months following the exo2 manual instructions the total algae sensor chl a and bga was calibrated for relative fluorescence units rfu using a rhodamine standard regular monthly monitoring activities were performed at four pilot coves near buford dam these included the old control cove occ new control cove ncc cove 2 c2 and cove 3 c3 the shoreline areas of pilot coves occ and ncc are fairly pristine while those of coves c2 and c3 feature dense residential developments additional sites in the southern and northern regions of lake lanier fig 1 were monitored since june 2020 expanding the geographic scope of the monitoring program table s1 shows the information of all monitoring sites and dates in each of the four pilot coves 18 locations were consistently monitored depending on the topography and bathymetry of the lake the exact latitude longitude coordinates of these locations were determined in situ using a garmin gpsmap 64st at each location depth wise sonde measurements were taken along the water column at depths spaced every 0 5 m from 0 5 m below the water surface to 0 5 m above the lake bottom at the additional sites monitoring was carried out at depths spaced every 1 m the sonde was deployed manually from a boat at each monitoring depth and a 40 s dwell time was allowed to stabilize sensor readings before data were recorded data recording took place continuously for 10 to 15 s to reduce measurement noise at each pilot cove each monitoring day involved 250 sonde measurements encompassing all locations and depths and required approximately 7 8 h to complete the monitoring order of each location and depth at each cove was consistently the same during all field campaigns throughout 2018 2020 2 2 2 field sampling and laboratory analysis in each pilot cove regular monthly water sampling was undertaken in one location but at multiple depths green dots in fig 1 as the total number of water samples was limited by laboratory capacity several additional samples were taken from sites across the northern region on july 15 2020 for model validation purposes the corresponding sampled depths at each location table s2 were determined based on typical summer temperature profiles which delineate the lake epilimnion thermocline and hypolimnion regions samples were taken with a relatively small depth spacing in the top 3 m 0 5 m and around the epilimnion thermocline and thermocline hypolimnion transition regions 1 meter and with a larger spacing 2 m in other parts of the water column the same depths were sampled during the cold season november to march when the lake is fully mixed and during the stratification season april to october water samples were collected using a 12 volt tornado plastic pump proactive environmental products florida usa the pump was tightly tied to the exo2 sonde with the filter screen being at the same position as the sensors front to ensure that water samples and sonde measurements were as spatially and temporally consistent as possible after dropping the bundled pump and sonde to each desired depth a 40 s dwell time was allowed not only for the sonde readings to stabilize before sampling but also for rinsing the pump tube to avoid potential contamination from residual water in the tube samples for chl a analysis were contained in 1 l opaque nalgene bottles and samples for other water quality parameters in 1 l white nalgene bottles grabbed water samples were immediately placed in an ice filled cooler and delivered to the laboratory water samples were analyzed for chl a at the water quality lab of gwinnett county s department of water resources following the epa 445 0 non acidification method arar and collins 1997 filters were manually grounded with glass rods and sonicated in a waterbath at 4 c for 20 min instead of mechanical grinding with a teflon tissue grinder following an environmental protection division epd approved modification a shimadzu rf 6000 spectrofluorometer with excitation emission bandwidth of 436 nm 680 nm was used for the analysis in addition duplicates were also run on the turner trilogy fluorometer to cross check the settings on the spectrofluorometer 2 3 data pre processing sonde measured data at each monitoring location were downloaded from the korexo software into excel files for each depth the average of each measured parameter over the recording time interval was computed for use in subsequent data analysis among all sonde measured parameters chl a bga and fdom fluorescence exhibit significant temperature dependence temperature compensation for these three parameters is necessary if the site temperature is significantly different from the calibration temperature ysi incorporated 2009 to investigate this dependence in addition to the samples for routine water quality analysis an extra 17 and 15 samples were collected in 2019 and 2020 respectively these samples were collected from the pilot coves at depths where chl a fluorescence was relatively high these extra samples were also immediately placed in an ice filled cooler until the time they were analyzed sample analysis was conducted in a dark room with temperature around 25 c and included the following steps first the sonde calibration cup was filled with the water sample and screwed tightly to the sonde to ensure no oxygen exchange with the ambient air occurred during the analysis then the water sample was left to warm up naturally from its initial temperature 4 c to room temperature during which sonde measurements were collected continuously at 1 s intervals over a period of 3 to 5 h sonde measurement of chl a bga fdom and temperature continued until the temperature of the water sample equalized with the room temperature linear regression analysis was next used to characterize the response of the chl a bga and fdom fluorescence to temperature variation in the range 10 to 25 c which is representative of the annual lake water temperature variation the required correction was consistent with the findings of watras et al 2017 and employed a linear function for all three parameters 1 x c x m 1 α x t m t c where x is the parameter being measured i e chl a bga or fdom fluorescence and subscripts c and m denote the corrected and measured values respectively t m is the measured water temperature and t c can be any reference temperature theoretically but in this study t c refers to the temperature of standard regents during the sensor calibration process coefficient α x is for temperature correction of parameter x and was estimated via linear regression of sonde fluorescence and temperature as the ratio of the slope and intercept specifically the computed annual temperature correction coefficients for chl a bga and fdom are 0 008 0 033 0 006 in 2019 and 0 019 0 041 0 008 in 2020 respectively the values of the coefficients in 2018 are assumed to be the same as in 2019 all sonde measured chl a bga and fdom fluorescence were corrected for temperature before model development 2 4 model development the chl a model was developed in stages guided by a error analysis b source attribution and c model complexity versus accuracy considerations 2 4 1 laboratory extracted chl a versus sonde chl a fluorescence we first evaluated the accuracy of estimating chl a concentrations laboratory extracted from sonde chl a measurements a linear regression model was developed for all data pairs of laboratory extracted and sonde measured chl a concentrations collected during 2018 and 2020 to test whether potential interannual variations of this relationships may exist we also developed three separate linear regression models for the sonde lab data pairs in different years 2 4 2 value of other synchronous sonde measured parameters next we investigated whether other synchronous sonde measurements in addition to sonde chl a could be used to improve model estimation accuracy at this stage we considered all sonde measured parameters as potential explanatory variables including sonde chl a rfu bga rfu temperature c conductivity µs cm do mg l turbidity fnu ph and fdom rfu in addition the squared and cubed sonde chl a measurements were added to the list to account for underlying nonlinearities depending on the combination of explanatory variables all possible multivariate regression models were calibrated using 236 data samples from 2018 to 2019 and validated using 240 data samples from 2020 the best performing model was then selected based on the criteria outlined in subsection 2 5 which aim to balance model accuracy with model parsimony 2 4 3 correction of npq biases in surface waters since all samples were taken approximately between 9 am and 5 pm on each monitoring day we suspected that sonde chl a fluorescence measurements in the upper part of water column were impacted by npq to assess the presence of npq impacts we first compared vertical profiles of sonde chl a fluorescence and corresponding lab extracted chl a concentrations this comparison provided convincing evidence of npq impacts and motivated the development of a procedure to i determine the depth to which npq biases existed and ii correct all sonde measurements above that depth this procedure is outlined below 1 compute the vertical change rate of the measured dissolved oxygen mg l m at each depth throughout the profile from the first measured depth 0 5 m below the surface to the last measured depth 0 5 m above the bottom 2 starting from the measurement depth nearest the surface search downward for the first depth where the oxygen change rate becomes higher than 0 2 mg l m denote and refer to this depth as the oxygen mixed layer depth omld 3 scan all chl a fluorescence measurements between the surface and omld and locate the first chl a fluorescence maximum which is strictly equal to or greater than the chl a measurements in the next 1 m depth denote and refer to this depth as the maximum fluorescence depth mfd and consider the chl a fluorescence measurement at the mfd as the true chl a fluorescence in the water column above the mfd to the surface 4 for all depths above the mfd correct the raw sonde chl a fluorescence measurements using the chl a fluorescence value measured at mfd step 3 the assumptions underlying this npq bias correction procedure are that a the chl a concentration can be considered uniform in the layer where dissolved oxygen balance is constant b the depression of fluorescence in this oxygen mixed layer is only due to npq effect and c npq does not affect the chl a measurements below the mfd the rationale of these assumptions is further discussed and validated in the supplementary material page 4 and fig s1 2 4 4 validation of npq correction approach after determining the depth affected by npq effects the data set was further classified as quenched and unquenched groups in the calibration and validation data set respectively the multivariate nonlinear regression model was then calibrated on the unquenched data from 2018 to 2019 and validated on the unquenched data from 2020 chl a concentrations for the quenched group were estimated by estimating chl a at the mfd of each location using the multivariate nonlinear model with both npq corrected and uncorrected sonde chl a fluorescence lastly to validate the npq correction method we compared estimated chl a concentrations with lab extracted chl a concentrations for all sampling periods 2 5 model selection the best performing model was selected based on the corrected akaike information criterion aicc according to hurvich 1989 2 a i c c i n l n σ i 2 2 k i n n k i 1 where i is the i t h model among all candidate models n is the number of data points used in the estimation of model parameters σ i 2 is the variance of the residuals estimated from the data set and k i is the total number of estimated parameters of the i t h model including the intercept and σ i 2 the model selection process was as follows a compute the aicc value for each candidate model b rank all candidate models based on their aicc values in ascending order and select the model with the smallest aicc value 2 6 model performance assessment all statistical analyses were performed using matlab r2020a a visualization of sample data distribution was provided by box plots adjusted coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean percent error mpe and mean absolute percent error mape were employed to assess model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of sonde measurements and laboratory chl a estimates a summary of monthly sonde measurements and lab extracted chl a concentration estimates during october 2018 to december 2020 is shown as box plots fig 2 in general all water quality parameters exhibit similar seasonal patterns but high interannual variability based on measured temperature profiles lake lanier is typically well mixed during november to march and stratified during the rest of each year water temperature ranged approximately between 10 c and 31 c during the entire sampling periods although in 2020 it was slightly lower by 1 to 3 c at each corresponding location and time of year the water temperature in may 2019 reached a value that was approximately 1 4 times higher than that in may 2020 do ranged approximately between 8 and 10 mg l in the well mixed periods and anoxia in the hypolimnion occurred during july to october in the past two years the notable difference is that do profiles exhibited a large bulge within the thermocline in may 2019 but not in 2020 fig s2 conductivity was overall higher in 2020 but fdom was higher in 2019 relatively low bga levels were measured during past two years although bga was slightly higher in 2019 higher turbidity was measured among pilot coves in 2019 than 2020 whereas in 2020 lake lanier was more turbid in the northern region as indicated by the many outliers outside the 2020 boxplot ph levels responded similarly in the past two years except that high alkaline readings ph 9 were observed within the thermocline in may 2019 fig s2 both the sonde chl a fluorescence and lab extracted chl a exhibited similar seasonal patterns in the past two years chl a was lower during november to march grew rapidly in late spring and subsided in the summer before increasing again in the fall overall chl a was relatively higher in 2019 than in 2020 with the highest chl a concentration of 19 13 µg l recorded within the metalimnion in may 2019 a deep chlorophyll maximum dcm which generally occurs in mesotrophic to oligotrophic water bodies scofield et al 2020 was widely observed in lake lanier during stratified seasons the algae bloom in may 2019 was attributed to a significant temperature increase of nearly 15 c from april to may and high light and nutrient inputs intense photosynthetic activity produced excessive do observed as a do bulge and consumed co2 in the metalimnion the ph increased due to reduction of the dissolved carbonic acid h2co3 and the concomitant increase of bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 ² the monitoring results exhibit high spatial and temporal variability corroborating the need for frequent monitoring to detect potential pollution events such as short lived algae blooms and to quantify short and long term ecosystem changes for lake management marcé et al 2016 sonde chl a fluorescence measurements can be used to characterize the overall trend in phytoplankton biomass however to assess compliance to site specific chl a concentration standards it is crucial that the sonde chl a fluorescence be accurately converted to actual chl a concentrations moreover the coincidence of high chl a with elevated temperature do and ph suggests that all these sonde measured parameters may be useful in the reliable estimation of chl a 3 2 relationships of sonde chl a fluorescence and laboratory extracted chl a estimates comparison between sonde chl a fluorescence as rfu and lab extracted chl a concentrations as µg l of all collected samples is shown in fig 3 a a fairly strong relationship exists between the sonde chl a fluorescence and the lab extracted concentration explaining 72 of the data variation comparable to that reported by o holm hansen et al 2000 however the deviations of estimated chl a concentrations from lab extracted chl a concentrations vary over a wide range from 7 28 µg l to 6 74 µg l mean percent error mpe mean absolute percent error mape and root mean square error rmse is more than 16 32 and 1 5 µg l respectively table 1 significant overestimation is shown around both low fluorescence 0 5 rfu and high fluorescence 3 rfu and a number of intermediate samples are underestimated as seen by the large data scatter above the regression line in fig 3a this suggests that the relationship between sonde chl a fluorescence and lab concentration is not homogeneous across samples slightly better relationships were found when the data set was separated into three subsets corresponding to the sampled years the errors in these relationships ranged from 2 58 µg l to 1 20 µg l for 2018 6 97 µg l to 3 72 µg l for 2019 and 5 15 µg l to 4 07 µg l for 2020 respectively fig 3b table 1 comparing the model performance year by year 2019 exhibits the highest mpe mape and rmse while 2018 the lowest different model performance in different years can be attributed to varied magnitudes of algae abundance and complexities of species composition in different sampling periods bowling et al 2016 specifically the data variation in 2018 is relatively small because the sampling program started in october with samples taken only in late october and middle december 2018 when the lake was fully mixed in the sampled locations in 2019 the samples were collected in all seasons resulting in high variance in both algae abundance levels and species diversity this is also the case in 2020 except no fluorescence of higher than 3 rfu was observed which can also explain the higher model accuracy in 2020 in addition the relationship exhibited significant interannual variability as seen by the slope and intercept change from year to year and a fair amount of horizontal scatter in the data distribution these results suggest that using sonde chl a fluorescence as a single explanatory variable to estimate equivalent lab extracted chl a concentration is unreliable as also reported by bowling et al 2016 there is thus a need to explore other modeling options to reduce the chl a estimation biases and errors 3 3 reduction of chl a estimation bias by other sonde measured parameters fig 4 a shows the calibration results of a multivariate nonlinear regression model based on the sonde chl a fluorescence and other sonde measured parameters during 2018 to 2019 clearly the multivariate nonlinear model outperforms the single predictor models this model explains up to 89 of chl a variance and the rmse is also reduced to less than 1 µg l however estimation errors range from 4 47 µg l to 3 80 µg l table 1 indicating that significant overestimation and underestimation of actual concentration values still exists the best performing model selected by aicc by the procedure described in subsection 2 4 contains seven explanatory variables sonde chl a fluorescence bga conductivity ph temperature turbidity and sonde chl a2 sonde chl a fluorescence temperature ph and sonde chl a2 are four most important variables p 0 0001 with conductivity turbidity and bga respectively having p values of 0 0525 0 0391 and 0 0201 table 2 validation of this model with 2020 data resulted in a larger rmse of 1 22 µg l and overestimation mpe 23 40 of the lab chl a concentration compared to the calibration data set fig 4b table 1 sonde chl a fluorescence is the most informative variable in the estimation of chl a concentration however these results also highlight that synchronously measured water quality data have an ability to reduce the chl a estimation bias from the single sonde chl a fluorescence one of the most noticeable parameters is the temperature which has been known as one of the primary factors light water temperature and nutrients availability to affect phytoplankton growth bouffard et al 2018 ph has a positive impact on chl a concentration which was also reported by wallace et al 2016 sonde chl a2 is selected as an important explanatory variable which indicates that intrinsic nonlinearities exist in the algae fluorescence response namely the phytoplankton response to light changes in ways that are not strictly proportional to the phytoplankton biomass density gregor and maršálek 2004 lorenzen 1966 thus the improvement of chl a estimation accuracy by the use of other sonde measured parameters partially stems from the inherent interactions between the water chemical environment and phytoplankton growth 3 4 further reduction of chl a estimation uncertainty and bias through npq correction comparison of the observed sonde chl a fluorescence profiles versus lab extracted chl a profiles shows that to varying degrees all measured sonde chl a fluorescence profiles are subjected to depression near the water surface see also falkowski and kolber 1995 gregor and maršálek 2004 o holm hansen et al 2000 lucius et al 2020 serra et al 2009 xing et al 2012 as noted all monitoring events were carried out during daytime hours next we analyzed the observed profile patterns of four measured variables sonde chl a fluorescence lab extracted chl a do and temperature in relation to the locations of the oxygen mixed layer depth omld and the maximum fluorescence depth mfd interestingly this analysis showed that all profiles at all locations and all observation times fall into one of three characteristic patterns fig 5 presents these three characteristic profile patterns together with the omld and mfd determined as described in subsection 2 4 panel a shows typical profiles of the first characteristic pattern measured on june 5 2019 in c3 this profile pattern has the following common features a the mfd and omld coincide b sonde chl a fluorescence gradually increases from the surface to 8 9 m where a deep chlorophyll maximum dcm develops and subsequently declines sharply c below the mfd both chl a fluorescence and lab chl a increase and d above the mfd lab chl a slightly increases toward the surface while sonde chl a fluorescence slightly decreases panel b depicts typical profiles of the second characteristic pattern measured on september 4 2019 in c2 the common features of this profile pattern include a mfd is located at a shallower depth than omld b lab chl a is nearly constant from the surface to 9 m depth and c sonde chl a fluorescence experiences a marked decline from mfd to the surface panel c depicts profiles of the third characteristic pattern measured on january 8 2020 in c2 this profile pattern is characterized by the following features a the omld is not located within the water column and may be assumed to be at an infinite depth b all measured variables are fairly uniform throughout the water column and c a pronounced depression occurs in the sonde chl a fluorescence above the mfd the fact that all measured profiles of our entire monitoring program fall into one of the above patterns provides assurance that our classification system based on the relative depths of mfd and omld captures an inherent phytoplankton response to the water chemical environment on this basis our npq correction approach consists of 1 identifying the underlying profile pattern type based on the four indicator variables the mfd and the omld for each of the 186 samples in 2018 2019 and 139 samples in 2020 2 estimate the chl a at mfd using the best performing model for unquenched measurements and 3 assume that from mfd to the water surface chl a has the same concentration as at mfd 3 4 1 model calibration and validation on unquenched data a multivariate nonlinear regression model for estimating chl a concentration was firstly calibrated on unquenched samples during 2018 to 2019 and exhibited the performance shown in fig 6 a and table 1 compared to the model calibrated on both quenched and unquenched data the adjusted r2 improved considerably from 0 89 to 0 95 and the rmse and mpe decreased by 0 23 µg l and 1 60 respectively the estimation error range decreased to 2 81 2 37 µg l and the error distribution fig s3a shows that the estimation is unbiased the optimal model selected by aicc includes six predictors sonde chl a fluorescence bga temperature fdom sonde chl a 2 and sonde chl a 3 based on their p values sonde chl a fluorescence temperature and sonde chl a 2 are three important explanatory variables regardless of whether the model is calibrated on quenched or unquenched data table 2 bga is again selected with a positive coefficient the likely reason for this is that cyanobacteria also contain chl a which can be detected by the laboratory fluorometer after extraction moreover the exo2 total algae sensor measures chl a in phytoplankton and phycocyanin in cyanobacteria providing a total algae biomass reading lastly this model includes fdom and sonde chl a 3 rather than conductivity ph and turbidity to account for fdom fluorescence interference and nonlinearity respectively for validation the model was employed to estimate the chl a concentrations for unquenched samples in 2020 fig 6b shows the comparison between estimated chl a concentrations and lab extracted concentrations the model exhibited high predictive accuracy r2 94 and rmse 0 76 µg l mpe 1 04 and mape 14 41 comparable to the calibration statistics table 1 the error distribution fig s3b indicates that the estimation is unbiased these results indicate that the quenched chl a fluorescence data can bias the chl a estimation procedures a common strategy used in the past to avoid the npq effects is to use night measurements for instance serra et al 2009 linearly correlated the night fluorescence measurement with high performance liquid chromatography hplc data however nighttime measurements are not practical because a fluorescence data is difficult to collect without autonomous sensor platforms lucius et al 2020 and b collecting paired lab samples at night time is costly an alternative but not quite equivalent strategy is to work only with daytime measurements taken deep enough to be free of npq effects in this regard two general methods have been used to determine the depth below which npq effects can be considered negligible the first method type is based on photosynthetic available radiation par o holm hansen et al 2000 developed different algorithms to estimate chl a based on fluorescence and photosynthetic par measurements and determined that the threshold par value for the quenching of chl a fluorescence is 40 μ mol m 1 s 1 xing et al 2018 found that the optimal npq light threshold instantaneous photosynthetically available radiation ipar is 15 μ mol m 1 s 1 thomalla et al 2018 determined the quenching depth as the shallowest minimum of the difference between mean night and day fluorescence within the euphotic zone par 1 of the surface value the unavoidable limitation of these methods however is that they additionally require par and possibly nighttime fluorescence measurements not commonly monitored in freshwater lakes the second method type utilizes the mixed layer depth mld xing et al 2012 proposed that the depth of daytime fluorescence maximum within the mld is a good indicator of the depth down to which quenching is significant the mld is determined as the depth where the density differs from the density at 15 m by more than 0 03 kg m 3 biermann et al 2015 suggested the same indicator maximum daytime fluorescence but within the euphotic zone the mld approach does not require additional information than typically available and has practical promise however it has been developed for ocean waters and it is not directly applicable to freshwater lakes where the mld is not typically determined based on density differences furthermore the existing mld estimation methods are inconsistent gray et al 2020 a lake s mld refers to the depth above which water temperature is uniform sverdrup 1953 and its correct estimation is important because it influences the outcomes of various physical chemical and biological lake processes in this study we adopted the general mld concept but investigated ways to determine the quenching depth using typical sonde measurements in freshwater lakes we found that the vertical gradient of the dissolved oxygen is a reliable mld indicator this can be attributed to the fact that oxygen variation is primarily controlled by phytoplankton metabolism and small vertical changes in oxygen concentration imply relatively uniform phytoplankton biomass distribution within the oxygen mixed layer so defined we used the depth of maximum daytime fluorescence to delineate the surface water layer impacted by quenching 3 4 2 validation of npq correction method the proposed npq correction method was validated on the quenched samples for all sampling periods chl a concentrations at depths affected by quenching were predicted by the model calibrated in subsection 3 4 1 using both uncorrected and corrected fluorescence comparisons between the predicted and lab extracted chl a concentrations are shown in fig 7 for different sampling periods the paired estimated chl a vertical profile and lab extracted concentration at discrete depths for sampled locations in 2020 can also be found in the supplement material fig 7 and table 1 show that estimated chl a concentrations using uncorrected fluorescence are biased on the low side with mpe being 31 94 in 2018 2019 and 22 60 in 2020 respectively after applying the quenching correction mpe becomes 2 00 in 2018 2019 and 8 45 in 2020 the rmse is reduced from 1 44 µg l to 0 80 µg l in 2018 2019 and from 1 35 µg l to 0 94 µg l in 2020 the mape is reduced from 35 23 to 15 51 in 2018 2019 and from 29 51 to 17 27 in 2020 the error distributions fig s4 show that systematic biases have been removed overall the results show that if not accounted for npq can cause large biases in estimating chl a concentration from sonde data this is particularly important in estimating chl a concentration in the euphotic zone which is prone to npq interference in lake lanier and many other lakes the regulatory standard requires that the average monthly mid channel chl a concentration in the euphotic zone not exceed a certain threshold more than once in a five year period the average concentration is obtained by compositing chl a readings taken over the photic zone at 1 m depth spacings the average chl a concentration is typically based on laboratory analysis of composite water samples but this effort is time consuming costly and limited to a few lake locations in situ fluorometers provide a more efficient inexpensive and reliable alternative but if not corrected for npq effects they may lead to erroneous findings and undermine regulatory compliance a number of npq correction methods have been developed for ocean waters biermann et al 2015 falkowski and kolber 1995 hemsley et al 2015 o holm hansen et al 2000 lavigne et al 2012 sackmann et al 2008 swart et al 2015 thomalla et al 2018 xing et al 2012 2018 but very few for freshwater lakes and reservoirs lucius et al 2020 moiseeva et al 2019 serra et al 2009 hemsley et al 2015 corrected the npq for day fluorescence profiles from ocean gliders using a linear relationship between night fluorescence and optical backscattering specifically they substituted the day measured optical backscattering into the regression equation to compute the fluorescence corrected within the euphotic zone however the required optical backscattering is not commonly measured in freshwater lakes and reservoirs xing et al 2012 assumed the vertical distribution of phytoplankton is uniform within the mixed layer and corrected the npq by extrapolating the fluorescence maximum toward the surface in southern ocean the mld determination in xing et al 2012 is not applicable in freshwater lakes lucius et al 2020 in follow up work xing et al 2018 improved their npq correction approach by incorporating synchronous irradiance profiles and using an empirical sigmoid function of par for depths below mld par profiles however are not typically available in lake investigations serra et al 2009 tested two in situ fluorometers in a freshwater reservoir under different light intensities and proposed npq correction equations for the water layers receiving high light irradiances the correction equations are based on the relationship between par and the difference between the in vitro and in vivo chl a concentrations similar to other par based methods this approach does not lend itself to typical freshwater lake investigations especially operationally moiseeva et al 2019 compensated the npq effects using the relationship derived between the percentage of open reaction center in photosystem ii and par in a freshwater lake however both par profiles and pulse amplitude modulation pam fluorescence parameters are not always available more recently lucius et al 2020 proposed a correction method for an oligotrophic lake using machine learning techniques random forest regression model the percent reduction of fluorescence is the output variable which was quantified by the percent difference between day fluorescence and the mean of night fluorescence input variables include raw fluorescence total solar radiation depth numerical month of the year water temperature 1 h rolling average of total radiation do saturation and solar azimuth angle while this approach is shown to be effective in the study it has conceptual and numerical issues one is the assumption that algae biomass remains essentially stationary in the water column during day and night however phytoplankton is known to rise and fall depending on solar heating internal waves and convection serra et al 2007 a second issue is the need for fairly large datasets which can take years to develop the npq correction method proposed in this study consists of a delineating the oxygen mixed layer b finding the maximum fluorescence depth mfd within this layer and c replacing the sonde fluorescence measurements above the mfd with the fluorescence measurement at the mfd this adjustment is based on commonly monitored water quality measurements and it is easily deployable operationally 3 5 model performance summary the overall bias correction procedure developed in this study combines the procedures for the correction of biases originating from various identified sources the overall procedure was cross validated and was shown to achieve a effective removal of all identified biases b high chl a estimation accuracy with a root mean square error of less than 1 µg l specifically fig 8 summarizes the performance of the bias correction procedure in comparison to the raw relationship between model estimated chl a concentration μg l using only sonde measured rfu and lab extracted chl a concentration μg l panel a panels b and c respectively correspond to chl a estimates at deep and shallow water depths demarcated by mfd the depth of maximum fluorescence this comparison shows that the bias correction procedure leads to substantially improved chl a estimates with the determination coefficient between lab extracted and model estimated chl a increasing from 0 72 to 0 95 0 87 the root mean square error decreasing from 1 55 μg l to 0 76 0 88 μg l the mean percent error decreasing from 16 04 to 0 29 2 47 and the mean absolute percent error decreasing from 32 19 to 14 29 16 26 furthermore the model is shown to exhibit high accuracy for individual seasons as well as for the entire year supplementary material this also suggests that the model captures the key factors of the underlying biophysical and observational processes 4 conclusions fluorometric probes have been widely used as a rapid means to measure chl a in inland aquatic environments however conversion of raw fluorescence to accurate and reliable chl a concentration estimates required for lake water quality management is challenging due to both instrumental biases and environmental variability this study is based on a dataset comprising sonde measurements of several water quality parameters and laboratory analyzed water samples collected over a two and a half year period the dataset has fairly high resolution both vertically throughout the water column and spatially across lake regions the main study findings are as follows lake chl a concentration estimates obtained through linear or non linear relationships between concurrent sonde and lab extracted chl a measurements contain biases and exhibit poor accuracy chl a estimation biases can be reduced through the use of concurrent sonde measurements of other water quality parameters including temperature fdom and bga in addition to chl a sonde chl a measurements near the water surface contain biases due to nonphotochemical quenching npq during daytime npq effects are significant and use of uncorrected sonde measurements can misinform regulatory compliance and other water quality assessments sonde npq biases can be reduced by replacing near surface fluorescence measurements by the maximum fluorescence within the surface oxygen mixed layer as suggested in this work the improved estimation accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of laboratory extracted chl a estimates

16586,in this study a spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor sssab was adopted for treating actual saline heparin sodium pharmaceutical wastewater hspw after adaptation under the influent cod of 8731 mg l olr of 6 98 kg cod m³ d and salinity of 3 57 wt the cod removal reached up to 82 this value is much higher than the reported for the other reactors at similar salinity benzenes are the major organic compounds in hspw the main rate limiting steps are the degradations of phenol and p cresol in addition the degradation pathways of typical benzenes in hspw were analyzed after adaptation the soluble salt content in the granular sludge increased and the bacterial extracellular polymers eps especially tightly bound eps also significantly increased 16s rrna analysis revealed that the microbial community in the anaerobic granular sludge ags had become adapted to the hspw treatment since mesotoga 12 4 anaerophaga 9 0 oceanotoga 6 1 and aminobacterium 4 1 increased from previously below 1 0 values the relative abundance of methanosarcina in the upper layer of the reactor 68 7 is significantly higher than that at the bottom 3 8 this proves the superiority of the sssab structure finally a model for salt tolerant microorganisms is given which proposes a mechanism for this study and provides reference for other anaerobic biological treatments of high salt containing wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic saline wastewater anaerobic biological treatment anaerobic salt tolerant flora model for salt tolerant microorganisms spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor 1 introduction over the years saline wastewater has been discharged in large volumes from industrial facilities producing agro food leather and petrochemicals hulsen et al 2019 lin et al 2020 shi et al 2015 in addition to high content of salt 1 wt such wastewater is also rich in organic matter chemical oxygen demand cod 2000 mg l li et al 2018 it is reported that such wastewater may account worldwide for as much as 5 of all wastewaters requiring treatment zhang et al 2020a such as heparin sodium pharmaceutical wastewater hspw heparin sodium is a valuable animal derived pharmaceutical that the medical community depends on to control blood coagulation in a number of patient applications a consistent supply of high quality heparin is needed for various purposes that contribute to immediate and long term medical needs of patients there are a large amount of hspw discharge in the production process of heparin sodium hspw usually contains high concentrations of salts and organic matter salinity 3 wt cod 8000 mg l current technologies for the treatment of saline organic wastewater include evaporation membrane filtration and their improved techniques deka et al 2019 mannina et al 2016 while the current technologies usually have the disadvantages of high costs and low removal banat et al 2005 the anaerobic biological treatment process has been regarded as the most logical concept for the treatment of highly concentrated organic wastewater in this process organic matter is anaerobically biodegraded to methane which is an energy source zhang et al 2020b in addition little excess sludge is generated unfortunately many salts contained in hspw will harm the anaerobic microorganisms and may lead to sludge loss and a reactor collapse gagliano et al 2017 preliminary studies have demonstrated that the reactor performance may worsen if the salinity of wastewater is above 1 wt lefebvre and moletta 2006 with regard to the inhibition of salts towards microorganisms two explanation exist on the one hand na and mg compete with enzymes protein for binding potential which can lead to a decreased of enzymatic activities or even inactivation on the other hand the high concentration of salts causes a high osmotic pressure salih and dastgheib 2017 which may cause dehydration plasmolysis and eventually a death of microorganisms onodera et al 2017 sudmalis et al 2018 according to previous studies gradually increasing the salinity can adapt the microorganisms to the salt concentrations this is a possibility for the treatment of saline organic wastewater lefebvre et al 2006 used an uasb reactor treating leather wastewater after adaptation for 307 d the cod removal reached 78 at an organic loading rate olr of 0 5 kg cod m3 d and a tds of 71 g l sierra et al also used an uasb reactor treating phenolic wastewater sierra et al 2019 after an adaptation time of 379 d the reactor collapsed before the salinity reached 26 g na l the results also show that the flora in the uasb reactor is highly volatile it is sensitive to changes in the salinity of the wastewater which indicates the instability of an uasb for treating saline organic wastewater in order to improve the degradation efficiency of saline organic wastewater meaning that the salinity tolerance should be increased and the adaptation time reduced we developed a highly efficient anaerobic reactor with own intellectual property rights the spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor sssab the structure and project photos of sssab are shown in fig s1 the sssab is divided into three reaction zones based on the anaerobic three stage theory in this reactor the hydraulic dead zone is minimized and the mass transfer efficiency between the granular sludge and the wastewater is increased through the spiral flow pattern which helps to achieve a rapid adaptation of the microbial flora in the reactor the superior operating performance of the sssab has been proven in previous studies chen et al 2016b dai et al 2017 2016 in a lab scale experiment the reactor run stably under the olr of 361 5 kg cod m3 d in the treatment of methanol sodium acetate wastewater chen et al 2016a in another pilot scale experiment the reactor run stably under the olr of 27 2 kg cod m3 d in the treatment of soybean process wastewater chen et al 2021 the reactor has also been put into project in the treatment of soybean process wastewater chinese pharmaceutical wastewater and polyacrylate containing wastewater in all tests a good cleaning effect was obtained the objective of this study was to 1 explore a technology for an efficient anaerobic biodegradation of saline organic wastewater 2 investigate the anaerobic degradation pathway of hspw and 3 analyze the mechanism of salt tolerance of the microflora the adaptation process of microflora in the sssab for treating hapw was divided into four phases low salt initiation phase stimulus response phase shock load phase and high salt stable phase the degradation pathways of organic matter the characteristics of the granular sludge and changes in the microbial flora were analyzed to explore the high efficiency mechanism of the reactor and to construct a model for salt tolerant microorganisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater the hspw originated from a pharmaceutical factory producing heparin in anhui province china eight different samples of hspw were collected the characteristics are reported in table 1 the high standard deviation reflects the high variability of the hspw 2 2 inoculated sludge for inoculation of the sssab anaerobic granular sludge obtained from sssab in a soybean product processing plant in jiangxi province china was used the average particle size of the sludge was ф2 25 mm the average settling velocity was 56 46 m h the density was 1 17 g cm3 and the vss ss value was 0 76 the sludge dosage accounted for about 40 of the effective volume of the sssab the concentration of wet sludge

removal the experimental process of adapting the microflora in the sssab was divided into four phases low salt initiation phase stimulus response phase shock load phase and high salt stable phase 1 phase 1 low salt initiation phase days 1 20 in this phase the sssab operated at a low olr 1 01 olr 3 05 kg cod m³ d as shown in fig 2 a and d with an olr of 1 01 kg cod m³ d and a salinity of 0 74 wt the cod removal reached up to 85 when the salinity further increased to 1 66 wt the cod removal finally stable at around 91 2 phase 2 stimulus response phase days 21 43 two shock experiments were operated in this phase in the first stimulus response 21 33d when the olr increased from 2 50 kg cod m³ d to 4 76 kg cod m³ d and the salinity increased from 1 41 wt to 2 82 wt the cod removal initially dropped to 78 but returned to around 90 in the second stimulus response 34 43d when the olr increased from 3 91 kg cod m³ d to 6 27 kg cod m³ d and salinity increased from 1 54 wt to 2 14 wt the cod removal reached 94 the two shock experiments show the excellent response of the microflora to changes of the olr and salinity in the sssab 3 phase 3 shock load phase days 44 70 in this phase the sssab adapted to a gradually increasing salinity when the olr increased from 3 90 kg cod m³ d to 5 79 kg cod m³ d and the salinity increased from 2 11 wt to 2 82 wt the cod removal dropped to 73 however after operating for 5 days the cod removal recovered to 86 4 phase 4 high salt stable phase days 71 92 in this phase the sssab operated with high olr and salinity when the olr increased from 4 20 kg cod m³ d to 6 47 kg cod m³ d and the salinity from 2 67 wt to 3 31 wt the cod removal dropped from 82 to 67 but later stable at around 81 finally with a cod of 8731 mg l an olr of 6 98 kg cod m³ d and a salinity of 3 57 wt the cod in the treated effluent reached 1562 mg l which means a corresponding cod removal of 82 compared with other anaerobic reactors used for the treatment of saline wastewater see table 3 sssab has obviously advantages in addition the biogas yield rate accounts to 205 5 ml h it means that the methane production capacity of the reactor accounts to 0 99 m3 m3 d which indicates the methanogenic activity and the recycling prospects 3 1 2 variations of nh4 n ph and alk as shown in fig 2b the change of nh4 n in influent is consistent with the change of salinity when the influent nh4 n account from 93 mg l to 495 mg l fig 2b the effluent nh4 n increased from 15 mg l to 536 mg l the increasing rate of nh4 n is always less than 10 the average influent ph was 7 18 and the effluent ph accounts to 8 18 a significant increase of ph can be seen as shown in fig 2c when the influent alk increase from 845 mg l to 2787 mg l the effluent alk account from 846 mg l to 2730 mg l the alk of influent and effluent are equivalent which indicates that the reactor achieved alk balance by itself those values indicate that the sssab run stably throughout the four phases chen et al 2021 3 2 degradation pathway of hspw according to the gc ms analysis a variety of organic substances occurs in hspw see fig 3 the benzene series in the influent and effluent accounts for 57 46 and 89 54 respectively this indicates that the benzene series are the main organic matter in hspw the other organics proportion decrease from 42 54 to 10 46 which indicated that those organics are degraded efficiently data in fig 4 a indicate that the main benzene series in hspw are phenol p cresol and indole after the treatment in the sssab phenol and p cresol were removed by 87 3 and 1 7 respectively this indicates that the main rate limiting steps for a degradation of benzene series are the degradation of phenol and p cresol however under aerobic conditions they can be effectively degraded by microorganisms mozo et al 2012 benzoic acid was detected in the effluent which is an intermediate of the anaerobic degradation of phenol and p cresol haggblom et al 1990 this indicates that these two compounds are degraded the probable reason for the increase of phenol and p cresol was that other high molecular weight organic compounds were degraded into phenol and p cresol the amount of indole decreased obviously indole is an organic compound composed of a benzene ring and a pyrrole bond it is typical intermediate of the anaerobic degradation of tryptophan tryptophan is a common substance of protein in pig intestines which are the raw material for heparin sodium production accordingly the anaerobic biodegradation of indole can be drawn as shown in fig 4b first the pyrrole bond in the indole is ketonated then the indole is converted to oxindole afterwards the pyrrole bond breaks because of its instability and the oxindole is converted to phenol p cresol and benzene series with one benzene ring subsequently the phenol and p cresol is converted to benzoic acid finally the benzene ring in benzoic acid is broken and vfas are produced subsequently these are converted to carbon dioxide and methane 3 3 efficient mechanism of the sssab 3 3 1 sem morphology of the ags in the sssab sludge bed the seed ags of sssab was black after adaptation some sludge turned gray see fig 5 a sem scanning electron microscope is used to observe the morphological differences between seed ags s ags adapted black ags b ags and adapted gray ags g ags as shown in fig 5b a comparation of s1 b1 and g1 indicates that the surface of the s ags is obviously rough while the surface of b ags and g ags are compact also the particle size is also significantly smaller than for s ags compare s2 and b2 the microbial flora in s ags is more diverse and complex compare b3 and g3 the obvious difference is that the content of filamentous bacteria in g ags is more than that in b ags and there is a network structure among the strains in g ags which may be the cause of the sludge turning gray as shown in s3 b3 and g3 there were lots of columnar matters with flat ends in s ags while there was no such columnar matter in b ags and g ags which indicates that the composition of granular sludge had undergone significant changes 3 3 2 thermogravimetric analysis of ags according to fig 6 a there is no significant difference between tg curves below 450 c however the weight loss of the seed ags and the adapted ags showed obvious difference with rising temperature from fig 6b the soluble salt contents in the ashes of the b ags and g ags were 31 9 0 7 and 30 7 0 7 respectively much higher than that in the s ags 5 3 0 4 the probable reason for these differences is that the microbial flora may have accumulated some salts in its eps and cells to balance the osmotic pressure inside and outside the organisms yan et al 2019 according to fig 6a the weight loss rate of ags is similar in shape but slightly different in weight loss peak value the first difference is at around 100 c which is related to the loss of tightly bound water here the s ags is slightly higher than that of the adapted sludge which indicates that the tightly bound water of ags was reduce after the adaptation of the saline environment the major peak is in the range of 200 375 c which is related to the loss of low molecular organic compounds huang et al 2016 here the s ags mass decreased by 32 4 and the adapted b ags and g ags masses by 33 8 and 34 7 respectively another peak is in the range of 375 450 c which was related to the loss of benzene series lignin and other refractory organic substances francioso et al 2010 molinuevo salces et al 2013 here the weight loss peak of the adapted ags is a little higher than the seed which can be explained by the absorption of benzene series by the ags above 500 c the weight loss of the adapted ags is significantly lower than that of the seeding ags this may be due to the fact that the residue of the adapted ags contains salts which are difficult to volatilize accordingly after adaptation the composition of the ags in the reactor has changed 3 3 3 variation of eps the 3d eem technique was used to provide direct information on the composition and content of the eps in the sludge as shown in fig 7 only two characteristic peaks are observed in the 3d eem spectra one peak a is located at excitation emission wavelengths ex em around 235 330 nm which is referring to aromatic protein like compounds and another peak located at around 280 310 nm which represents humic acid like substances li et al 2018 these two groups of substances are typical components of eps by comparison the concentration of substances in tb eps is the largest and the peak value for the eps in adapted ags is significantly higher than that in inoculated sludge these suggests that more eps are secreted by microorganisms in response to high salinity according to previous studies the eps are enhancing active transport and diffusion activities or provide a niche so as to help to achieve the balance between osmotic pressure in vivo and in vitro and to maintain normal metabolism he et al 2017 wang et al 2021 3 3 4 microbial community distributions in sssab the microbial communities in the sludge samples have been analyzed by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing table 4 shows the alpha diversity of the bacteria and archaea f s is the flocculent sludge sampled from upper part of the reactor the good s coverages values for bacteria and archaea were all more than 0 99 this shows that the current sequencing depth was sufficient to represent the diversity level of the microbial flora in ags the shannon diversity index and pielou evenness comprehensively reflect the diversity and evenness of the community yang et al 2018 compared with the s ags the microbial community of the adapted ags became more specific since the values of the shannon diversity index and the simpson index becomes smaller after the operation the chao1 and observed species values reflect the richness of the community compared with the s ags the number of microbial species in the adapted ags decreased significantly this indicates that the salinity significantly inhibits the microorganism fig 8 a shows the phylum level distributions of the bacteria in the four samples the main phyla in b ags include chloroflexi 25 1 bacteroidetes 13 3 firmicutes 8 2 proteobacteria 5 1 thermotogae 18 5 and synergistetes 14 7 compared with the s ags the abundance of the chloroflexi decreased from 44 7 to 25 1 while the abundances of thermotogae and synergistetes increased from less than 1 to 18 5 and 14 7 respectively the microbial composition in sample g ags were similar to b ags the difference was that the abundance of proteobacteria in g ags was much higher than the one in b ags the comparation of the data for sample f s and sample b ags yield significant differences the dominant phylum chloroflexi and thermotogae in the sample b ags and g ags can be detected hardly in f s while bacteroidetes and firmicutes become obviously dominant with relative abundance of 51 0 and 34 8 respectively proteobacteria thermotogae and synergistetes have been reported to be salt tolerant ji et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the synergistetes are also drug resistant xue et al 2019 and can be considered as a highly efficient bacteria phylum for hspw degradation fig 8b shows the genus level distributions of the bacteria in the four samples in sample b ags and g ags mesotoga 12 4 and 8 5 anaerophaga 9 0 and 4 4 oceanotoga 6 1 and 0 8 ebm 39 4 1 and 0 9 and aminobacterium 4 0 and 2 9 have become the dominant the values are relative abundance of genus of b ags and g ags respectively in contrast the relative abundance of those genus are all below 0 6 in the s ags the microbial flora distribution in sample g ags is similar to that in b ags however the microflora in f s is different in f s the relative abundances for bacteroides tepidimicrobium and sporanaerobacter account for 48 3 14 9 and 7 0 respectively while the three genus in the other samples account to less than 0 5 mesotoga anaerophaga oceanotoga and aminobacterium are typical anaerobic fermenting bacteria the relative abundances of those bacteria in samples b ags and g ags indicates that in the middle and lower layers of the sssab reactor specialize in the hydrolytic acidification of organic compounds bacteroides are acid producing bacteria with a low tolerance to toxic compounds a few bacteroides were found in the bottom while a large number of bacteroides were found in the upper part of the reactor this indicates that a large amount of inhibitory substances had been decomposed already in the bottom of sssab fig 8c depicts the distributions at the genus level for archaeal in the four samples in the adapted ags average value of samples b ags and g ags methanobacterium 49 8 methanosaeta 36 6 methanosarcina 3 8 candidatus methanofastidiosum 2 0 methanolinea 2 2 and bathyarchaeia 2 3 are the dominant genus the relative abundances for the candidatus methanofastidiosum methanolinea and bathyarchaeia are significantly lower than in the seeding in group f s methanobacterium 22 1 methanosaeta 7 0 and methanosarcina 68 7 are the dominant genus the relative abundance of the genus methanosarcina in sample b ags and s ags is low 3 8 and 0 1 respectively according to a study performed by sudmalis sudmalis et al 2018 methanosarcina is a salt tolerant organism which can counteract an increased osmotic pressure in the high salt wastewater by accumulating nε acetyl β lysine in its cell the analysis of the occurance of archaea shows that there are abundant methanogens with salt tolerance in the sssab especially in the upper free flora the relative abundance of methanogens is high and efficient 3 3 5 inhibitory mechanism of salinity on microorganisms in sssab 1 physical model of salinity inhibitory on microbial flora fig 9 depicts the model of the effect of salt on microbial flora and microbe during adaptation salt ion enter the interior of ags with hspw anaerobic microorganisms secrete a large amount of eps through degradation of organics in hspw to protect the bacteria and maintain normal metabolic function tang et al 2021 fig 9a depicts the mechanisms of salinity effect on non salt tolerant microbe as the salinity increases the activity of microorganism is inhibited enzymatic activity of microbe is destroyed and the metabolism of microbe becomes deterioration at the same time with the increase of salinity the osmotic pressure of the environment increases which cause the microbe to dehydrate plasmolysis and even to die he et al 2017 kobayashi et al 2018 fig 9b depicts the salt tolerant mechanism of salt tolerant bacteria when the salinity and osmotic pressure increase the salt tolerant microbe will accumulate salt ion and compatible solute and secret solutes to achieve osmotic pressure balance among bacteria eps and the environment kempf and bremer 1998 zeng et al 2020 by this way the salt tolerant microbe can metabolize normally grow and become the dominant species in the microbial flora 2 salt ion diffusion model for changing salinity fig 10 a depicts the diffusion of salt ion and the secretion of compatible solute or protein the salts in hspw are mainly nacl fick s law was used to characterize the diffusion of nacl in eps the mass of salt entering a small volume element through a certain section in dt time is 1 dm da dc dx dt where m is the mass of the salt ion passing through the section d is the diffusion coefficient a is the area of the section in the diffusion direction c is the concentration of salt ions dc dx is the gradient of the concentration of the salt ion in the diffusion direction and t is the time the mass of salt ion leaving the small volume element in dt time is 2 d m da dc dx 2 c x 2 dx dt where 2 c x 2 dx is the increment of the concentration gradient from x to x dx dc dx 2 c x 2 dx is the concentration gradient at x dx by subtracting eq 2 from eq 1 the increment of salt ion in the small volume element in the time of dt can be obtained 3 dm d m da 2 c x 2 dx dt on the basis of eq 3 eq 4 can be derived 4 dm d m adx d 2 c x 2 dt where adx is the volume of the small volume element and dm d m adx is the concentration of salt ion of the small volume element eq 5 can be derived from eq 4 5 c t d 2 c x 2 eq 5 shows that the rate of change of concentration in a small volume element with time is proportional to the second derivative of the concentration with respect to the distance in the diffusion direction this indicates that thicker eps can better protect the bacteria in addition it indicates that when the increase rate of salinity in the wastewater is uneven too fast the salinity in the eps will increase rapidly and the osmotic pressure shock will cause greater damage to the microbial cells 3 osmotic pressure equilibrium model when salinity stable according to the osmotic pressure calculation formula held and sadowski 2016 the osmotic pressure of the external environment can be calculated 6 π 1 irt c salt where π is the osmotic pressure of the external environment i is calibration factor for osmotic pressure calculation its value is the number of particles that can be produced by a single molecule of electrolyte in solution for nacl i 2 r is the gas constant which in an ideal state is 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature in kelvin and c salt is the molar concentration of salt ions the osmotic pressure of the eps can be calculated 7 π 2 irt c salt in rt c solutes out θ t c where c salt in is the molar concentration of salt ions diffused into eps c solutes out is the molar concentration of solute secreted by microbe into eps and θ is its osmotic coefficient it describes the molecular interactions in the solution and depends on temperature as well as on kind and molarity of the compatible solute in equilibrium π 1 π 2 and eq 8 can be derived 8 irt c salt irt c salt in rt c solutes out θ t c on the basis of eq 8 eq 9 can be derived 9 c solutes out i θ t c c salt c salt in according to eq 6 and the experiment values fig 10b is drawn when the salinity is lower than 1 04 wt the microorganisms are not inhibited this was because that eps generally have a net negative charge ajao et al 2018 which enables them to adsorb heavy metals and prevents their diffusion into the deeper parts of the biofilm at low concentration of mentals harrison et al 2007 the reactor finally reaches a salinity of 3 57 wt now the final osmotic pressure of the solution which the microorganisms endure is 3079 kpa eq 8 shows that the salt ions diffuse into the eps and cause eps production to maintain the osmotic pressure balance with the external environment while it worth noting an accumulation of compatible solutes will not inhibit the activity of microorganisms but if the salt ion concentration is too high it will cause the microbe to lose water and eventually die held and sadowski 2016 according to eq 9 references held et al 2010 and the experiment values fig 10c is drawn the previous study demonstrated that θ was in the range of 0 95 1 4 for compatible solutes and the value of θ depends on temperature as well as on kind and molarity of the compatible solute fig 10c shows that if the external salinity is constant the concentration of solutes secreted or accumulated by microorganisms is inversely proportional to the salinity which diffuses into the eps the larger the i θ t c value is the more solutes that microorganisms need to secrete or accumulate the θ value of compatible solutes is directly related to its protective effect on microorganisms the higher the θ value the more effective becomes the solutes against osmotic stress 4 conclusions although high osmotic pressure caused by salt contents inhibits anaerobic microorganisms a high salt tolerance and efficient treatment can still be achieved by sssab this study provides a novel biological method for treating saline organic wastewater besides a model for salt tolerant microorganism is proposed as a reference for future research 1 the sssab can operate efficiently and stably in treating actual hspw finally with a cod of 8731 mg l an olr of 6 98 kg cod m³ d and a salinity of 3 57 wt the cod removal reached 82 this value was higher than other reactors reported in the existing literature under similar salinity 2 the benzene series are the main organic matter in hspw and the rate limiting steps for a degradation of benzene series in hspw are the degradation of phenol and p cresol 3 the microbial flora in sssab became more specialized in treating saline organic wastewater since the salt tolerant microbe became more dominant such as bacteria mesotoga anaerophaga oceanotoga and aminobacterium declaration of

16586,in this study a spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor sssab was adopted for treating actual saline heparin sodium pharmaceutical wastewater hspw after adaptation under the influent cod of 8731 mg l olr of 6 98 kg cod m³ d and salinity of 3 57 wt the cod removal reached up to 82 this value is much higher than the reported for the other reactors at similar salinity benzenes are the major organic compounds in hspw the main rate limiting steps are the degradations of phenol and p cresol in addition the degradation pathways of typical benzenes in hspw were analyzed after adaptation the soluble salt content in the granular sludge increased and the bacterial extracellular polymers eps especially tightly bound eps also significantly increased 16s rrna analysis revealed that the microbial community in the anaerobic granular sludge ags had become adapted to the hspw treatment since mesotoga 12 4 anaerophaga 9 0 oceanotoga 6 1 and aminobacterium 4 1 increased from previously below 1 0 values the relative abundance of methanosarcina in the upper layer of the reactor 68 7 is significantly higher than that at the bottom 3 8 this proves the superiority of the sssab structure finally a model for salt tolerant microorganisms is given which proposes a mechanism for this study and provides reference for other anaerobic biological treatments of high salt containing wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic saline wastewater anaerobic biological treatment anaerobic salt tolerant flora model for salt tolerant microorganisms spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor 1 introduction over the years saline wastewater has been discharged in large volumes from industrial facilities producing agro food leather and petrochemicals hulsen et al 2019 lin et al 2020 shi et al 2015 in addition to high content of salt 1 wt such wastewater is also rich in organic matter chemical oxygen demand cod 2000 mg l li et al 2018 it is reported that such wastewater may account worldwide for as much as 5 of all wastewaters requiring treatment zhang et al 2020a such as heparin sodium pharmaceutical wastewater hspw heparin sodium is a valuable animal derived pharmaceutical that the medical community depends on to control blood coagulation in a number of patient applications a consistent supply of high quality heparin is needed for various purposes that contribute to immediate and long term medical needs of patients there are a large amount of hspw discharge in the production process of heparin sodium hspw usually contains high concentrations of salts and organic matter salinity 3 wt cod 8000 mg l current technologies for the treatment of saline organic wastewater include evaporation membrane filtration and their improved techniques deka et al 2019 mannina et al 2016 while the current technologies usually have the disadvantages of high costs and low removal banat et al 2005 the anaerobic biological treatment process has been regarded as the most logical concept for the treatment of highly concentrated organic wastewater in this process organic matter is anaerobically biodegraded to methane which is an energy source zhang et al 2020b in addition little excess sludge is generated unfortunately many salts contained in hspw will harm the anaerobic microorganisms and may lead to sludge loss and a reactor collapse gagliano et al 2017 preliminary studies have demonstrated that the reactor performance may worsen if the salinity of wastewater is above 1 wt lefebvre and moletta 2006 with regard to the inhibition of salts towards microorganisms two explanation exist on the one hand na and mg compete with enzymes protein for binding potential which can lead to a decreased of enzymatic activities or even inactivation on the other hand the high concentration of salts causes a high osmotic pressure salih and dastgheib 2017 which may cause dehydration plasmolysis and eventually a death of microorganisms onodera et al 2017 sudmalis et al 2018 according to previous studies gradually increasing the salinity can adapt the microorganisms to the salt concentrations this is a possibility for the treatment of saline organic wastewater lefebvre et al 2006 used an uasb reactor treating leather wastewater after adaptation for 307 d the cod removal reached 78 at an organic loading rate olr of 0 5 kg cod m3 d and a tds of 71 g l sierra et al also used an uasb reactor treating phenolic wastewater sierra et al 2019 after an adaptation time of 379 d the reactor collapsed before the salinity reached 26 g na l the results also show that the flora in the uasb reactor is highly volatile it is sensitive to changes in the salinity of the wastewater which indicates the instability of an uasb for treating saline organic wastewater in order to improve the degradation efficiency of saline organic wastewater meaning that the salinity tolerance should be increased and the adaptation time reduced we developed a highly efficient anaerobic reactor with own intellectual property rights the spiral symmetry stream anaerobic bioreactor sssab the structure and project photos of sssab are shown in fig s1 the sssab is divided into three reaction zones based on the anaerobic three stage theory in this reactor the hydraulic dead zone is minimized and the mass transfer efficiency between the granular sludge and the wastewater is increased through the spiral flow pattern which helps to achieve a rapid adaptation of the microbial flora in the reactor the superior operating performance of the sssab has been proven in previous studies chen et al 2016b dai et al 2017 2016 in a lab scale experiment the reactor run stably under the olr of 361 5 kg cod m3 d in the treatment of methanol sodium acetate wastewater chen et al 2016a in another pilot scale experiment the reactor run stably under the olr of 27 2 kg cod m3 d in the treatment of soybean process wastewater chen et al 2021 the reactor has also been put into project in the treatment of soybean process wastewater chinese pharmaceutical wastewater and polyacrylate containing wastewater in all tests a good cleaning effect was obtained the objective of this study was to 1 explore a technology for an efficient anaerobic biodegradation of saline organic wastewater 2 investigate the anaerobic degradation pathway of hspw and 3 analyze the mechanism of salt tolerance of the microflora the adaptation process of microflora in the sssab for treating hapw was divided into four phases low salt initiation phase stimulus response phase shock load phase and high salt stable phase the degradation pathways of organic matter the characteristics of the granular sludge and changes in the microbial flora were analyzed to explore the high efficiency mechanism of the reactor and to construct a model for salt tolerant microorganisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater the hspw originated from a pharmaceutical factory producing heparin in anhui province china eight different samples of hspw were collected the characteristics are reported in table 1 the high standard deviation reflects the high variability of the hspw 2 2 inoculated sludge for inoculation of the sssab anaerobic granular sludge obtained from sssab in a soybean product processing plant in jiangxi province china was used the average particle size of the sludge was ф2 25 mm the average settling velocity was 56 46 m h the density was 1 17 g cm3 and the vss ss value was 0 76 the sludge dosage accounted for about 40 of the effective volume of the sssab the concentration of wet sludge in reactor is 0 468 kg l and vss concentration accounts to 16 16 g vss l 2 3 reactor configuration and operation the apparatus is shown in fig 1 the experiments were performed using a lab scale sssab with an effective volume of 5 l the sssab was made of stainless steel it was heated by hot water circulation at a temperature of 39 2 c by a sponge layer the parameters and the schematic of the sssab have been described chen et al 2016b the influent was provided continuously to the sssab using a peristaltic pump the hrt was maintained at 30 h throughout the experiment the influent was hspw diluted with tap water in different proportions the experimental strategy was shown in table 2 2 4 analysis methods cod nh4 n mlss ph and mlvss were measured following apha s standard methods federation and association 2005 the alkalinity alk was analyzed by acid base indicator titration method and the carbonate alkalinity is calculated as caco3 salinity is measured by conductivity method particle size distribution was measured by a wet sieving method morphological characteristics of the ags were tested by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem hitachi s 4800 the eps were extracted from 50 ml ags and diluted to 2 l before analysis the extraction method of lb eps and tb eps was the two stage heat extraction method which can be found in the study of li yang 2007 fluorescence spectrograms of eps were recorded by a fluorospectro photometer hitachi himac cr 22gⅱ tga thermogravimetric analysis a thermal gravimetric analyzer mettler toledo tga 1 stare system was used soluble

removal the experimental process of adapting the microflora in the sssab was divided into four phases low salt initiation phase stimulus response phase shock load phase and high salt stable phase 1 phase 1 low salt initiation phase days 1 20 in this phase the sssab operated at a low olr 1 01 olr 3 05 kg cod m³ d as shown in fig 2 a and d with an olr of 1 01 kg cod m³ d and a salinity of 0 74 wt the cod removal reached up to 85 when the salinity further increased to 1 66 wt the cod removal finally stable at around 91 2 phase 2 stimulus response phase days 21 43 two shock experiments were operated in this phase in the first stimulus response 21 33d when the olr increased from 2 50 kg cod m³ d to 4 76 kg cod m³ d and the salinity increased from 1 41 wt to 2 82 wt the cod removal initially dropped to 78 but returned to around 90 in the second stimulus response 34 43d when the olr increased from 3 91 kg cod m³ d to 6 27 kg cod m³ d and salinity increased from 1 54 wt to 2 14 wt the cod removal reached 94 the two shock experiments show the excellent response of the microflora to changes of the olr and salinity in the sssab 3 phase 3 shock load phase days 44 70 in this phase the sssab adapted to a gradually increasing salinity when the olr increased from 3 90 kg cod m³ d to 5 79 kg cod m³ d and the salinity increased from 2 11 wt to 2 82 wt the cod removal dropped to 73 however after operating for 5 days the cod removal recovered to 86 4 phase 4 high salt stable phase days 71 92 in this phase the sssab operated with high olr and salinity when the olr increased from 4 20 kg cod m³ d to 6 47 kg cod m³ d and the salinity from 2 67 wt to 3 31 wt the cod removal dropped from 82 to 67 but later stable at around 81 finally with a cod of 8731 mg l an olr of 6 98 kg cod m³ d and a salinity of 3 57 wt the cod in the treated effluent reached 1562 mg l which means a corresponding cod removal of 82 compared with other anaerobic reactors used for the treatment of saline wastewater see table 3 sssab has obviously advantages in addition the biogas yield rate accounts to 205 5 ml h it means that the methane production capacity of the reactor accounts to 0 99 m3 m3 d which indicates the methanogenic activity and the recycling prospects 3 1 2 variations of nh4 n ph and alk as shown in fig 2b the change of nh4 n in influent is consistent with the change of salinity when the influent nh4 n account from 93 mg l to 495 mg l fig 2b the effluent nh4 n increased from 15 mg l to 536 mg l the increasing rate of nh4 n is always less than 10 the average influent ph was 7 18 and the effluent ph accounts to 8 18 a significant increase of ph can be seen as shown in fig 2c when the influent alk increase from 845 mg l to 2787 mg l the effluent alk account from 846 mg l to 2730 mg l the alk of influent and effluent are equivalent which indicates that the reactor achieved alk balance by itself those values indicate that the sssab run stably throughout the four phases chen et al 2021 3 2 degradation pathway of hspw according to the gc ms analysis a variety of organic substances occurs in hspw see fig 3 the benzene series in the influent and effluent accounts for 57 46 and 89 54 respectively this indicates that the benzene series are the main organic matter in hspw the other organics proportion decrease from 42 54 to 10 46 which indicated that those organics are degraded efficiently data in fig 4 a indicate that the main benzene series in hspw are phenol p cresol and indole after the treatment in the sssab phenol and p cresol were removed by 87 3 and 1 7 respectively this indicates that the main rate limiting steps for a degradation of benzene series are the degradation of phenol and p cresol however under aerobic conditions they can be effectively degraded by microorganisms mozo et al 2012 benzoic acid was detected in the effluent which is an intermediate of the anaerobic degradation of phenol and p cresol haggblom et al 1990 this indicates that these two compounds are degraded the probable reason for the increase of phenol and p cresol was that other high molecular weight organic compounds were degraded into phenol and p cresol the amount of indole decreased obviously indole is an organic compound composed of a benzene ring and a pyrrole bond it is typical intermediate of the anaerobic degradation of tryptophan tryptophan is a common substance of protein in pig intestines which are the raw material for heparin sodium production accordingly the anaerobic biodegradation of indole can be drawn as shown in fig 4b first the pyrrole bond in the indole is ketonated then the indole is converted to oxindole afterwards the pyrrole bond breaks because of its instability and the oxindole is converted to phenol p cresol and benzene series with one benzene ring subsequently the phenol and p cresol is converted to benzoic acid finally the benzene ring in benzoic acid is broken and vfas are produced subsequently these are converted to carbon dioxide and methane 3 3 efficient mechanism of the sssab 3 3 1 sem morphology of the ags in the sssab sludge bed the seed ags of sssab was black after adaptation some sludge turned gray see fig 5 a sem scanning electron microscope is used to observe the morphological differences between seed ags s ags adapted black ags b ags and adapted gray ags g ags as shown in fig 5b a comparation of s1 b1 and g1 indicates that the surface of the s ags is obviously rough while the surface of b ags and g ags are compact also the particle size is also significantly smaller than for s ags compare s2 and b2 the microbial flora in s ags is more diverse and complex compare b3 and g3 the obvious difference is that the content of filamentous bacteria in g ags is more than that in b ags and there is a network structure among the strains in g ags which may be the cause of the sludge turning gray as shown in s3 b3 and g3 there were lots of columnar matters with flat ends in s ags while there was no such columnar matter in b ags and g ags which indicates that the composition of granular sludge had undergone significant changes 3 3 2 thermogravimetric analysis of ags according to fig 6 a there is no significant difference between tg curves below 450 c however the weight loss of the seed ags and the adapted ags showed obvious difference with rising temperature from fig 6b the soluble salt contents in the ashes of the b ags and g ags were 31 9 0 7 and 30 7 0 7 respectively much higher than that in the s ags 5 3 0 4 the probable reason for these differences is that the microbial flora may have accumulated some salts in its eps and cells to balance the osmotic pressure inside and outside the organisms yan et al 2019 according to fig 6a the weight loss rate of ags is similar in shape but slightly different in weight loss peak value the first difference is at around 100 c which is related to the loss of tightly bound water here the s ags is slightly higher than that of the adapted sludge which indicates that the tightly bound water of ags was reduce after the adaptation of the saline environment the major peak is in the range of 200 375 c which is related to the loss of low molecular organic compounds huang et al 2016 here the s ags mass decreased by 32 4 and the adapted b ags and g ags masses by 33 8 and 34 7 respectively another peak is in the range of 375 450 c which was related to the loss of benzene series lignin and other refractory organic substances francioso et al 2010 molinuevo salces et al 2013 here the weight loss peak of the adapted ags is a little higher than the seed which can be explained by the absorption of benzene series by the ags above 500 c the weight loss of the adapted ags is significantly lower than that of the seeding ags this may be due to the fact that the residue of the adapted ags contains salts which are difficult to volatilize accordingly after adaptation the composition of the ags in the reactor has changed 3 3 3 variation of eps the 3d eem technique was used to provide direct information on the composition and content of the eps in the sludge as shown in fig 7 only two characteristic peaks are observed in the 3d eem spectra one peak a is located at excitation emission wavelengths ex em around 235 330 nm which is referring to aromatic protein like compounds and another peak located at around 280 310 nm which represents humic acid like substances li et al 2018 these two groups of substances are typical components of eps by comparison the concentration of substances in tb eps is the largest and the peak value for the eps in adapted ags is significantly higher than that in inoculated sludge these suggests that more eps are secreted by microorganisms in response to high salinity according to previous studies the eps are enhancing active transport and diffusion activities or provide a niche so as to help to achieve the balance between osmotic pressure in vivo and in vitro and to maintain normal metabolism he et al 2017 wang et al 2021 3 3 4 microbial community distributions in sssab the microbial communities in the sludge samples have been analyzed by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing table 4 shows the alpha diversity of the bacteria and archaea f s is the flocculent sludge sampled from upper part of the reactor the good s coverages values for bacteria and archaea were all more than 0 99 this shows that the current sequencing depth was sufficient to represent the diversity level of the microbial flora in ags the shannon diversity index and pielou evenness comprehensively reflect the diversity and evenness of the community yang et al 2018 compared with the s ags the microbial community of the adapted ags became more specific since the values of the shannon diversity index and the simpson index becomes smaller after the operation the chao1 and observed species values reflect the richness of the community compared with the s ags the number of microbial species in the adapted ags decreased significantly this indicates that the salinity significantly inhibits the microorganism fig 8 a shows the phylum level distributions of the bacteria in the four samples the main phyla in b ags include chloroflexi 25 1 bacteroidetes 13 3 firmicutes 8 2 proteobacteria 5 1 thermotogae 18 5 and synergistetes 14 7 compared with the s ags the abundance of the chloroflexi decreased from 44 7 to 25 1 while the abundances of thermotogae and synergistetes increased from less than 1 to 18 5 and 14 7 respectively the microbial composition in sample g ags were similar to b ags the difference was that the abundance of proteobacteria in g ags was much higher than the one in b ags the comparation of the data for sample f s and sample b ags yield significant differences the dominant phylum chloroflexi and thermotogae in the sample b ags and g ags can be detected hardly in f s while bacteroidetes and firmicutes become obviously dominant with relative abundance of 51 0 and 34 8 respectively proteobacteria thermotogae and synergistetes have been reported to be salt tolerant ji et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the synergistetes are also drug resistant xue et al 2019 and can be considered as a highly efficient bacteria phylum for hspw degradation fig 8b shows the genus level distributions of the bacteria in the four samples in sample b ags and g ags mesotoga 12 4 and 8 5 anaerophaga 9 0 and 4 4 oceanotoga 6 1 and 0 8 ebm 39 4 1 and 0 9 and aminobacterium 4 0 and 2 9 have become the dominant the values are relative abundance of genus of b ags and g ags respectively in contrast the relative abundance of those genus are all below 0 6 in the s ags the microbial flora distribution in sample g ags is similar to that in b ags however the microflora in f s is different in f s the relative abundances for bacteroides tepidimicrobium and sporanaerobacter account for 48 3 14 9 and 7 0 respectively while the three genus in the other samples account to less than 0 5 mesotoga anaerophaga oceanotoga and aminobacterium are typical anaerobic fermenting bacteria the relative abundances of those bacteria in samples b ags and g ags indicates that in the middle and lower layers of the sssab reactor specialize in the hydrolytic acidification of organic compounds bacteroides are acid producing bacteria with a low tolerance to toxic compounds a few bacteroides were found in the bottom while a large number of bacteroides were found in the upper part of the reactor this indicates that a large amount of inhibitory substances had been decomposed already in the bottom of sssab fig 8c depicts the distributions at the genus level for archaeal in the four samples in the adapted ags average value of samples b ags and g ags methanobacterium 49 8 methanosaeta 36 6 methanosarcina 3 8 candidatus methanofastidiosum 2 0 methanolinea 2 2 and bathyarchaeia 2 3 are the dominant genus the relative abundances for the candidatus methanofastidiosum methanolinea and bathyarchaeia are significantly lower than in the seeding in group f s methanobacterium 22 1 methanosaeta 7 0 and methanosarcina 68 7 are the dominant genus the relative abundance of the genus methanosarcina in sample b ags and s ags is low 3 8 and 0 1 respectively according to a study performed by sudmalis sudmalis et al 2018 methanosarcina is a salt tolerant organism which can counteract an increased osmotic pressure in the high salt wastewater by accumulating nε acetyl β lysine in its cell the analysis of the occurance of archaea shows that there are abundant methanogens with salt tolerance in the sssab especially in the upper free flora the relative abundance of methanogens is high and efficient 3 3 5 inhibitory mechanism of salinity on microorganisms in sssab 1 physical model of salinity inhibitory on microbial flora fig 9 depicts the model of the effect of salt on microbial flora and microbe during adaptation salt ion enter the interior of ags with hspw anaerobic microorganisms secrete a large amount of eps through degradation of organics in hspw to protect the bacteria and maintain normal metabolic function tang et al 2021 fig 9a depicts the mechanisms of salinity effect on non salt tolerant microbe as the salinity increases the activity of microorganism is inhibited enzymatic activity of microbe is destroyed and the metabolism of microbe becomes deterioration at the same time with the increase of salinity the osmotic pressure of the environment increases which cause the microbe to dehydrate plasmolysis and even to die he et al 2017 kobayashi et al 2018 fig 9b depicts the salt tolerant mechanism of salt tolerant bacteria when the salinity and osmotic pressure increase the salt tolerant microbe will accumulate salt ion and compatible solute and secret solutes to achieve osmotic pressure balance among bacteria eps and the environment kempf and bremer 1998 zeng et al 2020 by this way the salt tolerant microbe can metabolize normally grow and become the dominant species in the microbial flora 2 salt ion diffusion model for changing salinity fig 10 a depicts the diffusion of salt ion and the secretion of compatible solute or protein the salts in hspw are mainly nacl fick s law was used to characterize the diffusion of nacl in eps the mass of salt entering a small volume element through a certain section in dt time is 1 dm da dc dx dt where m is the mass of the salt ion passing through the section d is the diffusion coefficient a is the area of the section in the diffusion direction c is the concentration of salt ions dc dx is the gradient of the concentration of the salt ion in the diffusion direction and t is the time the mass of salt ion leaving the small volume element in dt time is 2 d m da dc dx 2 c x 2 dx dt where 2 c x 2 dx is the increment of the concentration gradient from x to x dx dc dx 2 c x 2 dx is the concentration gradient at x dx by subtracting eq 2 from eq 1 the increment of salt ion in the small volume element in the time of dt can be obtained 3 dm d m da 2 c x 2 dx dt on the basis of eq 3 eq 4 can be derived 4 dm d m adx d 2 c x 2 dt where adx is the volume of the small volume element and dm d m adx is the concentration of salt ion of the small volume element eq 5 can be derived from eq 4 5 c t d 2 c x 2 eq 5 shows that the rate of change of concentration in a small volume element with time is proportional to the second derivative of the concentration with respect to the distance in the diffusion direction this indicates that thicker eps can better protect the bacteria in addition it indicates that when the increase rate of salinity in the wastewater is uneven too fast the salinity in the eps will increase rapidly and the osmotic pressure shock will cause greater damage to the microbial cells 3 osmotic pressure equilibrium model when salinity stable according to the osmotic pressure calculation formula held and sadowski 2016 the osmotic pressure of the external environment can be calculated 6 π 1 irt c salt where π is the osmotic pressure of the external environment i is calibration factor for osmotic pressure calculation its value is the number of particles that can be produced by a single molecule of electrolyte in solution for nacl i 2 r is the gas constant which in an ideal state is 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature in kelvin and c salt is the molar concentration of salt ions the osmotic pressure of the eps can be calculated 7 π 2 irt c salt in rt c solutes out θ t c where c salt in is the molar concentration of salt ions diffused into eps c solutes out is the molar concentration of solute secreted by microbe into eps and θ is its osmotic coefficient it describes the molecular interactions in the solution and depends on temperature as well as on kind and molarity of the compatible solute in equilibrium π 1 π 2 and eq 8 can be derived 8 irt c salt irt c salt in rt c solutes out θ t c on the basis of eq 8 eq 9 can be derived 9 c solutes out i θ t c c salt c salt in according to eq 6 and the experiment values fig 10b is drawn when the salinity is lower than 1 04 wt the microorganisms are not inhibited this was because that eps generally have a net negative charge ajao et al 2018 which enables them to adsorb heavy metals and prevents their diffusion into the deeper parts of the biofilm at low concentration of mentals harrison et al 2007 the reactor finally reaches a salinity of 3 57 wt now the final osmotic pressure of the solution which the microorganisms endure is 3079 kpa eq 8 shows that the salt ions diffuse into the eps and cause eps production to maintain the osmotic pressure balance with the external environment while it worth noting an accumulation of compatible solutes will not inhibit the activity of microorganisms but if the salt ion concentration is too high it will cause the microbe to lose water and eventually die held and sadowski 2016 according to eq 9 references held et al 2010 and the experiment values fig 10c is drawn the previous study demonstrated that θ was in the range of 0 95 1 4 for compatible solutes and the value of θ depends on temperature as well as on kind and molarity of the compatible solute fig 10c shows that if the external salinity is constant the concentration of solutes secreted or accumulated by microorganisms is inversely proportional to the salinity which diffuses into the eps the larger the i θ t c value is the more solutes that microorganisms need to secrete or accumulate the θ value of compatible solutes is directly related to its protective effect on microorganisms the higher the θ value the more effective becomes the solutes against osmotic stress 4 conclusions although high osmotic pressure caused by salt contents inhibits anaerobic microorganisms a high salt tolerance and efficient treatment can still be achieved by sssab this study provides a novel biological method for treating saline organic wastewater besides a model for salt tolerant microorganism is proposed as a reference for future research 1 the sssab can operate efficiently and stably in treating actual hspw finally with a cod of 8731 mg l an olr of 6 98 kg cod m³ d and a salinity of 3 57 wt the cod removal reached 82 this value was higher than other reactors reported in the existing literature under similar salinity 2 the benzene series are the main organic matter in hspw and the rate limiting steps for a degradation of benzene series in hspw are the degradation of phenol and p cresol 3 the microbial flora in sssab became more specialized in treating saline organic wastewater since the salt tolerant microbe became more dominant such as bacteria mesotoga anaerophaga oceanotoga and aminobacterium declaration of

16587,selective removal of atrazine atz in wastewater and clarification of the degradation intermediate toxicity correlation are of great importance a newly molecularly imprinted 001 facets exposed tio2 mi tio2 001 photoanode with strong catalytic and selective ability was designed atz was selectively removed from pesticide wastewater reaching 1 9 µg l 1 approximately 1 10 of the concentration achieved with nonselective treatment this selective removal originated from the preferential adsorption and enrichment of atz onto mi tio2 001 the highly specific recognition relied on the halogen bond and strong hydrogen bond formed between the cl atom and triazine ring π orbital of atz and the surface oh group of mi tio2 001 as well as the recognition of mi tio2 001 to the shape and size of atz the specific interaction leads to different accumulations of intermediates the correlation of intermediate and toxicity was also discussed aquatic toxicity was rapidly reduced through the direct dealkylation path and due to the accumulation of highly toxic 2 hydroxy 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino s triazine there will be transient fluctuations via the dechlorination hydroxylation path first the final product was identified as nearly nontoxic cyanuric acid the selective accumulation of which indicated that there was almost 100 removal of aquatic toxicity and cytotoxicity with only 9 8 removal of total organic carbon this work provides new insight into the correlation of pollutant degradation intermediates and changes in toxicity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords selective removal atrazine photoelectrocatalysis intermediates toxicity reduction 1 introduction atrazine atz is a commonly used herbicide in agricultural fields due to its low cost and high efficiency with an annual worldwide consumption of 70 000 90 000 tons zhang et al 2017a mu et al 2019 however atz was listed as a possible carcinogen by the united states environmental protection agency epa browner 1998 according to reports atz can accumulate in organisms inducing significant oxidative stress in zebrafish above 10 μgl 1 which stimulates oxidative damage and severe cytotoxicity jin et al 2010 valavanidis et al 2006 gunkel and streit 1980 rats even experienced cell apoptosis of erythrocytes after daily oral administration of atz at 300 mgkg 1 body weight for 21 days singh et al 2008 bhatti et al 2011 pesticide production wastewater and agricultural runoff are one of the important sources of atz with concentrations up to mgl 1 jing et al 2017 graymore et al 2001 denoyelles et al 1982 pereira and hostettler 1993 readman et al 1993 schottler et al 1994 as one of the persistent organic pollutants atz is hard to be efficiently removed by conventional treatments such as adsorption and biological methods nava montes et al 2020 ryu et al 2021 besides rapid saturation of adsorbents results in decreased removal efficiency due to competitive adsorption of interferents babel and kurniawan 2003 and it is hard to maintain the activity of microorganisms because of the toxicity of atz to them kadian et al 2008 after treatment the concentration of atz can still reach tens of μgl 1 possessing high risk derakhshan et al 2018 thus it is undoubtedly necessary to completely remove atz and eliminate its toxicity before wastewater discharge currently most traditional advanced treatment methods such as photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis to remove atz were usually carried out under the condition of deionized water and the removal efficiency was approximately 85 100 yola et al 2014 fernandez domene et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 however they did not study the removal efficiency of atz in actual wastewater even when used for agricultural and municipal water 76 84 removal of atz was observed which means that complete removal requires a longer degradation time or further catalyst addition so more energy consumption and complex catalyst recycling were needed majhi et al 2020 miranda garcia et al 2011 for the bioremediation method atz could be degraded by approximately 90 within a few days to tens of days getenga et al 2009 yu et al 2018 this long repair time obviously limits the efficiency of wastewater treatment for the treatment method combining photocatalysis and microalgae only 64 3 of atz was removed after photocatalysis and 8 days of biodegradation which is not ideal hu et al 2021 selective treatment is a new and advanced technology that can selectively enrich toxic targets in actual wastewater with a large number of nontoxic interferents improve its removal efficiency and save energy cai et al 2021 however most of the previous selective treatments focus on the concentration change of targets rather than the toxicity change chai et al 2017 cantarella et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 according to reports higher cumulative toxicity may occur during atz degradation process mu et al 2019 sudrajat 2017 selective removal may avoid the production of highly toxic intermediates or change the accumulation of intermediates so that the toxicity of the system is continuously reduced cai et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to focus on the removal of toxicity during the selective degradation of atz previous works on atz degradation mainly only discussed the removal in atz concentration and degradation path khan et al 2014 wang et al 2015 ji et al 2019 shi et al 2019 however 100 atz removal does not mean the elimination of toxicity currently total organic carbon toc is usually used as a risk evaluation indicator as reported toc decreased by 12 7 88 after treatment under deionized water conditions which did not mean that the byproducts were completely consumed nor can it directly indicate that the system was nontoxic wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2014 bu et al 2019 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 li et al 2019 hong et al 2019 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2014 sanchis et al 2014 khan et al 2013 pineda arellano et al 2013 garza campos et al 2014 jain et al 2009 thus the complete removal of toxicity should be paid more attention rather than toc removal during degradation of toxic pollutants according to reports the aquatic toxicity was reduced by 22 5 90 after atz degradation which did not achieve the goal of toxicity elimination zhu et al 2014 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 yang et al 2014 pineda arellano et al 2013 tian et al 2021 some literatures also mentioned that the toxicity increased after treatment bu et al 2019 sanchis et al 2014 the researchers attributed this to the production of some more toxic byproducts during atz degradation bu et al 2019 sanchis et al 2014 therefore if the relationship between degradation products and toxicity was clarified the goal of rapid and totally detoxification can be achieved this may be a very important reference for the detoxification researches of other toxic pollutants in environments in order to significantly improve the oxidation efficiency the photoelectrochemical oxidation method that greatly reduces or avoids the rapid recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs is used to remove atz garcia segura and brillas 2017 in this work molecular imprints were directly constructed on high oxidative capacity tio2 with highly 001 facets due to the relatively clear expression ability of molecular imprints yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2017b selective photoelectrochemical removal of atz in the presence of highly concentrated interferents was proposed the selectivity originated from the preferential adsorption and enrichment of atz on mi tio2 001 the possible recognition mechanism was investigated by operando attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and uv vis spectroscopy the reaction intermediates were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc and lc mass spectrometry lc ms to establish a degradation pathway the intermediate toxicity correlation was also explained further application of our photoelectrochemical protocol in actual pesticide wastewater treatment demonstrated the selective removal of atz as well as toxicity reduction this study may provide new insight into the correlation of pollutant degradation intermediates and changes in toxicity 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals atz 2 hydroxy 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino

calcined at 450 c for 1 h to remove the atz molecules traditional sol gel tio2 electrodes with molecular imprints mi tio2 sg were prepared by a sol gel spin coating method on fto substrate the experimental details of the preparation of four electrodes are recorded in the supporting information si 2 3 photoelectrochemical analysis photoelectrochemical tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation chi 660c ch instruments usa with a traditional three electrode system the counter electrode reference electrode and electrolyte were a platinum sheet 1 5 6 cm2 saturated calomel electrode sce and 0 1 moll 1 na2so4 respectively potentials were recorded according to the reference electrode unless otherwise specified atz was present at a concentration of 2 0 mgl 1 the reactor was a 50 ml quartz cell which was irradiated from outside with a 150 w la 410uv 3 lamp hayashi japan the distance between the working electrode and the center of the lamp was 1 0 cm more information is recorded in the si 2 4 degradation experiments and intermediate analysis photoelectrochemical degradation experiments were employed in a 50 ml water jacketed quartz cell which externally connected to a constant potential rectifier hdy 1 nanjing sangli electronic equipment factory china and circulating water system to keep a constant temperature at 25 c a 300 w high voltage lamp pe300buv perfect light ltd beijing equipped with a uv reflector uvref perfect light ltd beijing was used as the light source the amount of tio2 on fto was about 50 mg and the geometric area of the working electrode was limited to 7 5 cm2 the degradation experiments were studied at 0 6 v vs sce for 3 0 h the atz concentration was measured by hplc thermo u3000 usa with a solid phase

ecosar v2 0 from the epa more information is recorded in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of electrode morphology as shown in supplementary fig 1a scanning electron microscopy sem revealed that the as synthesized mi tio2 001 had a nanosheet morphology high resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction patterns proved to be 001 facets with an exposure ratio of 91 after calculation yang et al 2008 liu et al 2016 characteristic vibrational bands assigned to atz were observed for mi tio2 001 before calcination which disappeared after calcination indicating successful removal of the templates supplementary fig 2 martinneto et al 1994 mi tio2 sg constructed by the traditional sol gel method was composed of irregular nanoparticle aggregates supplementary fig 1e indicating a polycrystalline structure supplementary fig 1c and f suggests that the morphology of nonimprinted electrodes was similar to that of imprinted electrodes the diffraction peaks in the x ray diffraction xrd patterns and the characteristic peaks in raman spectra corresponded to anatase tio2 the intensity of which suggested high crystallinity of 001 tio2 supplementary fig 3 yu et al 2013 3 2 strong oxidation ability and excellent selectivity of mi tio2 001 the photoelectrochemical oxidation process of atz at the mi tio2 001 electrode was systematically investigated the chopped light lsv curve supplementary fig 4 showed that the onset potential of anodic water oxidation was 1 6 v in the dark under irradiation an obvious atz oxidation photocurrent emerged at mi tio2 001 to investigate the potential dependency of atz oxidative degradation on mi tio2 001 the removal efficiency at voltages of 0 2 v 0 4 v 0 6 v 0 8 v and 1 0 v were determined as shown in supplementary fig 5 the removal efficiency increased from 0 2 to 0 6 v but decreased at a higher anodic potential a total of 99 8 atz was removed after 3 0 h at 0 6 v which was the maximum value this result might be due to the electrode having the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency at 0 56 v which was 5 26 implying electroassisted photocatalysis supplementary fig 6 thus 0 6 v was applied for subsequent experiments to assess the photoelectroxidation ability of various electrodes of atz from fig 1 a the photocurrent density of tio2 001 was 1 86 times that of tio2 sg in addition epr spectra with a characteristic peak intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 for dmpo oh confirmed that oh is the dominant reactive oxygen species in pec fig 1b cai et al 2019 the peak intensities and further quantification supplementary fig 8 suggested that high oh levels were produced in tio2 001 the relatively high photocurrent density and oh content indicated the excellent oxidative ability of the 001 facets in comparison to sg in addition the smaller charge transfer resistance supplementary fig 9 extended light absorption range supplementary fig 10a and longer carrier lifetime supplementary fig 10b rationalized the higher photoelectrocatalytic activity of tio2 001 than that of sg degradation experiments for atz at different electrodes also proved this result approximately 99 8 and 79 1 of atz degraded at the mi tio2 001 and mi tio2 sg photoanodes supplementary fig 11a respectively atz degradation followed a first order rate law with a rate constant of 1 73 h 1 at the mi tio2 001 electrode which was 2 38 times higher than that at the mi tio2 sg electrode supplementary fig s11b next the specific recognition ability of several electrodes for atz was investigated in a mixed system with some structural analogs propazine prometon simazine cyanuric chloride 4 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol as interferents aquino et al 2017 the anti interference ability of the two component system catz cinterferents 1 3 considering the water solubility in supplementary table s1 is expressed by the interference factor which is defined as follows i n t e r f e r e n c e f a c t o r j m i x j a t z j a t z j b l a n k 100 where jblank is the photocurrent density of electrodes in 0 1 moll na2so4 solution and jmix and jatz are the photocurrent densities with and without the addition of interferents respectively the voltage was set to 0 6 v vs sce fig 1c showed that the interference factors of all interferents were below 7 at mi tio2 001 while those at ni tio2 001 were nearly 100 extremely poor anti interference ability as shown in supplementary fig s12a it indicated that the strong anti interference ability as well as exceptional recognition ability for the target atz was still realized at mi tio2 001 even under the interference of structural analogs and it can be concluded that the anti interference ability was closely related to the construction of mi the comparison between mi tio2 sg and ni tio2 sg also confirmed this point the interference factors of all interferents at mi tio2 sg were 7 0 14 5 times higher than those at mi tio2 001 supplementary fig s12 which highlighted the benefit of the 001 crystal plane for the construction of mi for the highly specific recognition of atz this observation might be attributed to the fact that the 001 facet of single crystal tio2 with a smooth surface bears a higher mi expression degree leading to a more specific recognition of the target atz zhang et al 2017b zhang et al 2020 to explore the underlying reason for the selective removal of atz the adsorption under various conditions was studied in detail the static adsorption results shown in supplementary fig 13 illustrated that the amount of atz adsorbed on mi tio2 001 was 1 36 times higher than that on ni tio2 001 which can be inferred that the construction of mi may increase the specific recognition sites for atz herein the structural analogs in the above anti interference test such as propazine and simazine were also employed catz cinterferents 1 3 after adding interferents the adsorption amount of atz on mi tio2 001 decreased slightly 8 4 while it dropped 37 6 43 9 on ni tio2 001 reinforcing the strong adsorption of atz on mi tio2 001 in addition quartz crystal microbalance qcm was used to further study the specific adsorption of atz in actual pesticide wastewater by the electrodes qcm frequency changes versus solution density and viscosity according to kanazawa equation deakin and buttry 1989 δ f f 0 3 2 η s ρ s π μ q ρ q 1 2 where ηs is the solution viscosity and ρs is the solution density δf is the change in the oscillation frequency f0 is the oscillation frequency of the fundamental mode of the qcm ρq is the density of quartz 2 648 g cm 3 and μq is the shear modulus of quartz 2 947 1011 gcm 1 s 2 as evident in fig 1d δf of atz was collected in a one component system catz 53 4 µgl 1 or in actual wastewater from a pesticide production plant catz 53 4µgl 1 after atz was added to the one component system δf of atz at mi tio2 001 was 3 68 times that observed for ni tio2 001 indicating a high affinity of atz to mi tio2 001 to achieve surface enrichment for an actual wastewater system δf at ni tio2 001 was a little larger which may be attributed to the much higher molecular weight of interferents compared to that of the target atz δf caused by these interferent adsorptions on ni tio2 001 was 3 39 times higher than that on mi tio2 001 implying the more nonselective adsorption of interferents vs atz on ni tio2 001 according to the above results selective adsorption led to atz enrichment on mi tio2 001 which assisted in the preferential removal of the target atz 3 3 the specific recognition mechanism of selective electrode to atz the possible recognition mechanism for atz in the adsorption process was investigated by operando ir spectroscopy to eliminate the interference of hydrogen bonds in h2o and to determine whether the hydrogen bonds originated from water or formed between atz and catalysts ccl4 was used as the solvent under anhydrous conditions as shown in fig 2 a the peak at 3228 cm 1 was attributed to the oh group formed between atz and mi tio2 001 chien et al 2016 after adsorption of atz on mi tio2 001 the in plane deformation peaks of its triazine ring two peaks at 1620 and 1543 cm 1 supplementary fig 2 split into multiple small peaks fig 2a which originated from the hydrogen bond interaction between the triazine ring π orbital and the oh on the mi tio2 001 surface martinneto et al 1994 ariraman et al 2015 in addition the υ ccl vibration peak of atz 806 cm 1 supplementary fig 2 showed an 8 cm 1 redshift upon adsorption fig 2a implying that a halogen bond was formed between the cl atom of atz and mi tio2 001 shi et al 2019 hall et al 1991 however there was no peak shift for ni tio2 001 adsorbed atz besides as reported the nanocavities generated after templates removal are complementary to target molecules in shape size and functional groups which is conducive to the selective recognition of targets in the presence of structural analogs interferents chen et al 2016 tada and iwasawa 2003 canlas et al 2012 galarneau et al 1995 the previous anti interference results confirmed that the specific recognition also relied on selective recognition of mi tio2 001 to the shape and size of atz except for strong hydrogen bonds oh π and halogen bonds formed between them the multiple interaction was beneficial to the enrichment of atz near the mi tio2 001 electrode and the subsequent selective removal a much weaker atr signal was observed on the ni tio2 001 surface due to the weak interaction between atz and the electrode the atz electrode interaction was further studied by xps fig 2b demonstrates the n 1 s spectra for pure atz and mi tio2 001 after the adsorption of atz labeled mi tio2 001 atz for pure atz the peaks at 399 1 and 397 0 ev corresponded to the c n group of the triazine ring and the nh group respectively wang et al 2009 the peaks shifted positively by 1 1 0 9 ev implying the strong chemical interaction between the triazine ring and nh group of atz and mi tio2 001 as shown in fig 2c the peaks of cl 2p3 2 and cl 2p1 2 shifted positively by 0 3 and 0 7 ev respectively indicating that a halogen bond was formed between atz and mi tio2 001 wang et al 2009 liu et al 2009 besides the o 1 s spectra of mi tio2 001 after atz adsorption clearly illustrated a 0 5 0 6 ev positive shift in the binding energies of the ti o ti and oh groups compared with mi tio2 001 before adsorption supplementary fig 16 xu et al 2018 this increase in binding energy may be due to electron redistribution after atz interacted with the ti o ti and oh groups of mi tio2 001 similar increases were also found in the c 1 s spectrum of atz and the ti 2p spectrum of mi tio2 001 supplementary fig 17 therefore chemical interactions i e oh triazine ring and halogen bond were confirmed between atz and mi tio2 001 the relatively high affinity was further evidenced by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy higashimoto et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 as shown in supplementary fig 18 no visible light absorption was observed for atz and the two kinds of 001 tio2 after adsorption of atz visible light absorption above 400 nm was observed on mi tio2 001 in contrast there was almost no absorption difference observed for ni tio2 001 after atz adsorption as reported visible light absorption may originate from multiple interactions between atz and mi tio2 001 such as hydrogen bonds oh π and halogen bonds shi et al 2019 thus the newly emerged visible light absorption on mi tio2 001 upon atz adsorption corroborates the stronger binding owing to the construction of mi sites which was beneficial to the enrichment of atz and subsequent selective removal 3 4 proposed degradation pathway of atz on electrodes to further study the degradation process of atz a series of potential resolved operando ir spectra were acquired fig 3 a b the spectra were recorded after subtracting the background that is the spectrum when the atz adsorption reached saturation on the electrode surface significant changes were observed on the two electrodes when a 0 2 v anodic bias was applied the peak of υ rnh2 appeared at 1671 cm 1 on mi tio2 001 implying the fracture of atz branch chains kolekar et al 2014 the vibration peak at 1117 cm 1 was assigned to the υ coh of phenols indicating the cleavage of ccl and formation of hydroxylation intermediates palmisano et al 1994 the consumption peak at approximately 1298 cm 1 corresponded to δ cn suggesting the emergence of a dealkylation product at 0 2 v on mi tio2 001 martinneto et al 1994 the consumption peak of the isopropyl group with a peak intensity of 1 1 at 1385 and 1375 cm 1 was not found which may be due to its intrinsic low intensity or low concentration marzec et al 2011 at a higher bias 0 8 v the δ cn peak started to be consumed on ni tio2 001 consistent with the faster oxidation of atz on mi tio2 001 derived from the strong interaction between the target atz and mi tio2 001 the lower peak intensity observed for the ni tio2 001 electrode under the same conditions further supported the distinct interaction due to the construction of mi the peak displacement may be related to the change in the applied potential the above potential resolved operando ir experiments showed that the degradation process of atz on selective and nonselective electrodes may be different so the characterization of the intermediates formed during the photoelectrochemical oxidation of atz can provide insight into the degradation pathway of the two methods eight intermediates were characterized by lc ms detailed information was listed in supplementary table s2 and a possible photoelectroxidation pathway was proposed in fig 4 two possible routes were proposed in the first path the dechlorination hydroxylation reaction occurred to obtain the primary intermediate heit m z 198 after calculation the bond length of the ccl bond was determined to be 1 734 å the longest among all bonds in atz so its cleavage was the easiest chen et al 2009 as most studies mentioned the first step of the degradation mechanism consisted of fast dechlorination hydroxylation khan et al 2014 chen et al 2009 next heit can be further transformed into two potential secondary intermediates by dealkylation at different positions namely hait m z 170 and heat m z 156 after further dealkylation the downstream intermediate oaat m z 128 was formed finally the key downstream intermediate ooot m z 130 was observed the difference was that the first step in the second path was a direct dealkylation reaction which removed the alkyl group from the side chain of atz to obtain the desethyl product cait m z 188 and the desisopropyl product ceat m z 174 respectively this was followed by further dealkylation to yield caat m z 146 and then oaat via dechlorination hydroxylation finally the key downstream intermediate ooot was also observed at the nonselective electrode the types of intermediates are the same as those at the selective electrode and there is no difference in the predicted degradation path 3 5 intermediate accumulation during atz degradation process however the previously different degradation kinetics of atz at the two electrodes led us to speculate that the cumulative concentration of intermediates may be different during the degradation process thus the concentration changes of all intermediates at the selective and nonselective electrodes are plotted in figs 5 a 5b and s19 the concentrations of most intermediates first increased and then decreased but the maximum cumulative concentration of each intermediate and the temporal time varied the dechlorinated hydroxylated intermediate heit and dealkylated intermediates cait and ceat accumulated in the early stage of degradation the maximum concentration ratio crmax is the ratio of the maximum cumulative molar concentration of intermediates to the initial molar concentration of atz the crmax of heit on mi tio2 001 and ni tio2 001 were 0 078 at 1 0 h and 0 109 at 1 5 h respectively cait and ceat peaked at 10 min on mi tio2 001 while they peaked at 0 5 1 0 h on ni tio2 001 the crmax of cait and ceat on ni tio2 001 was 2 95 and 3 00 times that on mi tio2 001 respectively the crmax of the primary intermediates on the mi tio2 001 electrode was smaller than that on the ni tio2 001 electrode and the time to reach crmax was shorter indicating a faster atz decomposition process on the mi tio2 001 electrode due to the fast degradation rate the initial intermediates were rapidly oxidized and decomposed at mi tio2 001 in addition the order of their crmax was heit cait ceat this result is consistent with those of previous studies where dechlorination occurred easily and promptly and the fracture of ethyl groups occurred more easily than that of isopropyl groups khan et al 2014 chen et al 2009 ta et al 2006 later further dealkylated secondary intermediates hait heat and caat accumulated gradually and then decomposed the crmax of secondary intermediates on ni tio2 001 was 1 15 1 52 times higher than that on mi tio2 001 then secondary intermediates gradually oxidized to tertiary intermediates ooat which peaked at 3 0 h the crmax of oaat on ni tio2 001 was 1 15 times higher than that on mi tio2 001 the concentration ratio of the final intermediate ooot increased continuously as the reaction proceeded approaching 0 716 on mi tio2 001 1 51 times higher than that on ni tio2 001 less accumulation of secondary and tertiary intermediates with more accumulation of the final intermediate indicated a greater degradation degree of the target atz on the mi tio2 001 electrode in fact there are differences in the toxicity of different intermediates and the toxicity caused by the same intermediate also varies with concentration therefore the toxicity evolution of atz in the selective and nonselective photoelectrochemical oxidation process may be different mu et al 2019 sudrajat 2017 3 6 toxicity reduction during atz degradation process oxidative stress is usually used as an indicator of cytotoxicity which was evaluated by the changes in mda concentration of cells during treatment as shown in fig 5d and s20 jin et al 2010 campos pereira et al 2012 toughan et al 2018 the δmda concentration was the value after subtracting the mda concentration of the control group without atz 109 8 µmoll 1 per mg of protein after adding atz the δmda concentration increased by 99 5 105 7 µmoll 1 per mg of protein demonstrating lipid peroxidation and severe cytotoxicity during the degradation process the mda concentration gradually decreased and it decreased faster after treatment with the mi tio2 001 electrode the final δmda concentration was merely 2 9 µmoll 1 per mg of protein after degradation with the mi tio2 001 electrode for 5 0 h while it was 44 2 µmoll 1 per mg of protein after degradation with the ni tio2 001 electrode supplementary fig 20 this result suggested that no lipid peroxidation or cytotoxicity was observed after treatment with mi tio2 001 while obvious oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation remained after treatment with ni tio2 001 it is worth noting that the concentration of all intermediates in the early degradation stage increased with decreasing cytotoxicity when the concentration of primary intermediates began to decrease the cytotoxicity continued to decrease thus the primary intermediates were not the main reason for cytotoxicity changes similarly the accumulation of secondary and tertiary intermediates began to decrease in the mid degradation period while the cytotoxicity was still reduced excluding their primary effect in addition ooot accumulated continuously during the whole degradation process and the cytotoxicity decreased sustainably the further pearson correlation coefficient in supplementary fig 24 between the decrease of δmda and the accumulation of ooot was 0 971 suggesting a significant positive relevance between the reduction of cytotoxicity and the accumulation of ooot high cytotoxicity may lead to further apoptosis which was visually authenticated by the fluorescence image of cells exposure to atz caused notable apoptosis fig 5e compared with the control group supplementary fig 20a after treatment with the mi tio2 001 electrode almost no apoptosis was observed fig 5f whereas apoptosis was still observed after treatment with the ni tio2 001 electrode supplementary fig 20b this result showed the excellent detoxification ability of the mi tio2 001 electrode which was due to the large accumulation of low toxicity intermediates caused by the rapid oxidation of atz to further explore the intermediate toxicity correlation of atz the aquatic toxicity of all intermediates was measured by ec50 as shown in fig 5c the ec50 of all intermediates except heit was higher than that of the parent pollutant atz indicating the relatively high toxicity of heit and reduced toxicity of other intermediates the luminescence inhibition rate of hait 80 mgl 1 and oaat 25 mgl 1 at nearly saturated solubility was still less than 15 indicating that they were almost nontoxic it is speculated that the toxicity of atz reduced rapidly through the direct dealkylation path when degrading through dechlorination hydroxylation at the first step the toxicity likely fluctuated briefly during the degradation process because of the accumulation of heit with the degradation of atz the removal of aquatic toxicity first increased then decreased and finally reached 100 fig 5d initially although highly toxic heit accumulated slowly the removal of aquatic toxicity increased rapidly due to the large accumulation of almost nontoxic ooot and other low toxicity intermediates subsequently the accumulation of almost nontoxic ooot and other low toxicity intermediates slowed significantly with an unchanged accumulation rate of highly toxic heit so the removal of aquatic toxicity began to decrease when the accumulation of heit reached the maximum toxicity removal reached its minimum then the accumulation of highly toxic heit began to decrease other low toxicity or nontoxic intermediates still accumulated and the toxicity removal increased therefore the decrease in aquatic toxicity was inversely proportional to the accumulation of highly toxic heit and directly proportional to the low or nontoxic intermediates the accumulation of almost nontoxic ooot was much larger than that of other low toxicity intermediates so the removal of aquatic toxicity mainly depends on the accumulation of ooot the removal trend of aquatic toxicity for ni tio2 001 was similar to that for mi tio2 001 supplementary fig 22 in contrast the elimination of aquatic toxicity in the initial stage was mainly due to the accumulation of low toxicity heat the reduction in the removal of toxicity stemmed from the fact that heat accumulation slowed significantly while highly toxic heit was still accumulating when the heit concentration reached its peak the reduction in toxicity was minimal then with the consumption of heit and the high accumulation of ooot and heat the toxicity removal increased significantly thus the decrease in toxicity was mainly related to the accumulation of ooot and heat the comparison of toc removal and toxicity reduction with literature was shown in table 1 as reported toc decreased by 12 7 88 after treatment under deionized water conditions which did not mean that the byproducts were completely consumed nor can it directly indicate that the system was nontoxic wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2014 bu et al 2019 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 li et al 2019 hong et al 2019 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2014 sanchis et al 2014 khan et al 2013 pineda arellano et al 2013 garza campos et al 2014 jain et al 2009 thus the complete removal of toxicity should be paid more attention rather than toc removal during degradation of toxic pollutants according to reports the aquatic toxicity was reduced by 22 5 90 after atz degradation zhu et al 2014 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 yang et al 2014 pineda arellano et al 2013 tian et al 2021 some literatures also mentioned that the toxicity of the system increased after treatment bu et al 2019 sanchis et al 2014 the researchers attributed this to the production of some more toxic products during atz degradation bu et al 2019 sanchis et al 2014 in this work 58 2 of toc and 100 of toxicity was reduced the elimination of toxicity was origined from the massive accumulation of nearly nontoxic final product in selective treatment this may provide a reference for the detoxification of other toxic organic pollutants the aquatic toxicity of wastewater was also estimated by the ecosar program with two indicators of acute toxicity and chronic toxicity as shown in table 2 according to the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals ghs all intermediates were classified into four categories according to lc50 ec50 chv very toxic 1 mgl 1 toxic 1 mgl 1 10 mgl 1 harmful 10 mgl 1 100 mgl 1 and not harmful 100 mgl 1 among all intermediates the acute and chronic toxicity of ooot was relatively low thus ooot might be an indicator of toxicity reduction the intermediates causing increased toxicity were different from the abovementioned experimental results however regardless of the path taken the acute and chronic toxicity of the system toward fish daphnid and green algae would significantly decrease after fluctuation 3 7 selective removal and toxicity reduction of atz in actual wastewater wastewater from a pesticide plant after anaerobic anoxic oxic treatment was employed to further assess the selective removal of atz at electrodes in a real aquatic system the specific water quality indicators are shown in supplementary table s4 after photoelectrocatalysis for 5 0 h 96 5 of atz was eliminated with a mere 9 8 decrease in toc at the mi tio2 001 electrode suggesting insignificant mineralization of interferents fig 6 in the case of the nonselective electrode the toc content dropped by 37 5 after photoelectrolysis while the removal efficiency of the target atz was 63 4 implying indiscriminate mineralization and poor recognition of atz the removal efficiency of atz on other electrodes was fairly low supplementary fig 25 thus the target atz can be selectively enriched and degraded over the mi tio2 001 electrode in an actual system more importantly mi tio2 001 showed excellent activity in reducing cytotoxicity and aquatic toxicity a 99 2 decrease in cytotoxicity and a 99 6 decrease in aquatic toxicity were achieved after treatment with mi tio2 001 compared with other electrodes the reduction in cytotoxicity and aquatic toxicity over mi tio2 001 degradation was 46 2 77 8 and 41 7 70 8 more effective respectively 4 conclusion in conclusion this study has successfully developed imprinted high 001 facets exposed tio2 as a photoanode for specific recognition and the subsequent selective elimination of atz the selective removal originated from the preferential adsorption and enrichment of atz onto selective electrode highly specific atz recognition relied on halogen bonds and strong hydrogen bonds which were formed between atz and mi tio2 001 as well as the recognition of mi tio2 001 to the shape and size of atz the correlation between intermediates and toxicity was rationalized aquatic toxicity was rapidly reduced through the direct dealkylation path and due to the accumulation of highly toxic heit there will be transient fluctuations via the dechlorination hydroxylation path first almost 100 removal of aquatic toxicity and cytotoxicity was realized due to the large accumulation of the nearly nontoxic final product ooot this study may provide new insights into the correlation analysis of toxicity and intermediates of the target pollutants in other complex water matrix soil dust and even sludge credit authorship contribution statement baoling niu conceptualization investigation methodology data curation writing

16587,selective removal of atrazine atz in wastewater and clarification of the degradation intermediate toxicity correlation are of great importance a newly molecularly imprinted 001 facets exposed tio2 mi tio2 001 photoanode with strong catalytic and selective ability was designed atz was selectively removed from pesticide wastewater reaching 1 9 µg l 1 approximately 1 10 of the concentration achieved with nonselective treatment this selective removal originated from the preferential adsorption and enrichment of atz onto mi tio2 001 the highly specific recognition relied on the halogen bond and strong hydrogen bond formed between the cl atom and triazine ring π orbital of atz and the surface oh group of mi tio2 001 as well as the recognition of mi tio2 001 to the shape and size of atz the specific interaction leads to different accumulations of intermediates the correlation of intermediate and toxicity was also discussed aquatic toxicity was rapidly reduced through the direct dealkylation path and due to the accumulation of highly toxic 2 hydroxy 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino s triazine there will be transient fluctuations via the dechlorination hydroxylation path first the final product was identified as nearly nontoxic cyanuric acid the selective accumulation of which indicated that there was almost 100 removal of aquatic toxicity and cytotoxicity with only 9 8 removal of total organic carbon this work provides new insight into the correlation of pollutant degradation intermediates and changes in toxicity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords selective removal atrazine photoelectrocatalysis intermediates toxicity reduction 1 introduction atrazine atz is a commonly used herbicide in agricultural fields due to its low cost and high efficiency with an annual worldwide consumption of 70 000 90 000 tons zhang et al 2017a mu et al 2019 however atz was listed as a possible carcinogen by the united states environmental protection agency epa browner 1998 according to reports atz can accumulate in organisms inducing significant oxidative stress in zebrafish above 10 μgl 1 which stimulates oxidative damage and severe cytotoxicity jin et al 2010 valavanidis et al 2006 gunkel and streit 1980 rats even experienced cell apoptosis of erythrocytes after daily oral administration of atz at 300 mgkg 1 body weight for 21 days singh et al 2008 bhatti et al 2011 pesticide production wastewater and agricultural runoff are one of the important sources of atz with concentrations up to mgl 1 jing et al 2017 graymore et al 2001 denoyelles et al 1982 pereira and hostettler 1993 readman et al 1993 schottler et al 1994 as one of the persistent organic pollutants atz is hard to be efficiently removed by conventional treatments such as adsorption and biological methods nava montes et al 2020 ryu et al 2021 besides rapid saturation of adsorbents results in decreased removal efficiency due to competitive adsorption of interferents babel and kurniawan 2003 and it is hard to maintain the activity of microorganisms because of the toxicity of atz to them kadian et al 2008 after treatment the concentration of atz can still reach tens of μgl 1 possessing high risk derakhshan et al 2018 thus it is undoubtedly necessary to completely remove atz and eliminate its toxicity before wastewater discharge currently most traditional advanced treatment methods such as photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis to remove atz were usually carried out under the condition of deionized water and the removal efficiency was approximately 85 100 yola et al 2014 fernandez domene et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 however they did not study the removal efficiency of atz in actual wastewater even when used for agricultural and municipal water 76 84 removal of atz was observed which means that complete removal requires a longer degradation time or further catalyst addition so more energy consumption and complex catalyst recycling were needed majhi et al 2020 miranda garcia et al 2011 for the bioremediation method atz could be degraded by approximately 90 within a few days to tens of days getenga et al 2009 yu et al 2018 this long repair time obviously limits the efficiency of wastewater treatment for the treatment method combining photocatalysis and microalgae only 64 3 of atz was removed after photocatalysis and 8 days of biodegradation which is not ideal hu et al 2021 selective treatment is a new and advanced technology that can selectively enrich toxic targets in actual wastewater with a large number of nontoxic interferents improve its removal efficiency and save energy cai et al 2021 however most of the previous selective treatments focus on the concentration change of targets rather than the toxicity change chai et al 2017 cantarella et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 according to reports higher cumulative toxicity may occur during atz degradation process mu et al 2019 sudrajat 2017 selective removal may avoid the production of highly toxic intermediates or change the accumulation of intermediates so that the toxicity of the system is continuously reduced cai et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to focus on the removal of toxicity during the selective degradation of atz previous works on atz degradation mainly only discussed the removal in atz concentration and degradation path khan et al 2014 wang et al 2015 ji et al 2019 shi et al 2019 however 100 atz removal does not mean the elimination of toxicity currently total organic carbon toc is usually used as a risk evaluation indicator as reported toc decreased by 12 7 88 after treatment under deionized water conditions which did not mean that the byproducts were completely consumed nor can it directly indicate that the system was nontoxic wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2014 bu et al 2019 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 li et al 2019 hong et al 2019 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2014 sanchis et al 2014 khan et al 2013 pineda arellano et al 2013 garza campos et al 2014 jain et al 2009 thus the complete removal of toxicity should be paid more attention rather than toc removal during degradation of toxic pollutants according to reports the aquatic toxicity was reduced by 22 5 90 after atz degradation which did not achieve the goal of toxicity elimination zhu et al 2014 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 yang et al 2014 pineda arellano et al 2013 tian et al 2021 some literatures also mentioned that the toxicity increased after treatment bu et al 2019 sanchis et al 2014 the researchers attributed this to the production of some more toxic byproducts during atz degradation bu et al 2019 sanchis et al 2014 therefore if the relationship between degradation products and toxicity was clarified the goal of rapid and totally detoxification can be achieved this may be a very important reference for the detoxification researches of other toxic pollutants in environments in order to significantly improve the oxidation efficiency the photoelectrochemical oxidation method that greatly reduces or avoids the rapid recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs is used to remove atz garcia segura and brillas 2017 in this work molecular imprints were directly constructed on high oxidative capacity tio2 with highly 001 facets due to the relatively clear expression ability of molecular imprints yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2017b selective photoelectrochemical removal of atz in the presence of highly concentrated interferents was proposed the selectivity originated from the preferential adsorption and enrichment of atz on mi tio2 001 the possible recognition mechanism was investigated by operando attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and uv vis spectroscopy the reaction intermediates were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc and lc mass spectrometry lc ms to establish a degradation pathway the intermediate toxicity correlation was also explained further application of our photoelectrochemical protocol in actual pesticide wastewater treatment demonstrated the selective removal of atz as well as toxicity reduction

expressed as the luminescence inhibition rate ir of vibrio fischeri nrrl b 11177 theoretical acute and chronic aquatic toxicity of intermediates were predicted by eco structural activity relationship ecosar v2 0 from the epa more information is recorded in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of electrode morphology as shown in supplementary fig 1a scanning electron microscopy sem revealed that the as synthesized mi tio2 001 had a nanosheet morphology high resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction patterns proved to be 001 facets with an exposure ratio of 91 after calculation yang et al 2008 liu et al 2016 characteristic vibrational bands assigned to atz were observed for mi tio2 001 before calcination which disappeared after calcination indicating successful removal of the templates supplementary fig 2 martinneto et al 1994 mi tio2 sg constructed by the traditional sol gel method was composed of irregular nanoparticle aggregates supplementary fig 1e indicating a polycrystalline structure supplementary fig 1c and f suggests that the morphology of nonimprinted electrodes was similar to that of imprinted electrodes the diffraction peaks in the x ray diffraction xrd patterns and the characteristic peaks in raman spectra corresponded to anatase tio2 the intensity of which suggested high crystallinity of 001 tio2 supplementary fig 3 yu et al 2013 3 2 strong oxidation ability and excellent selectivity of mi tio2 001 the photoelectrochemical oxidation process of atz at the mi tio2 001 electrode was systematically investigated the chopped light lsv curve supplementary fig 4 showed that the onset potential of anodic water oxidation was 1 6 v in the dark under irradiation an obvious atz oxidation photocurrent emerged at mi tio2 001 to investigate the potential dependency of atz oxidative degradation on mi tio2 001 the removal efficiency at voltages of 0 2 v 0 4 v 0 6 v 0 8 v and 1 0 v were determined as shown in supplementary fig 5 the removal efficiency increased from 0 2 to 0 6 v but decreased at a higher anodic potential a total of 99 8 atz was removed after 3 0 h at 0 6 v which was the maximum value this result might be due to the electrode having the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency at 0 56 v which was 5 26 implying electroassisted photocatalysis supplementary fig 6 thus 0 6 v was applied for subsequent experiments to assess the photoelectroxidation ability of various electrodes of atz from fig 1 a the photocurrent density of tio2 001 was 1 86 times that of tio2 sg in addition epr spectra with a characteristic peak intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 for dmpo oh confirmed that oh is the dominant reactive oxygen species in pec fig 1b cai et al 2019 the peak intensities and further quantification supplementary fig 8 suggested that high oh levels were produced in tio2 001 the relatively high photocurrent density and oh content indicated the excellent oxidative ability of the 001 facets in comparison to sg in addition the smaller charge transfer resistance supplementary fig 9 extended light absorption range supplementary fig 10a and longer carrier lifetime supplementary fig 10b rationalized the higher photoelectrocatalytic activity of tio2 001 than that of sg degradation experiments for atz at different electrodes also proved this result approximately 99 8 and 79 1 of atz degraded at the mi tio2 001 and mi tio2 sg photoanodes supplementary fig 11a respectively atz degradation followed a first order rate law with a rate constant of 1 73 h 1 at the mi tio2 001 electrode which was 2 38 times higher than that at the mi tio2 sg electrode supplementary fig s11b next the specific recognition ability of several electrodes for atz was investigated in a mixed system with some structural analogs propazine prometon simazine cyanuric chloride 4 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol as interferents aquino et al 2017 the anti interference ability of the two component system catz cinterferents 1 3 considering the water solubility in supplementary table s1 is expressed by the interference factor which is defined as follows i n t e r f e r e n c e f a c t o r j m i x j a t z j a t z j b l a n k 100 where jblank is the photocurrent density of electrodes in 0 1 moll na2so4 solution and jmix and jatz are the photocurrent densities with and without the addition of interferents respectively the voltage was set to 0 6 v vs sce fig 1c showed that the interference factors of all interferents were below 7 at mi tio2 001 while those at ni tio2 001 were nearly 100 extremely poor anti interference ability as shown in supplementary fig s12a it indicated that the strong anti interference ability as well as exceptional recognition ability for the target atz was still realized at mi tio2 001 even under the interference of structural analogs and it can be concluded that the anti interference ability was closely related to the construction of mi the comparison between mi tio2 sg and ni tio2 sg also confirmed this point the interference factors of all interferents at mi tio2 sg were 7 0 14 5 times higher than those at mi tio2 001 supplementary fig s12 which highlighted the benefit of the 001 crystal plane for the construction of mi for the highly specific recognition of atz this observation might be attributed to the fact that the 001 facet of single crystal tio2 with a smooth surface bears a higher mi expression degree leading to a more specific recognition of the target atz zhang et al 2017b zhang et al 2020 to explore the underlying reason for the selective removal of atz the adsorption under various conditions was studied in detail the static adsorption results shown in supplementary fig 13 illustrated that the amount of atz adsorbed on mi tio2 001 was 1 36 times higher than that on ni tio2 001 which can be inferred that the construction of mi may increase the specific recognition sites for atz herein the structural analogs in the above anti interference test such as propazine and simazine were also employed catz cinterferents 1 3 after adding interferents the adsorption amount of atz on mi tio2 001 decreased slightly 8 4 while it dropped 37 6 43 9 on ni tio2 001 reinforcing the strong adsorption of atz on mi tio2 001 in addition quartz crystal microbalance qcm was used to further study the specific adsorption of atz in actual pesticide wastewater by the electrodes qcm frequency changes versus solution density and viscosity according to kanazawa equation deakin and buttry 1989 δ f f 0 3 2 η s ρ s π μ q ρ q 1 2 where ηs is the solution viscosity and ρs is the solution density δf is the change in the oscillation frequency f0 is the oscillation frequency of the fundamental mode of the qcm ρq is the density of quartz 2 648 g cm 3 and μq is the shear modulus of quartz 2 947 1011 gcm 1 s 2 as evident in fig 1d δf of atz was collected in a one component system catz 53 4 µgl 1 or in actual wastewater from a pesticide production plant catz 53 4µgl 1 after atz was added to the one component system δf of atz at mi tio2 001 was 3 68 times that observed for ni tio2 001 indicating a high affinity of atz to mi tio2 001 to achieve surface enrichment for an actual wastewater system δf at ni tio2 001 was a little larger which may be attributed to the much higher molecular weight of interferents compared to that of the target atz δf caused by these interferent adsorptions on ni tio2 001 was 3 39 times higher than that on mi tio2 001 implying the more nonselective adsorption of interferents vs atz on ni tio2 001 according to the above results selective adsorption led to atz enrichment on mi tio2 001 which assisted in the preferential removal of the target atz 3 3 the specific recognition mechanism of selective electrode to atz the possible recognition mechanism for atz in the adsorption process was investigated by operando ir spectroscopy to eliminate the interference of hydrogen bonds in h2o and to determine whether the hydrogen bonds originated from water or formed between atz and catalysts ccl4 was used as the solvent under anhydrous conditions as shown in fig 2 a the peak at 3228 cm 1 was attributed to the oh group formed between atz and mi tio2 001 chien et al 2016 after adsorption of atz on mi tio2 001 the in plane deformation peaks of its triazine ring two peaks at 1620 and 1543 cm 1 supplementary fig 2 split into multiple small peaks fig 2a which originated from the hydrogen bond interaction between the triazine ring π orbital and the oh on the mi tio2 001 surface martinneto et al 1994 ariraman et al 2015 in addition the υ ccl vibration peak of atz 806 cm 1 supplementary fig 2 showed an 8 cm 1 redshift upon adsorption fig 2a implying that a halogen bond was formed between the cl atom of atz and mi tio2 001 shi et al 2019 hall et al 1991 however there was no peak shift for ni tio2 001 adsorbed atz besides as reported the nanocavities generated after templates removal are complementary to target molecules in shape size and functional groups which is conducive to the selective recognition of targets in the presence of structural analogs interferents chen et al 2016 tada and iwasawa 2003 canlas et al 2012 galarneau et al 1995 the previous anti interference results confirmed that the specific recognition also relied on selective recognition of mi tio2 001 to the shape and size of atz except for strong hydrogen bonds oh π and halogen bonds formed between them the multiple interaction was beneficial to the enrichment of atz near the mi tio2 001 electrode and the subsequent selective removal a much weaker atr signal was observed on the ni tio2 001 surface due to the weak interaction between atz and the electrode the atz electrode interaction was further studied by xps fig 2b demonstrates the n 1 s spectra for pure atz and mi tio2 001 after the adsorption of atz labeled mi tio2 001 atz for pure atz the peaks at 399 1 and 397 0 ev corresponded to the c n group of the triazine ring and the nh group respectively wang et al 2009 the peaks shifted positively by 1 1 0 9 ev implying the strong chemical interaction between the triazine ring and nh group of atz and mi tio2 001 as shown in fig 2c the peaks of cl 2p3 2 and cl 2p1 2 shifted positively by 0 3 and 0 7 ev respectively indicating that a halogen bond was formed between atz and mi tio2 001 wang et al 2009 liu et al 2009 besides the o 1 s spectra of mi tio2 001 after atz adsorption clearly illustrated a 0 5 0 6 ev positive shift in the binding energies of the ti o ti and oh groups compared with mi tio2 001 before adsorption supplementary fig 16 xu et al 2018 this increase in binding energy may be due to electron redistribution after atz interacted with the ti o ti and oh groups of mi tio2 001 similar increases were also found in the c 1 s spectrum of atz and the ti 2p spectrum of mi tio2 001 supplementary fig 17 therefore chemical interactions i e oh triazine ring and halogen bond were confirmed between atz and mi tio2 001 the relatively high affinity was further evidenced by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy higashimoto et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 as shown in supplementary fig 18 no visible light absorption was observed for atz and the two kinds of 001 tio2 after adsorption of atz visible light absorption above 400 nm was observed on mi tio2 001 in contrast there was almost no absorption difference observed for ni tio2 001 after atz adsorption as reported visible light absorption may originate from multiple interactions between atz and mi tio2 001 such as hydrogen bonds oh π and halogen bonds shi et al 2019 thus the newly emerged visible light absorption on mi tio2 001 upon atz adsorption corroborates the stronger binding owing to the construction of mi sites which was beneficial to the enrichment of atz and subsequent selective removal 3 4 proposed degradation pathway of atz on electrodes to further study the degradation process of atz a series of potential resolved operando ir spectra were acquired fig 3 a b the spectra were recorded after subtracting the background that is the spectrum when the atz adsorption reached saturation on the electrode surface significant changes were observed on the two electrodes when a 0 2 v anodic bias was applied the peak of υ rnh2 appeared at 1671 cm 1 on mi tio2 001 implying the fracture of atz branch chains kolekar et al 2014 the vibration peak at 1117 cm 1 was assigned to the υ coh of phenols indicating the cleavage of ccl and formation of hydroxylation intermediates palmisano et al 1994 the consumption peak at approximately 1298 cm 1 corresponded to δ cn suggesting the emergence of a dealkylation product at 0 2 v on mi tio2 001 martinneto et al 1994 the consumption peak of the isopropyl group with a peak intensity of 1 1 at 1385 and 1375 cm 1 was not found which may be due to its intrinsic low intensity or low concentration marzec et al 2011 at a higher bias 0 8 v the δ cn peak started to be consumed on ni tio2 001 consistent with the faster oxidation of atz on mi tio2 001 derived from the strong interaction between the target atz and mi tio2 001 the lower peak intensity observed for the ni tio2 001 electrode under the same conditions further supported the distinct interaction due to the construction of mi the peak displacement may be related to the change in the applied potential the above potential resolved operando ir experiments showed that the degradation process of atz on selective and nonselective electrodes may be different so the characterization of the intermediates formed during the photoelectrochemical oxidation of atz can provide insight into the degradation pathway of the two methods eight intermediates were characterized by lc ms detailed information was listed in supplementary table s2 and a possible photoelectroxidation pathway was proposed in fig 4 two possible routes were proposed in the first path the dechlorination hydroxylation reaction occurred to obtain the primary intermediate heit m z 198 after calculation the bond length of the ccl bond was determined to be 1 734 å the longest among all bonds in atz so its cleavage was the easiest chen et al 2009 as most studies mentioned the first step of the degradation mechanism consisted of fast dechlorination hydroxylation khan et al 2014 chen et al 2009 next heit can be further transformed into two potential secondary intermediates by dealkylation at different positions namely hait m z 170 and heat m z 156 after further dealkylation the downstream intermediate oaat m z 128 was formed finally the key downstream intermediate ooot m z 130 was observed the difference was that the first step in the second path was a direct dealkylation reaction which removed the alkyl group from the side chain of atz to obtain the desethyl product cait m z 188 and the desisopropyl product ceat m z 174 respectively this was followed by further dealkylation to yield caat m z 146 and then oaat via dechlorination hydroxylation finally the key downstream intermediate ooot was also observed at the nonselective electrode the types of intermediates are the same as those at the selective electrode and there is no difference in the predicted degradation path 3 5 intermediate accumulation during atz degradation process however the previously different degradation kinetics of atz at the two electrodes led us to speculate that the cumulative concentration of intermediates may be different during the degradation process thus the concentration changes of all intermediates at the selective and nonselective electrodes are plotted in figs 5 a 5b and s19 the concentrations of most intermediates first increased and then decreased but the maximum cumulative concentration of each intermediate and the temporal time varied the dechlorinated hydroxylated intermediate heit and dealkylated intermediates cait and ceat accumulated in the early stage of degradation the maximum concentration ratio crmax is the ratio of the maximum cumulative molar concentration of intermediates to the initial molar concentration of atz the crmax of heit on mi tio2 001 and ni tio2 001 were 0 078 at 1 0 h and 0 109 at 1 5 h respectively cait and ceat peaked at 10 min on mi tio2 001 while they peaked at 0 5 1 0 h on ni tio2 001 the crmax of cait and ceat on ni tio2 001 was 2 95 and 3 00 times that on mi tio2 001 respectively the crmax of the primary intermediates on the mi tio2 001 electrode was smaller than that on the ni tio2 001 electrode and the time to reach crmax was shorter indicating a faster atz decomposition process on the mi tio2 001 electrode due to the fast degradation rate the initial intermediates were rapidly oxidized and decomposed at mi tio2 001 in addition the order of their crmax was heit cait ceat this result is consistent with those of previous studies where dechlorination occurred easily and promptly and the fracture of ethyl groups occurred more easily than that of isopropyl groups khan et al 2014 chen et al 2009 ta et al 2006 later further dealkylated secondary intermediates hait heat and caat accumulated gradually and then decomposed the crmax of secondary intermediates on ni tio2 001 was 1 15 1 52 times higher than that on mi tio2 001 then secondary intermediates gradually oxidized to tertiary intermediates ooat which peaked at 3 0 h the crmax of oaat on ni tio2 001 was 1 15 times higher than that on mi tio2 001 the concentration ratio of the final intermediate ooot increased continuously as the reaction proceeded approaching 0 716 on mi tio2 001 1 51 times higher than that on ni tio2 001 less accumulation of secondary and tertiary intermediates with more accumulation of the final intermediate indicated a greater degradation degree of the target atz on the mi tio2 001 electrode in fact there are differences in the toxicity of different intermediates and the toxicity caused by the same intermediate also varies with concentration therefore the toxicity evolution of atz in the selective and nonselective photoelectrochemical oxidation process may be different mu et al 2019 sudrajat 2017 3 6 toxicity reduction during atz degradation process oxidative stress is usually used as an indicator of cytotoxicity which was evaluated by the changes in mda concentration of cells during treatment as shown in fig 5d and s20 jin et al 2010 campos pereira et al 2012 toughan et al 2018 the δmda concentration was the value after subtracting the mda concentration of the control group without atz 109 8 µmoll 1 per mg of protein after adding atz the δmda concentration increased by 99 5 105 7 µmoll 1 per mg of protein demonstrating lipid peroxidation and severe cytotoxicity during the degradation process the mda concentration gradually decreased and it decreased faster after treatment with the mi tio2 001 electrode the final δmda concentration was merely 2 9 µmoll 1 per mg of protein after degradation with the mi tio2 001 electrode for 5 0 h while it was 44 2 µmoll 1 per mg of protein after degradation with the ni tio2 001 electrode supplementary fig 20 this result suggested that no lipid peroxidation or cytotoxicity was observed after treatment with mi tio2 001 while obvious oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation remained after treatment with ni tio2 001 it is worth noting that the concentration of all intermediates in the early degradation stage increased with decreasing cytotoxicity when the concentration of primary intermediates began to decrease the cytotoxicity continued to decrease thus the primary intermediates were not the main reason for cytotoxicity changes similarly the accumulation of secondary and tertiary intermediates began to decrease in the mid degradation period while the cytotoxicity was still reduced excluding their primary effect in addition ooot accumulated continuously during the whole degradation process and the cytotoxicity decreased sustainably the further pearson correlation coefficient in supplementary fig 24 between the decrease of δmda and the accumulation of ooot was 0 971 suggesting a significant positive relevance between the reduction of cytotoxicity and the accumulation of ooot high cytotoxicity may lead to further apoptosis which was visually authenticated by the fluorescence image of cells exposure to atz caused notable apoptosis fig 5e compared with the control group supplementary fig 20a after treatment with the mi tio2 001 electrode almost no apoptosis was observed fig 5f whereas apoptosis was still observed after treatment with the ni tio2 001 electrode supplementary fig 20b this result showed the excellent detoxification ability of the mi tio2 001 electrode which was due to the large accumulation of low toxicity intermediates caused by the rapid oxidation of atz to further explore the intermediate toxicity correlation of atz the aquatic toxicity of all intermediates was measured by ec50 as shown in fig 5c the ec50 of all intermediates except heit was higher than that of the parent pollutant atz indicating the relatively high toxicity of heit and reduced toxicity of other intermediates the luminescence inhibition rate of hait 80 mgl 1 and oaat 25 mgl 1 at nearly saturated solubility was still less than 15 indicating that they were almost nontoxic it is speculated that the toxicity of atz reduced rapidly through the direct dealkylation path when degrading through dechlorination hydroxylation at the first step the toxicity likely fluctuated briefly during the degradation process because of the accumulation of heit with the degradation of atz the removal of aquatic toxicity first increased then decreased and finally reached 100 fig 5d initially although highly toxic heit accumulated slowly the removal of aquatic toxicity increased rapidly due to the large accumulation of almost nontoxic ooot and other low toxicity intermediates subsequently the accumulation of almost nontoxic ooot and other low toxicity intermediates slowed significantly with an unchanged accumulation rate of highly toxic heit so the removal of aquatic toxicity began to decrease when the accumulation of heit reached the maximum toxicity removal reached its minimum then the accumulation of highly toxic heit began to decrease other low toxicity or nontoxic intermediates still accumulated and the toxicity removal increased therefore the decrease in aquatic toxicity was inversely proportional to the accumulation of highly toxic heit and directly proportional to the low or nontoxic intermediates the accumulation of almost nontoxic ooot was much larger than that of other low toxicity intermediates so the removal of aquatic toxicity mainly depends on the accumulation of ooot the removal trend of aquatic toxicity for ni tio2 001 was similar to that for mi tio2 001 supplementary fig 22 in contrast the elimination of aquatic toxicity in the initial stage was mainly due to the accumulation of low toxicity heat the reduction in the removal of toxicity stemmed from the fact that heat accumulation slowed significantly while highly toxic heit was still accumulating when the heit concentration reached its peak the reduction in toxicity was minimal then with the consumption of heit and the high accumulation of ooot and heat the toxicity removal increased significantly thus the decrease in toxicity was mainly related to the accumulation of ooot and heat the comparison of toc removal and toxicity reduction with literature was shown in table 1 as reported toc decreased by 12 7 88 after treatment under deionized water conditions which did not mean that the byproducts were completely consumed nor can it directly indicate that the system was nontoxic wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2014 bu et al 2019 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 li et al 2019 hong et al 2019 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2014 sanchis et al 2014 khan et al 2013 pineda arellano et al 2013 garza campos et al 2014 jain et al 2009 thus the complete removal of toxicity should be paid more attention rather than toc removal during degradation of toxic pollutants according to reports the aquatic toxicity was reduced by 22 5 90 after atz degradation zhu et al 2014 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 yang et al 2014 pineda arellano et al 2013 tian et al 2021 some literatures also mentioned that the toxicity of the system increased after treatment bu et al 2019 sanchis et al 2014 the researchers attributed this to the production of some more toxic products during atz degradation bu et al 2019 sanchis et al 2014 in this work 58 2 of toc and 100 of toxicity was reduced the elimination of toxicity was origined from the massive accumulation of nearly nontoxic final product in selective treatment this may provide a reference for the detoxification of other toxic organic pollutants the aquatic toxicity of wastewater was also estimated by the ecosar program with two indicators of acute toxicity and chronic toxicity as shown in table 2 according to the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals ghs all intermediates were classified into four categories according to lc50 ec50 chv very toxic 1 mgl 1 toxic 1 mgl 1 10 mgl 1 harmful 10 mgl 1 100 mgl 1 and not harmful 100 mgl 1 among all intermediates the acute and chronic toxicity of ooot was relatively low thus ooot might be an indicator of toxicity reduction the intermediates causing increased toxicity were different from the abovementioned experimental results however regardless of the path taken the acute and chronic toxicity of the system toward fish daphnid and green algae would significantly decrease after fluctuation 3 7 selective removal and toxicity reduction of atz in actual wastewater wastewater from a pesticide plant after anaerobic anoxic oxic treatment was employed to further assess the selective removal of atz at electrodes in a real aquatic system the specific water quality indicators are shown in supplementary table s4 after photoelectrocatalysis for 5 0 h 96 5 of atz was eliminated with a mere 9 8 decrease in toc at the mi tio2 001 electrode suggesting insignificant mineralization of interferents fig 6 in the case of the nonselective electrode the toc content dropped by 37 5 after photoelectrolysis while the removal efficiency of the target atz was 63 4 implying indiscriminate mineralization and poor recognition of atz the removal efficiency of atz on other electrodes was fairly low supplementary fig 25 thus the target atz can be selectively enriched and degraded over the mi tio2 001 electrode in an actual system more importantly mi tio2 001 showed excellent activity in reducing cytotoxicity and aquatic toxicity a 99 2 decrease in cytotoxicity and a 99 6 decrease in aquatic toxicity were achieved after treatment with mi tio2 001 compared with other electrodes the reduction in cytotoxicity and aquatic toxicity over mi tio2 001 degradation was 46 2 77 8 and 41 7 70 8 more effective respectively 4 conclusion in conclusion this study has successfully developed imprinted high 001 facets exposed tio2 as a photoanode for specific recognition and the subsequent selective elimination of atz the selective removal originated from the preferential adsorption and enrichment of atz onto selective electrode highly specific atz recognition relied on halogen bonds and strong hydrogen bonds which were formed between atz and mi tio2 001 as well as the recognition of mi tio2 001 to the shape and size of atz the correlation between intermediates and toxicity was rationalized aquatic toxicity was rapidly reduced through the direct dealkylation path and due to the accumulation of highly toxic heit there will be transient fluctuations via the dechlorination hydroxylation path first almost 100 removal of aquatic toxicity and cytotoxicity was realized due to the large accumulation of the nearly nontoxic final product ooot this study may provide new insights into the correlation analysis of toxicity and intermediates of the target pollutants in other complex water matrix soil dust and even sludge credit authorship contribution statement baoling niu conceptualization investigation methodology data curation writing

16588,the microbial community coalescence describes the mixing of microbial communities and the merging of their surrounding environments despite its prevalence in natural ecosystems and its potential influence on ecological processes little research focused on the extent of coalescence between aquatic microbial communities in this research we analyzed the microbial communities in the three gorges reservoir a typical deep water reservoir on the yangtze river the biogeography and the coalescence of microbial communities in water and sediment were illustrated and analyzed based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence variants asvs differences in composition and diversity were identified between microbial communities in water and sediment and microbial communities in sediment were more diverse than those in water between adjacent communities by calculating the proportion of overlapped taxa adopting the sourcetracker algorithm and quantifying the connectivity of microbial cohesion we found that the extent of intra medium coalescence was strong 19 8 and inter media coalescence was faint 0 2 50 keystone species were selected using the cohesion metric they displayed a stronger coalescence extent than average and formed an accumulating pattern from upstream to downstream in the three gorges reservoir exhibiting their importance in the ecological network potential influencing factors of microbial community coalescence in aquatic environments were discussed including environmental conditions types of habitats suspended particles in water and microscale microbial activities to summarize this research depicted the coalescence of microbial communities in a deep water reservoir and emphasized its ecological importance we anticipate more attention and further research on the processes of microbial coalescence in the aquatic environment which might provide new insights into turnover of microbial keystone species and changes in aquatic ecological conditions graphical

important roles in rivers and streams some of them are driving aquatic biogeochemical cycles of elements and nutrients battin et al 2016 maavara et al 2020 some are contributing to aquatic primary production palmer and ruhi 2019 some are causing ecological problems zhang et al 2019b while some are applied in bioremediation xu et al 2014 the composition and function of microbial communities in rivers and streams are influenced by their surrounding environmental variables eutrophic conditions often induce algal bloom and denitrification often occurs in anaerobic conditions madigan et al 2018 in addition to environmental variables microbial communities are also influenced by different ecological processes such as selection dispersal and drift vellend 2010 while the prevalence and ubiquity of microorganisms was attributed to the dispersal process of individuals among microbial communities leibold et al 2004 read et al 2015 terui et al 2018 the extent to which microbial communities merge and coalesce is not fully understood mansour et al 2018 langenheder and lindström 2019 all these bring about a need for knowledge on how microbial communities coalesce in typical natural habitats studies focusing on the coalescence of microbial communities is increasing in recent years trying to elucidate and quantify different community assembly processes in microbial ecology zhou and ning 2017 as defined by rillig et al rillig et al 2015 community coalescence is an interchange event of communities and their environments in which separate communities join together into a new entity along with the mixing of their relatively large surrounding environments from a perspective of ecology community coalescence events are intersected with dispersal processes and the latter was described as the movement and successful establishment of an individual hanson et al 2012 they are also entangled with existing ecological theories and hypotheses e g environmental filtering priority effects metacommunity theory rillig et al 2015 evidence tools terminologies and importance of microbial community coalescence have been reviewed to encourage more research rillig et al 2015 rillig and mansour 2017 various microcosm experiments were conducted the asymmetric mixing of microbial communities with long distinct assembly history was proposed and confirmed supporting community based assembly process gilpin 1994 livingston et al 2013 study on methanogenic communities proved that one single community dominates the structure and function of coalesced community sierocinski et al 2017 in addition to microcosm experiments new methods were proposed to quantify the extent of coalescence between communities in a mixing event the most intuitive measurement would be the proportion of overlapped taxa classical dissimilarity measures are also useful as they are correlated with the overlap rate in real data bashan et al 2016 microbial source tracking has been widely used to quantify the immigration of taxa from source communities to sink communities knights et al 2011 mei and liu 2019 a new algorithm cohesion has been proposed to quantify the connectivity of microbial communities in a large dataset 40 samples herren and mcmahon 2017 non negative least squares nnls approach has also been used to estimate the contribution of communities sierocinski et al 2017 to summarize existing studies focused more on theoretical conceptions microcosm experiment interpretations or mathematical algorithms of the quantification yet the distribution patterns and the influencing factors of microbial coalescence happening in natural habitats have not been holistically studied rivers and streams are ideal places for field studies of microbial community coalescence mansour et al 2018 shifts in microbial communities in rivers and streams are primarily driven by biotic ecological succession than abiotic properties hence the microbial community coalescence is important for knowing modelling and altering of microbial communities in river networks read et al 2015 bai et al 2020 passive diffusion of microbial communities in rivers and streams is unidirectional from upstream to downstream reducing the complexity of diffusing directions of microbial communities and facilitating the preliminary research in aquatic environment mccarthy et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a moreover microbial communities in the aquatic environments are playing important roles in biogeochemical processes schmadel et al 2018 consequently getting a better knowledge of microbial community coalescence in rivers and streams paves way to a better protection of river ecosystem and a deeper understanding of natural microbial community coalescence the three gorges reservoir tgr built on the yangtze river is the largest water reservoir in terms of installed electric generating capacity xu et al 2013 the assembly of microbial communities in reservoirs explained the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of both biotic and abiotic properties of water and sediments and community coalescence is potentially influencing the community assembly processes liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 gao et al 2020 in addition the tgr is a typical deep water reservoir which contains a variety of aquatic conditions riverine zone transition zone and lacustrine zone therefore microbial communities in the tgr were focused and we hypothesized that microbial communities in water and sediment were differently affected by community coalescence and the coalescence had measurable impacts on microbial community structure different methods of community coalescence quantification were applied to a describe the biogeographic patterns of microbial communities b demonstrate the patterns of and relations between community diversity and community coalescence and c figure out the potential influencing factors of community coalescence and their ecological implications although community coalescence between various types of habitats e g bank soil to river water was not comprehensively explored in this work we provide a reference for prospective research on microbial community coalescence in aquatic environment and we anticipate a larger awareness of microbial community coalescence in search of solutions to microbial associated river environmental and river ecological issues 2 materials methods 2 1 study site and sampling yangtze river the largest river in china and the third longest river in the world originates in the qinghai tibetan plateau and flows eastward to the east china sea the three gorges reservoir tgr along the yangtze river extends between chongqing and yichang and covers more than 600 km of the yangtze river in this study a total of 94 water and sediment samples from 35 sites in the tgr were collected during april and may of 2018 the sampling work covered both the yangtze river mainstream and its 14 tributaries in the tgr fig 1 illustrated the locations of sampling sites in an electronic map samples were categorized according to their types and positions surface water middle water bottom water and surface sediment among these samples 37 were surface water 15 were middle water 16 were bottom water and 26 were samples of sediments 45 of samples were taken from the mainstream of the yangtze river and 49 were taken from its tributaries see supplementary table 1 samples of surface river water were taken directly samples of middle and bottom water were taken using a water column sampler attached with an electronic motor to control the depths of sampling for each water sample 0 22 μm filtered films and bottled samples were stored in dry ice 80 c and ice box 4 c separately for further microbial dna extraction and physiochemical properties measurement each sample of surface sediment was taken from a mixture of 3 sediment samples collected near the site for each sediment sample 10 ml sterilized polypropylene tubes were stored in dry ice 80 c and sampling

measured simultaneously during the sampling process including the sediment depth the water temperature the water ph the water turbidity the water dissolved oxygen concentration do etc the dendritic distances of the sampling site to the yangtze estuary were measured on electronic maps along the longitudinal centerline of the yangtze river and its tributaries physical properties were all measured

of 16s rrna were performed by biozeron biotechnology co ltd shanghai china raw reads of 16s rrna gene amplicons were quality controlled and analyzed using qiime2 2020 11 basic criteria were respected following the official suggestions detailed processes could be found elsewhere gao et al 2020 after the aforementioned quality control dada2 was used for the detection and correction of amplicon sequence data as well as the generation of the phylogenetic tree the taxonomic annotation of sequences was assigned using the naive bayes classifier trained by the silva ssu132 16s rrna database quast et al 2012 with the pipeline provided by qiime2 amplicon sequence variants asvs also referred to as exact sequence variants or esv were produced in place of operational taxonomic units otus for a higher resolution of taxonomic annotations and a better comparability among studies glassman and martiny 2018 2 4 statistical analysis of microbial communities in this research richness measures observed asvs chao 1 ace shannon simpson invsimpson fisher and evenness statistical tests anova kruskal wallis rank sum test etc and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds were calculated and plotted using r language version 4 0 4 and the following packages vegan version 2 5 7 phyloseq version 1 34 0 and ggplot2 version 3 3 3 2 5 coalescence related calculations as illustrated in a recent review mei and liu 2019 there are three commonly used methods to evaluate the immigration and coalescence in microbial ecosystems the overlap of species proportion of shared species or number of reads of common asvs the estimation of proportion of taxa in the downstream given by source sink based models such as sourcetracker knights et al 2011 and the sloan s neutral model sloan et al 2006 in this research firstly the overlap of asvs between adjacent microbial communities was counted using r version 4 0 4 the contributions of different types of upstream sources to different types of downstream sinks were predicted using the bayesian classifier sourcetracker knights et al 2011 similar to the methods described elsewhere zhang et al 2019a luo et al 2020b the sourcetracker analysis was performed 4 times each time a type of habitat was set as the sink and the contribution of the rest communities to the sink communities were quantified moreover cohesion a recently proposed method for quantifying the degree of connectivity of microbial communities herren and mcmahon 2017 was also calculated to test the coalescence between communities 2 6 co occurrence network networks have been frequently used to explore interspecies interactions and to elucidate the importance of certain strains and species röttjers and faust 2018 keystone species are vital for the species turnover and the functions of microbial communities steele et al 2011 berry and widder 2014 banerjee et al 2018 here to identify the key species in different habitats i e surface water middle water bottom water and sediment 4 sub networks have been established with the following steps 1 selection of prevalent presented in no less than 1 5 of samples and abundant number of reads 5 asvs among samples in the same habitat type as nodes liu et al 2018 2 pairwise calculation of pearson correlation between nodes 3 selection of strong correlation coefficient 0 7 and significant p value 0 05 correlations as edges

each sub network using degree and cohesion banerjee et al 2018 6 construction of the full co occurrence network using strong coefficients 0 7 interspecies correlations isolated nodes whose degree 0 were omitted during the construction of the full network 7 combination of keystone species from 4 sub networks and the full network to better understand the structure of the co occurrence network the abundance sequence reads and mean abundance sequence reads number of presence of species in each layer of water and sediment were calculated and the species were then defined as layer related species by their highest mean abundance in each layer all calculations were conducted using r language r core team 2021 and igraph package csardi and nepusz 2006 the software gephi was used to visualize and render all networks bastian et al 2009 in the network the size of nodes was correlated with the degree of nodes and the brightness and saturation of nodes represent the mean abundance of species without specific explanations 2 7 data availability the sequencing data have been submitted to ncbi sequence read archive database under accession number prjna733826 3 results 3 1 physiochemical properties of samples the physiochemical properties of 94 water and sediment samples and 35 corresponding sampling sites could be found in supplementary table 1 in brief nutrient levels in water samples showed little difference between layers and most nutrients tn tp no3 and no2 were slightly higher in mainstreams than in tributaries except ammonium nh4 the average min max tn tp nitrate

concentration varied from 5 89 mg l to 10 46 mg l from bottom to surface do slightly increased in both mainstream and tributaries the orp varied from 127 6 mv to 308 2 mv and the average was 247 6 mv according to the particle size range the sediment could be separated into 3 components clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm and in most sediment samples particle size was larger than those in tributaries supplementary fig 10 3 2 sequencing results the statistics of sequencing results of the microbial samples i e the numbers of input filtered denoised and non chimeric reads and their corresponding percentages were listed in supplementary table 2 after all quality controls 18 238 to 53 402 valid reads were left in each sample with their proportions of input reads varying from 81 20 to 90 35 in all samples 8 092 asvs were obtained and the total number of valid reads reached to 3 569 132 prior to other analyses using r language sequences were rarified to 18 238 in each sample retaining 8 062 99 63 of 8 092 asvs 1 714 372 48 03 of 3 569 132 valid sequences and 94 100 of 94 samples in all sequences 32 346 0 91 sequences were assigned to archaea 3 536 779 99 09 to bacteria and only 7 sequences remained unassigned supplementary fig 1 most archaeal sequences 31 989 98 90 of 32 346 were found in sediments at the phylum level the most populated 10 phyla were proteobacteria 1 517 506 sequence counts 42 54 actinobacteria 793 918 sequence counts 22 26 bacteroidetes 334 281 sequence counts 9 37 chloroflexi 185 637 sequence counts 5 20 acidobacteria 185 346

deinococcus thermus 27 826 sequence counts 0 78 and they were differently colored in fig 2 in addition 39 3 of all 8062 asvs were unique to water samples 59 9 were unique to sediment samples and 64 asvs 0 8 of 8062 present in both water and sediment 3 3 diversity analyses of microbial communities a series of alpha diversity indices including observed asvs chao1 index ace index shannon index simpson index invsimpson index and fisher index were calculated using the rarified sequences of each sample and the results were plotted in the matrix of bar charts in supplementary fig 2 in brief alpha diversity indices in different layers of river water surface water middle water bottom water showed little difference in both mainstream and tributaries of the yangtze river in the tgr in the sediment the alpha diversity indices in both mainstream and tributaries were significantly higher than those in different layers of river water in river water of the mainstream and tributaries alpha diversity indices of microbial communities were indistinguishable while in sediment of the mainstream alpha diversity indices of microbial communities were higher than those in the sediment of tributaries supplementary fig 2 and supplementary fig 3 moreover along the longitudinal flow direction of the yangtze river the alpha diversity indices of sedimental microbial communities decreased slower in the mainstream than in tributaries in the tgr supplementary fig 11 to demonstrate the beta diversity among microbial communities in both sediment and different layers of river water non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds of weighted unifrac dissimilarity matrix was performed as shown in fig 3 in addition to demonstrate the compositional dissimilarity of microbial communities nmds was also performed based on bray curtis dissimilarity matrix of proportional sample data supplementary fig 4 the distribution patterns of microbial communities were illustrated clearly in these fig s microbial communities in the sediment were significantly different from those in water samples from the sediment showed comparable differences in comparison with samples from different layers of water in terms of proportional dissimilarity nmds based on bray curtis dissimilarity furthermore taking phylogenetic dissimilarity nmds based on weighted unifrac dissimilarity into consideration communities in sediment demonstrated a much broader disparity than those in waters with the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix and the calculated dendritic distance matrix between samples a linear regression of dissimilarity on the distance was calculated and shown in supplementary fig 5 due to the small amount of shared asvs in sediment and water their bray curtis dissimilarity indices were close to 1 in contrast both water phase and sediment phase bray curtis dissimilarity were positively correlated with the dendritic distance between samples 3 4 coalescence of microbial communities different layers of water and river sediment of adjacent sampling sites were regarded as sources and destinations of the coalescence of microbial communities and the default flow direction from west to east from tributaries to the mainstream was respected to get a more general and meaningful result i e in this research density current caused by different water temperature or sand concentration was not considered the detailed pairs of upstream downstream were listed in the supplementary table 3 with this basic hypothesis the relative abundance of overlapped shared asvs was calculated for each microbial community and its neighbored upstream communities as demonstrated in fig 4 in pairwise upstream downstream community coalescence much more asvs were preserved in intra medium compared with inter media coalescence sediment sediment 20 6 0 7 water water 18 9 2 5 water sediment 0 3 0 0 sediment water 0 0 0 0 this result demonstrated a pattern of microbial coalescence in aquatic environment although the river water column and the sediment flowed in the same direction and there were a series of exchange of matters nutrients and elements little microorganisms successfully immigrated from their original habitat into new habitat the results of sourcetracker confirmed this pattern as shown in supplementary fig 6 when the sink was set to the microbial communities of surface water middle water and bottom water separately little proportion or none was contributed by the sediment microbial communities analogously when the sink was set to the microbial communities of sediment little proportion or none was contributed by the microbial communities from water interestingly the major source of microbial communities in water was the microbial communities in other layers of water and the contribution from other layers of water was highest 66 in the middle water to quantify the connectivity of microbial communities we calculated the cohesion of each microbial community in this research in general the absolute values of both positive and negative cohesions were higher in microbial communities in water than in sediment fig 5 the negative cohesion values mirrored the patterns of alpha diversity measurements of microbial communities supplementary fig 2 3 5 network analysis and keystone species identification to identify the keystone species for the metacommunity of the tgr co occurrence network analysis was used a series of operations were conducted as stated in materials methods as a result 476 positive interspecies correlations and 332 asvs were retained in the full network most nodes 267 80 42 of 332 asvs in the full network belonged to the most populated phyla fig 6 according to the mean abundance of species in the network each node in the co occurrence network was related to a layer i e surface water middle water bottom water sediment supplementary fig 7 most nodes were sediment related species 230 69 27 of 332 asvs followed by surface water 45 13 55 of 332 asvs middle water 29 8 73 of 332 asvs and bottom water 28 8 43 of 332 asvs most strong and significant correlations were found between sediment related species in the 4 sub networks of different layers of water and sediment a total of 50 keystone asvs were identified and 36 of them were present in the full network supplementary table 4 in each layer unlike the disparity and disproportion of nodes in the full network the numbers of keystone asvs were similar 11 was bottom water related species 10 were middle water related species 9 were sediment related species and 6 were surface water related species to demonstrate the quantitative change of 50 keystone asvs along the yangtze river before the three gorges dam we calculated the dendritic distance of samples and counted the reads of 50 keystone asvs in each sample as shown in supplementary fig 8 more reads of keystone asvs were found in samples closer to the three gorges dam and number of reads of keystone asvs in water were higher than that in the sediment these keystone asvs were emphasized in green color in the supplementary fig 9 to demonstrate their positions and connectivity in the full network 4 discussion microbial communities are playing key roles in biogeochemical cycling and energy flowing in aquatic ecosystems however the understanding of the impacts of the community coalescence and the keystone species on the formation of microbial communities remained preliminary in this work we investigated the distribution patterns of microbial communities in the tgr and their coalescence moreover co occurrence network analysis was conducted to identify strongly correlated species and keystone species in the microbial communities 4 1 coalescence of microbial communities showed distinct patterns in vertical and longitudinal directions along the vertical direction of the river water column in different layers of water similar microbial communities were found and they showed little dissimilarity in terms of alpha diversity fig 2 supplementary fig 2 and 3 indices as well as beta diversity fig 3 and supplementary fig 4 however microbial communities were distinct between water and sediment fig 2 and 3 supplementary fig 2 5 the distinction between water and sediment microbial communities has been reported in previous studies liu et al 2018 liao et al 2020 luo et al 2020a the portions of otus unique to water samples were reported as only a minority 1 2 in previous research liu et al 2018 but in this study asvs unique to water samples 39 3 and unique to sediment samples 59 9 were comparable and only 64 asvs present in both water and sediment this result showed the importance of habitat in the selection of microbial communities moreover the microbial source tracking result supplementary fig 6 illustrated that microbial communities coalesced in different layers of water but at the sediment water interface the coalescence of microbial communities was insufficient to be observed bi directionally the calculation of both positive and negative cohesions also showed a discrepancy between microbial communities in different layers of water and in the sediment fig 5 these results taken together demonstrated the distinction between microbial communities inhabited in water and in the sediment along the longitudinal direction upstream downstream relations of microbial communities were defined according to the location of sampling sites and the coalescence of adjacent microbial communities has been quantified using the proportion of overlapped asvs as shown in fig 4 as expected between two adjacent sampling sites microbial communities in the same type of habitat shared more overlapped asvs i e from the upstream sediment to the downstream sediment or from the upstream water to the downstream water this also showed the discrepancy of microbial species in the water and in the sediment according to a previous research focusing on the aquatic microbial communities in the yangtze river liu et al 2018 the estimated immigration rate m of sediment communities was much lower than that of water communities this conclusion was acquired by sloan s neutral model estimation and could interpret the difference between the coalescence of adjacent microbial communities in the overlying water and in the sediment 4 2 keystone species accumulated in microbial community coalescence keystone species in microbial communities are important for community structure and are driving irreplaceable pivotal functions steele et al 2011 berry and widder 2014 in this research only 3 keystone asvs were distinctly annotated to species level and most taxonomic annotations of keystone asvs were incomplete or ambiguous these unknown or unclassified taxa also known as microbial dark matter were reported meaningful for ecosystem processes zamkovaya et al 2021 and the result here supported the importance of microbial dark matter in the functions of microbial communities among 50 identified keystone asvs in our research some keystone taxa including nitrospira rhodobacteradaceae rhizobiales verrucomicrobia chloroflexi etc were computationally inferred in aquatic ecosystems banerjee et al 2018 these keystone taxa were reported present in diverse types of habitats including contaminated soil agricultural lands forest or woodlands etc indicating potential coalescences of communities between these habitats 4 keystone asvs were identified in both the sediment and the water in the tgr and the proportion of asv in common reached to 8 4 of 50 of keystone species in comparison only 0 79 asvs 64 of 8062 asvs were found present in both sediment and water this indicated a stronger coalescence of keystone species between different types of habitats water and sediment in our research from the upstream to the downstream in the tgr the velocity decreases and the water residence time increases and the reservoir could be divided into 3 zones according to these hydrologic gradients riverine zone transitional zone and lacustrine zone li et al 2019 number of sequencing reads of keystone asvs showed an increasing trend from the upstream riverine zone to the downstream lacustrine zone both in the water and in the sediment supplementary fig 8 one possible explanation is that these keystone taxa possessed unique ecological niche with their vital functions and the downstream homogeneous environment strengthened the competition between non keystone asvs causing the decrease of non keystone asvs and the rise of keystone asvs the species sorting in the lacustrine zone got more stronger and the priority effect was attenuated facilitating the intruding of the keystone asvs from the upstream niño garcía et al 2016 wu et al 2018 li et al 2019 in addition in this research keystone asvs were not the most abundant nor the most connected in the full network supplementary fig 9 this result is consistent with the definition of keystone taxa they are driving the composition and function of microbial communities irrespective of their abundance banerjee et al 2018 4 3 ecological implications of microbial community coalescence according to the definition community coalescence is a joining of previously separate communities as well as the mixing of habitat hence a stronger microbial community coalescence would result in more alike communities and more homogeneous environments where environmental conditions would converge rillig et al 2015 according to the theory of island biogeography under homogeneous environmental conditions little variation in community structure or species turnover is expected macarthur and wilson 2001 this is referred to as homogeneous selection which is a deterministic ecological process leibold et al 2004 zhou and ning 2017 in the tgr our previous research demonstrated that homogeneous selection dominated the sedimental microbial communities and the dispersal was limited li et al 2019 microbial community coalescence promoted homogeneous selection homogeneous selection competed with dispersal and dispersal was strongly affected by microbial community coalescence dispersal community coalescence and selection reached to a balanced tradeoff because of their competitive relations competitive interactions as negative feedbacks were regarded more stable than cooperative or positively correlated interactions coyte et al 2015 in this way microbial community coalescence could improve the microbiome stability 4 4 potential impacting factors of microbial community coalescence coalescence of microbial communities were prevalent in aquatic environment including rivers gao et al 2020 luo et al 2020b lakes wan et al 2021 reservoirs liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 etc in these studies of microbial ecology dispersal and coalescence were often discussed to explain the biogeographic distribution patterns of microbial communities however their impacting factors were rarely discussed according to niche theory among all impacting factors of microbial communities environmental conditions i e physiochemical properties of the environment were presumably the most influencing regardless of types of habitats of microorganisms macarthur and wilson 2001 hanson et al 2012 for aquatic microbial communities temperature and dissolved oxygen were reported as the relatively strong factors structuring the microbial communities in water in the tgr liu et al 2018 2020 in the sediment however total nitrogen nitrate ammonia total phosphorus and total organic carbon were the main impacting factors of the microbial communities liu et al 2018 li et al 2019 second microbial communities were also determined by different types of habitats in rivers and streams sediment and water are two distinguished habitats for microorganisms and the compositions diversity patterns and functions of microbial communities in both habitats were also distinct wang et al 2019 liao et al 2020 gao et al 2020 third suspended particles in water as a special interface of aquatic environment also played an important role in the coalescence of microbial communities the migration of suspended particles in river is a typical coalescence process of communities rather than a dispersal process as the definition of dispersal is the movement and successful establishment of an individual whilst the communities as well as the surrounding environment are deemed as the subject of coalescence hanson et al 2012 rillig et al 2015 in previous research free living and particle attached microbial communities were reported distinctly distributed and differently functioning salazar et al 2016 liu et al 2019 moreover suspended particles played important roles in the nitrogen cycle food web interactions and ecosystem services xia et al 2018 in addition the microbial coalescence could also be influenced by microscale microbial activities such as biofilm formation microbial coaggregation etc for instance in rivers and streams biofilms and aggregates were formed separately by different groups of microorganisms in laminar and turbulent the downstream compositions of microbial community were developed into distinct lifestyles niederdorfer et al 2016 in aquatic systems motile microorganisms and their self organization were studied and microbial coaggregation and the formation of multispecies biofilms were reviewed xu et al 2019 afonso et al 2021 in addition different carbon sources drove distinct spatial associations and patterns of cell aggregation forming vastly different microecosystems d souza et al 2021 in these prevailing microscale phenomena the microbial community coalescence should not be neglected 5 conclusion in this research by combining novel analyzing methods of 16s rrna sequencing results and recently proposed theories and hypotheses of microbial ecology coalescence of 94 microbial communities in both water and sediment in the tgr were focused the biogeography and the coalescence of microbial communities was depicted and analyzed and a co occurrence network of microbial communities was established to identify the keystone species and to track their abundance in the coalescence process this research found that the extent of coalescence was greater between communities in the same type of habitat than between communities in different types of habitats and that the abundance of keystone species accumulated in the coalesced downstream river water and sediment in summary this research emphasized the prevalence of microbial community coalescence in nature highlighted the importance of keystone species in community turnover and establishment and discussed the ecological implications of microbial community coalescence declaration of competing interest

16588,the microbial community coalescence describes the mixing of microbial communities and the merging of their surrounding environments despite its prevalence in natural ecosystems and its potential influence on ecological processes little research focused on the extent of coalescence between aquatic microbial communities in this research we analyzed the microbial communities in the three gorges reservoir a typical deep water reservoir on the yangtze river the biogeography and the coalescence of microbial communities in water and sediment were illustrated and analyzed based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence variants asvs differences in composition and diversity were identified between microbial communities in water and sediment and microbial communities in sediment were more diverse than those in water between adjacent communities by calculating the proportion of overlapped taxa adopting the sourcetracker algorithm and quantifying the connectivity of microbial cohesion we found that the extent of intra medium coalescence was strong 19 8 and inter media coalescence was faint 0 2 50 keystone species were selected using the cohesion metric they displayed a stronger coalescence extent than average and formed an accumulating pattern from upstream to downstream in the three gorges reservoir exhibiting their importance in the ecological network potential influencing factors of microbial community coalescence in aquatic environments were discussed including environmental conditions types of habitats suspended particles in water and microscale microbial activities to summarize this research depicted the coalescence of microbial communities in a deep water reservoir and emphasized its ecological importance we anticipate more attention and further research on the processes of microbial coalescence in the aquatic environment which might provide new insights into turnover of microbial keystone species and changes in aquatic ecological conditions graphical

important roles in rivers and streams some of them are driving aquatic biogeochemical cycles of elements and nutrients battin et al 2016 maavara et al 2020 some are contributing to aquatic primary production palmer and ruhi 2019 some are causing ecological problems zhang et al 2019b while some are applied in bioremediation xu et al 2014 the composition and function of microbial communities in rivers and streams are influenced by their surrounding environmental variables eutrophic conditions often induce algal bloom and denitrification often occurs in anaerobic conditions madigan et al 2018 in addition to environmental variables microbial communities are also influenced by different ecological processes such as selection dispersal and drift vellend 2010 while the prevalence and ubiquity of microorganisms was attributed to the dispersal process of individuals among microbial communities leibold et al 2004 read et al 2015 terui et al 2018 the extent to which microbial communities merge and coalesce is not fully understood mansour et al 2018 langenheder and lindström 2019 all these bring about a need for knowledge on how microbial communities coalesce in typical natural habitats studies focusing on the coalescence of microbial communities is increasing in recent years trying to elucidate and quantify different community assembly processes in microbial ecology zhou and ning 2017 as defined by rillig et al rillig et al 2015 community coalescence is an interchange event of communities and their environments in which separate communities join together into a new entity along with the mixing of their relatively large surrounding environments from a perspective of ecology community coalescence events are intersected with dispersal processes and the latter was described as the movement and successful establishment of an individual hanson et al 2012 they are also entangled with existing ecological theories and hypotheses e g environmental filtering priority effects metacommunity theory rillig et al 2015 evidence tools terminologies and importance of microbial community coalescence have been reviewed to encourage more research rillig et al 2015 rillig and mansour 2017 various microcosm experiments were conducted the asymmetric mixing of microbial communities with long distinct assembly history was proposed and confirmed supporting community based assembly process gilpin 1994 livingston et al 2013 study on methanogenic communities proved that one single community dominates the structure and function of coalesced community sierocinski et al 2017 in addition to microcosm experiments new methods were proposed to quantify the extent of coalescence between communities in a mixing event the most intuitive measurement would be the proportion of overlapped taxa classical dissimilarity measures are also useful as they are correlated with the overlap rate in real data bashan et al 2016 microbial source tracking has been widely used to quantify the immigration of taxa from source communities to sink communities knights et al 2011 mei and liu 2019 a new algorithm cohesion has been proposed to quantify the connectivity of microbial communities in a large dataset 40 samples herren and mcmahon 2017 non negative least squares nnls approach has also been used to estimate the contribution of communities sierocinski et al 2017 to summarize existing studies focused more on theoretical conceptions microcosm experiment interpretations or mathematical algorithms of the quantification yet the distribution patterns and the influencing factors of microbial coalescence happening in natural habitats have not been holistically studied rivers and streams are ideal places for field studies of microbial community coalescence mansour et al 2018 shifts in microbial communities in rivers and streams are primarily driven by biotic ecological succession than abiotic properties hence the microbial community coalescence is important for knowing modelling and altering of microbial communities in river networks read et al 2015 bai et al 2020 passive diffusion of microbial communities in rivers and streams is unidirectional from upstream to downstream reducing the complexity of diffusing directions of microbial communities and facilitating the preliminary research in aquatic environment mccarthy et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a moreover microbial communities in the aquatic environments are playing important roles in biogeochemical processes schmadel et al 2018 consequently getting a better knowledge of microbial community coalescence in rivers and streams paves way to a better protection of river ecosystem and a deeper understanding of natural microbial community coalescence the three gorges reservoir tgr built on the yangtze river is the largest water reservoir in terms of installed electric generating capacity xu et al 2013 the assembly of microbial communities in reservoirs explained the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of both biotic and abiotic properties of water and sediments and community coalescence is potentially influencing the community assembly processes liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 gao et al 2020 in addition the tgr is a typical deep water reservoir which contains a variety of aquatic conditions riverine zone transition zone and lacustrine zone therefore microbial communities in the tgr were focused and we hypothesized that microbial communities in water and sediment were differently affected by community coalescence and the coalescence had measurable impacts on microbial community structure different methods of community coalescence quantification were applied to a describe the biogeographic patterns of microbial communities b demonstrate the patterns of and relations between community diversity and community coalescence and c figure out the potential influencing factors of community coalescence and their ecological implications although community coalescence between various types of habitats e g bank soil to river water was not comprehensively explored in this work we provide a reference for prospective research on microbial community coalescence in aquatic environment and we anticipate a larger awareness of microbial community coalescence in search of solutions to microbial associated river environmental and river ecological issues 2 materials methods 2 1 study site and sampling yangtze river the largest river in china and the third longest river in the world originates in the qinghai tibetan plateau and flows eastward to the east china sea the three gorges reservoir tgr along the yangtze river extends between chongqing and yichang and covers more than 600 km of the yangtze river in this study a total of 94 water and sediment samples from 35 sites in the tgr were collected during april and may of 2018 the sampling work covered both the yangtze river mainstream and its 14 tributaries in the tgr fig 1 illustrated the locations of sampling sites

middle water 16 were bottom water and 26 were samples of sediments 45 of samples were taken from the mainstream of the yangtze river and 49 were taken from its tributaries see supplementary table 1 samples of surface river water were taken directly samples of middle and bottom water were taken using a water column sampler attached with an electronic motor to control the depths of sampling for each water sample 0 22 μm filtered films and bottled samples were stored in dry ice 80 c and ice box 4 c separately for further microbial dna extraction and physiochemical properties measurement each

of 16s rrna were performed by biozeron biotechnology co ltd shanghai china raw reads of 16s rrna gene amplicons were quality controlled and analyzed using qiime2 2020 11 basic criteria were respected following the official suggestions detailed processes could be found elsewhere gao et al 2020 after the aforementioned quality control dada2 was used for the detection and correction of amplicon sequence data as well as the generation of the phylogenetic tree the taxonomic annotation of sequences was assigned using the naive bayes classifier trained by the silva ssu132 16s rrna database quast et al 2012 with the pipeline provided by qiime2 amplicon sequence variants asvs also referred to as exact sequence variants or esv were produced in place of operational taxonomic units otus for a higher resolution of taxonomic annotations and a better comparability among studies glassman and martiny 2018 2 4 statistical analysis of microbial communities in this research richness measures observed asvs chao 1 ace shannon simpson invsimpson fisher and evenness statistical tests anova kruskal wallis rank sum test etc and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds were calculated and plotted using r language version 4 0 4 and the following packages vegan version 2 5 7 phyloseq version 1 34 0 and ggplot2 version 3 3 3 2 5 coalescence related calculations as illustrated in a recent review mei and liu 2019 there are three commonly used methods to evaluate the immigration and coalescence in microbial ecosystems the overlap of species proportion of shared species or number of reads of common asvs the estimation of proportion of taxa in the downstream given by source sink based models such as sourcetracker knights et al 2011 and the sloan s neutral model sloan et al 2006 in this research firstly the overlap of asvs between adjacent microbial communities was counted using r version 4 0 4 the contributions of different types of upstream sources to different types of downstream sinks were predicted using the bayesian classifier sourcetracker knights et al 2011 similar to the methods described elsewhere zhang et al 2019a luo et al 2020b the sourcetracker analysis was performed 4 times each time a type of habitat was set as the sink and the contribution of the rest communities to the sink communities were quantified moreover cohesion a recently proposed method for quantifying the degree of connectivity of microbial communities herren and mcmahon 2017 was also calculated to test the coalescence between communities 2 6 co occurrence network networks have been frequently used to explore interspecies interactions and to elucidate the importance of certain strains and species röttjers and faust 2018 keystone species are vital for the species turnover and the functions of microbial communities steele et al 2011 berry and widder 2014 banerjee et al 2018 here to identify the key species in different habitats i e surface water middle water bottom water and sediment 4 sub networks have been established with the following steps 1 selection of prevalent presented in no less than 1 5 of samples and abundant number of reads 5 asvs among samples in the same habitat type as nodes liu et al 2018 2 pairwise calculation of pearson correlation between nodes 3 selection of strong correlation coefficient 0 7 and significant p value 0 05 correlations as edges

each sub network using degree and cohesion banerjee et al 2018 6 construction of the full co occurrence network using strong coefficients 0 7 interspecies correlations isolated nodes whose degree 0 were omitted during the construction of the full network 7 combination of keystone species from 4 sub networks and the full network to better understand the structure of the co occurrence network the abundance sequence reads and mean abundance sequence reads number of presence of species in each layer of water and sediment were calculated and the species were then defined as layer related species by their highest mean abundance in each layer all calculations were conducted using r language r core team 2021 and igraph package csardi and nepusz 2006 the software gephi was used to visualize and render all networks bastian et al 2009 in the network the size of nodes was correlated with the degree of nodes and the brightness and saturation of nodes represent the mean abundance of species without specific explanations 2 7 data availability the sequencing data have been submitted to ncbi sequence read archive database under accession number prjna733826 3 results 3 1 physiochemical properties of samples the physiochemical properties of 94 water and sediment samples and 35 corresponding sampling sites could be found in supplementary table 1 in brief nutrient levels in water samples showed little difference between layers and most nutrients tn tp no3 and no2 were slightly higher in mainstreams than in tributaries except ammonium nh4 the average min max tn tp nitrate nitrite and ammonia concentrations were 2 192 1 183 3 440 mg l 0 134 0 041 0 834 mg l 1 625 0 478 2 648 mg l 0 039 0 002 0 150 mg l 0 110 0 008 0 872 mg l respectively water temperature varied from 13

concentration varied from 5 89 mg l to 10 46 mg l from bottom to surface do slightly increased in both mainstream and tributaries the orp varied from 127 6 mv to 308 2 mv and the average was 247 6 mv according to the particle size range the sediment could be separated into 3 components clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm and in most sediment samples particle size was larger than those in tributaries supplementary fig 10 3 2 sequencing results the statistics of sequencing results of the microbial samples i e the numbers of input filtered denoised and non chimeric reads and their corresponding percentages were listed in supplementary table 2 after all quality controls 18 238 to 53 402 valid reads were left in each sample with their proportions of input reads varying from 81 20 to 90 35 in all samples 8 092 asvs were obtained and the total number of valid reads reached to 3 569 132 prior to other analyses using r language sequences were rarified to 18 238 in each sample retaining 8 062 99 63 of 8 092 asvs 1 714 372 48 03 of 3 569 132 valid sequences and 94 100 of 94 samples in all sequences 32 346 0 91 sequences were assigned to archaea 3 536 779 99 09 to bacteria and only 7 sequences remained unassigned supplementary fig 1 most archaeal sequences 31 989 98 90 of 32 346 were found in sediments at the phylum level the most populated 10 phyla were proteobacteria 1 517 506 sequence counts 42 54 actinobacteria 793 918 sequence counts 22 26 bacteroidetes 334 281 sequence counts 9 37 chloroflexi 185 637 sequence counts 5 20 acidobacteria 185 346 sequence counts 5 20 cyanobacteria 170 023 sequence counts 4 77 verrucomicrobia 95 220 sequence counts 2 67 firmicutes 94 160 sequence counts 2 64 nitrospirae 35 791 sequence counts 1 00 and deinococcus thermus 27 826 sequence counts 0 78 and they were differently colored in fig 2 in addition 39 3 of all 8062 asvs were unique to water samples 59 9 were unique to sediment samples and 64 asvs 0 8 of 8062 present in both water and sediment 3 3 diversity analyses of microbial communities a series of alpha diversity indices including observed asvs chao1 index ace index shannon index simpson index invsimpson index and fisher index were calculated using the rarified sequences of each sample and the results were plotted in the matrix of bar charts in supplementary fig 2 in brief alpha diversity indices in different layers of river water surface water middle water bottom water showed little difference in both mainstream and tributaries of the yangtze river in the tgr in the sediment the alpha diversity indices in both mainstream and tributaries were significantly higher than those in different layers of river water in river water of the mainstream and tributaries alpha diversity indices of microbial communities were indistinguishable while in sediment of the mainstream alpha diversity indices of microbial communities were higher than those in the sediment of tributaries supplementary fig 2 and supplementary fig 3 moreover along the longitudinal flow direction of the yangtze river the alpha diversity indices of sedimental microbial communities decreased slower in the mainstream than in tributaries in the tgr supplementary fig 11 to demonstrate the beta diversity among microbial communities in both sediment and different layers of river water non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds of weighted unifrac dissimilarity matrix was performed as shown in fig 3 in addition to demonstrate the compositional dissimilarity of microbial communities nmds was also performed based on bray curtis dissimilarity matrix of proportional sample data supplementary fig 4 the distribution patterns of microbial communities were illustrated clearly in these fig s microbial communities in the sediment were significantly different from those in water samples from the sediment showed comparable differences in comparison with samples from different layers of water in terms of proportional dissimilarity nmds based on bray curtis dissimilarity furthermore taking phylogenetic dissimilarity nmds based on weighted unifrac dissimilarity into consideration communities in sediment demonstrated a much broader disparity than those in waters with the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix and the calculated dendritic distance matrix between samples a linear regression of dissimilarity on the distance was calculated and shown in supplementary fig 5 due to the small amount of shared asvs in sediment and water their bray curtis dissimilarity indices were close to 1 in contrast both water phase and sediment phase bray curtis dissimilarity were positively correlated with the dendritic distance between samples 3 4 coalescence of microbial communities different layers of water and river sediment of adjacent sampling sites were regarded as sources and destinations of the coalescence of microbial communities and the default flow direction from west to east from tributaries to the mainstream was respected to get a more general and meaningful result i e in this research density current caused by different water temperature or sand concentration was not considered the detailed pairs of upstream downstream were listed in the supplementary table 3 with this basic hypothesis the relative abundance of overlapped shared asvs was calculated for each microbial community and its neighbored upstream communities as demonstrated in fig 4 in pairwise upstream downstream community coalescence much more asvs were preserved in intra medium compared with inter media coalescence sediment sediment 20 6 0 7 water water 18 9 2 5 water sediment 0 3 0 0 sediment water 0 0 0 0 this result demonstrated a pattern of microbial coalescence in aquatic environment although the river water column and the sediment flowed in the same direction and there were a series of exchange of matters nutrients and elements little microorganisms successfully immigrated from their original habitat into new habitat the results of sourcetracker confirmed this pattern as shown in supplementary fig 6 when the sink was set to the microbial communities of surface water middle water and bottom water separately little proportion or none was contributed by the sediment microbial communities analogously when the sink was set to the microbial communities of sediment little proportion or none was contributed by the microbial communities from water interestingly the major source of microbial communities in water was the microbial communities in other layers of water and the contribution from other layers of water was highest 66 in the middle water to quantify the connectivity of microbial communities we calculated the cohesion of each microbial community in this research in general the absolute values of both positive and negative cohesions were higher in microbial communities in water than in sediment fig 5 the negative cohesion values mirrored the patterns of alpha diversity measurements of microbial communities supplementary fig 2 3 5 network analysis and keystone species identification to identify the keystone species for the metacommunity of the tgr co occurrence network analysis was used a series of operations were conducted as stated in materials methods as a result 476 positive interspecies correlations and 332 asvs were retained in the full network most nodes 267 80 42 of 332 asvs in the full network belonged to the most populated phyla fig 6 according to the mean abundance of species in the network each node in the co occurrence network was related to a layer i e surface water middle water bottom water sediment supplementary fig 7 most nodes were sediment related species 230 69 27 of 332 asvs followed by surface water 45 13 55 of 332 asvs middle water 29 8 73 of 332 asvs and bottom water 28 8 43 of 332 asvs most strong and significant correlations were found between sediment related species in the 4 sub networks of different layers of water and sediment a total of 50 keystone asvs were identified and 36 of them were present in the full network supplementary table 4 in each layer unlike the disparity and disproportion of nodes in the full network the numbers of keystone asvs were similar 11 was bottom water related species 10 were middle water related species 9 were sediment related species and 6 were surface water related species to demonstrate the quantitative change of 50 keystone asvs along the yangtze river before the three gorges dam we calculated the dendritic distance of samples and counted the reads of 50 keystone asvs in each sample as shown in supplementary fig 8 more reads of keystone asvs were found in samples closer to the three gorges dam and number of reads of keystone asvs in water were higher than that in the sediment these keystone asvs were emphasized in green color in the supplementary fig 9 to demonstrate their positions and connectivity in the full network 4 discussion microbial communities are playing key roles in biogeochemical cycling and energy flowing in aquatic ecosystems however the understanding of the impacts of the community coalescence and the keystone species on the formation of microbial communities remained preliminary in this work we investigated the distribution patterns of microbial communities in the tgr and their coalescence moreover co occurrence network analysis was conducted to identify strongly correlated species and keystone species in the microbial communities 4 1 coalescence of microbial communities showed distinct patterns in vertical and longitudinal directions along the vertical direction of the river water column in different layers of water similar microbial communities were found and they showed little dissimilarity in terms of alpha diversity fig 2 supplementary fig 2 and 3 indices as well as beta diversity fig 3 and supplementary fig 4 however microbial communities were distinct between water and sediment fig 2 and 3 supplementary fig 2 5 the distinction between water and sediment microbial communities has been reported in previous studies liu et al 2018 liao et al 2020 luo et al 2020a the portions of otus unique to water samples were reported as only a minority 1 2 in previous research liu et al 2018 but in this study asvs unique to water samples 39 3 and unique to sediment samples 59 9 were comparable and only 64 asvs present in both water and sediment this result showed the importance of habitat in the selection of microbial communities moreover the microbial source tracking result supplementary fig 6 illustrated that microbial communities coalesced in different layers of water but at the sediment water interface the coalescence of microbial communities was insufficient to be observed bi directionally the calculation of both positive and negative cohesions also showed a discrepancy between microbial communities in different layers of water and in the sediment fig 5 these results taken together demonstrated the distinction between microbial communities inhabited in water and in the sediment along the longitudinal direction upstream downstream relations of microbial communities were defined according to the location of sampling sites and the coalescence of adjacent microbial communities has been quantified using the proportion of overlapped asvs as shown in fig 4 as expected between two adjacent sampling sites microbial communities in the same type of habitat shared more overlapped asvs i e from the upstream sediment to the downstream sediment or from the upstream water to the downstream water this also showed the discrepancy of microbial species in the water and in the sediment according to a previous research focusing on the aquatic microbial communities in the yangtze river liu et al 2018 the estimated immigration rate m of sediment communities was much lower than that of water communities this conclusion was acquired by sloan s neutral model estimation and could interpret the difference between the coalescence of adjacent microbial communities in the overlying water and in the sediment 4 2 keystone species accumulated in microbial community coalescence keystone species in microbial communities are important for community structure and are driving irreplaceable pivotal functions steele et al 2011 berry and widder 2014 in this research only 3 keystone asvs were distinctly annotated to species level and most taxonomic annotations of keystone asvs were incomplete or ambiguous these unknown or unclassified taxa also known as microbial dark matter were reported meaningful for ecosystem processes zamkovaya et al 2021 and the result here supported the importance of microbial dark matter in the functions of microbial communities among 50 identified keystone asvs in our research some keystone taxa including nitrospira rhodobacteradaceae rhizobiales verrucomicrobia chloroflexi etc were computationally inferred in aquatic ecosystems banerjee et al 2018 these keystone taxa were reported present in diverse types of habitats including contaminated soil agricultural lands forest or woodlands etc indicating potential coalescences of communities between these habitats 4 keystone asvs were identified in both the sediment and the water in the tgr and the proportion of asv in common reached to 8 4 of 50 of keystone species in comparison only 0 79 asvs 64 of 8062 asvs were found present in both sediment and water this indicated a stronger coalescence of keystone species between different types of habitats water and sediment in our research from the upstream to the downstream in the tgr the velocity decreases and the water residence time increases and the reservoir could be divided into 3 zones according to these hydrologic gradients riverine zone transitional zone and lacustrine zone li et al 2019 number of sequencing reads of keystone asvs showed an increasing trend from the upstream riverine zone to the downstream lacustrine zone both in the water and in the sediment supplementary fig 8 one possible explanation is that these keystone taxa possessed unique ecological niche with their vital functions and the downstream homogeneous environment strengthened the competition between non keystone asvs causing the decrease of non keystone asvs and the rise of keystone asvs the species sorting in the lacustrine zone got more stronger and the priority effect was attenuated facilitating the intruding of the keystone asvs from the upstream niño garcía et al 2016 wu et al 2018 li et al 2019 in addition in this research keystone asvs were not the most abundant nor the most connected in the full network supplementary fig 9 this result is consistent with the definition of keystone taxa they are driving the composition and function of microbial communities irrespective of their abundance banerjee et al 2018 4 3 ecological implications of microbial community coalescence according to the definition community coalescence is a joining of previously separate communities as well as the mixing of habitat hence a stronger microbial community coalescence would result in more alike communities and more homogeneous environments where environmental conditions would converge rillig et al 2015 according to the theory of island biogeography under homogeneous environmental conditions little variation in community structure or species turnover is expected macarthur and wilson 2001 this is referred to as homogeneous selection which is a deterministic ecological process leibold et al 2004 zhou and ning 2017 in the tgr our previous research demonstrated that homogeneous selection dominated the sedimental microbial communities and the dispersal was limited li et al 2019 microbial community coalescence promoted homogeneous selection homogeneous selection competed with dispersal and dispersal was strongly affected by microbial community coalescence dispersal community coalescence and selection reached to a balanced tradeoff because of their competitive relations competitive interactions as negative feedbacks were regarded more stable than cooperative or positively correlated interactions coyte et al 2015 in this way microbial community coalescence could improve the microbiome stability 4 4 potential impacting factors of microbial community coalescence coalescence of microbial communities were prevalent in aquatic environment including rivers gao et al 2020 luo et al 2020b lakes wan et al 2021 reservoirs liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 etc in these studies of microbial ecology dispersal and coalescence were often discussed to explain the biogeographic distribution patterns of microbial communities however their impacting factors were rarely discussed according to niche theory among all impacting factors of microbial communities environmental conditions i e physiochemical properties of the environment were presumably the most influencing regardless of types of habitats of microorganisms macarthur and wilson 2001 hanson et al 2012 for aquatic microbial communities temperature and dissolved oxygen were reported as the relatively strong factors structuring the microbial communities in water in the tgr liu et al 2018 2020 in the sediment however total nitrogen nitrate ammonia total phosphorus and total organic carbon were the main impacting factors of the microbial communities liu et al 2018 li et al 2019 second microbial communities were also determined by different types of habitats in rivers and streams sediment and water are two distinguished habitats for microorganisms and the compositions diversity patterns and functions of microbial communities in both habitats were also distinct wang et al 2019 liao et al 2020 gao et al 2020 third suspended particles in water as a special interface of aquatic environment also played an important role in the coalescence of microbial communities the migration of suspended particles in river is a typical coalescence process of communities rather than a dispersal process as the definition of dispersal is the movement and successful establishment of an individual whilst the communities as well as the surrounding environment are deemed as the subject of coalescence hanson et al 2012 rillig et al 2015 in previous research free living and particle attached microbial communities were reported distinctly distributed and differently functioning salazar et al 2016 liu et al 2019 moreover suspended particles played important roles in the nitrogen cycle food web interactions and ecosystem services xia et al 2018 in addition the microbial coalescence could also be influenced by microscale microbial activities such as biofilm formation microbial coaggregation etc for instance in rivers and streams biofilms and aggregates were formed separately by different groups of microorganisms in laminar and turbulent the downstream compositions of microbial community were developed into distinct lifestyles niederdorfer et al 2016 in aquatic systems motile microorganisms and their self organization were studied and microbial coaggregation and the formation of multispecies biofilms were reviewed xu et al 2019 afonso et al 2021 in addition different carbon sources drove distinct spatial associations and patterns of cell aggregation forming vastly different microecosystems d souza et al 2021 in these prevailing microscale phenomena the microbial community coalescence should not be neglected 5 conclusion in this research by combining novel analyzing methods of 16s rrna sequencing results and recently proposed theories and hypotheses of microbial ecology coalescence of 94 microbial communities in both water and sediment in the tgr were focused the biogeography and the coalescence of microbial communities was depicted and analyzed and a co occurrence network of microbial communities was established to identify the keystone species and to track their abundance in the coalescence process this research found that the extent of coalescence was greater between communities in the same type of habitat than between communities in different types of habitats and that the abundance of keystone species accumulated in the coalesced downstream river water and sediment in summary this research emphasized the prevalence of microbial community coalescence in nature

16589,the enrichment of zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps in waste activated sludge was has raised concerns about their potential impact on anaerobic digestion of was to date there is no information regarding how to attenuate the negative effects of zno nps on was anaerobic digestion in this study it was found that the appropriate amount of cationic polyacrylamide cpam could mitigate the toxicity of zno nps during short term exposure the supplement of 4 0 mg cpam g tss significantly restored biochemical methane potential from 28 6 inhibition to 9 3 inhibition compared with the control digester p 0 01 the spiked cpam promoted the solubilization and acidification stages by weakening the contact between zno nps and anaerobes in anaerobic digestion process thus providing abundant substance for sequent bio utilization in the long term semi continues operated reactor the continuous replacement of cpam at 4 0 mg g tss significantly strengthened the recovery of vs destruction rate 20 3 to 26 4 p 0 01 and the daily yield of methane 93 5 ml d to 124 2 ml d p 0 01 consistent with the restored performance the application of cpam increased the total microbial communities and the relative abundances of dominant acidogens and methanogens further explorations showed decreased toxicity of zno nps primarily attributed to the decline of reactive oxygen species ros induced by zno nps

zno nps on anaerobic digestion in wwtps has attracted close attention of researchers in the last few years owing to their significant concentration level and noteworthy toxicity to microorganisms adams et al 2006 ge et al 2011 gottschalk et al 2009 some studies suggested that zno nps can adversely affect was anaerobic digestion for example the zno nps of 30 and 150 mg g tss reduced methane yield by 22 8 and 81 8 in the was anaerobic digestion respectively mu and chen 2011 additionally the zno nps of 87 mg l caused the 50 inhibition of acetoclastic methanogens and accordingly the zno nps of 250 mg l led to the 50 inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogens gonzalez estrella et al 2013 previous investigations have shown the toxicity of zno nps is mainly attributed to the released zinc ions zn2 franklin et al 2007 wong et al 2010 xia et al 2008 for instance the leached zn2 of 11 6 mg l and 17 6 mg l 30 and 150 mg g tss of zno nps respectively caused inhibited methane yield to 81 7 and 24 9 of the control respectively mu and chen 2011 apart from zn2 reactive oxygen species ros induced by zno nps are the alternative explanation for the adverse effects of zno nps on biological processes in wwtps which enables the cell vitality to decline xia et al 2008 for example the intracellular ros were found to increase as the elevated zno nps concentration and further impaired the polyphosphate accumulating bacteria in wastewater biological nitrogen process zheng et al 2011 cationic polyacrylamide cpam a high molecular weight cationically charged linear water soluble polymer compound is widely applied as a flocculant to strengthen solid liquid separation by interparticle cross linking and charge neutralization aguilar et al 2005 moussas and zouboulis 2009 there was an inevitable accumulation of cpam in sludge and its concentration ranged from 2 5 to 10 mg g dry sludge according to the previous report wang et al 2018 the abundant entrance of zno nps and the wide application of cpam in wwtps lead to the possibility of their co occurrence in the anaerobic digestion process the structure shaped from cpam likely seizes particulate matter lapointe et al 2020 making attenuated interaction between zno nps and microbial cells possible equally important the toxicity of zno nps is deemed to depend on their surface modification such as coating with oleic acid and methacrylic colvin 2003 hoshino et al 2004 yin et al 2010 2005 coincidently cpam can form the coating on the surface of zno nps and enmesh zno nps lapointe et al 2020 indicating its potential to regulate toxicity taking the situation into consideration the presence of cpam may effectively block the negative interaction of zno nps with anaerobic microorganisms in addition cpam can trap zno nps and further lower the mobility of zno nps thus reducing the potential risk of ros induction and zn2 leaching consequently it can be speculated that the addition of an appropriate amount of cpam will diminish the negative influence of zno nps on anaerobic digestion in wwtps however the information about the addition of cpam for alleviating methane production inhibition remains scarce this work was to focus on illuminating the potential effects of cpam on the toxicity of zno nps during was anaerobic digestion firstly the influence of different concentrations cpam 0 2 0 4 0 8 0 mg g tss on methane production during was including zno nps at a dosage of 15 mg g tss anaerobic digestion was evaluated then the details of how cpam alleviated the toxicity of zno nps were demonstrated through two toxicity pathways of zno nps zn2 leaching and ros induced from zno nps the present paper explores the feasibility of adding cpam to mitigate the adverse impacts of zno nps on the anaerobic digestion of was which will assist engineers in raising appropriate management strategies for wastewater with high level nanoparticles 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge zno nps and cpam the inoculum was anaerobically digested sludge which was gathered from a long term operated anaerobic digester with a sludge retention time of 20 days in our laboratory the was no cpam addition during sewage treatment process used in the following digestion was acquired from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtps in changsha city china the raw sludge was concentrated by setting for 24 h 4 c and filtered with a 0 45 mm stainless steel sieve to remove impurities the main characteristics of was are as follows total suspended solids tss 40 053 556 mg l volatile suspended solids vss 16 315 421 mg l and ph 6 8 0 1 the respective concentrations of carbohydrates and proteins are 186 5 mg l and 359 6 mg l respectively fig 2 zno nps 30 10 nm purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd were used in this work and the average diameter of their aggregates in nanofluids was measured by malvern zetasizer nano zs90 to be 308 6 nm fig s1 suspensions of zno nps were freshly prepared by medicating 20 g zno nps to 1 0 l distilled water ph 7 0 and then were sonicated 25 c 250 w 40 khz for 1 h before use the cpam with a molecular weight of 8 12 million da and a 30 charge density was purchased from meiyuan water purification materials company meiyuan co inc gongyi china furthermore with a remaining acrylamide level less 10 mg kg 2 2 effects of cpam on methane production from was added zno nps during short term exposure usually the zinc content in wwtps biosolids ranges from 0 22 to 8 55 mg g tss in usa epa 2009 considering the large consumption and potential accumulation of zno nps their content in environment may reach a higher content of 15 mg g tss according to the literature adams et al 2006 herein the batch scale experiment during short exposure period was implemented in four replicate reactors a working volume of 500 ml firstly 250 ml of was that contained 15 mg zno nps g tss a dosage of negatively affecting methane production from was anaerobic digestion zhao et al 2018 was added into four reactors then different dosages of cpam in terms of 0 6 w v solution were spiked into those digesters to attain the preestablished level 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 g kg tss at the initiation of the test followed by stirring at 200 rpm for 10 min and 50 rpm for another 15 min afterwards 25 ml of anaerobic sludge tss 23 671 mg l total cod 18 531 mg l was inoculated each digester was diluted using milli q water to 300 ml in contrast to the control 0 mg g tss of cpam and experimental group 2 0 4 0 or 8 0 mg g tss of cpam one blank group pristine was without zno nps and cpam addition was also carried out to assess the biochemical methane potential bmp of the zno nps free was after being purged with nitrogen for 5 min to expel oxygen all reactors were wedged with rubber stoppers tightly sealed and settled in an air bath incubator 35 1 c the total gas produced was detected by releasing the pressure to equilibrate with the room pressure using a glass syringe 250 ml in the reactor on the basis of the literature owen et al 1979 and the bmp tests modeling was described in supplementary material all experiments in the study unless otherwise stated were implemented in triplicate 2 3 influences of cpam on processes related to methane production from was added zno nps the tests to understand the effects of cpam at different levels i e 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg g tss in other anaerobic digestion steps related to methane production fig s2 were established under the same process as the bmp tests but spiked with sodium 2 bromoethanesulphonate sbes silva et al 2013 here 50 mm l sbes was added into the reactors to inhibit methanogenic archaea of the anaerobic digester since methanogens can rapidly utilize the yielded vfas during acidification here before and after three days of the tests the soluble cod soluble polysaccharides soluble proteins and vfas were determined respectively meanwhile the activities of the key enzymes concerning the anaerobic digestion process i e hydrolysis and acidification were assessed the detection procedures of the relevant enzyme activities i e protease cellulose and acetate kinase ak were presented in supplementary material the key enzymes measured in the anaerobic digestion process in this work are shown in fig s3 2 4 bench scale operation of long term semi continuous reactors three semi continuous bench scale anaerobic reactors 1 l working volume were conducted to estimate the prolonged effects of cpam on the microbial community and the toxicity of zno nps these reactors were continuously performed for 122 days with two stages in phase i baseline phase day 0 35 the three reactors were performed simultaneously to attain parallel and stable performance three digesters were settled in an air bath shaker and without the ph controlled in all digesters 35 1 c 150 rpm the sludge retention time of each reactor was regulated at 15 days by withdrawing 67 ml digested sludge and continuously replenishing 67 ml was at intervals of one day the vs concentrations of the was were estimated every 3 4 days to evaluate vs destruction rate of was before and after digestion the daily methane yield of each reactor was measured 3 4 times every week after the daily methane production and vs destruction rate reached a 10 difference the tests were initiated phase ii day 35 122 one of three digesters was fed with pristine was as blank the other two reactors were both spiked 15 mg zno nps g tss one of them was regarded as a control group and another one was treated as an experimental reactor added extra 4 0 mg cpam g tss except that the daily feed was correspondingly replaced by the was with zno nps or was added zno nps and cpam other working conditions were kept the same as those of phase i when the methane production and vs destruction rate in three reactors did not amend dramatically with time respectively i e within 5 inequality of value the second relative stable phase is deemed to be achieved three specimens were withdrawn from individual digester when the experiment was finished day 122 and the microbial communities in the sample were examined by the illumina hiseq 16s rdna genes method majorbio shanghai china according to our previous report fan et al 2019 the primers 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 targeting the v4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16s rdna were chosen 2 5 effects of adding cpam on released zn2 as well as ros production from zno nps on was anaerobic digestion mu et al found that zn2 was the only dominant chemical extraneous substance from zno nps alluding that zn2 played an essential role in the toxicity of zno nps to was anaerobic digestion mu and chen 2011 here the different amounts of cpam 0 2 0 4 0 8 0 mg g tss were dosed in the reactors with 250 ml was and 15 mg zno nps g tss to determine the concentration of released zn2 from zno nps these reactors were maintained in the same setup after flushed with nitrogen for 3 min to remove o2 35 1 c at a completely different leaching stage each sludge mixture was removed and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 25 min and then the liquid supernatant was gathered and filtrated by 0 22 mm mixed cellulose ester membrane jiang et al 2009 li et al 2011 after acidified with 2 ultra high purity hno3 the released zn2 was measured through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7900icp ms usa the ros production was also considered to gain an insight into the mechanisms of alleviated zno nps toxicity joshi et al 2009 therefore the intracellular ros level was determined during the bmp tests at different cpam section 2 2 and the lactate dehydrogenase ldh was measured to guarantee the potential impacts of adding cpam on the generation of ros from zno nps gu et al 2014 the values related to ros production at different zno nps applications were described as parameters relative to the blank with pristine concentrated was 2 6 analytical methods the composition of produced biogas was examined by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd using nitrogen as the carrier gas agilent 7890b vfas were measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector fid agilent 7890b and represented as a sum of determined components i e acetic propionic and butyric acids the operating conditions of gc tcd and gc fid are detailed in supplementary material the determination of zn2 tss vss and tcod was achieved according to standard methods american public health association et al 2017 protein and carbohydrate were analyzed by the bca bicinchoninic acid method and phenol sulfuric acid method respectively raunkjær et al 1994 smith et al 1985 the sample treatment for analysis of soluble protein soluble polysaccharide scod and vfas was conducted according to our previous study fan et al 2019 the lactate dehydrogenase assay kit njjcbio nanjing china was used to detect the concentration of ldh the detailed steps of scanning electron microscope sem of sludge and intracellular ros are presented in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of cpam on bmp of was added zno nps bmp tests at different cpam levels were accomplished to explore the influence of cpam on methane production from was anaerobic digestion added zno nps based on eq s1 table s1 the accumulative methane production throughout anaerobic digestion is presented in fig 1 it was shown that the methane production in the blank reactor 238 07 ml g vs without zno nps and cpam rose with digestion time 1 35 d and then no dramatic increase was detected after day 35 p 0 05 however the maximum methane yield decreased to 170 63 ml g vs and the lag phase time increased from 35 to 50 in the control reactor with only zno nps which corresponded to previous reports mu and chen 2011 zhao et al 2018 similar trends of methane cumulation were discovered in reactors with cpam application but cpam ameliorated the inhibition of zno nps on methane production for example with the addition of 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg cpam g the methane production was 193 23 216 64 and 200 25 ml g vs respectively the presence of 4 0 mg cpam g significantly p 0 01 increased methane production by 19 3 compared with the control which showed the highest recovery efficiency of bmp for was with zno nps addition nevertheless the maximum cpam 8 0 mg cpam g addition made a low efficiency on recovery for methane production to some degree this could be accounted for the increased transfer resistance of available substances the excessive cpam addition facilitated the formation of flocculated sludge particles such particles in turn hindered the disintegration efficiency of was eventually weakening methane production of anaerobic digestion chu et al 2005 in summary all results manifested that cpam exerted a positive influence on methane yield of was anaerobic digestion added zno nps it should be emphasized that although cpam and zno nps had detrimental impacts on anaerobic digestion of sludge respectively the alleviated effects of cpam on the toxicity of zno nps were well established fig s4 the contribution of cpam to methane production may be neglected because only 6 7 of the decomposed cpam was converted to the final product methane wang et al 2018 this pattern proved that increased methane yield benefited from decreased toxicity of zno nps rather than the enhanced performance of pristine sludge anaerobic digestion 3 2 effects of cpam on each step of was anaerobic digestion added zno nps the inhibition of zno nps on was anaerobic digestion is manifested in the following four stages sludge solubilization hydrolysis acidification and methanation wei et al 2019 the selection of proper model substrates can evaluate the impact of exogenous pollutants on each step of sludge anaerobic digestion wu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 however the application of model substrates in synthetic wastewater rather than sludge inevitably transforms the connection between zno nps and cpam thereby the fluctuations of soluble organic substances from anaerobic reactors fed with sludge rather than synthetic wastewater were applied to estimate the effects of cpam on each step of was anaerobic digestion added zno nps anaerobic digestion of was with different contents of cpam was performed in the condition of prohibiting methanogens the test operated for 3 days during which the methane in each case was not monitored because of the addition of sbes sludge disintegration converting organic molecule substances of sludge to soluble matters is the initial step the release of soluble cod scod is used to express the ratio of sludge disintegration in this study and the result is summarized in fig 2 the released scod decreased from 6865 165 mg l of the blank digester without zno nps and cpam to 5501 151 mg l in control with zno nps implicating the negative effect of zno nps on the solubilization process it is noticed that zno nps with a particle size of 140 nm were no significant effect on sludge solubilization process mu and chen 2011 this inconsistency could be partly due to the difference of particles diameter for zno nps 308 6 nm of particles diameter in our tests in the reactors with 15 mg zno nps g tss and different levels of cpam the release of scod was all promoted specifically the scod concentration was 6263 135 mg l p 0 001 and 6626 110 mg l p 0 001 for the addition of 2 0 mg cpam g and 4 0 mg cpam g respectively but only 6500 168 mg l with the supplement of 8 0 mg cpam g higher cpam level did not further improve the discharge of scod which might be the inhibitory effect of higher cpam level during anaerobic digestion wang et al 2018 in a word the addition of cpam can strengthen the sludge solubilization in our study levels especially in 4 0 mg cpam g tss as the primary components of sludge solubilization soluble protein and carbohydrate were decomposed in the hydrolysis process from fig 2 it can be seen that the levels of soluble carbohydrate and protein for the control group with 15 mg zno nps g tss were comparable to those in the blank without zno nps and extra cpam respectively which is in accordance with previous literature mu and chen 2011 zhang et al 2017 in addition the content of soluble carbohydrate and protein in different levels of cpam had no obvious p 0 05 variation compared with the control which was also proved by the consequences of the analyzes for enzyme activities especially the protease and α glucosidase fig s3 this finding demonstrated that cpam at the studied level 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg g tss did not affect hydrolysis of sludge added 15 mg zno nps g tss vfas the production of microbial acidification mainly included acetate propionate butyrate and valerate from fig 2 the total vfas concentrations were 4826 8 3821 6 4205 9 4329 3 and 4101 0 mg cod l in the blank 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg cpam g tss respectively the zno nps of 15 mg g tss in the control could restrain vfas production to 79 2 0 1 compared with blank which was in agreement with the previous research zhang et al 2017 while cpam at 4 0 mg g tss significantly promoted the vfas yield to 89 7 p 0 01 consistent with the vfas advancement the activity of bk and oaatc also increased from 94 6 and 96 8 to 98 2 and 98 9 respectively fig s3 it is clear that the recovery of vfas was negatively affected by 8 0 mg cpam g with only a percent of 85 0 liu et al also reported that vfas accumulation gradually decreased with the addition of cpam from 0 to 24 mg g tss during anaerobic digestion of was which could elaborate why a higher dosage of cpam 8 0 mg g tss in tests was less effective than 4 0 mg cpam g tss liu et al 2019 from our knowledge methanogenesis is based on vfas and the more production of vfas the more generation of methane overall although the addition of cpam had no effect on hydrolysis of was with the presence of zno nps it facilitated solubilization and acidification it can be concluded that although cpam addition increased transfer resistance of sludge it limited the direct contact and interaction between zno nps and anaerobes increased organic substrates caused by increased extracellular hydrolase were beneficial to the sequent biochemical process meanwhile the decreased toxicity of zno nps for acidogens and methanogens also had a positive influence on methane production this pattern may imply one reason of the strengthened methane yield from was added zno nps anaerobic digestion with the appropriate application of cpam i e 4 0 mg g tss 3 3 effects of continuous addition of cpam on the performance of was anaerobic digestion the growing release of zno nps owing to their universal application would possibly cause a greater enrichment in sludge based on the bmp tests it was observed that cpam can enhance the methane production on anaerobic digestion of was added zno nps suggesting the application of cpam may alleviate the toxicity of zno nps and consequently strengthen the performance of anaerobic digestion system the application of cpam to regulate the toxicity of zno nps in was anaerobic digestion can be regarded as a successive procedure during the practical engineering thereby it is indispensable to understand the long term effects of cpam on anaerobic digestion of was with the addition of zno nps the performance of anaerobic digestion system was evaluated by the vs destruction efficiency and daily methane yield and the results are presented in fig 3 at the end of phase i day 25 35 the average vs destruction rate was basically stabilized at 29 8 and average daily methane yield was approximately 149 6 ml d in each digester representing that the was in all digester has adapted and reached a similar steady status during phase ii day 35 122 the long term exposure to zno nps triggered fluctuant and deteriorative performances of the control digester which was in agreement with the literature zhang et al 2020 with the gradual acclimation of anaerobic microbes in the reactor added zno nps the fluctuations performance of the reactor got smaller and entered into the relatively steady state again after day 90 during the last 12 days in phase ii day 110 122 the average vs destruction rate and daily methane yield of the control digester fell from 29 8 to 20 3 p 0 01 and from 149 6 ml d to 93 5 ml d p 0 01 respectively fig 3 compared with the blank without zno nps and extra cpam in contrast the application of cpam alleviated the inhibition of zno nps to the anaerobic digestion of sludge during days 110 122 the average vs destruction rate in the experimental reactor restored to 26 4 making a contract to the vs destruction rate value the average daily methane yield in the experimental reactor restored to 124 2 ml d to sum up the long term exposure to zno nps worsened the performance of was anaerobic digestion system which was represented by a decline in vs destruction rate and methane yield meanwhile the application of 4 0 mg cpam g tss obviously mitigated the adverse impacts of zno nps on anaerobic digestion system 3 4 microbial community assessment with the supplement of cpam to further comprehend the mechanisms of the cpam enhancing methane yield from anaerobic digestion of was with zno nps the microbial community composition in the long term anaerobic digesters was detected in the samples from the blank control and experimental digester the illumina hiseq sequencing number was 47 897 46 205 and 49 242 respectively meanwhile venn diagram analysis presented that a total of 1357 operational taxonomic units otus was shared by three reactors and the number of otus in blank control and experimental reactor was 1835 1863 and 1980 respectively it s worth noting that the supplement of zno nps constrained the development of community richness diversity and phylogenetic diversity as indicated by α diversity analysis at the out classification level whereas cpam promoted that table s2 this pattern demonstrated that the prolonged presence of zno nps decreased the total microbial populations but the additional cpam mitigated this restriction the raised richness and diversity of the total microbial community may be due to the fact that the formed sludge aggregations further facilitated the expansion of specific microorganisms with the addition of cpam the dominant phyla of the microbial community among three reactors were euryarchaeota cloacimonetes proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroides which accounted for 71 2 of the total microbial community the relative abundance of phyla euryarchaeota a well known methanogen fell from 24 5 in the blank digester to 15 3 in the control digester which was consistent with the suppressive influence of zno nps on methanogenesis process during was anaerobic digestion compared with the control reactor the supplement of 4 0 mg cpam g tss alleviated the decrement of methane production and the relative abundance of phyla euryarchaeota recovered to 23 3 in the experimental digester in addition the continuous exposure to zno nps hardly influenced the abundances of other predominant bacterial phyla e g actinobacteria and proteobacteria fig 4 a these completely versatile anaerobes were representative of organotrophs including hydrolytic strains capable of decomposing lipids polymeric carbohydrates and proteins wei et al 2019 their invariability may indicate that exposure to zno nps has no effect on hydrolysis process section 3 2 correspondingly a similar phenomenon was also observed in the digester with the application of 4 0 mg cpam g tss the heat map fig 4b demonstrates the microbial populations of anaerobes involved in acetogenesis and methanogenesis processes at the genus level in all anaerobic digesters the methanobacterium sp and methanosaeta sp relevant to methanogenesis were the principal genera compared to the blank system their abundances reduced from 14 3 and 8 9 to 11 2 and 5 6 in the control digester respectively while restored to 13 9 and 8 2 in the experimental digester respectively moreover the abundances of some anaerobes related to acidification in the experimental system were also remarkably elevated for instance christensenellaceae r 7 group sp and longilinea sp were two dominant acidogens and their populations increased by 12 8 and 7 1 in comparison with the control digester it can be concluded that the long term replenishment of 4 0 mg cpam g tss ameliorated the adverse impacts of zno nps on dominant methanogens and acidogens which is the reason why the cpam facilitated anaerobic system performance the enhancement of acidogens and methanogens might be also helpful to comprehend how cpam strengthened methane accumulation 3 5 effects of adding cpam on sludge surface and leached zn2 as well as intracellular ros production sem detection was used to examine the accumulation of nps in was kiser et al 2009 and the results are recorded in fig s5 during anaerobic digestion the sludge was continuously exposed to zno nps resulting in a large number of zno nps adsorbed on the sludge surface similar results were observed by other investigators when exploring the absorption of nanoparticles in sludge kiser et al 2010 limbach et al 2008 mu et al 2011a 2011b from fig s5c the zno nps tend to aggregate with the supplement of 4 0 mg cpam g tss the released zn2 from zno nps a significant contributor to the negative effects of zno nps liu et al 2011 was detected in different anaerobic digestion time 7 days background concentration of zn2 from pristine sludge was also measured before the test and a lower zn2 concentration was obtained 0 09 mg l the concentration of released zn2 in was with different levels of cpam is shown in fig 5 a in all cases the released zn2 of all levels cpam dosed was comparable with those of only zno nps dosed hinting the presence of cpam hardly affected zn2 release the initial decrease day of 1 2 of zn2 concentration can be attributed to the zn2 release from zno nps into digestion solution where it can interact with an extracellular polymeric matter zhao et al 2018 in addition intracellular ros production and ldh release have been widely used to assess the impacts of nanoparticles on cell growth and viability gu et al 2014 ma et al 2013 it can be seen from fig 5b that ldh level and ros generation were higher remarkably in the control with zno nps than blank reactor without zno nps and cpam which increased to 117 6 and 129 6 respectively the application of cpam mitigated the oxidative damage of zno nps on anaerobic microbes in comparison with the control the ros production was decreased to 119 6 108 6 and 114 3 of the blank meanwhile the relative content of ldh was 107 1 103 5 and 135 1 with the presence of 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg cpam g tts respectively this observation is consistent with the finding of yin et al and leung et al leung et al 2012 yin et al 2010 the surface chemistry coatings helped to reduce ros production and cytotoxicity of zno nps in general our results demonstrated that cpam could not prevent the zn2 discharge from zno nps but the moderate application of cpam effectively reduced ros induction which is the reason why cpam can mitigate the deterioration of anaerobic digestion system by zno nps positive holes formed at the surface of zno nps due to the presence of oxygen remained in sludge are trapped by water molecules dodd and jha 2011 which causes the generation of hydroxyl radicals bound to the surface of zno nps yin et al 2010 zno nps also play an essential role in production of hydrogen peroxide under anaerobic state yang et al 2013 these ros generated can trigger peroxidation of membrane and organelle which finally leads to metabolic disorder or ultimate death of microbial cells the death of cells makes release of ldh possible li et al 2008 the intensity of oxidative damage depends on the contact opportunities between zno nps and oxygen and the efficiency of ros entering into microbial cells the addition of cpam may hinder the link between zno nps and oxygen since cpam traps zno nps and meanwhile chemical bonds might form on the surface of zno nps dodd and jha 2011 in addition the presence of cpam may confine the contact between zno nps and anaerobes owing to the formation of aggregated sludge flocs however the excessive cpam 8 0 mg g tss causes the death of microbial cells and further leak of ldh fig 5b although the enmeshment effect of cpam on zno nps remains effective 3 6 implications currently the removal of nps from wastewater is still in its infancy kiser et al 2010 wwtps have been a final sinks of zno nps li et al 2019 because there was not any suggested limit on zno nps in water piplai et al 2018 even though the was exhibits a very significant enrichment for zno nps cervantes avilés and cuevas rodríguez 2017 khan et al 2018 the treatment e g concentration dewatering anaerobic digestion pyrolysis drying of following biosolids is also a serious issue based on our observations it can be confirmed that the mitigation of the adverse effects of zno nps on was anaerobic digestion was accomplished with the moderate application of cpam the net gain of cpam application was calculated and recorded in supplementary material it is clear that the benefit of restored methane is higher than the cost of cpam no matter what content is chosen 2 0 mg g tss or 4 0 mg g tss as this finding was based on our laboratory conditions further verification should be put into effect in practical operation only the effectiveness of dosing cpam to alleviate the toxicity of single zno nps i e 30 10 nm uncoated was estimated nowadays hence further study could be implemented to understand the availability of adding cpam to weaken the toxicity of compound zno nps in coming days as zno nps exixt in was with different species and forms ma et al 2014 additionally although the cpam is low cost and easily available in the actual treatment process it is worth noting that excessive cpam has less efficiency in the recovery of methane production this underscores that a reduced amount of cpam may optimize the anaerobic digestion performance after sludge dewatering since large quantities cpam is supplemented to flocs during the mechanical dewatering chu et al 2002 typically various pretrements are used to enhance sludge anaerobic digestion microwave pretreatment a pretreatment technology should be recommended to carry out before anaerobic digestion when was contained zno nps at substantial level wang et al 2019 due to the amount of energy to be provided for decomposition of organic matters by frequent friction between zno nps and organic substances under the microwave moreover unintentional land use or soil application is always a disposal method of digested sludge in the usa zhou and zhang 2020 in this scenario there is a possibility of spatial coexistence of zno nps and cpam however the effects of cpam on the bioavailability of cumulate zno nps still unexplored and further works should be conducted in the future 4 conclusion the anaerobic digestion of sludge was restrained by zno nps this study manifested that the possibility of adding cpam to alleviate the toxicity of zno nps for was anaerobic digestion and the main conclusions are 1 with the presence of 4 mg cpam g tss in was the methane production significantly increased from 71 4 to 90 7 compared with the control with zno nps 2 compared with the control reactor the addition of cpam had no obvious influence on hydrolysis but significantly facilitated solubilization and acidification process for was anaerobic digestion which contributed to methane production enhanced 3 analyzes of the long term operated reactors demonstrated that cpam application obviously diminished the toxicity of zno nps to was anaerobic digestion which was testified by recovery of average vs destruction rate and daily methane yield 4 from the long term operation of semi continuous reactors it was found that the total microbial communities and the relative abundances of key acidogens and methanogens increased 5 increased methane yield was mainly ascribed to the declined ros induction by zno nps when cpam was

16589,the enrichment of zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps in waste activated sludge was has raised concerns about their potential impact on anaerobic digestion of was to date there is no information regarding how to attenuate the negative effects of zno nps on was anaerobic digestion in this study it was found that the appropriate amount of cationic polyacrylamide cpam could mitigate the toxicity of zno nps during short term exposure the supplement of 4 0 mg cpam g tss significantly restored biochemical methane potential from 28 6 inhibition to 9 3 inhibition compared with the control digester p 0 01 the spiked cpam promoted the solubilization and acidification stages by weakening the contact between zno nps and anaerobes in anaerobic digestion process thus providing abundant substance for sequent bio utilization in the long term semi continues operated reactor the continuous replacement of cpam at 4 0 mg g tss significantly strengthened the recovery of vs destruction rate 20 3 to 26 4 p 0 01 and the daily yield of methane 93 5 ml d to 124 2 ml d p 0 01 consistent with the restored performance the application of cpam increased the total microbial communities and the relative abundances of dominant acidogens and methanogens further explorations showed decreased toxicity of zno nps primarily attributed to the decline of reactive oxygen species ros induced by zno nps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion zinc oxide nanoparticles cationic polyacrylamide 1 introduction more and more nanoparticles are applied to industrial and daily products due to their novel particular properties kim et al 2010 nel et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 especially zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps are produced at a quantity of 550 t per year globally ranking the third in the output of metal nanoparticles piccinno et al 2012 as one of the most popular metal oxide nanoparticles zno nps are indirectly released to the environment for their wide applications in sunscreen formulations cosmetics paints packaging and plastics ishii et al 2016 ju nam and lead 2008 wu et al 2009 via urban pipe network a mass of zno nps eventually accumulate in wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are usually operated with activated sludge technology gottschalk et al 2009 due to the absorption aggregation and precipitation in activated sludge zno nps are easy to remain in waste activated sludge was kiser et al 2010 limbach et al 2008 which brings long term challenges to the treatment of was in wwtps adams et al 2006 the impact of zno nps on anaerobic digestion in wwtps has attracted close attention of researchers in the last few years owing to their significant concentration level and noteworthy toxicity to microorganisms adams et al 2006 ge et al 2011 gottschalk et al 2009 some studies suggested that zno nps can adversely affect was anaerobic digestion for example the zno nps of 30 and 150 mg g tss reduced methane yield by 22 8 and 81 8 in the was anaerobic digestion respectively mu and chen 2011 additionally the zno nps of 87 mg l caused the 50 inhibition of acetoclastic methanogens and accordingly the zno nps of 250 mg l led to the 50 inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogens gonzalez estrella et al 2013 previous investigations have shown the toxicity of zno nps is mainly attributed to the released zinc ions zn2 franklin et al 2007 wong et al 2010 xia et al 2008 for instance the leached zn2 of 11 6 mg l and 17 6 mg l 30 and 150 mg g tss of zno nps respectively caused inhibited methane yield to 81 7 and 24 9 of the control respectively mu and chen 2011 apart from zn2 reactive oxygen species ros induced by zno nps are the alternative explanation for the adverse effects of zno nps on biological processes in wwtps which enables the cell vitality to decline xia et al 2008 for example the intracellular ros were found to increase as the elevated zno nps concentration and further impaired the polyphosphate accumulating bacteria in wastewater biological nitrogen process zheng et al 2011 cationic polyacrylamide cpam a high molecular weight cationically charged linear water soluble polymer compound is widely applied as a flocculant to strengthen solid liquid separation by interparticle cross linking and charge neutralization aguilar et al 2005 moussas and zouboulis 2009 there was an inevitable accumulation of cpam in sludge and its concentration ranged from 2 5 to 10 mg g dry sludge according to the previous report wang et al 2018 the abundant entrance of zno nps and the wide application of cpam in wwtps lead to the possibility of their co occurrence in the anaerobic digestion process the structure shaped from cpam likely seizes particulate matter lapointe et al 2020 making attenuated interaction between zno nps and microbial cells possible equally important the toxicity of zno nps is deemed to depend on their surface modification such as coating with oleic acid and methacrylic colvin 2003 hoshino et al 2004 yin et al 2010 2005 coincidently cpam can form the coating on the surface of zno nps and enmesh zno nps lapointe et al 2020 indicating its potential to regulate toxicity taking the situation into consideration the presence of cpam may effectively block the negative interaction of zno nps with anaerobic microorganisms in addition cpam can trap zno nps and further lower the mobility of zno nps thus reducing the potential risk of ros induction and zn2 leaching consequently it can be speculated that the addition of an appropriate amount of cpam will diminish the negative influence of zno nps on anaerobic digestion in wwtps however the information about the addition of cpam for alleviating methane production inhibition remains scarce this work was to focus on illuminating the potential effects of cpam on the toxicity of zno nps during was anaerobic digestion firstly the influence of different concentrations cpam 0 2 0 4 0 8 0 mg g tss on methane production during was including zno nps at a dosage of 15 mg g tss anaerobic digestion was evaluated then the details of how cpam alleviated the toxicity of zno nps were demonstrated through two toxicity pathways of zno nps zn2 leaching and ros induced from zno nps the present paper explores the feasibility of adding cpam to mitigate the adverse impacts of zno nps on the anaerobic digestion of was which will assist engineers in raising appropriate management strategies for wastewater with high level nanoparticles 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge zno nps and cpam the inoculum was anaerobically digested sludge which was gathered from a long term operated anaerobic digester with a sludge retention time of 20 days in our laboratory the was no cpam addition during sewage treatment process used in the following digestion was acquired from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtps in changsha city china the raw sludge was concentrated by setting for 24 h 4 c and filtered with a 0 45 mm stainless steel sieve to remove impurities the main characteristics of was are as follows total suspended solids tss 40 053 556 mg l volatile suspended solids vss 16 315 421 mg l and ph 6 8 0 1 the respective concentrations of carbohydrates and proteins are 186 5 mg l and 359 6 mg l respectively fig 2 zno nps 30 10 nm purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd were used in this work and the average diameter of their aggregates in nanofluids was measured by malvern zetasizer nano zs90 to be 308 6 nm fig s1 suspensions of zno nps were freshly prepared by medicating 20 g zno nps to 1 0 l distilled water ph 7 0 and then were sonicated 25 c 250 w 40 khz for 1 h before use the cpam with a molecular weight of 8 12 million da and a 30 charge density was purchased from meiyuan water purification materials company meiyuan co inc gongyi china furthermore with a remaining acrylamide level less 10 mg kg 2 2 effects of cpam on methane production from was added zno nps during short term exposure usually the zinc content in wwtps biosolids ranges from 0 22 to 8 55 mg g tss in usa epa 2009 considering the large consumption and potential accumulation of zno nps their content in environment may reach a higher content of 15 mg g tss according to the literature adams et al 2006 herein the batch scale experiment during short exposure period was implemented in four replicate reactors a working volume of 500 ml firstly 250 ml of was that contained 15 mg zno nps g tss a dosage of negatively affecting methane production from was anaerobic digestion zhao et al 2018 was added into four reactors then different dosages of cpam in terms of 0 6 w v solution were spiked into those digesters to attain the preestablished level 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 g kg tss at the initiation of the test followed by stirring at 200 rpm for 10 min and 50 rpm for another 15 min afterwards 25 ml of anaerobic sludge tss 23 671 mg l total cod 18 531 mg l was inoculated each digester was diluted using milli q water to 300 ml in contrast to the control 0 mg g tss of cpam and experimental group 2 0 4 0 or 8 0 mg g tss of cpam one blank group pristine was without zno nps and cpam addition was also carried out to assess the biochemical methane potential bmp of the zno nps free was after being purged with nitrogen for 5 min to expel oxygen all reactors were wedged with rubber stoppers tightly sealed and settled in an air bath incubator 35 1 c the total gas produced was detected by releasing the pressure to equilibrate with the room pressure using a glass syringe 250 ml in the reactor on the basis of the literature owen et al 1979 and the bmp tests modeling was described in supplementary material all experiments in the study unless otherwise stated were implemented in triplicate 2 3 influences of cpam on processes related to methane production from was added zno nps the tests to understand the effects of cpam at different levels i e 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg g tss in other anaerobic digestion steps related to methane production fig s2 were established under the same process as the bmp tests but spiked with sodium 2 bromoethanesulphonate sbes silva et al 2013 here 50 mm l sbes was added into the reactors to inhibit methanogenic archaea of the anaerobic digester since methanogens can rapidly utilize the yielded vfas during acidification here before and after three days of the tests the soluble cod soluble polysaccharides soluble proteins and vfas were determined respectively meanwhile the activities of the key enzymes concerning the anaerobic digestion process i e hydrolysis and acidification were assessed the detection procedures of the relevant enzyme activities i e protease cellulose and acetate kinase ak were presented in supplementary material the key enzymes measured in the anaerobic digestion process in this work are shown in fig s3 2 4 bench scale operation of long term semi continuous reactors three semi continuous bench scale anaerobic reactors 1 l working volume were conducted to estimate the prolonged effects of cpam on the microbial community and the toxicity of zno nps these reactors were continuously performed for 122 days with two stages in phase i baseline phase day 0 35 the three reactors were performed simultaneously to attain parallel and stable performance three digesters were settled in an air bath shaker and without the ph controlled in all digesters 35 1 c 150 rpm the sludge retention time of each reactor was regulated at 15 days by withdrawing 67 ml digested sludge and continuously replenishing 67 ml was at intervals of one day the vs concentrations of the was were estimated every 3 4 days to evaluate vs destruction rate of was before and after digestion the daily methane yield of each reactor was measured 3 4 times every week after the daily methane production and vs destruction rate reached a 10 difference the tests were initiated phase ii day 35 122 one of three digesters was fed with pristine was as blank the other two reactors were both spiked 15 mg zno nps g tss one of them was regarded as a control group and another one was treated as an experimental reactor added extra 4 0 mg cpam g tss except that the daily feed was correspondingly replaced by the was with zno nps or was added zno nps and cpam other working conditions were kept the same as those of phase i when the methane production and vs destruction rate in three reactors did not amend dramatically with time respectively i e within 5 inequality of value the second relative stable phase is deemed to be achieved three specimens were withdrawn from individual digester when the experiment was finished day 122 and the microbial communities in the sample were examined by the illumina hiseq 16s rdna genes method majorbio shanghai china according to our previous report fan et al 2019 the primers 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 targeting the v4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16s rdna were chosen 2 5 effects of adding cpam on released zn2 as well as ros production from zno nps on was anaerobic digestion mu et al found that zn2 was the only dominant chemical extraneous substance from zno nps alluding that zn2 played an essential role in the toxicity of zno nps to was anaerobic digestion mu and chen 2011 here the different amounts of cpam 0 2 0 4 0 8 0 mg g tss were dosed in the reactors with 250 ml was and 15 mg zno nps g tss to determine the concentration of released zn2 from zno nps these reactors were maintained in the same setup after flushed with nitrogen for 3 min to remove o2 35 1 c at a completely different leaching stage each sludge mixture was removed and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 25 min and then the liquid supernatant was gathered and filtrated by 0 22 mm mixed cellulose ester membrane jiang et al 2009 li et al 2011 after acidified with 2 ultra high purity hno3 the released zn2 was measured through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7900icp ms usa the ros production was also considered to gain an insight into the mechanisms of alleviated zno nps toxicity joshi et al 2009 therefore the intracellular ros level was determined during the bmp tests at different cpam section 2 2 and the lactate dehydrogenase ldh was measured to guarantee the potential impacts of adding cpam on the generation of ros from zno nps gu et al 2014 the values related to ros production at different zno nps applications were described as parameters relative to the blank with pristine concentrated was 2 6 analytical methods the composition of produced biogas was examined by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd using nitrogen as the carrier gas agilent 7890b vfas were measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector fid agilent 7890b and represented as a sum of determined components i e acetic propionic and butyric acids the operating conditions of gc tcd and gc fid are detailed in supplementary material the determination of zn2 tss vss and tcod was achieved according to standard methods american public health association et al 2017 protein and carbohydrate were analyzed by the bca bicinchoninic acid method and phenol sulfuric acid method respectively raunkjær et al 1994 smith et al 1985 the sample treatment for analysis of soluble protein soluble polysaccharide scod and vfas was conducted according to our previous study fan et al 2019 the lactate dehydrogenase assay kit njjcbio nanjing china was used to detect the concentration of ldh the detailed steps of scanning electron microscope sem of sludge and intracellular ros are presented in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of cpam on bmp of was added zno nps bmp tests at different cpam levels were accomplished to explore the influence of cpam on methane production from was anaerobic digestion added zno nps based on eq s1 table s1 the accumulative methane production throughout anaerobic digestion is presented in fig 1 it was shown that the methane production in the blank reactor 238 07 ml g vs without zno nps and cpam rose with digestion time 1 35 d and then no dramatic increase was detected after day 35 p 0 05 however the maximum methane yield decreased to 170 63 ml g vs and the lag phase time increased from 35 to 50 in the control reactor with only zno nps which corresponded to previous reports mu and chen 2011 zhao et al 2018 similar trends of methane cumulation were discovered in reactors with cpam application but cpam ameliorated the inhibition of zno nps on methane production for example with the addition of 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg cpam g the methane production was 193 23 216 64 and 200 25 ml g vs respectively the presence of 4 0 mg cpam g significantly p 0 01 increased methane production by 19 3 compared with the control which showed the highest recovery efficiency of bmp for was with zno nps addition nevertheless the maximum cpam 8 0 mg cpam g addition made a low efficiency on recovery for methane production to some degree this could be accounted for the increased transfer resistance of available substances the excessive cpam addition facilitated the formation of flocculated sludge particles such particles in turn hindered the disintegration efficiency of was eventually weakening methane production of anaerobic digestion chu et al 2005 in summary all results manifested that cpam exerted a positive influence on methane yield of was anaerobic digestion added zno nps it should be emphasized that although cpam and zno nps had detrimental impacts on anaerobic digestion of sludge respectively the alleviated effects of cpam on the toxicity of zno nps were well established fig s4 the contribution of cpam to methane production may be neglected because only 6 7 of the decomposed cpam was converted to the final product methane wang et al 2018 this pattern proved that increased methane yield benefited from decreased toxicity of zno nps rather than the enhanced performance of pristine sludge anaerobic digestion 3 2 effects of cpam on each step of was anaerobic digestion added zno nps the inhibition of zno nps on was anaerobic digestion is manifested in the following four stages sludge solubilization hydrolysis acidification and methanation wei et al 2019 the selection of proper model substrates can evaluate the impact of exogenous pollutants on each step of sludge anaerobic digestion wu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 however the application of model substrates in synthetic wastewater rather than sludge inevitably transforms the connection between zno nps and cpam thereby the fluctuations of soluble organic substances from anaerobic reactors fed with sludge rather than synthetic wastewater were applied to estimate the effects of cpam on each step of was anaerobic digestion added zno nps anaerobic digestion of was with different contents of cpam was performed in the condition of prohibiting methanogens the test operated for 3 days during which the methane in each case was not monitored because of the addition of sbes sludge disintegration converting organic molecule substances of sludge to soluble matters is the initial step the release of soluble cod scod is used to express the ratio of sludge disintegration in this study and the result is summarized in fig 2 the released scod decreased from 6865 165 mg l of the blank digester without zno nps and cpam to 5501 151 mg l in control with zno nps implicating the negative effect of zno nps on the solubilization process it is noticed that zno nps with a particle size of 140 nm were no significant effect on sludge solubilization process mu and chen 2011 this inconsistency could be partly due to the difference of particles diameter for zno nps 308 6 nm of particles diameter in our tests in the reactors with 15 mg zno nps g tss and different levels of cpam the release of scod was all promoted specifically the scod concentration was 6263 135 mg l p 0 001 and 6626 110 mg l p 0 001 for the addition of 2 0 mg cpam g and 4 0 mg cpam g respectively but only 6500 168 mg l with the supplement of 8 0 mg cpam g higher cpam level did not further improve the discharge of scod which might be the inhibitory effect of higher cpam level during anaerobic digestion wang et al 2018 in a word the addition of cpam can strengthen the sludge solubilization in our study levels especially in 4 0 mg cpam g tss as the primary components of sludge solubilization soluble protein and carbohydrate were decomposed in the hydrolysis process from fig 2 it can be seen that the levels of soluble carbohydrate and protein for the control group with 15 mg zno nps g tss were comparable to those in the blank without zno nps and extra cpam respectively which is in accordance with previous literature mu and chen 2011 zhang et al 2017 in addition the content of soluble carbohydrate and protein in different levels of cpam had no obvious p 0 05 variation compared with the control which was also proved by the consequences of the analyzes for enzyme activities especially the protease and α glucosidase fig s3 this finding demonstrated that cpam at the studied level 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg g tss did not affect hydrolysis of sludge added 15 mg zno nps g tss vfas the production of microbial acidification mainly included acetate propionate butyrate and valerate from fig 2 the total vfas concentrations were 4826 8 3821 6 4205 9 4329 3 and 4101 0 mg cod l in the blank 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg cpam g tss respectively the zno nps of 15 mg g tss in the control could restrain vfas production to 79 2 0 1 compared with blank which was in agreement with the previous research zhang et al 2017 while cpam at 4 0 mg g tss significantly promoted the vfas yield to 89 7 p 0 01 consistent with the vfas advancement the activity of bk and oaatc also increased from 94 6 and 96 8 to 98 2 and 98 9 respectively fig s3 it is clear that the recovery of vfas was negatively affected by 8 0 mg cpam g with only a percent of 85 0 liu et al also reported that vfas accumulation gradually decreased with the addition of cpam from 0 to 24 mg g tss during anaerobic digestion of was which could elaborate why a higher dosage of cpam 8 0 mg g tss in tests was less effective than 4 0 mg cpam g tss liu et al 2019 from our knowledge methanogenesis is based on vfas and the more production of vfas the more generation of methane overall although the addition of cpam had no effect on hydrolysis of was with the presence of zno nps it facilitated solubilization and acidification it can be concluded that although cpam addition increased transfer resistance of sludge it limited the direct contact and interaction between zno nps and anaerobes increased organic substrates caused by increased extracellular hydrolase were beneficial to the sequent biochemical process meanwhile the decreased toxicity of zno nps for acidogens and methanogens also had a positive influence on methane production this pattern may imply one reason of the strengthened methane yield from was added zno nps anaerobic digestion with the appropriate application of cpam i e 4 0 mg g tss 3 3 effects of continuous addition of cpam on the performance of was anaerobic digestion the growing release of zno nps owing to their universal application would possibly cause a greater enrichment in sludge based on the bmp tests it was observed that cpam can enhance the methane production on anaerobic digestion of was added zno nps suggesting the application of cpam may alleviate the toxicity of zno nps and consequently strengthen the performance of anaerobic digestion system the application of cpam to regulate the toxicity of zno nps in was anaerobic digestion can be regarded as a successive procedure during the practical engineering thereby it is indispensable to understand the long term effects of cpam on anaerobic digestion of was with the addition of zno nps the performance of anaerobic digestion system was evaluated by the vs destruction efficiency and daily methane yield and the results are presented in fig 3 at the end of phase i day 25 35 the average vs destruction rate was basically stabilized at 29 8 and average daily methane yield was approximately 149 6 ml d in each digester representing that the was in all digester has adapted and reached a similar steady status during phase ii day 35 122 the long term exposure to zno nps triggered fluctuant and deteriorative performances of the control digester which was in agreement with the literature zhang et al 2020 with the gradual acclimation of anaerobic microbes in the reactor added zno nps the fluctuations performance of the reactor got smaller and entered into the relatively steady state again after day 90 during the last 12 days in phase ii day 110 122 the average vs destruction rate and daily methane yield of the control digester fell from 29 8 to 20 3 p 0 01 and from 149 6 ml d to 93 5 ml d p 0 01 respectively fig 3 compared with the blank without zno nps and extra cpam in contrast the application of cpam alleviated the inhibition of zno nps to the anaerobic digestion of sludge during days 110 122 the average vs destruction rate in the experimental reactor restored to 26 4 making a contract to the vs destruction rate value the average daily methane yield in the experimental reactor restored to 124 2 ml d to sum up the long term exposure to zno nps worsened the performance of was anaerobic digestion system which was represented by a decline in vs destruction rate and methane yield meanwhile the application of 4 0 mg cpam g tss obviously mitigated the adverse impacts of zno nps on anaerobic digestion system 3 4 microbial community assessment with the supplement of cpam to further comprehend the mechanisms of the cpam enhancing methane yield from anaerobic digestion of was with zno nps the microbial community composition in the long term anaerobic digesters was detected in the samples from the blank control and experimental digester the illumina hiseq sequencing number was 47 897 46 205 and 49 242 respectively meanwhile venn diagram analysis presented that a total of 1357 operational taxonomic units otus was shared by three reactors and the number of otus in blank control and experimental reactor was 1835 1863 and 1980 respectively it s worth noting that the supplement of zno nps constrained the development of community richness diversity and phylogenetic diversity as indicated by α diversity analysis at the out classification level whereas cpam promoted that table s2 this pattern demonstrated that the prolonged presence of zno nps decreased the total microbial populations but the additional cpam mitigated this restriction the raised richness and diversity of the total microbial community may be due to the fact that the formed sludge aggregations further facilitated the expansion of specific microorganisms with the addition of cpam the dominant phyla of the microbial community among three reactors were euryarchaeota cloacimonetes proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroides which accounted for 71 2 of the total microbial community the relative abundance of phyla euryarchaeota a well known methanogen fell from 24 5 in the blank digester to 15 3 in the control digester which was consistent with the suppressive influence of zno nps on methanogenesis process during was anaerobic digestion compared with the control reactor the supplement of 4 0 mg cpam g tss alleviated the decrement of methane production and the relative abundance of phyla euryarchaeota recovered to 23 3 in the experimental digester in addition the continuous exposure to zno nps hardly influenced the abundances of other predominant bacterial phyla e g actinobacteria and proteobacteria fig 4 a these completely versatile anaerobes were representative of organotrophs including hydrolytic strains capable of decomposing lipids polymeric carbohydrates and proteins wei et al 2019 their invariability may indicate that exposure to zno nps has no effect on hydrolysis process section 3 2 correspondingly a similar phenomenon was also observed in the digester with the application of 4 0 mg cpam g tss the heat map fig 4b demonstrates the microbial populations of anaerobes involved in acetogenesis and methanogenesis processes at the genus level in all anaerobic digesters the methanobacterium sp and methanosaeta sp relevant to methanogenesis were the principal genera compared to the blank system their abundances reduced from 14 3 and 8 9 to 11 2 and 5 6 in the control digester respectively while restored to 13 9 and 8 2 in the experimental digester respectively moreover the abundances of some anaerobes related to acidification in the experimental system were also remarkably elevated for instance christensenellaceae r 7 group sp and longilinea sp were two dominant acidogens and their populations increased by 12 8 and 7 1 in comparison with the control digester it can be concluded that the long term replenishment of 4 0 mg cpam g tss ameliorated the adverse impacts of zno nps on dominant methanogens and acidogens which is the reason why the cpam facilitated anaerobic system performance the enhancement of acidogens and methanogens might be also helpful to comprehend how cpam strengthened methane accumulation 3 5 effects of adding cpam on sludge surface and leached zn2 as well as intracellular ros production sem detection was used to examine the accumulation of nps in was kiser et al 2009 and the results are recorded in fig s5 during anaerobic digestion the sludge was continuously exposed to zno nps resulting in a large number of zno nps adsorbed on the sludge surface similar results were observed by other investigators when exploring the absorption of nanoparticles in sludge kiser et al 2010 limbach et al 2008 mu et al 2011a 2011b from fig s5c the zno nps tend to aggregate with the supplement of 4 0 mg cpam g tss the released zn2 from zno nps a significant contributor to the negative effects of zno nps liu et al 2011 was detected in different anaerobic digestion time 7 days background concentration of zn2 from pristine sludge was also measured before the test and a lower zn2 concentration was obtained 0 09 mg l the concentration of released zn2 in was with different levels of cpam is shown in fig 5 a in all cases the released zn2 of all levels cpam dosed was comparable with those of only zno nps dosed hinting the presence of cpam hardly affected zn2 release the initial decrease day of 1 2 of zn2 concentration can be attributed to the zn2 release from zno nps into digestion solution where it can interact with an extracellular polymeric matter zhao et al 2018 in addition intracellular ros production and ldh release have been widely used to assess the impacts of nanoparticles on cell growth and viability gu et al 2014 ma et al 2013 it can be seen from fig 5b that ldh level and ros generation were higher remarkably in the control with zno nps than blank reactor without zno nps and cpam which increased to 117 6 and 129 6 respectively the application of cpam mitigated the oxidative damage of zno nps on anaerobic microbes in comparison with the control the ros production was decreased to 119 6 108 6 and 114 3 of the blank meanwhile the relative content of ldh was 107 1 103 5 and 135 1 with the presence of 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg cpam g tts respectively this observation is consistent with the finding of yin et al and leung et al leung et al 2012 yin et al 2010 the surface chemistry coatings helped to reduce ros production and cytotoxicity of zno nps in general our results demonstrated that cpam could not prevent the zn2 discharge from zno nps but the moderate application of cpam effectively reduced ros induction which is the reason why cpam can mitigate the deterioration of anaerobic digestion system by zno nps positive holes formed at the surface of zno nps due to the presence of oxygen remained in sludge are trapped by water molecules dodd and jha 2011 which causes the generation of hydroxyl radicals bound to the surface of zno nps yin et al 2010 zno nps also play an essential role in production of hydrogen peroxide under anaerobic state yang et al 2013 these ros generated can trigger peroxidation of membrane and organelle which finally leads to metabolic disorder or ultimate death of microbial cells the death of cells makes release of ldh possible li et al 2008 the intensity of oxidative damage depends on the contact opportunities between zno nps and oxygen and the efficiency of ros entering into microbial cells the addition of cpam may hinder the link between zno nps and oxygen since cpam traps zno nps and meanwhile chemical bonds might form on the surface of zno nps dodd and jha 2011 in addition the presence of cpam may confine the contact between zno nps and anaerobes owing to the formation of aggregated sludge flocs however the excessive cpam 8 0 mg g tss causes the death of microbial cells and further leak of ldh fig 5b although the enmeshment effect of cpam on zno nps remains effective 3 6 implications currently the removal of nps from wastewater is still in its infancy kiser et al 2010 wwtps have been a final sinks of zno nps li et al 2019 because there was not any suggested limit on zno nps in water piplai et al 2018 even though the was exhibits a very significant enrichment for zno nps cervantes avilés and cuevas rodríguez 2017 khan et al 2018 the treatment e g concentration dewatering anaerobic digestion pyrolysis drying of following biosolids is also a serious issue based on our observations it can be confirmed that the mitigation of the adverse effects of zno nps on was anaerobic digestion was accomplished with the moderate application of cpam the net gain of cpam application was calculated and recorded in supplementary material it is clear that the benefit of restored methane is higher than the cost of cpam no matter what content is chosen 2 0 mg g tss or 4 0 mg g tss as this finding was based on our laboratory conditions further verification should be put into effect in practical operation only the effectiveness of dosing cpam to alleviate the toxicity of single zno nps i e 30 10 nm uncoated was estimated nowadays hence further study could be implemented to understand the availability of adding cpam to weaken the toxicity of compound zno nps in coming days as zno nps exixt in was with different species and forms ma et al 2014 additionally although the cpam is low cost and easily available in the actual treatment process it is worth noting that excessive cpam has less efficiency in the recovery of methane production this underscores that a reduced amount of cpam may optimize the anaerobic digestion performance after sludge dewatering since large quantities cpam is supplemented to flocs during the mechanical dewatering chu et al 2002 typically various pretrements are used to enhance sludge anaerobic digestion microwave pretreatment a pretreatment technology should be recommended to carry out before anaerobic digestion when was contained zno nps at substantial level wang et al 2019 due to the amount of energy to be provided for decomposition of organic matters by frequent friction between zno nps and organic substances under the microwave moreover unintentional land use or soil application is always a disposal method of digested sludge in the usa zhou and zhang 2020 in this scenario there is a possibility of spatial coexistence of zno nps and cpam however the effects of cpam on the bioavailability of cumulate zno nps still unexplored and further works should be conducted in the future 4 conclusion the anaerobic digestion of sludge was restrained by zno nps this study manifested that the possibility of adding cpam to alleviate the toxicity of zno nps for was anaerobic digestion and the main conclusions are 1 with the presence of 4 mg cpam g tss in was the methane production significantly increased from 71 4 to 90 7 compared with the control with zno nps 2 compared with the control reactor the addition of cpam had no obvious influence on hydrolysis but significantly facilitated solubilization and acidification process for was anaerobic digestion which contributed to methane production enhanced 3 analyzes of the long term operated reactors demonstrated that cpam application obviously diminished the toxicity of zno nps to was anaerobic digestion which was testified by recovery of average vs destruction rate and daily methane yield 4 from the long term operation of semi continuous reactors it was found that the total microbial communities and the relative abundances of key acidogens and methanogens increased 5 increased methane yield was mainly ascribed to the declined ros induction by zno nps when cpam was applied to was anerobic digestion process declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing
