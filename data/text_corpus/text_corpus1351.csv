6755,the middle and down streams of han river are complex river systems influenced by hydrologic variations population distributions and the engineering projects the middle route of china s south to north water transfer msnw project planned to transfer 95 billion m3 annually from han river to north china the operation of the msnw project may alter the flow rate and further influence the water quality of han river this study used min max autocorrelation factor analysis mafa and dynamic factor analysis dfa to analyze spatio temporal variations of the water quality variables in three typical tributary mainstream intersection zones in han river from june 2014 to april 2017 mafa results showed that chlorophyll a chl a chemical oxygen demand cod suspend solid ss and phosphate po4 3 represented as trophic dynamics are main concerned water quality variables in densely populated zones zones 1 and 3 and total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 cod and po4 3 regarded as nutrient formations dynamics represent the underlying water quality variations in agricultural cultivation zone zone 2 dfa results indicated that domestic and municipal effluent pollutants influence the organic concentrations and nutrient formations in the mainstream in zones 1 and 2 the non point source nitrogen and phosphorus discharged from the tributaries tangbai and hanbei rivers elevate the nutrient concentrations and increase chl a concentration i e promote the algal growth in densely populated zones in addition controlling the flow rates in low and middle flow rate conditions can avoid degrading water quality the flow rate should be elevated to more than 700 cm cubic meters per second in the middle stream and to more than 800 cm in the downstream of han river for preventing water quality deterioration from high loadings of organic pollutants and nutrients the integrated mafa and dfa method establishes an efficient analysis distinguishing spatio temporal variation of water quality variables and provides useful site specific management to control water quality in various flow conditions keywords min max autocorrelation factor analysis dynamic factor analysis han river flow rate water transfer water quality variation 1 introduction the ongoing urbanization and the augment of fertilizer application substantially increase the loadings of nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matters into river streams thereby deteriorating water quality in big cities more than 1 million population the discharge of industrial and domestic wastewaters containing high organic content may adversely affect the aquatic life drinking water quality and agricultural activities kambole 2003 pekey et al 2004 runoff volume carries agricultural pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus from farming lands into rivers in high precipitation period wei et al 2009 municipal pollution and agricultural non point source pollution are two main sources providing organic pollutants and nutrients which may also influence the algal growth li et al 2008 therefore a better understanding of water quality variations and their driving factors is critical for river water quality management flow rate is considered as the key factor influencing the self purification and interactions among water quality variables in river ecosystems junk 1989 bunn and arthington 2002 the flow rate can be altered by precipitation and runoff volumes from various land uses for agriculturalization or urbanization in a watershed vega et al 1998 ahearn et al 2005 lin et al 2013 in addition the operation of engineering projects may reduce the flow rate and consequently cause eutrophic states in a river system huang et al 2009 poff et al 2007 wang et al 2011a b however the relation between water quality variables and flow rate with strong spatio temporal variation remains unexplored because of the complex hydrochemical mechanism in river system dynamic process based models such as swat arnold et al 2014 hspf xie and lian 2013 and the annagnps model que et al 2015 have been applied to explain the relationship between variation of environmental variables e g temperature and precipitation and water quality dynamics however they need complex user supplied parameters usually 50 parameters to perform physicochemical simulations jackson blake et al 2017 in addition multivariate statistical analysis methods such as cluster analysis and factor analysis momen et al 1996 lau and lane 2002 arhonditsis et al 2004 mostly ignore the spatio temporal variation of data instead of using the average data of time or space yang et al 2012 therefore a statistic method considering the spatio temporal variation may be an available option for investigating the relationships among water quality variables min max autocorrelation factor analysis mafa is used to extract trends from multiple time series that represent the common behavior of the original time series zuur et al 2007 dynamic factor analysis dfa a dimension reduction technique is used to identify underlying common trends among multivariate time series which also considers the effects of explanatory variables on response variables kuo and lin 2010 zuur and pierce 2004 mafa has been widely applied for spatio temporal analysis including the evolution of fish stocks in time woillez et al 2009 the water quality variation of river estuary kuo et al 2013 and the temporal variability of environmental variables in german bight shojaei et al 2016 dfa has been used for studies of aquatic ecological monitoring kuo and lin 2010 ligas et al 2010 groundwater levels and quality muñoz carpena et al 2005 kuo and chang 2010 atmospheric environment and pollution kuo et al 2011 kuo et al 2013 and the interactions between environmental variables and algal abundance kuo and wu 2016 the combination of mafa and dfa can effectively deal with the regional water quality characteristics and the relationship among the water quality variables kuo et al 2013 the han river basin where the population distributed unevenly has more than 10 tributaries li et al 2008 several big cities located along the mainstream of han river with more than 1 5 million people discharged in the range of 0 8 2 0 107 kg wastewaters into han river in 2010 zeng et al 2014 two seriously polluted feed in tributaries tangbai river and hanbei river discharged 2 1 3 8 106 kg yr phosphorus and 0 9 1 8 106 kg yr ammonia nitrogen nh4 n into han river and finally deteriorated the water quality in the main stream huang et al 2009 li et al 2011 the middle route of china s south to north water transfer msnw project planned to transfer 95 billion m3 annually from han river to north china and the yangtze han water diversion yhwd project diverted water from the middle stream jingzhou city of yangtze river to the downstream of han river from zhongxiang city to wuhan city to mitigate the effect of the msnw project on han river since 2014 fig 1 the operation of the msnw and yhwd projects may alter the flow rate of han river yang et al 2012 these hydrological variations may influence water self purification and further influence the water quality of han river xie et al 2004 zhao et al 2010 this study statistically analyzes spatio temporal variations of the water quality variables in three typical zones zones in the intersection between the mainstream and two tributaries or an engineering project in han river from june 2014 to april 2017 the objectives of the study are to i determine the main concerned water quality variables in the main stream of han river of three zones ii examine the environmental factors influencing the temporal variations of main concerned water quality variables in three zones iii identify the relationships between flow rate and environmental variables and provide useful management to control water quality of han river with knowledge of these crucial factors the results can be valuable for developing management strategies to improve water quality 2 study area and method 2 1 study area han river located in the central china is the longest tributary of the yangtze river the middle stream of han river is defined from danjiangkou reservoir to jingzhou city 270 km and the downstream is defined from jingzhou to wuhan city 406 km where it joins the yangtze river fig 1 the total drainage area in the middle and down streams is 64 000 km2 with an elevation from 500 m at danjiangkou reservoir to 110 m at wuhan city li et al 2008 annual precipitations range from 700 to 1300 mm from the middle stream to the downstream of han river jiang et al 2004 80 of precipitation concentrates in the period from may to october fig 2 jianghan plain with total drainage area of 46 000 km2 where 70 of land use is agricultural land is located in the downstream with an elevation from 110 to 200 m zhang and dong 2009 agricultural activities such as irrigation and fertilization in jianghan plain may affect the hydrological conditions and water quality zhou 2009 li et al 2012 undergoing rapid social and economic development has gradually deteriorated water environment of the middle and down streams of han river watershed in the past 20 years chou et al 2007 zhong et al 2012 the average annual concentrations of organic substances nitrogen and phosphorus were increased by more than 20 from 1998 to 2009 luo et al 2011 tangbai river and hanbei river are two heavily polluted tributaries which both flow through agricultural areas and discharge nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus into the mainstream of han river liang et al 2012 xiangyang city and zhongxiang city fig 1 located in the tributary mainstream intersection zones with more than 1 million population sun and wu 2012 discharged 2 1 107 kg yr and 1 4 107 kg yr domestic and municipal organic pollutants into the mainstream respectively in 2007 wang et al 2011a b the high mass of organic pollutants and nutrients have resulted in several large scale algal blooms in the middle and down streams of han river in recent 15 years chou et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 after the operation of the msnw project the flow rate discharged from danjiangkou reservoir to han river was decreased and the flow rate in tangbai river contributed more than 30 of that in the mainstream of han river liang et al 2016 in addition the yhwd project diverts water from the middle stream jingzhou city of yangtze river to han river fig 1 to mitigate the effect of the msnw project on han river the yhwd project han river intersection zone is located in jianghan plain where the agricultural land is the main land use producing non point pollutants agricultural nitrogen and phosphorous into the mainstream zeng et al 2014 two tributaries tangbai and hanbei rivers and two engineering projects msnw and yhwd projects play important roles for regulating water quality variation in the mainstream of han river therefore the zones of tributary tangbai han river intersection yhwd project han river intersection and tributary hanbei han river intersection are defined as zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 table 1 and fig 1 respectively for further discussion in the study the 9 water sampling sites were distributed from the middle and down streams of han river watershed among the 9 sampling sites sites main1 main2 and main3 are located at the upstream from the intersections of the tributary and the mainstream of han river in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively which represent the water quality in the mainstream before the tributaries or yhwd project flows into han river on behalf of the water quality in tributaries or yhwd project sites tri1 tri2 and tri3 are located at tributary tangbai river zone 1 yhwd project zone 2 and tributary hanbei river zone 3 respectively sites at the downstream from the intersections of the tributary and the mainstream of han river in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively int1 int2 and int3 respectively represent the water quality in the mainstream influenced by both upstream han river and tributaries or engineering project 2 2 water quality analysis water samples were collected monthly from june 2014 and april 2017 9 sites with 306 water samples in total from 50 cm below a water table by using a kemmerer water sampler wildco yulee fl usa in each sample a total of 13 environmental variables including air temperature temp flow rate q ph chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec suspend solid ss chlorophyll a chl a nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and orthophosphate po4 3 were analyzed temp do ec ss and ph were measured immediately in situ all water samples were filtered 0 45 μm millipore nitrocellulose filter in the field and the samples were acidified with ultra pure hcl to ph 2 and stored at 4 c in ice box for analyzing physiochemical variables tp was measured by a colorimetric method after digestion digested by the ammonium molybdenum blue method and analyzed by the ascorbic acid method nh4 n was measured by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry 752 ltraviolet visible spectrophotometer biochrom usa no3 n and tn were determined by the alkaline potassium per sulfate oxidation uv spectrophotometric method cod was measured by microwave digestion method sarkar et al 1986 and chl a was analyzed by the acetone frozen extraction spectrophotometric method vollenweider 1968 2 3 methods 2 3 1 min max autocorrelation factor analysis mafa is used to extract trends from multiple time series to estimate index functions from time series that represent the common behavior of the original time series and for smoothing switzer and green 1984 shapiro and switzer 1989 solow 1994 mafa estimates the axes that have decreasing auto correlation at time lag 1 zuur et al 2007 mafa divides the set of initial variables into a series of axes the number of important maf axes was determined by obtaining p values for maf axes through a randomization process p 0 80 solow 1994 the axis represents the underlying pattern or the trend in the data the first mafa axis maf1 is the main trend underlying the entire time series that exhibits a maximal auto correlation between nearby observations and the other axes represent less crucial trends thus the first mafa axis has the highest auto correlation with time lag 1 and the second axis has the second highest auto correlation with time lag 1 a similar trend occurs for all axes the canonical correlation coefficients r between the variables time series and the mafa axes were obtained to determine the relationship between each variable and particular mafa axes the terms high moderate weak and minor as applied to canonical correlation coefficients refer to absolute values of 0 75 0 75 0 5 0 5 0 25 and 0 25 respectively in this study mafa axes represent the water quality variation and the canonical correlation coefficients were used to determine the significance of the water quality variables which reflect the regional characteristics further details on mafa are presented in zuur et al 2007 and erzini 2005 2 3 2 dynamic factor analysis as a parameter optimization and dimension reduction technique dfa is useful for determining interactions between time series response and possible explanatory variables zuur et al 2003a in a dfa model n time series are expressed as a function of a linear combination of m common trends one or more explanatory variables a constant level parameter and noise zuur et al 2003b zuur and pierce 2004 the mathematical formulation of the dfa model is as follows 1 r n t m 1 m γ m n α m t μ n k 1 k β k n z k t ε n t 2 α m t α t 1 η m t where r n t is the value of the nth response variable rv at time t α m t is the mth common trend at time t and γ m n is the factor loading or weighting coefficient that indicates the importance of each α m t trend within the dynamic factor model β k n represents the regression coefficient for the kth explanatory variable ev z k t the t test is used to assess whether the ev is significantly related to the rv γ m n and β k n allow for the identification of the most relevant common trends and evs for each rv μ n refers to the nth constant level parameter intercept term which increases or decreases the linear combination of common trends the terms ε n t and η m t are independent gaussian distributed noise with zero mean and an unknown diagonal or symmetric non diagonal covariance matrix the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1974 were used to select the optimal performing dfa model nse 1 indicated that the pairs of predicted and observed data were consistent once a set of common trends was identified different combinations of common trends and explanatory variables are incorporated in the analysis until the minimum aic best dfa model is identified without exceeding the variance inflation factor vif criterion vif 5 0 zuur et al 2007 dfa was performed by using the brodgar version 2 6 6 statistical package highland statistics ltd newburgh uk which uses the statistical software language r version 2 9 1 r core development team 2009 further details regarding dfa are presented in zuur et al 2003a 2007 2 3 3 analytical procedure in this study mafa was first used to determine the main concerned water quality variables in three zones and investigate the regional watershed characteristics at the downstream sites from the intersections of the tributary and the mainstream of han river i e sites int1 int2 and int3 shown as black points in fig 1 these main concerned water quality variables were selected as rvs in dfa models after that dfa was used to investigate the interactions among the water quality variables and what mechanisms of tributaries and engineering projects influence main concerned water quality variables in han river the water quality variables at the upstream sites from the interaction between the mainstream and tributaries i e sites main1 main2 and main3 shown as red points in fig 1 and those in tributaries or in the yhwd project i e sites tri1 tri2 and tri3 shown as red points in fig 1 were selected as evs the vif was computed to detect the multicolinearity of each set of explanatory variables zuur et al 2007 the vif of explanatory variables greater than five was removed in these analyses ritter et al 2009 2 3 4 model validation the quality of the optimal dfa model was evaluated by the fiteval code which uses a more general formulation of the coefficient of efficiency ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 a combination of graphical results absolute value error statistics e g root mean square error rmse and normalized goodness of fit statistics e g nse was used as quantitative statistics of the predictive accuracy of a model hypothesis testing of the nse exceeding threshold values is accomplished based on approximated probability distributions in the case of time series data in conjunction with graphs and indicator values a probability of the following model performance ratings was provided as follows unsatisfactory nse 0 65 acceptable 0 65 nse 0 80 good 0 80 nse 0 90 and very good nse 0 90 more details of application of fiteval code can be found in wu et al 2014 harmel et al 2014 hornero et al 2016 and mfumu kihumba et al 2016 3 results and discussions 3 1 descriptive statistical analysis table 2 summarizes the mean and coefficients of variation cv of 13 physicochemical parameters for the 9 sampling sites high variations with cvs of 50 of environmental variables were observed for the temp q chl a tp po4 3 and cod variables at most sites indicating strong fluctuations during the study period from june 2014 to april 2017 water diversion of the msnw and yhwd projects result that cvs of q at sites main1 and tri2 were greater than 100 fig 3 illustrates the temporal variations of water quality variables in three zones all water quality variables were relatively stable floating around mean value of each variable the concentrations of chl a among the 3 zones were varied seasonally which show high values in early spring february april and low values in summer july august corresponding well with low and high flow rate conditions respectively in addition tn tp and po4 3 concentrations showed similar trends fig 3 q chl a tn and tp concentrations decreased from june to october and increased from january and april in all three zones when the abovementioned concentrations increased chl a tp and tn concentrations were in the range of 4 72 13 48 μg l 0 102 0 188 mg l and 2 12 5 88 mg l respectively the highest concentrations and error estimates of water quality variables were distributed at sites tri1 tri2 and tri3 among the three sites in each zone fig 4 therefore concentrations of most water quality variables in the downstream section were higher than those in the upstream section of han river in addition mean values of most water quality variables in zone 1 except site tri1 were lower than those in zones 2 and 3 fig 4 indicating that water quality in middle stream was better than that in the downstream han river 3 2 min max autocorrelation factor analysis mafa in both zone 1 and zone 3 only one maf axis was selected for representing the common behavior of the water quality time series in these zones fig 5 and table 3 with an autocorrelation of 0 96 p 0 01 for zone 1 and with that of 0 89 p 0 01 for zone 3 chl a cod and po4 3 showed high positive canonical correlation coefficients with the maf axis r 0 70 0 84 and 0 88 for chl a cod and po4 3 respectively while ss moderately and negatively correlated with the maf axis r 0 71 chl a which has been widely used as an indicative indicator for estimating phytoplankton biomass felip and catalan 2000 had the highest correlation coefficient with the maf axis in both zone 1 r 0 61 and zone 3 r 0 58 cod represents the content of organic matter in water bodies chen et al 2010 liu et al 2018 the reach of han river in xiangyang city site main1 was heavily contaminated by domestic and municipal organic pollutants represented as cod li et al 2008 tangbai river and hanbei river discharged more than 3 0 106 kg yr of phosphorus to the mainstream since 2009 li et al 2011 the increases of cod and po4 3 concentrations can promote the growth of phytoplankton which can increase chl a concentration and influence the trophic states zheng et al 2010 large scale algal blooms have occurred five times in the downstream han river during 2002 2012 endangering the safety of drinking and agricultural water luo et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 therefore the maf axis can be interpreted as the trophic dynamics for water quality in these zones two maf axes were selected to represent the time series variation of water quality in zone 2 fig 5 and table 3 with an autocorrelation of 0 89 p 0 01 for the first maf axis maf1 and that of 0 81 p 0 01 for the second maf axis maf2 respectively tn showed moderate and positive correlation with the maf1 r 0 63 cod was positively correlated with the maf2 r 0 61 while no3 and po4 3 were negatively related to the maf2 r 0 59 for no3 and r 0 81 for po4 3 tn no3 and po4 3 represent the variations of inorganic nutrient variables in water body hakanson 1980 elser et al 2000 because agricultural cultivation land accounts for 70 of jianghan plain nutrients such as agricultural fertilizers organic pollutants represented as cod have been widely used and may finally contaminate water quality the organic agricultural fertilizers can be oxidizing decomposed to inorganic nutrients dolman et al 2012 paerl et al 2011 and alter nutrient formations in water bodies therefore the maf axis can be interpreted as the nutrient formation dynamics for water quality in zone 2 3 3 dynamic factor analysis 3 3 1 the optimal dfa model because high and positive correlation r 0 775 0 857 p 0 05 was found between q and precipitation in all sampling sites and precipitation had a high vif value vif 12 78 precipitation was removed from candidate evs for determining the optimal dfa model and should be considered together with q once q was a significant ev in the optimal model the optimal dfa model with the lowest aic contained one common trend various evs and a symmetric non diagonal covariance matrix in zone 1 air temperature cod at site main1 and chl a tp tn and q at site tri1 were optimally fitted to the time series of rvs in zone 2 q cod tp and po4 3 at site main2 and do and tn concentrations at site tri2 were significant evs in the optimal dfa model q chl a and tn at site main3 and cod tp and q at site tri3 were optimally fitted to the time series of the main concerned water quality in zone 3 table 4 shows the factor loadings γ of the optimal dfa models in these three zones the magnitude of factor loadings indicated the relation of the common trend to the time series of the response variable within the optimal dfa models for all three zones the magnitudes of factor loadings for the common trend were less than 0 31 indicating that the common trend is not important for influencing the variability of response variables therefore the explanatory variables are more effective for the interpretation of what mechanisms of tributaries and engineering projects influence water quality response variables in the mainstream han river 3 3 2 interactions among the water quality variables table 4 illustrates the regression parameters βk n which quantify the relative contribution of each ev on each response time series with a bold number indicating significant parameters by t test t value 2 a total of nine water quality variables including q temp cod do tp po4 3 tn no3 and chl a were included in the optimal dfa models influencing mechanism among the water quality variables and the source identification of pollutants are discussed in this section and the relationship between flow rate and water quality variables is discussed in section 3 4 in all three zones po4 3 inorganic phosphorus concentration occupied more than 50 of tp 54 61 and 59 in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively and the sum of nh4 and no3 inorganic nitrogen concentration occupied more than 69 of tn 77 75 and 69 in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively during the study period except july and august in both 2015 and 2016 years therefore most of tn and tp acts as inorganic compounds the organic compounds in tn and tp can be oxidizing decomposed to inorganic nutrients e g po4 3 and no3 by chemoautotrophic bacteria e g nitrosomonas nitrobacter etc in organic pollution states high cod and low do values mccauley et al 1989 thus a negative correlation between cod and no3 r 0 51 and that between cod and po4 3 r 0 46 were found and consequently cod and nutrients showed the opposite relationship in all three zones table 4 precipitation can increase runoff volume carrying with sediment into a river which increases ss in a river qian et al 2018 high and positive relationships between q and ss were found r 0 65 p 0 05 for zone 1 and r 0 69 p 0 05 for zone 3 in addition increasing flow rate can dilute the concentrations of chl a cod and nutrients tn and tp yu et al 2016 therefore q and ss concentrations were negatively related to chl a nutrients and cod concentrations table 4 chl a concentrations at sites int1 and int3 were positively related to both tp and cod in the tributaries in zones 1 and 3 table 4 some organic matters and high phosphorus concentration can promote the activity of enzymes in the hydrophytes leboulanger et al 2001 which can be assimilated by aquatic plants algae and bacteria zheng et al 2010 in addition chl a concentrations at sites int1 and int3 were positively related with those at sites tri1 tangbai river and main3 upstream of zone 3 in the downstream han river respectively in zone 3 concentrations of nutrients and organic pollutants were much higher than those in zones 1 and 2 fig 4 especially during early spring from february to april during this period the flow rate in zone 3 is the lowest fig 3 affected by the high backwater discharged from yangtze river into han river dong et al 2010 algae prefer to grow abundantly in an approximate lentic environment with high organic pollutants and nutrients yang et al 2016 isabwe et al 2018 therefore large scale algal blooms have occurred five times in early spring in the downstream han river zone 3 rather than in zones 1 and 2 during 2002 2012 chou et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 more relationships between various flow rate conditions and water quality variables are further discussed in section 3 4 organic pollutants and nutrients in the downstream of han river are influenced by multiple sources i e tributaries and upstreams of mainstream han river which exists high spatio temporal variation in zones 1 and 3 cod concentrations at sites main1 and main3 significantly influenced cod concentrations at sites int1 and int3 respectively and tp concentrations at sites tri1 and tri3 positively related to po4 3 concentrations at sites int1 and int3 respectively table 4 in zone 1 auto manufacturing is the pillar industry in xiangyang city which is also an important organic pollution source of han river sun et al 2017 based on our observations xiangyang city located near site main1 discharged 2 7 107 kg yr domestic and municipal organic pollutants in 2016 into the mainstream of han river and therefore influence the organic concentrations and nutrient cycles in zone 3 high cod concentration in the mainstream may be derived from the accumulation of pollutant emissions in zones 1 and 2 the tributaries tangbai river and hanbei river flowing through agricultural regions discharged large amounts of nutrients into han river liang et al 2012 li et al 2011 and liang et al 2012 reported that the tangbai river and hanbei river discharged 6 2 106 kg yr and 3 8 106 kg yr phosphorus to the mainstream han river which occupied 32 and 15 of total amount of phosphorus discharged from han river to yangtze river at wuhan city in 2009 respectively in zone 2 cod concentration and tp concentration at site main2 significantly influence the organic pollutants and nutrient concentrations at site int2 zhongxiang city located at the upstream from the intersection of yhwd project and the mainstream discharged 1 7 107 kg yr domestic and municipal organic pollutants in 2016 into han river sun et al 2017 the organic pollutants and phosphorus at site main2 may be also derived from the municipal pollutants discharged from xiangyang city and nutrients discharged from tangbai river in zone 1 3 3 3 goodness of fit evaluation of the response variables in each zone time series data of the rvs in the optimal dfa model were combined together and then were evaluated by the fiteval model the calibration process was repeated in an attempt to improve the fit fig 6 illustrates the main results of the evaluation data of rvs in zones 1 and 3 show very good fits average nse 0 958 ranged from 0 915 to 0 991 in zone 1 and average nse 0 995 ranged from 0 991 to 0 998 in zone 3 fig 6 and data of rvs in zone 2 show a good to very good fit average nse 0 958 ranged from 0 862 to 0 989 fig 6 among all the rvs tn variable in zone 2 with the lowest nse table 4 fitted as good while the other variables were fitted as very good which resulted in the worse model fit in zone 2 comparing with those in zones 1 and 3 the spatio temporal variability of fertilizer application and the precipitation in the watershed lead to the uncertainly of nitrogen fitting in zone 2 in addition the nitrogen goodness of fit was difficult to evaluate because of the complex nitrogen cycles among various nitrogen formations e g ammonium nitrogen nitrate nitrogen organic nitrogen harmel and smith 2007 amiri 2016 3 4 relationship between flow rate and environmental factors in the optimal dfa model the flow rates in sites tri1 main2 and main3 are negatively correlated with most rvs main concerned water quality variables indicating that increase in flow rate can effectively improve the water quality the flow rate can be regarded as an indicative variable representing the regional characteristics the levels of flow rate were trisected as low middle and high flow rates conditions of each zone to further discuss the relationships between flow rates and the environmental variables fig 7 low flow rate condition defined q less than 500 700 and 800 cms in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively mostly occurred from november to december and from january to march in this condition concentrations of chl a cod and nutrient variables were high and varied strongly table 5 in this period with low precipitation and low runoff volume figs 2 and 3 the self purification ability of water quality variable in low flow rate conditions can obviously alter water quality you et al 2009 the low flow rate accompanied with low self purification may deteriorate water quality and increase concentrations of pollutants therefore the higher flow rate in zone 3 possesses higher self purification resulting in the lower cvs of chl a and cod compared with the lower flow rate in zones 1 and 2 fig 7 middle flow rate conditions defined q between 500 and 1400 700 1600 and 800 1800 cms in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively mostly occurred from april to may and from september to october figs 2 and 3 during this period with high precipitation fig 3 increasing runoff volume carries high amounts of organic fertilizers pesticides and nutrients into han river and consequently triggers the algal growth therefore the flow rate positively relates to the nutrients cod and chl a concentrations in middle flow rates fig 7 the flow rate at site tri2 is negatively correlated with cod r 0 65 and chl a r 0 59 at site main2 indicating that increase in the flow rate at the yhwd project may be an effective way for improving the water quality in the mainstream high flow rate conditions more than 1400 1600 and 1800 cms in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively have high self purification ability and high self rehabilitation capacity vagnetti et al 2003 vandermarken et al 2018 therefore the correlations between flow rate and the environmental factors including nutrients organic matters and suspend solids are not obviously the cvs of these environmental factors are also the lowest among all flow rate conditions table 5 because the concentrations of the water quality variables are low and stable the variations of these variables are not drastic in high flow rate conditions flow rate as a key variable can be regulated by the mnsw and yhwd projects for controlling water quality in the middle and down streams of han river during low flow rate conditions the flow rate discharged from the mnsw project should be reduced and that from the yhwd project to han river should be increased the flow rate should be controlled to more than 700 cm in the middle stream and to more than 800 cm in the downstream of han river for preventing water quality deterioration from high loadings of organic pollutants and nutrients in middle flow rate conditions decreasing the flow rate transferred from the mnsw project and increasing the flow rate discharged from the yhwd project may be effective ways for improving the water quality in the mainstream the relationship between water quality and flow rate can provide useful site specific management to control water quality in various flow rate conditions 4 conclusion the msnw and yhwd projects have been operated since 2014 which may influence the hydrologic conditions and deteriorate water quality in han river mafa was used to statistically analyze regional characteristics of water quality in three tributary mainstream intersection zones of han river in densely populated zones zones 1 and 3 chl a cod ss and po4 3 represented as trophic dynamics represent the main variations of water quality variables in the agricultural cultivation zone zone 2 tn no3 cod and po4 3 regarded as nutrient formations are main concerned water quality variables from dfa results we identified pollutants source and infer possible mechanisms of tributaries and engineering projects influence main concerned water quality in the mainstream han river domestic and municipal organic pollutants are mainly discharged from xiangyang city and zhongxiang city into han river which influence the concentrations of organic pollutants and nutrients in zones 1 and 2 the non point source nitrogen and phosphorus containing high fraction of organic compounds emitted from the tributaries tangbai and hanbei rivers elevate the nutrient concentrations and increase chl a concentration i e promote the algal growth in densely populated zones in low flow rate conditions the flow rate should be elevated to more than 700 cm in the middle stream of han river and to more than 800 cm in the downstream of han river controlling the flow rate in the msnw and yhwd projects can avoid degrading water quality in low flow rate conditions the study can establish an efficient analysis distinguishing spatio temporal variation of water quality variables and provide useful site specific management to control water quality in various flow

6755,the middle and down streams of han river are complex river systems influenced by hydrologic variations population distributions and the engineering projects the middle route of china s south to north water transfer msnw project planned to transfer 95 billion m3 annually from han river to north china the operation of the msnw project may alter the flow rate and further influence the water quality of han river this study used min max autocorrelation factor analysis mafa and dynamic factor analysis dfa to analyze spatio temporal variations of the water quality variables in three typical tributary mainstream intersection zones in han river from june 2014 to april 2017 mafa results showed that chlorophyll a chl a chemical oxygen demand cod suspend solid ss and phosphate po4 3 represented as trophic dynamics are main concerned water quality variables in densely populated zones zones 1 and 3 and total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 cod and po4 3 regarded as nutrient formations dynamics represent the underlying water quality variations in agricultural cultivation zone zone 2 dfa results indicated that domestic and municipal effluent pollutants influence the organic concentrations and nutrient formations in the mainstream in zones 1 and 2 the non point source nitrogen and phosphorus discharged from the tributaries tangbai and hanbei rivers elevate the nutrient concentrations and increase chl a concentration i e promote the algal growth in densely populated zones in addition controlling the flow rates in low and middle flow rate conditions can avoid degrading water quality the flow rate should be elevated to more than 700 cm cubic meters per second in the middle stream and to more than 800 cm in the downstream of han river for preventing water quality deterioration from high loadings of organic pollutants and nutrients the integrated mafa and dfa method establishes an efficient analysis distinguishing spatio temporal variation of water quality variables and provides useful site specific management to control water quality in various flow conditions keywords min max autocorrelation factor analysis dynamic factor analysis han river flow rate water transfer water quality variation 1 introduction the ongoing urbanization and the augment of fertilizer application substantially increase the loadings of nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matters into river streams thereby deteriorating water quality in big cities more than 1 million population the discharge of industrial and domestic wastewaters containing high organic content may adversely affect the aquatic life drinking water quality and agricultural activities kambole 2003 pekey et al 2004 runoff volume carries agricultural pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus from farming lands into rivers in high precipitation period wei et al 2009 municipal pollution and agricultural non point source pollution are two main sources providing organic pollutants and nutrients which may also influence the algal growth li et al 2008 therefore a better understanding of water quality variations and their driving factors is critical for river water quality management flow rate is considered as the key factor influencing the self purification and interactions among water quality variables in river ecosystems junk 1989 bunn and arthington 2002 the flow rate can be altered by precipitation and runoff volumes from various land uses for agriculturalization or urbanization in a watershed vega et al 1998 ahearn et al 2005 lin et al 2013 in addition the operation of engineering projects may reduce the flow rate and consequently cause eutrophic states in a river system huang et al 2009 poff et al 2007 wang et al 2011a b however the relation between water quality variables and flow rate with strong spatio temporal variation remains unexplored because of the complex hydrochemical mechanism in river system dynamic process based models such as swat arnold et al 2014 hspf xie and lian 2013 and the annagnps model que et al 2015 have been applied to explain the relationship between variation of environmental variables e g temperature and precipitation and water quality dynamics however they need complex user supplied parameters usually 50 parameters to perform physicochemical simulations jackson blake et al 2017 in addition multivariate statistical analysis methods such as cluster analysis and factor analysis momen et al 1996 lau and lane 2002 arhonditsis et al 2004 mostly ignore the spatio temporal variation of data instead of using the average data of time or space yang et al 2012 therefore a statistic method considering the spatio temporal variation may be an available option for investigating the relationships among water quality variables min max autocorrelation factor analysis mafa is used to extract trends from multiple time series that represent the common behavior of the original time series zuur et al 2007 dynamic factor analysis dfa a dimension reduction technique is used to identify underlying common trends among multivariate time series which also considers the effects of explanatory variables on response variables kuo and lin 2010 zuur and pierce 2004 mafa has been widely applied for spatio temporal analysis including the evolution of fish stocks in time woillez et al 2009 the water

interactions between environmental variables and algal abundance kuo and wu 2016 the combination of mafa and dfa can effectively deal with the regional water quality characteristics and the relationship among the water quality variables kuo et al 2013 the han river basin where the population distributed unevenly has more than 10 tributaries li et al 2008 several big cities located along the mainstream of han river with more than 1 5 million people discharged in the range of 0 8 2 0 107 kg wastewaters into han river in 2010 zeng et al 2014 two seriously polluted feed in tributaries tangbai river and hanbei river discharged 2 1 3 8 106 kg yr phosphorus and 0 9 1 8 106 kg yr ammonia nitrogen nh4 n into han river and finally deteriorated the water quality in the main stream huang et al 2009 li et al 2011 the middle route of china s south to north water transfer msnw project planned to transfer 95 billion m3 annually from han river to north china and the yangtze han water diversion yhwd project diverted water from the middle stream jingzhou city of yangtze river to the downstream of han river from zhongxiang city to wuhan city to mitigate the effect of the msnw project on han river since 2014 fig 1 the operation of the msnw and yhwd projects may alter the flow rate of han river yang et al 2012 these hydrological variations may influence water self purification and further influence the water quality of han river xie et al 2004 zhao et al 2010 this study statistically analyzes spatio temporal variations of the water quality variables in three typical zones zones in the intersection between the mainstream and two tributaries or an engineering project in han river from june 2014 to april 2017 the objectives of the study are to i determine the main concerned water quality variables in the main stream of han river of three zones ii examine the environmental factors influencing the temporal variations of main concerned water quality variables in three zones iii identify the relationships between flow rate and environmental variables and provide useful management to control water quality of han river with knowledge of these crucial factors the results can be valuable for developing management strategies to improve water quality 2 study area and method 2 1 study area han river located in the central china is the longest tributary of the yangtze river the middle stream of han river is defined from danjiangkou reservoir to jingzhou city 270 km and the downstream is defined from jingzhou to wuhan city 406 km where it joins the yangtze river fig 1 the total drainage area in the middle and down streams is 64 000 km2 with an elevation from 500 m at danjiangkou reservoir to 110 m at wuhan city li et al 2008 annual precipitations range from 700 to 1300 mm from the middle stream to the downstream of han river jiang et al 2004 80 of precipitation concentrates in the period from may to october fig 2 jianghan plain with total drainage area of 46 000 km2 where 70 of land use is agricultural land is located in the downstream with an elevation from 110 to 200 m zhang and dong 2009 agricultural activities such as irrigation and fertilization in jianghan plain may affect the hydrological conditions and water quality zhou 2009 li et al 2012 undergoing rapid social and economic development has gradually deteriorated water environment of the middle and down streams of han river watershed in the past 20 years chou et al 2007 zhong et al 2012 the average annual concentrations of organic substances nitrogen and phosphorus were increased by more than 20 from 1998 to 2009 luo et al 2011 tangbai river and hanbei river are two heavily polluted tributaries which both flow through agricultural areas and discharge nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus into the mainstream of han river liang et al 2012 xiangyang city and zhongxiang city fig 1 located in the tributary mainstream intersection zones with more than 1 million population sun and wu 2012 discharged 2 1 107 kg yr and 1 4 107 kg yr domestic and municipal organic pollutants into the mainstream respectively in 2007 wang et al 2011a b the high mass of organic pollutants and nutrients have resulted in several large scale algal blooms in the middle and down streams of han river in recent 15 years chou et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 after the operation of the msnw project the flow rate discharged from danjiangkou reservoir to han river was decreased and the flow rate in tangbai river contributed more than 30 of that in the mainstream of han river liang et al 2016 in addition the yhwd project diverts water from the middle stream jingzhou city of yangtze river to han river fig 1 to mitigate the effect of the msnw project on han river the yhwd project han river intersection zone is located in jianghan plain where the agricultural land is the main land use producing non point pollutants agricultural nitrogen and phosphorous into the mainstream zeng et al 2014 two tributaries tangbai and hanbei rivers and two engineering projects msnw and yhwd projects play important roles for regulating water quality variation in the mainstream of han river therefore the zones of tributary tangbai han river intersection yhwd project han river intersection and tributary hanbei han river intersection are defined as zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 table 1 and fig 1 respectively for further discussion in the study the 9 water sampling sites were distributed from the middle and down streams of han river watershed among the 9 sampling sites sites main1 main2 and main3 are located at the upstream from the intersections of the tributary and the mainstream of han river in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively which represent the water quality in the mainstream before the tributaries or yhwd project flows into han river on behalf of the water quality in tributaries or yhwd project sites tri1 tri2 and tri3 are located at tributary tangbai river zone 1 yhwd project zone 2 and tributary hanbei river zone 3 respectively sites at the downstream from the intersections of the tributary and the mainstream of han river in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively int1 int2 and int3 respectively represent the water quality in the mainstream influenced by both upstream han river and tributaries or engineering project 2 2 water quality analysis water samples were collected monthly from june 2014 and april 2017 9 sites with 306 water samples in total from 50 cm below a water table by using a kemmerer water sampler wildco yulee fl usa in each sample a total of 13 environmental variables including air temperature temp flow rate q ph chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec suspend solid ss chlorophyll a chl a nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and orthophosphate po4 3 were analyzed temp do ec ss and ph were measured immediately in situ all water samples were filtered 0 45 μm millipore nitrocellulose filter in the field and the samples were acidified with ultra pure hcl to ph 2 and stored at 4 c in ice box for analyzing physiochemical variables tp was measured by a colorimetric method after digestion digested by the ammonium molybdenum blue method and analyzed by the ascorbic acid method nh4 n was measured by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry 752 ltraviolet visible spectrophotometer biochrom usa no3 n and tn were determined by the alkaline potassium per sulfate oxidation uv spectrophotometric method cod was measured by microwave digestion method sarkar et al 1986 and chl a was analyzed by the acetone frozen extraction spectrophotometric method vollenweider 1968 2 3 methods 2 3 1 min max autocorrelation factor analysis mafa is used to extract trends from multiple time series to estimate index functions from time series that represent the common behavior of the original time series and for smoothing switzer and green 1984 shapiro and switzer 1989 solow 1994 mafa estimates the axes that have decreasing auto correlation at time lag 1 zuur et al 2007 mafa divides the set of initial variables into a series of axes the number of important maf axes was determined by obtaining p values for maf axes through a randomization process p 0 80 solow 1994 the axis represents the underlying pattern or the trend in the data the first mafa axis maf1 is the main trend underlying the entire time series that exhibits a maximal auto correlation between nearby observations and the other axes represent less crucial trends thus the first mafa axis has the highest auto correlation with time lag 1 and the second axis has the second highest auto correlation with time lag 1 a similar trend occurs for all axes the canonical correlation coefficients r between the variables time series and the mafa axes were obtained to determine the relationship between each variable and particular mafa axes the terms high moderate weak and minor as applied to canonical correlation coefficients refer to absolute values of 0 75 0 75 0 5 0 5 0 25 and 0 25 respectively in this study mafa axes represent the water quality variation and the canonical correlation coefficients were used to determine the significance of the water quality variables which reflect the regional characteristics further details on mafa are presented in zuur et al 2007 and erzini 2005 2 3 2 dynamic factor analysis as a parameter optimization and dimension reduction technique dfa is useful for determining interactions between time series response and possible explanatory variables zuur et al 2003a in a dfa model n time series are expressed as a function of a linear combination of m common trends one or more explanatory variables a constant level parameter and noise zuur et al 2003b zuur and pierce 2004 the mathematical formulation of the dfa model is as follows 1 r n t m 1 m γ m n α m t μ n k 1 k β k n z k t ε n t 2 α m t α t 1 η m t where r n t is the value of the nth response variable rv at time t α m t is the mth common trend at time t and γ m n is the factor loading or weighting coefficient that indicates the importance of each α m t trend within the dynamic factor model β k n represents the regression coefficient for the kth explanatory variable ev z k t the t test is used to assess whether the ev is significantly related to the rv γ m n and β k n allow for the identification of the most relevant common trends and evs for each rv μ n refers to the nth constant level parameter intercept term which increases or decreases the linear combination of common trends the terms ε n t and η m t are independent gaussian distributed noise with zero mean and an unknown diagonal or symmetric non diagonal covariance matrix the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1974 were used to select the optimal performing dfa model nse 1 indicated that the pairs of predicted and observed data were consistent once a set of common trends was identified different combinations of common trends and explanatory variables are incorporated in the analysis until the minimum aic best dfa model is identified without exceeding the variance inflation factor vif criterion vif 5 0 zuur et al 2007 dfa was performed by using the brodgar version 2 6 6 statistical package highland statistics ltd newburgh uk which uses the statistical software language r version 2 9 1 r core development team 2009 further details regarding dfa are presented in zuur et al 2003a 2007 2 3 3 analytical procedure in this study mafa was first used to determine the main concerned water quality variables in three zones and investigate the regional watershed characteristics at the downstream sites from the intersections of the tributary and the mainstream of han river i e sites int1 int2 and int3 shown as black points in fig 1 these main concerned water quality variables were selected as rvs in dfa models after that dfa was used to investigate the interactions among the water quality variables and what mechanisms of tributaries and engineering projects influence main concerned water quality variables in han river the water quality variables at the upstream sites from the interaction between the mainstream and tributaries i e sites main1 main2 and main3 shown as red points in fig 1 and those in tributaries or in the yhwd project i e sites tri1 tri2 and tri3 shown as red points in fig 1 were selected as evs the vif was computed to detect the multicolinearity of each set of explanatory variables zuur et al 2007 the vif of explanatory variables greater than five was removed in these analyses ritter et al 2009 2 3 4 model validation the quality of the optimal dfa model was evaluated by the fiteval code which uses a more general formulation of the coefficient of efficiency ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 a combination of graphical results absolute value error statistics e g root mean square error rmse and normalized goodness of fit statistics e g nse was used as quantitative statistics of the predictive accuracy of a model hypothesis testing of the nse exceeding threshold values is accomplished based on approximated probability distributions in the case of time series data in conjunction with graphs and indicator values a probability of the following model performance ratings was provided as follows unsatisfactory nse 0 65 acceptable 0 65 nse 0 80 good 0 80 nse 0 90 and very good nse 0 90 more details of application of fiteval code can be found in wu et al 2014 harmel et al 2014 hornero et al 2016 and mfumu kihumba et al 2016 3 results and discussions 3 1 descriptive statistical analysis table 2 summarizes the mean and coefficients of variation cv of 13 physicochemical parameters for the 9 sampling sites high variations with cvs of 50 of environmental variables were observed for the temp q chl a tp po4 3 and cod variables at most sites indicating strong fluctuations during the study period from june 2014 to april 2017 water diversion of the msnw and yhwd projects result that cvs of q at sites main1 and tri2 were greater than 100 fig 3 illustrates the temporal variations of water quality variables in three zones all water quality variables were relatively stable floating around mean value of each variable the concentrations of chl a among the 3 zones were varied seasonally which show high values in early spring february april and low values in summer july august corresponding well with low and high flow rate conditions respectively in addition tn tp and po4 3 concentrations showed similar trends fig 3 q chl a tn and tp concentrations decreased from june to october and increased from january and april in all three zones when the abovementioned concentrations increased chl a tp and tn concentrations were in the range of 4 72 13 48 μg l 0 102 0 188 mg l and 2 12 5 88 mg l respectively the highest concentrations and error estimates of water quality variables were distributed at sites tri1 tri2 and tri3 among the three sites in each zone fig 4 therefore concentrations of most water quality variables in the downstream section were higher than those in the upstream section of han river in addition mean values of most water quality variables in zone 1 except site tri1 were lower than those in zones 2 and 3 fig 4 indicating that water quality in middle stream was better than that in the downstream han river 3 2 min max autocorrelation factor analysis mafa in both zone 1 and zone 3 only one maf axis was selected for representing the common behavior of the water quality time series in these zones fig 5 and table 3 with an autocorrelation of 0 96 p 0 01 for zone 1 and with that of 0 89 p 0 01 for zone 3 chl a cod and po4 3 showed high positive canonical correlation coefficients with the maf axis r 0 70 0 84 and 0 88 for chl a cod and po4 3 respectively while ss moderately and negatively correlated with the maf axis r 0 71 chl a which has been widely used as an indicative indicator for estimating phytoplankton biomass felip and catalan 2000 had the highest correlation coefficient with the maf axis in both zone 1 r 0 61 and zone 3 r 0 58 cod represents the content of organic matter in water bodies chen et al 2010 liu et al 2018 the reach of han river in xiangyang city site main1 was heavily contaminated by domestic and municipal organic pollutants represented as cod li et al 2008 tangbai river and hanbei river discharged more than 3 0 106 kg yr of phosphorus to the mainstream since 2009 li et al 2011 the increases of cod and po4 3 concentrations can promote the growth of phytoplankton which can increase chl a concentration and influence the trophic states zheng et al 2010 large scale algal blooms have occurred five times in the downstream han river during 2002 2012 endangering the safety of drinking and agricultural water luo et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 therefore the maf axis can be interpreted as the trophic dynamics for water quality in these zones two maf axes were selected to represent the time series variation of water quality in zone 2 fig 5 and table 3 with an autocorrelation of 0 89 p 0 01 for the first maf axis maf1 and that of 0 81 p 0 01 for the second maf axis maf2 respectively tn showed moderate and positive correlation with the maf1 r 0 63 cod was positively correlated with the maf2 r 0 61 while no3 and po4 3 were negatively related to the maf2 r 0 59 for no3 and r 0 81 for po4 3 tn no3 and po4 3 represent the variations of inorganic nutrient variables in water body hakanson 1980 elser et al 2000 because agricultural cultivation land accounts for 70 of jianghan plain nutrients such as agricultural fertilizers organic pollutants represented as cod have been widely used and may finally contaminate water quality the organic agricultural fertilizers can be oxidizing decomposed to inorganic nutrients dolman et al 2012 paerl et al 2011 and alter nutrient formations in water bodies therefore the maf axis can be interpreted as the nutrient formation dynamics for water quality in zone 2 3 3 dynamic factor analysis 3 3 1 the optimal dfa model because high and positive correlation r 0 775 0 857 p 0 05 was found between q and precipitation in all sampling sites and precipitation had a high vif value vif 12 78 precipitation was removed from candidate evs for determining the optimal dfa model and should be considered together with q once q was a significant ev in the optimal model the optimal dfa model with the lowest aic contained one common trend various evs and a symmetric non diagonal covariance matrix in zone 1 air temperature cod at site main1 and chl a tp tn and q at site tri1 were optimally fitted to the time series of rvs in zone 2 q cod tp and po4 3 at site main2 and do and tn concentrations at site tri2 were significant evs in the optimal dfa model q chl a and tn at site main3 and cod tp and q at site tri3 were optimally fitted to the time series of the main concerned water quality in zone 3 table 4 shows the factor loadings γ of the optimal dfa models in these three zones the magnitude of factor loadings indicated the relation of the common trend to the time series of the response variable within the optimal dfa models for all three zones the magnitudes of factor loadings for the common trend were less than 0 31 indicating that the common trend is not important for influencing the variability of response variables therefore the explanatory variables are more effective for the interpretation of what mechanisms of tributaries and engineering projects influence water quality response variables in the mainstream han river 3 3 2 interactions among the water quality variables table 4 illustrates the regression parameters βk n which quantify the relative contribution of each ev on each response time series with a bold number indicating significant parameters by t test t value 2 a total of nine water quality variables including q temp cod do tp po4 3 tn no3 and chl a were included in the optimal dfa models influencing mechanism among the water quality variables and the source identification of pollutants are discussed in this section and the relationship between flow rate and water quality variables is discussed in section 3 4 in all three zones po4 3 inorganic phosphorus concentration occupied more than 50 of tp 54 61 and 59 in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively and the sum of nh4 and no3 inorganic nitrogen concentration occupied more than 69 of tn 77 75 and 69 in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively during the study period except july and august in both 2015 and 2016 years therefore most of tn and tp acts as inorganic compounds the organic compounds in tn and tp can be oxidizing decomposed to inorganic nutrients e g po4 3 and no3 by chemoautotrophic bacteria e g nitrosomonas nitrobacter etc in organic pollution states high cod and low do values mccauley et al 1989 thus a negative correlation between cod and no3 r 0 51 and that between cod and po4 3 r 0 46 were found and consequently cod and nutrients showed the opposite relationship in all three zones table 4 precipitation can increase runoff volume carrying with sediment into a river which increases ss in a river qian et al 2018 high and positive relationships between q and ss were found r 0 65 p 0 05 for zone 1 and r 0 69 p 0 05 for zone 3 in addition increasing flow rate can dilute the concentrations of chl a cod and nutrients tn and tp yu et al 2016 therefore q and ss concentrations were negatively related to chl a nutrients and cod concentrations table 4 chl a concentrations at sites int1 and int3 were positively related to both tp and cod in the tributaries in zones 1 and 3 table 4 some organic matters and high phosphorus concentration can promote the activity of enzymes in the hydrophytes leboulanger et al 2001 which can be assimilated by aquatic plants algae and bacteria zheng et al 2010 in addition chl a concentrations at sites int1 and int3 were positively related with those at sites tri1 tangbai river and main3 upstream of zone 3 in the downstream han river respectively in zone 3 concentrations of nutrients and organic pollutants were much higher than those in zones 1 and 2 fig 4 especially during early spring from february to april during this period the flow rate in zone 3 is the lowest fig 3 affected by the high backwater discharged from yangtze river into han river dong et al 2010 algae prefer to grow abundantly in an approximate lentic environment with high organic pollutants and nutrients yang et al 2016 isabwe et al 2018 therefore large scale algal blooms have occurred five times in early spring in the downstream han river zone 3 rather than in zones 1 and 2 during 2002 2012 chou et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 more relationships between various flow rate conditions and water quality variables are further discussed in section 3 4 organic pollutants and nutrients in the downstream of han river are influenced by multiple sources i e tributaries and upstreams of mainstream han river which exists high spatio temporal variation in zones 1 and 3 cod concentrations at sites main1 and main3 significantly influenced cod concentrations at sites int1 and int3 respectively and tp concentrations at sites tri1 and tri3 positively related to po4 3 concentrations at sites int1 and int3 respectively table 4 in zone 1 auto manufacturing is the pillar industry in xiangyang city which is also an important organic pollution source of han river sun et al 2017 based on our observations xiangyang city located near site main1 discharged 2 7 107 kg yr domestic and municipal organic pollutants in 2016 into the mainstream of han river and therefore influence the organic concentrations and nutrient cycles in zone 3 high cod concentration in the mainstream may be derived from the accumulation of pollutant emissions in zones 1 and 2 the tributaries tangbai river and hanbei river flowing through agricultural regions discharged large amounts of nutrients into han river liang et al 2012 li et al 2011 and liang et al 2012 reported that the tangbai river and hanbei river discharged 6 2 106 kg yr and 3 8 106 kg yr phosphorus to the mainstream han river which occupied 32 and 15 of total amount of phosphorus discharged from han river to yangtze river at wuhan city in 2009 respectively in zone 2 cod concentration and tp concentration at site main2 significantly influence the organic pollutants and nutrient concentrations at site int2 zhongxiang city located at the upstream from the intersection of yhwd project and the mainstream discharged 1 7 107 kg yr domestic and municipal organic pollutants in 2016 into han river sun et al 2017 the organic pollutants and phosphorus at site main2 may be also derived from the municipal pollutants discharged from xiangyang city and nutrients discharged from tangbai river in zone 1 3 3 3 goodness of fit evaluation of the response variables in each zone time series data of the rvs in the optimal dfa model were combined together and then were evaluated by the fiteval model the calibration process was repeated in an attempt to improve the fit fig 6 illustrates the main results of the evaluation data of rvs in zones 1 and 3 show very good fits average nse 0 958 ranged from 0 915 to 0 991 in zone 1 and average nse 0 995 ranged from 0 991 to 0 998 in zone 3 fig 6 and data of rvs in zone 2 show a good to very good fit average nse 0 958 ranged from 0 862 to 0 989 fig 6 among all the rvs tn variable in zone 2 with the lowest nse table 4 fitted as good while the other variables were fitted as very good which resulted in the worse model fit in zone 2 comparing with those in zones 1 and 3 the spatio temporal variability of fertilizer application and the precipitation in the watershed lead to the uncertainly of nitrogen fitting in zone 2 in addition the nitrogen goodness of fit was difficult to evaluate because of the complex nitrogen cycles among various nitrogen formations e g ammonium nitrogen nitrate nitrogen organic nitrogen harmel and smith 2007 amiri 2016 3 4 relationship between flow rate and environmental factors in the optimal dfa model the flow rates in sites tri1 main2 and main3 are negatively correlated with most rvs main concerned water quality variables indicating that increase in flow rate can effectively improve the water quality the flow rate can be regarded as an indicative variable representing the regional characteristics the levels of flow rate were trisected as low middle and high flow rates conditions of each zone to further discuss the relationships between flow rates and the environmental variables fig 7 low flow rate condition defined q less than 500 700 and 800 cms in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively mostly occurred from november to december and from january to march in this condition concentrations of chl a cod and nutrient variables were high and varied strongly table 5 in this period with low precipitation and low runoff volume figs 2 and 3 the self purification ability of water quality variable in low flow rate conditions can obviously alter water quality you et al 2009 the low flow rate accompanied with low self purification may deteriorate water quality and increase concentrations of pollutants therefore the higher flow rate in zone 3 possesses higher self purification resulting in the lower cvs of chl a and cod compared with the lower flow rate in zones 1 and 2 fig 7 middle flow rate conditions defined q between 500 and 1400 700 1600 and 800 1800 cms in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively mostly occurred from april to may and from september to october figs 2 and 3 during this period with high precipitation fig 3 increasing runoff volume carries high amounts of organic fertilizers pesticides and nutrients into han river and consequently triggers the algal growth therefore the flow rate positively relates to the nutrients cod and chl a concentrations in middle flow rates fig 7 the flow rate at site tri2 is negatively correlated with cod r 0 65 and chl a r 0 59 at site main2 indicating that increase in the flow rate at the yhwd project may be an effective way for improving the water quality in the mainstream high flow rate conditions more than 1400 1600 and 1800 cms in zones 1 2 and 3 respectively have high self purification ability and high self rehabilitation capacity vagnetti et al 2003 vandermarken et al 2018 therefore the correlations between flow rate and the environmental factors including nutrients organic matters and suspend solids are not obviously the cvs of these environmental factors are also the lowest among all flow rate conditions table 5 because the concentrations of the water quality variables are low and stable the variations of these variables are not drastic in high flow rate conditions flow rate as a key variable can be regulated by the mnsw and yhwd projects for controlling water quality in the middle and down streams of han river during low flow rate conditions the flow rate discharged from the mnsw project should be reduced and that from the yhwd project to han river should be increased the flow rate should be controlled to more than 700 cm in the middle stream and to more than 800 cm in the downstream of han river for preventing water quality deterioration from high loadings of organic pollutants and nutrients in middle flow rate conditions decreasing the flow rate transferred from the mnsw project and increasing the flow rate discharged from the yhwd project may be effective ways for improving the water quality in the mainstream the relationship between water quality and flow rate can provide useful site specific management to control water quality in various flow rate conditions 4 conclusion the msnw and yhwd projects have been operated since 2014 which may influence the hydrologic conditions and deteriorate water quality in han river mafa was used to statistically analyze regional characteristics of water quality in three tributary mainstream intersection zones of han river in densely populated zones zones 1 and 3 chl a cod ss and po4 3 represented as trophic dynamics represent the main variations of water quality variables in the agricultural cultivation zone zone 2 tn no3 cod and po4 3 regarded as nutrient formations are main concerned water quality variables from dfa results we identified pollutants source and infer possible mechanisms of tributaries and engineering projects influence main concerned water quality in the mainstream han river domestic and municipal organic pollutants are mainly discharged from xiangyang city and zhongxiang city into han river which influence the concentrations of organic pollutants and nutrients in zones 1 and 2 the non point source nitrogen and phosphorus containing high fraction of organic compounds emitted from the tributaries tangbai and hanbei rivers elevate the nutrient concentrations and increase chl a concentration i e promote the algal growth in densely populated zones in low flow rate conditions the flow rate should be elevated to more than 700 cm in the middle stream of han river and to more than 800 cm in the downstream of han river controlling the flow rate in the msnw and yhwd projects can avoid degrading water quality in low flow rate conditions the study can establish an efficient analysis distinguishing spatio temporal variation of water quality variables and provide useful site specific management to control water quality in various flow conditions with knowledge of relationships between the flow rate and the water quality variables we can effectively improve water quality of han river declaration of interests the authors declare that

6756,green roofs in contrast to conventional roofs retain significant stormwater and are considerably appealing for urban regions to help mitigate flooding events and addressing serious environmental impacts of excessive or uncontrolled runoff in designing a green roof a careful selection of substrate material depths vegetation or slopes or its optimal combination is imperative but this issue remains underexplored by practicing hydrologists scale based models of extensive green roofs were purposely designed and simulated rainfall experiments were conducted to comprehensively quantify runoff retention performance of extensive green roofs to precisely determine the contribution of structural factors to stormwater retention the results indicated that green roofs can effectively retain stormwater and delay the start of the runoff to aver with this finding influential contribution of four structural factors are ordered as follows substrate material substrate depth slope vegetation this finding denotes that substrate material and its depth are major contributors to a green roof s stormwater retention capability statistical tests conducted on runoff retention showed the substrate materials and vegetation types had statistically significant effects no statistically significant difference in runoff retention abilities among the three substrate depth treatments and the slope gradients considered given the same conditions the study ascertains that runoff retention of low intensity events is likely to be relatively higher while that of the heavy events is lower than its counterparts the antecedent moisture contents of the substrate have a significant negative influence on the runoff retention and the time to the runoff keywords green roof runoff retention scale model simulated rainfall structural factors substrate 1 introduction although rapid urbanization warrants a need to implement sustainable hydrologic structures that limit environmental degradation it has become apparent that green surfaces mainly in urban regions are being replaced by additional buildings and pavements which in fact is changing the original permeable conditions to the impervious surfaces berndtsson 2010 consequently there has been a considerable increase in the surface stormwater runoff which has resulted in more frequent flooding and water logging al rawas et al 2015 ellis et al 2012 to address this issue a number of alternative options are being proposed to restore the hydrology of urban areas including but not limited to the maintenance of green areas and the recovery or restoration of deforested areas wilkinson et al 2014 in reality conventional rooftops can constitute up to 40 50 of the impervious area in a densely built up urban center where no space is available for a new infrastructure to be put in place dunnett and kingsbury 2004 green roofs which are a primary focus of this study utilize the otherwise unused impervious surfaces to restore predevelopment hydrologic functions such as a better infiltration and retention effect razzaghmanesh and beecham 2014 given a natural shortage of land in urban areas green roofs can therefore be one of the most important options to address issues associated with surface runoffs berndtsson 2010 palla et al 2010 recently green roofs have received increased recognition in developed countries such as the usa japan australia and europe berndtsson et al 2008 mentens et al 2006 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 williams et al 2010 the purpose of adopting such technologies is to use a smart approach that addresses the pertinent issues associated with waterlogging urban flooding and uncontrolled runoffs that is likely to pose serious environmental impacts the increasing premise of a sustainable city promoted by a green roof also known as an integrated eco and a living roof is becoming an issue of interest to hydrologists typically a green roof consists of three major components a vegetation layer a lightweight substrate medium and a water storage drainage layer placed on top of a waterproof membrane carson et al 2013 yang et al 2015 according to the depth of the growing substrate layer a green roof is commonly classified into extensive or intensive categories generally a green roof with a substrate depth of less than 15 cm is classified into an extensive green roof and its vegetation consists of a shallow rooting and drought resistant plant rainwater that falls on the green roof can be captured in the substrate or the vegetation and is eventually evaporated from the surface of the soil and released back into the atmosphere by the process of transpiration dunnett and kingsbury 2008 the benefits of a green roof is off course to help retain stormwater gregoire and clausen 2011 schroll et al 2011 speak et al 2013 delay the peak discharge time carter and rasmussen 2006 spolek 2008 and to attenuate the peak discharge volume carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 stovin et al 2012 these functions clearly outline the major contribution of an urban green roof in the control and moderation of surface hydrology in urban cities where flood risk management is a crucial determinant of the overall safety of the city dwellers many researchers have investigated the rainfall runoff behavior of a green roof carter and rasmussen 2006 denardo et al 2005 moran et al 2003 primarily to investigate its implications on surface water flow pilot scale studies based on elevated test boxes or similar modules with a watershed area that can range between 0 37 m2 and 12 m2 have been instrumental in helping to identify and quantify relationships associated with runoff retention of green roofs carson et al 2013 research into the hydrological properties of a green roof has therefore reveal a range of average rainwater retention efficiencies that vary from one design to another for extensive green roofs i e with a substrate depth 15 cm the average rainwater retention efficiency is nominally estimated to be between 45 denardo et al 2005 mentens et al 2006 and 60 moran et al 2003 and the cumulative annual retentions is about 50 stovin et al 2012 and 60 vanwoert et al 2005 the water retention capacity of a green roof system is therefore dependent on several causal factors such as the rainfall specific characteristics antecedent moisture conditions substrate depth and its hydraulic characteristics storage drainage layer capacity vegetation cover characteristics and slope of the green roof bengtsson et al 2005 carter and rasmussen 2006 getter et al 2007 simmons et al 2008 speak et al 2013 teemusk and mander 2007 villarreal and bengtsson 2005 wong and jim 2014 it should be noted that real time i e field measurements of these factors can be rather a tedious if not an impossible task and a large variation in the above mentioned conditions and the respective factors in existing literature also make it difficult to compare the water retention from these independent green roof runoff studies considering the difficulties encountered in accurately performing real measurements and the inconsistency of information obtained from previous studies independent experiments that are able to explore the influence of a green roof design on the underlying urban hydrology and particularly the runoff retention in a well controlled manner is an issue of practical interest in addition to the quantification of runoff retention for different rainfall sizes there is a particular need to understand retention for significant events with large return periods these events generally overwhelm stormwater management systems and result in flooding to concur with the foresaid reviews the runoff retention capacity of green roof is a result of the combined action of various factors affecting the runoff retention itself which results in various and rather inconsistent conclusions many research studies focused on the influence of one or two different structural factors on a green roof s runoff retention however multiple structural factors which are particularly important from a practical viewpoint have not been considered to assess their integrated contributions to the runoff retention therefore to address these issues from a practical point of view the primary structural factors must include the substrate material substrate depth vegetation types and slope gradients as undertaken in the present study the novelty of this study stems in the fact that the prototype green roof models are built following an orthogonal experimental design with four structural factors at three different levels the purpose was to facilitate an accurate and extensive evaluation of the respective relationships of green roof structures and the retention performance of stormwater runoffs by means of well defined and well controlled scale model experimental approaches to satisfy this need different scale models of extensive green roofs were designed and simulated rainfall experiments were conducted to assess the runoff retention performance this study for the first time makes a major contribution to the design of a future green roof in respect to providing a detailed evaluation of the influence of structural factors that control the stormwater retention performances of the designated green roofs the outcomes have important implications for sustainable stormwater management of the future design of a green roof hydrological planning and strategies for urban buildings and improving future practices in relation to better stormwater management in urban cities 2 materials and method 2 1 scale models of green roofs ten scale models of extensive green roofs were constructed from a custom made 2 mm thick stain less steel platform with internal dimensions of 100 cm wide 100 cm long 10 30 cm height fig 1 a and b these green roofs were placed on a metal base at the experiment ground of the dingxi institute of soil and water conservation in gansu province china 35 34 45 88 n 104 38 5 67 e this region was located in a semiarid climatic zone and was dominated by the warm humid summers and cold dry winters the mean annual precipitation was 421 mm the standard green roof assembly consisted of a drainage layer filter fabric growing substrate and vegetation the last layer was an additional waterproof layer comprising a waterproof roll paved onto the bottom of the platform the drainage layer was a 25 mm thick drainage board with high impact polystyrene dimple sheet a non woven geotextile fabric was bonded to the upper surface of the drainage composite as the filter layer which prevented the small particles from being washed from the substrate layer into the drainage layer or out of the system the growing substrate and plants were placed on top of the non woven geotextile the outflow openings were constructed in the middle of the drainage layer of the green roofs and were connected by pipes with a diameter of 25 mm meanwhile a conventional roof which paved with the traditional cement surface with a thickness of 10 cm was constructed the roof s size was consisted with the above runoff plots of green roofs the difference was that a marked steel v flume was created at the outlet of each plot for facilitating the collection of surface runoff the green roofs were designed following an orthogonal experimental design cabezas and comín 2010 sadeghi et al 2012 yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015a with four primary factors i e substrate materials substrate depth vegetation types and slope gradients at three levels table 1 this method has generally been adopted to optimize the design parameters and significantly minimize the overall testing time and experimental costs sadeghi et al 2012 the substrate material composition was based on roof greening material available in china bls 2005 considering the growth environment of plants and bearing capacity of their roof three mixture types of light weight materials were used as the growing substrate the volume ratio of each mixture were as follow rural soil peat soil was 1 1 in substrate s1 rural soil peat soil pine needle perlite was 1 1 1 1 in substrate s2 rural soil peat soil perlite vermiculite was 2 5 5 2 0 5 in substrate s3 a small shovel was used to measure the mix proportions and blended the substrate soil the maximum substrate depth of an extensive green roof is 15 cm berndtsson et al 2010 the soil thickness of extensive vegetated roofs defined by kosareo and ries 2007 was 50 150 mm for conventional non living roofs the literature data were limited to roofs with a slope of 2 mentens et al 2006 according to dunnett and kingsbury 2004 a maximum slope of 17 is the recommended limit before requiring additional slope stabilization measures according to the construction criterion of extensive green roofs and the above references the substrate depth treatments were set to 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm and the platforms were set at three slopes levels 2 7 and 15 based on their metal bases in order to keep the similar compactness of these substrates soil the substrate padding process was watered several times until the soil infiltration had saturated and compacted over a period of time the vegetation layers were planted with three different vegetation types included radix ophiopogonis ophiopogon japonicas linn f ker gawl sedumspectabile hylotelephium erythrostictum miq h ohba and iris iris tectorum maxim it is important to note that these species were selected according to their high resistance abilities to drought stress conditions nardini et al 2003 and these plants have been widely incorporated in local landscapes and green roof designs jim and peng 2012 these plants were positioned in the substrate with at an averaged density of 184 plugs m2 124 plugs m2 65 plugs m2 plant spacing is about 5 cm weeds were removed regularly to prevent any sort of competition with the experimental plants a green roof with no vegetation was thus considered as a control experiment compare with the green roof which has 5 cm depth of substrate s1 and planted by radix ophiopogonis under 2 slope in this study the outer edge of runoff plot was designed 10 cm higher than the substrate surface and the plots were placed about 70 cm apart to prevent rainfall splashing and edge effects splash on the green roofs was considered to be negligible because of the soft absorptive nature of the plant cover and spongy substrate material shen 2007 2 2 experimental design in this study an artificial rainfall simulator was applied arnaez et al 2004 battany and grismer 2000 lee et al 2015 sutherland and ziegler 2006 consisting of a norton ladder type rainfall simulator that was set 3 5 m above the present scale models fig 1c the spraying systems employed veejet 80 100 nozzles with 41 kpa water pressure that were spaced 1 1 m apart with a computer that oscillated across the plot to generate a constant rainfall intensity specifically the median volume of rain drop size obtained by this simulator was 2 2 mm and the uniformity coefficient of rainfall reached more than 0 8 rainfall intensity controller was set to produce different rainfall intensity events that could provide hydrological conditions for the prescribed green roofs the precipitation input was carefully monitored by a standard tipping bucket rain gauge onset hobo 0 2 mm rainfall smart sensor s rgb positioned adjacent near and at the same height as that of the experimental platforms this ensured that difference in height did not introduce any variations in turbulence and wind exposures and the rain gauge was tested and calibrated prior to every experiment to generate accurate simulations from the scale based models in this paper the runoff discharge from the designated green roof was collected in a plastic container below the platform by means of a pipe at its downstream end for continuous monitoring of the weight a fixed base was placed on a pressure transducer that aimed to stabilize the plastic container the depth in the collection container was monitored regularly using the pressure transducer to provide a continuous record of the runoff amounts by means of an appropriate calibration relationship the weight of the discharge container was measured continuously in small time intervals per second by an industrial grade pressure transducer weighing load cell bengbu sensor system engineering company jlbu bengbu china with an accuracy of 50 ml i e approximately 0 05 mm based on the platform area this permitted a precise quantification of the green roof discharge rates the measurements were logged into a data logger campbell scientific cr300 usa the per second readings were subsequently averaged to produce one minute readings for further data processing the 5te sensors decagon devices 5te usa were inserted horizontally into the mid depth of the substrate to monitor the moisture condition of the substrate layer the polynomial empirical topp equation used to convert dielectric permittivity to an antecedent moisture content visconti et al 2014 to avoid the standing water on the probe surface the flat probe was oriented perpendicularly to the soil surface 2 3 data analysis on the basis of the experimentally based hydrological data collected in this study the other selected variables including the rainfall intensity time of the runoff runoff discharge peak flow runoff retention and peak flow reduction were all computed and later utilized for further analysis descriptive statistical analysis was undertaken to detect the general features of the simulated rainfall related runoff characteristics and runoff retention performance by using spss 17 0 the relationship describing the runoff retention from the green roof was computed as follows zhang et al 2015b 1 r r r v v r v 100 in eq 1 r r was the runoff retention rate r v referred to the rainfall volume actually received by green roof mm v was the runoff depth of green roof mm based on the experimental data from orthogonal designs the univariate analysis of variance anova was performed to statistically assess the influence of four structural factors on runoff discharge of the designated green roofs under two rainfall intensities and this was used to determine the significance of each factor following the dunnett test was applied for the post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons procedure one way analysis of variance anova followed by kolmogorov smirnov normality test was used tocompare the averaged runoff retention between the different structural factors treatments considered in this paper the effects of rainfall intensity on the retention of runoff with the data analyzed in spss 17 0 to visualize the results boxplots and scatter diagrams were all prepared in the sigmaplot 12 0 3 results 3 1 rainfall and runoff quantity characteristic of green roofs 66 rainfall events i e low and high intensity rainfall accounting for half of the total rainfall events were simulated to examine in greater detail the runoff retention of green roofs the characteristics of the simulated rainfall events are presented in table 2 in general the low intensity rainfall was recorded with a mean intensity of 0 34 mm minute recorded rainfall and the duration of low intensity rainfall ranged between 17 4 mm and 23 0 mm and 59 0 min to 60 0 min respectively for a high intensity rainfall event the observed total rainfall depths rainfall had a mean intensity of 0 64 mm minute and the rainfall amount and duration had a mean value of 19 6 mm and 30 0 min respectively a hydrograph of the rainfall runoff process of a green roof g5 and a conventional cement roof under the high rainfall intensity 0 63 mm min is shown in fig 2 which intuitively illustrates the performance on runoff retention runoff onset delay and peak flow reduction of the green roof compared to the conventional roof overall the observed runoff retention for these green roofs ranged between 17 6 and 42 1 with an average value of 33 2 under low rainfall intensities and an average runoff retention was 23 0 ranged from 6 7 to 37 1 under high rainfall intensities table 3 the higher runoff retention 42 1 was observed for the green roof g2 of substrate s1 with 10 cm depth and plants of sedumspectabilecover the average peak flow reduction was 18 3 and 8 5 respectively under low and high rainfall intensities besides peak discharge characteristics the mean time to runoff was 21 0 min and 9 2 min under low and high rainfall intensities respectively consequently it is construed that the green roofs in this study can effectively retain stormwater runoff and delay the start of runoff however the observed runoff peak reduction was not as impressive 3 2 univariate analysis of variance of runoff discharge for green roofs the statisticalresults of the univariate analysis of variance of stormwater runoff discharge are shown in table 4 except g10 n 54 the order of influence of the four factors determined by a statistical procedure i e the f value was substrate material substrate depth slope vegetation the largest f value table 4 was 9 4 for the substrate material indicating that the effects of substrate material on the green roof runoff is likely to be the most significant factor in this study significance level of p 0 001 the influence of the substrate depth on the runoff was highly significant since its f value was found to be 4 6 at a significance level of p 0 01 the effect of slope on the stormwater runoff was also important with an f value of 2 6 but it was not significant at a confidence interval of 95 the present analysis shows that vegetation does not have a statistically significant influence on the runoffs of green roofs for the analyzed rainfall events during the study period as it yielded f value 1 consequently among the studied structural factors the substrate material and the depth were contributed notably to green roof runoff retention 3 3 runoff retention performance by substrate materials and depth treatments in accordance with the findings substrate material type s1 and s2 have a higher runoff retention approximately 29 2 and 32 9 respectively than type s3 19 7 fig 3 a in terms of the statistical significance the results analyzed between substrate materials s1 and s3 s2 and s3 for the analyzed rainfall events during the study period registered p 0 01 and p 0 001 respectively n 54 it is important to note that substrate s2 had a perlite material which in fact increased the porosity of the substrate and its maximum saturated water content that reached a value of 47 0 however saturated water content was approximately 42 7 for substrate s1 and 44 8 for substrate s3 moreover no statistical significance in the runoff retention performance was found between the three substrate depth treatments in this study period fig 3b for the four substrate treatments our results indicated similar mean retention percentages of about 25 4 28 9 3 4 effects of slope on runoff retention the findings of this study show that although the runoff retention of green roofs appears to decrease slightly as the slope was increased from 2 to 12 fig 4 no statistical significance of this result was evident among the retention performance of the slope treatments for the analyzed rainfall events n 54 mean retention however was the lowest at the 12 slope 25 8 and the greatest at the 2 slope 28 7 3 5 runoff retention by vegetation in this study a major focus was to investigate the runoff retention in terms of different vegetation used to design the experiments the results found that there were statistically significant differences between the vegetation types of radix ophiopogonis and sedum spectabile p 0 05 n 54 fig 5 the radix ophiopogonis had lower runoff retention 21 0 compared to the sedum spectabile vegetation 31 3 however the vegetation types of radix ophiopogonis and iris had no significant difference of runoff retention also the bare substrate g10 i e no vegetation conditions 35 4 was able to capture more runoff compared to the vegetal green roof g1 25 9 3 6 runoff retention performance by rainfall intensity the event based runoff retention performance of green roofs differ across different rainfall intensities under the same rainfall depth the mean retention was 33 2 for the low intensity events which was about 1 4 times that of heavy intensity events 23 0 fig 6 a time to runoff also exhibited similar patterns and a delay in the higher runoff generation for low intensity events it can be seen that green roofs had 21 0 min of time to the runoff under low intensities which was 2 3 times that of the high intensities 9 2 min fig 6b in this study the kolmogorov smirnov test indicates that the green roofs had a different runoff retention and time to the runoff values across the different rainfall intensities and all the interactions between them were significantly different p 0 05 p 0 001 n 60 3 7 effects of antecedent moisture content on runoff retention the antecedent moisture content of the substrate ranged from 22 9 to 43 8 in the present study a significantly negative relationship was found between the antecedent moisture content and runoff retention with r 59 2 1 p 0 001 fig 7 a also one may notice an inverse relationship between the antecedent moisture content and the time to runoff of green roofs r 59 96 7 p 0 001 fig 7b to support this finding the adjusted r 2 of 0 40 and 0 26 respectively was checked which suggested that the antecedent moisture content accounts for about 40 of the variance in the runoff retention and about 26 of the variance in the time to the runoff process although the data were scattered and the r 2 were lower than 0 5 there is a clear trend in this case 4 discussions 4 1 overall runoff retention performance in general in this study green roofs were shown to effectively retain stormwater runoff and delay the start of the runoff which can greatly alleviate the pressure on the downstream end of the urban drainage system the average runoff retention in this study was 23 0 and 33 2 table 3 which occupies a lower range of the reported values the retention values in this study were much lower than carter and rasmussen 2006 and vanwoert et al 2005 who have reported runoff retention more than about 50 a plausible reason for this is the fact that we have used large storms in the stormwater testing stage in this study the average rainfall depth was approximately 20 mm and average return period was 3 5 and 7 0 year for low and high rainfall intensities respectively our retention data concurs with previous studies for example stovin et al 2013 reported a total retention performance of 30 for significant rain events i e greater than 1 year return period speak et al 2013 reported 39 4 retention 22 1 of 56 1 mm while monitoring a 170 mm intensive roof in general studies report greater percentage retention for smaller size events as there is greater probability that the storm size will be smaller than the available storage capacity 4 2 structural factors affecting retention capacity of green roofs based on the experiment results this study indicated that among the studied structural factors the substrate material and the depth were contributed notably to green roof stormwater retention this concurs with a number of studies that agree that it is the substrate composition and the depth that has a major influence on green roof water retention capacity and not the vegetation type and cover berndtsson 2010 dunnett et al 2008 stovin et al 2012 vanwoert et al 2005 the physical properties of a substrate particularly its pore size distribution and the maximum water holding capacity governs its retention and release characteristics miller 2003 therefore the substrate properties are crucial for how much runoff will be retained by green roofs the finding seemingly does not align with previous research and general understanding that substrate depth exerts major influence on green roof stormwater retention berndtsson 2010 dunnett and kingsbury 2008 mentens et al 2006 vanwoert et al 2005 in contrast it is in line with the recent studies nardini et al 2012 voyde et al 2010 wong and jim 2014 they were unable to determine any statistically significant difference in retention performance among the studied substrate depth treatments the actual relationship could be more complex than assuming substrate depth as a dominant factor in stormwater management performance wong and jim 2014 emphasized that the importance of substrate moisture which is often a function of depth cannot be overemphasized the discrepancies in retention due to substrate depth factor could be related to differences in the antecedent moisture content the thicker substrate may have notably lower antecedent moisture content than the thinner one during prolonged dry periods thus resulting in higher retention therefore there is no measurable benefit to increase substrate depth 5 15 cm which increases the cost of an extensive green roof project different studies regarding the influence of slope on a green roof s runoff retention capacity has yielded different results nonetheless our results are consistent with those of bengtsson 2005 and mentens et al 2006 where they concluded that the green roof slope did not influence the retention amounts to a notable degree these results however contradict a few other previous studies e g getter et al 2007 vanwoert et al 2005 villarreal and bengtsson 2005 that the influence of roof slope was significantly different in each of these investigations it is important to note that the influence of the slope on runoff retention should be studied in combination with the influence of the other factors such as the physical properties of the substrate rainfall intensity and the design of green roof layers although the vegetation type also has significant influences on the runoff retention of green roofs in this study the vegetation types played a lesser important role in contributing the runoff retention when compared with the growing substrate plant covers with increased leaf area index is able to exhibit a higher evapotranspiration rates and consequently yield a lower outflow volumes at an annual scale bengtsson 2005 palla et al 2010 stovin 2010 on the contrary the study of wolf and lundholm 2008 found that the vegetation was indeed an important contributor to the loss of water in the green roof systems and its subsequent evaporation but this was only true when the water availability was relatively low notwithstanding this significant differences in evapotranspiration and substrate moisture losses between the vegetated and non vegetated roof gardens have also been observed in previous studies berretta et al 2014 poë et al 2015 it is noteworthy that under the same antecedent dry weather period the bare soil substrate was drying out quickly while the vegetation allowing less evaporation therefore the bare substrate has larger retention than vegetation green roof due to its lower antecedent soil moisture 4 3 effects of rainfall and substrate moisture condition on runoff retention the differences in runoff retention between the low and high rainfall intensities were statistically significant for all green roofs considered in this study this was consistent with previous studies getter et al 2007 lee et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b in fact the study of villarreal and bengtsson 2005 found that water retention within a green roof was dependent to a great extent on the rainfall intensity with generally lower intensities resulting in larger retention rates this was because the high rainfall intensity tends to increase the precipitation for the same rainfall duration and may result in a saturation state of the substrate soil infiltration more quickly when the substrate soil was saturated it was difficult for water to infiltrate through soil enabling the surface runoff to occur in a similar way the mean rainfall intensity has also been identified by other researchers as one of the multiple drivers of retention performances e g speak et al 2013 stovin et al 2012 voyde et al 2010 in this study we note that the drier initial substrate moisture conditions corresponded to higher runoff depth reductions and the onset of a delay in runoff this result is consistent with the general agreement from the green roof monitoring literature that green roofs have a greater ability to retain stormwater during the drier conditions berndtsson 2010 in the getter and rowe 2009 study it is interesting to note that the mean volumetric moisture content at the three media depths were correlated with plant growth and coverage the initial condition of green roof media water content at the start of a precipitation event has a great effect on the total runoff volume and peak flow reductions the total water retention capacity for a given green roof is equal to the field capacity of the media the actual amount of precipitation that can be retained at any time is equal to the field capacity minus the initial water content at the start of the event van spengen 2010 found that substrate moisture content is a better predictor for green roof retention than antecedent dry weather period this can be explained by the fact that the substrate moisture content is a more direct indicator of green roof retention capacity hakimdavar et al 2014 in application the initial substrate moisture conditions will aid in decisions related to green roof design e g selection of media depth and provide information on areas where the greatest reduction in stormwater can be expected 5 conclusion this research makes a primary contribution towards a better understanding of the hydrology and implications of structural factors on stormwater runoff retention of extensive green roofs the runoff retention capacity of a green roof is the result of the combined action of various factors including rainfall intensity distribution the initial moisture conditions and green roof characteristics the present study has sought answers to the question which is the significant factor influenced runoff retention and should be a priority this question is significant as it is not clear to green roof engineers in their design practices on ways to optimally select the suitable substrate material depth and vegetation or slope in this study a primary contribution to this knowledge was made using scale models of extensive green roofs with carefully designed and the simulated rainfall experiments conducted to determine the contribution of structural factors in green roof stormwater retention performance among the studied structural factors the substrate material and the depth was seen to contribute notably to the green roof stormwater retention however there is no measurable benefit to increase substrate depth which increases the cost of an extensive green roof project the runoff retention has significant different between substrate materials and vegetation types but the vegetation played a lesser contribution of runoff retention the slope treatments had slight and no statistically significant effects on runoff retention therefore the selection of green roof substrate is an important part of the design standards for green roof and should be a priority the present research showed that green roof with no vegetation was able to capture more water compared to the other vegetation types due to its lower antecedent soil moisture runoff retention within a green roof was dependent to a great extent on the rainfall intensity ascribed to the substrate infiltration mechanism in accordance with these findings it was evident that a roof s ability to retain stormwater can be highly sensitive to the initial moisture conditions of the green roof system prior to a rainfall event and a drier initial substrate moisture conditions corresponding to a higher runoff retention and runoff onset delay in the application area of engineering design the present study ascertains that the lightweight design substrate with a high retention capacity can be considered for future buildings with loading concerns although less substrates may be able to reduce the overall construction cost thinner depths may fulfill the need to accommodate ample rooting rooms for the selected plant species if vegetation was considered in the design of extensive green roofs acknowledgements this study was supported by

6756,green roofs in contrast to conventional roofs retain significant stormwater and are considerably appealing for urban regions to help mitigate flooding events and addressing serious environmental impacts of excessive or uncontrolled runoff in designing a green roof a careful selection of substrate material depths vegetation or slopes or its optimal combination is imperative but this issue remains underexplored by practicing hydrologists scale based models of extensive green roofs were purposely designed and simulated rainfall experiments were conducted to comprehensively quantify runoff retention performance of extensive green roofs to precisely determine the contribution of structural factors to stormwater retention the results indicated that green roofs can effectively retain stormwater and delay the start of the runoff to aver with this finding influential contribution of four structural factors are ordered as follows substrate material substrate depth slope vegetation this finding denotes that substrate material and its depth are major contributors to a green roof s stormwater retention capability statistical tests conducted on runoff retention showed the substrate materials and vegetation types had statistically significant effects no statistically significant difference in runoff retention abilities among the three substrate depth treatments and the slope gradients considered given the same conditions the study ascertains that runoff retention of low intensity events is likely to be relatively higher while that of the heavy events is lower than its counterparts the antecedent moisture contents of the substrate have a significant negative influence on the runoff retention and the time to the runoff keywords green roof runoff retention scale model simulated rainfall structural factors substrate 1 introduction although rapid urbanization warrants a need to implement sustainable hydrologic structures that limit environmental degradation it has become apparent that green surfaces mainly in urban regions are being replaced by additional buildings and pavements which in fact is changing the original permeable conditions to the impervious surfaces berndtsson 2010 consequently there has been a considerable increase in the surface stormwater runoff which has resulted in more frequent flooding and water logging al rawas et al 2015 ellis et al 2012 to address this issue a number of alternative options are being proposed to restore the hydrology of urban areas including but not limited to the maintenance of green areas and the recovery or restoration of deforested areas wilkinson et al 2014 in reality conventional rooftops can constitute up to 40 50 of the impervious area in a densely built up urban center where no space is available for a new infrastructure to be put in place dunnett and kingsbury 2004 green roofs which are a primary focus of this study utilize the otherwise unused impervious surfaces to restore predevelopment hydrologic functions such as a better infiltration and retention effect razzaghmanesh and beecham 2014 given a natural shortage of land in urban areas green roofs can therefore be one of the most important options to address issues associated with surface runoffs berndtsson 2010 palla et al 2010 recently green roofs have received increased recognition in developed countries such as the usa japan australia and europe berndtsson et al 2008 mentens et al 2006 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 williams et al 2010 the purpose of adopting such technologies is to use a smart approach that addresses the pertinent issues associated with waterlogging urban flooding and uncontrolled runoffs that is likely to pose serious environmental impacts the increasing premise of a sustainable city promoted by a green roof also known as an integrated eco and a living roof is becoming an issue of interest to hydrologists typically a green roof consists of three major components a vegetation layer a lightweight substrate medium and a water storage drainage layer placed on top of a waterproof membrane carson et al 2013 yang et al 2015 according to the depth of the growing substrate layer a green roof is commonly classified into extensive or intensive categories generally a green roof with a substrate depth of less than 15 cm is classified into an extensive green roof and its vegetation consists of a shallow rooting and drought resistant plant rainwater that falls on the green roof can be captured in the substrate or the vegetation and is eventually evaporated from the surface of the soil and released back into the atmosphere by the process of transpiration dunnett and kingsbury 2008 the benefits of a green roof is off course to help retain stormwater gregoire and clausen 2011 schroll et al 2011 speak et al 2013 delay the peak discharge time carter and rasmussen 2006 spolek 2008 and to attenuate the peak discharge volume carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 stovin et al 2012 these functions clearly outline the major contribution of an urban green roof in the control and moderation of surface hydrology in urban cities where flood risk management is a crucial determinant of the overall safety of the city dwellers many researchers have investigated the rainfall runoff behavior of a green roof carter and rasmussen 2006 denardo et al 2005 moran et al 2003 primarily to investigate its implications on surface water flow pilot scale studies based on elevated test boxes or similar modules with a watershed area that can range between 0 37 m2 and 12 m2 have been instrumental in helping to identify and quantify relationships associated with runoff retention of green roofs carson et al 2013 research into the hydrological properties of a green roof has therefore reveal a range of average rainwater retention efficiencies that vary from one design to another for extensive green roofs i e with a substrate depth 15 cm the average rainwater retention efficiency is nominally estimated to be between 45 denardo et al 2005 mentens et al 2006 and 60 moran et al 2003 and the cumulative annual retentions is about 50 stovin et al 2012 and 60 vanwoert et al 2005 the water retention capacity of a green roof system is therefore dependent on several causal factors such as the rainfall specific characteristics antecedent moisture conditions substrate depth and its hydraulic characteristics storage drainage layer capacity vegetation cover characteristics and slope of the green roof bengtsson et al 2005 carter and rasmussen 2006 getter et al 2007 simmons et al 2008 speak et al 2013 teemusk and mander 2007 villarreal and bengtsson 2005 wong and jim 2014 it should be noted that real time i e field measurements of these factors can be rather a tedious if not an impossible task and a large variation in the above mentioned conditions and the respective factors in existing literature also make it difficult to compare the water retention from these independent green roof runoff studies considering the difficulties encountered in accurately performing real measurements and the inconsistency of information obtained from previous studies independent experiments that are able to explore the influence of a green roof design on the underlying urban hydrology and particularly the runoff retention in a well controlled manner is an issue of practical interest in addition to the quantification of runoff retention for different rainfall sizes there is a particular need to understand retention for significant events with large return periods these events generally overwhelm stormwater management systems and result in flooding to concur with the foresaid reviews the runoff retention capacity of green roof is a result of the combined action of various factors affecting the runoff retention itself which results in various and rather inconsistent conclusions many research studies focused on the influence of one or two different structural factors on a green roof s runoff retention however multiple structural factors which are particularly important from a practical viewpoint have not been considered to assess their integrated contributions to the runoff retention therefore to address these issues from a practical point of view the primary structural factors must include the substrate material substrate depth vegetation types and slope gradients as undertaken in the present study the novelty of this study stems in the fact that the prototype green roof models are built following an orthogonal experimental design with four structural factors at three different levels the purpose was to facilitate an accurate and extensive evaluation of the respective relationships of green roof structures and the retention performance of stormwater runoffs by means of well defined and well controlled scale model experimental approaches to satisfy this need different scale models of extensive green roofs were designed and simulated rainfall experiments were conducted to assess the runoff retention performance this study for the first time makes a major contribution to the design of a future green roof in respect to providing a detailed evaluation of the influence of structural factors that control the stormwater retention performances of the designated green roofs the outcomes have important implications for sustainable stormwater management of the future design of a green roof hydrological planning and strategies for urban buildings and improving future practices in relation to better stormwater management in urban cities 2 materials and method 2 1 scale models of green roofs ten scale models of extensive green roofs were constructed from a custom made 2 mm thick stain less steel platform with internal dimensions of 100 cm wide 100 cm long 10 30 cm height fig 1 a and b these green roofs were placed on a metal base at the experiment ground of the dingxi institute of soil and water conservation in gansu province china 35 34 45 88 n 104 38 5 67 e this region was located in a semiarid climatic zone and was dominated by the warm humid summers and cold dry winters the mean annual precipitation was 421 mm the standard green roof assembly consisted of a drainage layer filter fabric growing substrate and vegetation the last layer was an additional waterproof layer comprising a waterproof roll paved onto the bottom of the platform the drainage layer was a 25 mm thick drainage board with high impact polystyrene dimple sheet a non woven geotextile fabric was bonded to the upper surface of the drainage composite as the filter layer which prevented the small particles from being washed from the substrate layer into the drainage layer or out of the system the growing substrate and plants were placed on top of the non woven geotextile the outflow openings were constructed in the middle of the drainage layer of the green roofs and were connected by pipes with a diameter of 25 mm meanwhile a conventional roof which paved with the traditional cement surface with a thickness of 10 cm was constructed the roof s size was consisted with the above runoff plots of green roofs the difference was that a marked steel v flume was created at the outlet of each plot for facilitating the collection of surface runoff the green roofs were designed following an orthogonal experimental design cabezas and comín 2010 sadeghi et al 2012 yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015a with four primary factors i e substrate materials substrate depth vegetation types and slope gradients at three levels table 1 this method has generally been adopted to optimize the design parameters and significantly minimize the overall testing time and experimental costs sadeghi et al 2012 the substrate material composition was based on roof greening material available in china bls 2005 considering the growth environment of plants and bearing capacity of their roof three mixture types of light weight materials were used as the growing substrate the volume ratio of each mixture were as follow rural soil peat soil was 1 1 in substrate s1 rural soil peat soil pine needle perlite was 1 1 1 1 in substrate s2 rural soil peat soil perlite vermiculite was 2 5 5 2 0 5 in substrate s3 a small shovel was used to measure the mix proportions and blended the substrate soil the maximum substrate depth of an extensive green roof is 15 cm berndtsson et al 2010 the soil thickness of extensive vegetated roofs defined by kosareo and ries 2007 was 50 150 mm for conventional non living roofs the literature data were limited to roofs with a slope of 2 mentens et al 2006 according to dunnett and kingsbury 2004 a maximum slope of 17 is the recommended limit before requiring additional slope stabilization measures according to the construction criterion of extensive green roofs and the above references the substrate depth treatments were set to 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm and the platforms were set at three slopes levels 2 7 and 15 based on their metal bases in order to keep the similar compactness of these substrates soil the substrate padding process was watered several times until the soil infiltration had saturated and compacted over a period of time the vegetation layers were planted with three different vegetation types included radix ophiopogonis ophiopogon japonicas linn f ker gawl sedumspectabile hylotelephium erythrostictum miq h ohba and iris iris tectorum maxim it is important to note that these species were selected according to their high resistance abilities to drought stress conditions nardini et al 2003 and these plants have been widely incorporated in local landscapes and green roof designs jim and peng 2012 these plants were positioned in the substrate with at an averaged density of 184 plugs m2 124 plugs m2 65 plugs m2 plant spacing is about 5 cm weeds were removed regularly to prevent any sort of competition with the experimental plants a green roof with no vegetation was thus considered as a control experiment compare with the green roof which has 5 cm depth of substrate s1 and planted by radix ophiopogonis under 2 slope in this study the outer edge of runoff plot was designed 10 cm higher than the substrate surface and the plots were placed about 70 cm apart to prevent rainfall splashing and edge effects splash on the green roofs was considered to be negligible because of the soft absorptive nature of the plant cover and spongy substrate material shen 2007 2 2 experimental design in this study an artificial rainfall simulator was applied arnaez et al 2004 battany and grismer 2000 lee et al 2015 sutherland and ziegler 2006 consisting of a norton ladder type rainfall simulator that was set 3 5 m above the present scale models fig 1c the spraying systems employed veejet 80 100 nozzles with 41 kpa water pressure that were spaced 1 1 m apart with a computer that oscillated across the plot to generate a constant rainfall intensity specifically the median volume of rain drop size obtained by this simulator was 2 2 mm and the uniformity coefficient of rainfall reached more than 0 8 rainfall intensity controller was set to produce different rainfall intensity events that could provide hydrological conditions for the prescribed green roofs the precipitation input was carefully monitored by a standard tipping bucket rain gauge onset hobo 0 2 mm rainfall smart sensor s rgb positioned adjacent near and at the same height as that of the experimental platforms this ensured that difference in height did not introduce any variations in turbulence and wind exposures and the rain gauge was tested and calibrated prior to every experiment to generate accurate simulations from the scale based models in this paper the runoff discharge from the designated green roof was collected in a plastic container below the platform by means of a pipe at its downstream end for continuous monitoring of the weight a fixed base was placed on a pressure transducer that aimed to stabilize the plastic container the depth in the collection container was monitored regularly using the pressure transducer to provide a continuous record of the runoff amounts by means of an appropriate calibration relationship the weight of the discharge container was measured continuously in small time intervals per second by an industrial grade pressure transducer weighing load cell bengbu sensor system engineering company jlbu bengbu china with an accuracy of 50 ml i e approximately 0 05 mm based on the platform area this permitted a precise quantification of the green roof discharge rates the measurements were logged into a data logger campbell scientific cr300 usa the per second readings were subsequently averaged to produce one minute readings for further data processing the 5te sensors decagon devices 5te usa were inserted horizontally into the mid depth of the substrate to monitor the moisture condition of the substrate layer the polynomial empirical topp equation used to convert dielectric permittivity to an antecedent moisture content visconti et al 2014 to avoid the standing water on the probe surface the flat probe was oriented perpendicularly to the soil surface 2 3 data analysis on the basis of the experimentally based hydrological data collected in this study the other selected variables including the rainfall intensity time of the runoff runoff discharge peak flow runoff retention and peak flow reduction were all computed and later utilized for further analysis descriptive statistical analysis was undertaken to detect the general features of the simulated rainfall related runoff characteristics and runoff retention performance by using spss 17 0 the relationship describing the runoff retention from the green roof was computed as follows zhang et al 2015b 1 r r r v v r v 100 in eq 1 r r was the runoff retention rate r v referred to the rainfall volume actually received by green roof mm v was the runoff depth of green roof mm based on the experimental data from orthogonal designs the univariate analysis of variance anova was performed to statistically assess the influence of four structural factors on runoff discharge of the designated green roofs under two rainfall intensities and this was used to determine the significance of each factor following the dunnett test was applied for the post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons procedure one way analysis of variance anova followed by kolmogorov smirnov normality test was used tocompare the averaged runoff retention between the different structural factors treatments considered in this paper the effects of rainfall intensity on the retention of runoff with the data analyzed in spss 17 0 to visualize the results boxplots and scatter diagrams were all prepared in the sigmaplot 12 0 3 results 3 1 rainfall and runoff quantity characteristic of green roofs 66 rainfall events i e low and high intensity rainfall accounting for half of the total rainfall events were simulated to examine in greater detail the runoff retention of green roofs the characteristics of the simulated rainfall events are presented in table 2 in general the low intensity rainfall was recorded with a mean intensity of 0 34 mm minute recorded rainfall and the duration of low intensity rainfall ranged between 17 4 mm and 23 0 mm and 59 0 min to 60 0 min respectively for a high intensity rainfall event the observed total rainfall depths rainfall had a mean intensity of 0 64 mm minute and the rainfall amount and duration had a mean value of 19 6 mm and 30 0 min respectively a hydrograph of the rainfall runoff process of a green roof g5 and a conventional cement roof under the high rainfall intensity 0 63 mm min is shown in fig 2 which intuitively illustrates the performance on runoff retention runoff onset delay and peak flow reduction of the green roof compared to the conventional roof overall the observed runoff retention for these green roofs ranged between 17 6 and 42 1 with an average value of 33 2 under low rainfall intensities and an average runoff retention was 23 0 ranged from 6 7 to 37 1 under high rainfall intensities table 3 the higher runoff retention 42 1 was observed for the green roof g2 of substrate s1 with 10 cm depth and plants of sedumspectabilecover the average peak flow reduction was 18 3 and 8 5 respectively under low and high rainfall intensities besides peak discharge characteristics the mean time to runoff was 21 0 min and 9 2 min under low and high rainfall intensities respectively consequently it is construed that the green roofs in this study can effectively retain stormwater runoff and delay the start of runoff however the observed runoff peak reduction was not as impressive 3 2 univariate analysis of variance of runoff discharge for green roofs the statisticalresults of the univariate analysis of variance of stormwater runoff discharge are shown in table 4 except g10 n 54 the order of influence of the four factors determined by a statistical procedure i e the f value was substrate material substrate depth slope vegetation the largest f value table 4 was 9 4 for the substrate material indicating that the effects of substrate material on the green roof runoff is likely to be the most significant factor in this study significance level of p 0 001 the influence of the substrate depth on the runoff was highly significant since its f value was found to be 4 6 at a significance level of p 0 01 the effect of slope on the stormwater runoff was also important with an f value of 2 6 but it was not significant at a confidence interval of 95 the present analysis shows that vegetation does not have a statistically significant influence on the runoffs of green roofs for the analyzed rainfall events during the study period as it yielded f value 1 consequently among the studied structural factors the substrate material and the depth were contributed notably to green roof runoff retention 3 3 runoff retention performance by substrate materials and depth treatments in accordance with the findings substrate material type s1 and s2 have a higher runoff retention approximately 29 2 and 32 9 respectively than type s3 19 7 fig 3 a in terms of the statistical significance the results analyzed between substrate materials s1 and s3 s2 and s3 for the analyzed rainfall events during the study period registered p 0 01 and p 0 001 respectively n 54 it is important to note that substrate s2 had a perlite material which in fact increased the porosity of the substrate and its maximum saturated water content that reached a value of 47 0 however saturated water content was approximately 42 7 for substrate s1 and 44 8 for substrate s3 moreover no statistical significance in the runoff retention performance was found between the three substrate depth treatments in this study period fig 3b for the four substrate treatments our results indicated similar mean retention percentages of about 25 4 28 9 3 4 effects of slope on runoff retention the findings of this study show that although the runoff retention of green roofs appears to decrease slightly as the slope was increased from 2 to 12 fig 4 no statistical significance of this result was evident among the retention performance of the slope treatments for the analyzed rainfall events n 54 mean retention however was the lowest at the 12 slope 25 8 and the greatest at the 2 slope 28 7 3 5 runoff retention by vegetation in this study a major focus was to investigate the runoff retention in terms of different vegetation used to design the experiments the results found that there were statistically significant differences between the vegetation types of radix ophiopogonis and sedum spectabile p 0 05 n 54 fig 5 the radix ophiopogonis had lower runoff retention 21 0 compared to the sedum spectabile vegetation 31 3 however the vegetation types of radix ophiopogonis and iris had no significant difference of runoff retention also the bare substrate g10 i e no vegetation conditions 35 4 was able to capture more runoff compared to the vegetal green roof g1 25 9 3 6 runoff retention performance by rainfall intensity the event based runoff retention performance of green roofs differ across different rainfall intensities under the same rainfall depth the mean retention was 33 2 for the low intensity events which was about 1 4 times that of heavy intensity events 23 0 fig 6 a time to runoff also exhibited similar patterns and a delay in the higher runoff generation for low intensity events it can be seen that green roofs had 21 0 min of time to the runoff under low intensities which was 2 3 times that of the high intensities 9 2 min fig 6b in this study the kolmogorov smirnov test indicates that the green roofs had a different runoff retention and time to the runoff values across the different rainfall intensities and all the interactions between them were significantly different p 0 05 p 0 001 n 60 3 7 effects of antecedent moisture content on runoff retention the antecedent moisture content of the substrate ranged from 22 9 to 43 8 in the present study a significantly negative relationship was found between the antecedent moisture content and runoff retention with r 59 2 1 p 0 001 fig 7 a also one may notice an inverse relationship between the antecedent moisture content and the time to runoff of green roofs r 59 96 7 p 0 001 fig 7b to support this finding the adjusted r 2 of 0 40 and 0 26 respectively was checked which suggested that the antecedent moisture content accounts for about 40 of the variance in the runoff retention and about 26 of the variance in the time to the runoff process although the data were scattered and the r 2 were lower than 0 5 there is a clear trend in this case 4 discussions 4 1 overall runoff retention performance in general in this study green roofs were shown to effectively retain stormwater runoff and delay the start of the runoff which can greatly alleviate the pressure on the downstream end of the urban drainage system the average runoff retention in this study was 23 0 and 33 2 table 3 which occupies a lower range of the reported values the retention values in this study were much lower than carter and rasmussen 2006 and vanwoert et al 2005 who have reported runoff retention more than about 50 a plausible reason for this is the fact that we have used large storms in the stormwater testing stage in this study the average rainfall depth was approximately 20 mm and average return period was 3 5 and 7 0 year for low and high rainfall intensities respectively our retention data concurs with previous studies for example stovin et al 2013 reported a total retention performance of 30 for significant rain events i e greater than 1 year return period speak et al 2013 reported 39 4 retention 22 1 of 56 1 mm while monitoring a 170 mm intensive roof in general studies report greater percentage retention for smaller size events as there is greater probability that the storm size will be smaller than the available storage capacity 4 2 structural factors affecting retention capacity of green roofs based on the experiment results this study indicated that among the studied structural factors the substrate material and the depth were contributed notably to green roof stormwater retention this concurs with a number of studies that agree that it is the substrate composition and the depth that has a major influence on green roof water retention capacity and not the vegetation type and cover berndtsson 2010 dunnett et al 2008 stovin et al 2012 vanwoert et al 2005 the physical properties of a substrate particularly its pore size distribution and the maximum water holding capacity governs its retention and release characteristics miller 2003 therefore the substrate properties are crucial for how much runoff will be retained by green roofs the finding seemingly does not align with previous research and general understanding that substrate depth exerts major influence on green roof stormwater retention berndtsson 2010 dunnett and kingsbury 2008 mentens et al 2006 vanwoert et al 2005 in contrast it is in line with the recent studies nardini et al 2012 voyde et al 2010 wong and jim 2014 they were unable to determine any statistically significant difference in retention performance among the studied substrate depth treatments the actual relationship could be more complex than assuming substrate depth as a dominant factor in stormwater management performance wong and jim 2014 emphasized that the importance of substrate moisture which is often a function of depth cannot be overemphasized the discrepancies in retention due to substrate depth factor could be related to differences in the antecedent moisture content the thicker substrate may have notably lower antecedent moisture content than the thinner one during prolonged dry periods thus resulting in higher retention therefore there is no measurable benefit to increase substrate depth 5 15 cm which increases the cost of an extensive green roof project different studies regarding the influence of slope on a green roof s runoff retention capacity has yielded different results nonetheless our results are consistent with those of bengtsson 2005 and mentens et al 2006 where they concluded that the green roof slope did not influence the retention amounts to a notable degree these results however contradict a few other previous studies e g getter et al 2007 vanwoert et al 2005 villarreal and bengtsson 2005 that the influence of roof slope was significantly different in each of these investigations it is important to note that the influence of the slope on runoff retention should be studied in combination with the influence of the other factors such as the physical properties of the substrate rainfall intensity and the design of green roof layers although the vegetation type also has significant influences on the runoff retention of green roofs in this study the vegetation types played a lesser important role in contributing the runoff retention when compared with the growing substrate plant covers with increased leaf area index is able to exhibit a higher evapotranspiration rates and consequently yield a lower outflow volumes at an annual scale bengtsson 2005 palla et al 2010 stovin 2010 on the contrary the study of wolf and lundholm 2008 found that the vegetation was indeed an important contributor to the loss of water in the green roof systems and its subsequent evaporation but this was only true when the water availability was relatively low notwithstanding this significant differences in evapotranspiration and substrate moisture losses between the vegetated and non vegetated roof gardens have also been observed in previous studies berretta et al 2014 poë et al 2015 it is noteworthy that under the same antecedent dry weather period the bare soil substrate was drying out quickly while the vegetation allowing less evaporation therefore the bare substrate has larger retention than vegetation green roof due to its lower antecedent soil moisture 4 3 effects of rainfall and substrate moisture condition on runoff retention the differences in runoff retention between the low and high rainfall intensities were statistically significant for all green roofs considered in this study this was consistent with previous studies getter et al 2007 lee et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b in fact the study of villarreal and bengtsson 2005 found that water retention within a green roof was dependent to a great extent on the rainfall intensity with generally lower intensities resulting in larger retention rates this was because the high rainfall intensity tends to increase the precipitation for the same rainfall duration and may result in a saturation state of the substrate soil infiltration more quickly when the substrate soil was saturated it was difficult for water to infiltrate through soil enabling the surface runoff to occur in a similar way the mean rainfall intensity has also been identified by other researchers as one of the multiple drivers of retention performances e g speak et al 2013 stovin et al 2012 voyde et al 2010 in this study we note that the drier initial substrate moisture conditions corresponded to higher runoff depth reductions and the onset of a delay in runoff this result is consistent with the general agreement from the green roof monitoring literature that green roofs have a greater ability to retain stormwater during the drier conditions berndtsson 2010 in the getter and rowe 2009 study it is interesting to note that the mean volumetric moisture content at the three media depths were correlated with plant growth and coverage the initial condition of green roof media water content at the start of a precipitation event has a great effect on the total runoff volume and peak flow reductions the total water retention capacity for a given green roof is equal to the field capacity of the media the actual amount of precipitation that can be retained at any time is equal to the field capacity minus the initial water content at the start of the event van spengen 2010 found that substrate moisture content is a better predictor for green roof retention than antecedent dry weather period this can be explained by the fact that the substrate moisture content is a more direct indicator of green roof retention capacity hakimdavar et al 2014 in application the initial substrate moisture conditions will aid in decisions related to green roof design e g selection of media depth and provide information on areas where the greatest reduction in stormwater can be expected 5 conclusion this research makes a primary contribution towards a better understanding of the hydrology and implications of structural factors on stormwater runoff retention of extensive green roofs the runoff retention capacity of a green roof is the result of the combined action of various factors including rainfall intensity distribution the initial moisture conditions and green roof characteristics the present study has sought answers to the question which is the significant factor influenced runoff retention and should be a priority this question is significant as it is not clear to green roof engineers in their design practices on ways to optimally select the suitable substrate material depth and vegetation or slope in this study a primary contribution to this knowledge was made using scale models of extensive green roofs with carefully designed and the simulated rainfall experiments conducted to determine the contribution of structural factors in green roof stormwater retention performance among the studied structural factors the substrate material and the depth was seen to contribute notably to the green roof stormwater retention however there is no measurable benefit to increase substrate depth which increases the cost of an extensive green roof project the runoff retention has significant different between substrate materials and vegetation types but the vegetation played a lesser contribution of runoff retention the slope treatments had slight and no statistically significant effects on runoff retention therefore the selection of green roof substrate is an important part of the design standards for green roof and should be a priority the present research showed that green roof with no vegetation was able to capture more water compared to the other vegetation types due to its lower antecedent soil moisture runoff retention within a green roof was dependent to a great extent on the rainfall intensity ascribed to the substrate infiltration mechanism in accordance with these findings it was evident that a roof s ability to retain stormwater can be highly sensitive to the initial moisture conditions of the green roof system prior to a rainfall event and a drier initial substrate moisture conditions corresponding to a higher runoff retention and runoff onset delay in the application area of engineering design the present study ascertains that the lightweight design substrate with a high retention capacity can be considered for future buildings with loading concerns although less substrates may be able to reduce the overall construction cost thinner depths may fulfill the need to accommodate ample rooting rooms for the selected plant species if vegetation was considered in the design of extensive green roofs acknowledgements this study was supported by

unique hydrological feature of the landscape and are essential for sustainable urban development mitsch and gosselink 2015 carvalho et al 2009 linder et al 1994 research on hydrological processes of solute transport in wetland also known as hydraulic dispersion or environmental dispersion can advance the physical understanding of wetland management and ecological functions of wetland zeng and chen 2011 wu et al 2011 much research has explored solute transport in wetland the presence of vegetation leads to complex flow and mass transport at multiple scales such as stem scale canopy scale and cross section scale of wetland channel ghisalberti and nepf 2002 zeng et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 to characterize such transport phenomena the basic model of taylor dispersion taylor 1954 taylor 1953 provides a fundamental tool of simplification which performs average over some scales and obtains the corresponding dispersion coefficients for emergent vegetation many laboratory measurements and simulations huai et al 2015 sonnenwald et al 2017 have been carried out to study the flow structure and lateral environmental dispersivity with respect to the width scale of wetland channel while for submerged vegetation researchers focus on vertical environmental dispersivity with respect to the height scale nepf 2012 luhar et al 2013 to systematically study the transport process in wetland chen et al 2010 used phase average method rajagopal and tao 1995 liu et al 2005 to deal with both the lateral and vertical environmental dispersivities by smearing out the discontinuity between water and vegetation phases zeng and chen 2009 together with aris moment analysis aris 1956 aris 1960 fischer 1972 they have obtained the gaussian cross sectional averaged concentration distribution zeng and chen 2011 and captured temporal evolution of the environmental dispersivity recently based on phase average method other analytical approaches such as multi scale perturbation analysis ng and yip 2001 wu et al 2011 paul and mazumder 2011 gill 1967 s generalized dispersion model jiang et al 2017 wang and huai 2018 gauss hermite expansion wang and chen 2017 have also been applied to solute transport in wetland typically wetlands have multiple layers such as heterogeneity of vegetation distribution especially the submerge vegetation soil substrate gravel bed małoszewski et al 2006 nepf 2012 chen et al 2012 many studies have explored solute transport in such layered wetland nepf et al 2007 used a two box canopy model to describe the vertical transport in submerged aquatic canopies murphy et al 2007 proposed a two zone layer model to characterize dispersion processes under submerged vegetation and discussed the influence of the relative submergence shucksmith et al 2010 applied chikwendu 1986 s n zone layer model to obtained the environmental dispersivity and verified the results of open channel flow with natural vegetation by experiments shucksmith et al 2011 based on the phase average transport equation chen et al 2012 obtained the analytical solution of the moments equation of a two layer wetland flow similarly wang et al 2013 extended such moments analysis to a three layer wetland while recently luo et al 2017 consider the impact of wind effect li et al 2017 on environmental dispersion in two layer wetland and wang et al 2018 discuss the three layer wetland other classic methods on solute transport such as generalized dispersion model has also been applied to layered wetland wang et al 2014 in addition similar to multi layer wetland solute transport in wetland flow dominated by wall bank effects with multiple zones with different plants in zones has also been investigated wu et al 2011 chen 2013 wang et al 2015 luo et al 2016 however above studies on solute transport in layered wetland using phase average method only discussed the depth averaged concentration distribution in fact vertical concentration distribution is an important issue for practical purpose such as residence time distributions hart et al 2016 critical length of solute cloud shao et al 2014 especially in wetland with layered structure due to heterogeneity of vegetation distribution soils and etc in open channel flow wu and chen 2014a demonstrated the slow decaying transient effect of variation of the vertical concentration due to the non uniform velocity zeng et al 2015 for single layer wetland flow recent studies wu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 reached the same conclusion on the non uniformity of vertical distribution therefore it is necessary to discuss the vertical distribution in layered wetland moreover recent work jiang et al 2017 also captured the skewed depth averaged concentration distribution chatwin 1970 of solute transport in single layer wetland while previous studies chen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 luo et al 2017 about layered wetland only obtained the gaussian distribution with environmental dispersivity as the variance in fact chatwin 1970 showed that the non gaussian distribution effects such as skewness the measure of asymmetry and kurtosis excess kurtosis the comparison to the gaussian distribution are remarkable in the initial stage of solute transport andersson and berglin 1981 aminian et al 2016 experimentally and numerically studied the anomalous dispersion effects skewed distribution due to different cross sections of ducts in wetland flow the time scale of diffusion with respect to advection is large small péclet number huang et al 2008 chen et al 2010 guo et al 2018a thus the initial stage of solute transport is fairly long murphy et al 2007 experimentally revealed the deviation of depth averaged distribution from gaussian distribution therefore there is a need to capture such anomalous dispersion in layered wetland to investigate the complete solute transport in layered wetland this work obtains the two dimensional concentration distribution using chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic technique based on the phase average transport model through asymptotic expansion the non gaussian distribution effects of skewness and kurtosis of depth averaged distribution are also included for simplicity the governing equations of different layers are combined into one typical advection diffusion equation with variable parameters piecewise functions for the whole layered wetland next we obtain the coefficients of the series expansion of concentration distribution by solving the equations of spatial moments of concentration finally we study wetlands of different number of layers but with same depth averaged porosity as an illustration of the impact of the layered structure on solute transport 2 formulation for solute transport in layered wetland for solute transport in a layered wetland as depicted in fig 1 previous studies chen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 luo et al 2017 constructed governing equations for each layer which is cumbersome here we combine the equations of different layers into a typical advection diffusion equation with variable parameters piecewise functions firstly we consider a simple wetland of only one layer using phase average method the general advection diffusion equation for superficial solute transport can be adopted as liu et al 2005 chen et al 2010 1 ϕ c w t u c w κ λ ϕ c w κ k c w where ϕ is porosity dimensionless t is time s c w is water phase based superficial concentration kg m 3 u is superficial velocity m s 1 κ is tortuosity accounting for the spatial structure of vegetation dimensionless λ is concentration diffusivity m 2 s

of the i th i n 1 interface of layer is y i let 5 s face y 1 y 2 y n 1 be the set of these positions we also denote y 0 0 and y n h for convenience immediately we can extend the governing eq 3 for a one layer wetland to that for a multi layer wetland with variable parameters 6 c t u y c x d x y 2 c x 2 d y y 2 c y 2 0 y h y s face where water phase based velocity u y now is a piecewise function 7

dimensionless parameters at first we use bracket to denote the depth averaged mean hereafter use mean for short of a quantity e g 16 u 1 h 0 h u y d y 1 h i 1 n y i 1 y i u y d y is the mean velocity notice that such integral is riemann integral of the piecewise function particularly the mean of longitudinal dispersivity 17 d x 1 h i 1 n d xi y i y i 1 1 h i 1 n λ k xi ϕ i y i y i 1 and the mean vertical dispersivity 18 d y 1 h i 1 n d yi y i y i 1 1 h i 1 n λ k yi ϕ i y i y i 1 now we can introduce the dimensionless parameters analogous to the case of a single layer wetland zeng et al 2011

distribution c and 29 c c before solving the whole problem 23 of solute transport in layered wetlands we need to obtain the water phase based velocity u y the solution of velocity u y of the two zone and three layered wetlands have been derived by wu et al 2011 and wang et al 2013 respectively for multi layered wetlands we combine the momentum transport equations of different layers into a typical one with variable parameters to be consistent with above advection diffusion eq 6 see appendix a 3 method and solution for environmental dispersion we have extended the governing equation of solute transport for one layer wetlands 3 to that for multi layer wetlands 23 with variable parameters such as velocity and dispersivity therefore we can apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion edgeworth expansion directly to obtain both the one dimensional distribution of the mean concentration and the two dimensional field of spatial concentration firstly we solve the equation for spatial moments of concentration then we obtain the coefficients of the expansion in terms of cumulants of concentration distribution 3 1 spatial moments of concentration distribution the spatial moments of concentration distribution are defined as aris 1956 30 c n y t x n c x y t d x n 0 1 and moments of mean distribution 31 c n t x n c d x c n n 0 1 using these definitions with the assumption aris 1956 that concentration decays exponentially as x eq 23 gives barton 1983 32 c n t d y y 2 c n y 2 n n 1 d x y pe 2 c n 2 nu y c n 1 y s face n 0 1 where c 1 c 2 0 the boundary conditions are 33 c n y y 0 c n y y 1 0 n 0 1 and the initial conditions are 34 c n t 0 c ini x y d x n 0 1 interface conditions give 35 c n ϕ i y y i c n ϕ i 1 y y i i 1 2 n 1 n 0 1 36 d y y c n y y y i d y y c n y y y i i 1 2 n 1 n 0 1 notice that c n y t are also piecewise functions to solve concentration moments c n we consider the following associated eigenvalue problem 37 d y y 2 ψ y 2 β ψ 38 d ψ d y y 0 d ψ d y y 1 0 39 ψ ϕ i y y i ψ ϕ i 1 y y i i 1 2 n 1 40 d y y ψ y y y i d y y ψ y y y i i 1 2 n 1 where β is eigenvalue and ψ y is the corresponding eigenfunction the solution of above problem give a discrete set of eigenvalue β j j 1 and corresponding eigenfunctions ψ j y j 1 shown in appendix b notice that each eigenfunction is also piecewise 41 ψ j y ψ ji y i 1 y y i i 1 2 n j 1 2 finally using the integral transform technique the solution of c n y t can be represented by the expansion 42 c n y t j 1 b nj t ψ j y n 0 1 detailed solutions of coefficients b nj t can be found in barton 1983 s work immediately we can obtain the mean concentration 43 c n t j 1 b nj t ψ j y n 0 1 3 2 cumulants skewness and kurtosis the coefficients of edgeworth expansion are related to cumulants of distribution which are basic quantities alternative to the moments in probability theory moreover skewness and kurtosis are introduced to capture the non gaussian concentration distribution first we obtain probability density function pdf p x y t with respect to x from the longitudinal concentration distribution c x y t by normalization 44 p x y t c x y t c 0 y t similarly the pdf p x t of mean concentration is 45 p x t c x t c 0 t notice that p x t is not necessarily equal to p x y t the n th raw moments of pdf are 46 p n y t x n p x y t d x c n c 0 n 0 1 the central moments of pdf can be defined as 47 p n y t x p 1 n p x y t d x n 0 1 particularly we use x μ to denote the mean expected value 48 x μ y t p 1 y t and σ the standard deviation variance 49 σ y t p 2 y t as for pdf p of the mean concentration distribution c we can correspondingly obtain above basic quantities p n p n x μ and σ in statistics cumulants k n of a pdf are similar to moments stuart and ord 2009 chatwin 1972 cumulants can be expressed in terms of central moments or raw moments and vice versa the first few cumulants are 50 k 1 p 1 x μ k 2 p 2 σ k 3 p 3 k 4 p 4 2 p 2 2 moreover we can define skewness and kurtosis by cumulants skewness 51 γ 1 k 3 k 2 3 2 is a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a distribution to its mean while kurtosis or excess kurtosis γ 2 52 γ 2 k 4 k 2 2 is a measure of the outliers of a distribution the tail weight notice that both skewness and kurtosis of gaussian distribution are zero since all its cumulants of order 3 and higher are zero therefore these two quantities are often used to measure the deviation from gaussian distribution jiang and chen 2018 3 3 edgeworth expansion now we can directly apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion edgeworth expansion method to obtain the asymptotic solution of concentration distribution guo et al 2018b with the piecewise cumulants as the expansion coefficients with the assumption of the long time approximation for cumulants chatwin 1972 of pdf p x y t 53 σ o t 1 2 k n t o σ 2 n 2 the edgeworth s series give solution 54 c x y t c 0 e x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x k 4 4 σ 4 he 4 x 10 6 k 3 2 σ 6 he 6 x o σ 3 where x is the standardized variable x x x μ σ and he n x are the chebyshev hermite polynomials 55 he n x 1 n e x 2 2 d n d x n e x 2 2 n 0 1 2 notice that above asymptotic solution of concentration distribution contains the first fourth order cumulants thus such solution can reflect the non gaussian effects like skewness and kurtosis chatwin 1972 similarly we can also apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion for vertical concentration distribution replacing the variables with those with the bar 56 c x t c 0 e x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x k 4 4 σ 4 he 4 x 10 6 k 3 2 σ 6 he 6 x o σ 3 where x is the standardized variable of mean distribution 57 x x x μ σ in addition we can obtain the time dependent environmental dispersivity with respect to mean distribution wang and chen 2017 58 d t t 1 2 d σ d t 4 case study to investigate the solute transport in layered wetlands we consider a 3 layer wetland with dense vegetation smaller porosity ϕ in the first and third layers in comparison simpler 2 layer and 1 layer wetlands with the same mean porosity ϕ are also calculated the porosity distributions of these studied wetlands are listed in fig 2 we consider a uniform and instantaneous release at cross section x 0 then the initial condition can be adopted as 59 c t 0 δ x where δ x is the dirac delta function previous studies wang et al 2014 luo et al 2017 obtained only the environmental dispersivity and corresponding gaussian mean concentration distribution in this work the non gaussian effects of distribution such as skewness and kurtosis are illustrated by means of chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion additionally we also obtain the two dimensional concentration distribution to analyze the dispersion progress in each layer first we calculate the basic parameters of solute transport of these three wetlands see appendix c according to previous studies liu et al 2005 zeng and chen 2011 the important dimensionless parameters are listed in table 1 notice that both the péclet number and vegetation factor of these wetlands vary slightly the deviation of velocity distribution u y momentum transport problem a 12 and dimensionless water phase based velocity u y eq a 18 from of the 3 layer wetland for the other two cases are large as depicted in fig 3 different porosity distributions across layers cause great changes in velocity profiles higher layer porosity smaller shear factor leads to higher velocity additionally as shown in fig 3 a velocity distributions of 3 layer and 2 layer wetlands are piecewise continuous in fig 3 b the jump discontinuity layer interface position y 1 1 3 y 2 2 3 of water phase based velocity u y of 3 layer wetland flow is due to its definition 7 19 i e divided by the discontinuous porosity 4 1 mean concentration distribution as can be seen the layered structure of wetlands leads to great changes in velocity profiles moreover the effective diffusion coefficients are not uniform wetlands of 3 layer and 2 layer in table 1 it will result in different solute dispersion progress in these layered wetlands i e the evolution of mean concentration distribution c first we analyze the basic characteristics i e environmental dispersivity skewness and kurtosis wang and chen 2017 of the mean distribution 4 1 1 environmental dispersivity skewness and kurtosis as shown in fig 4 the layered structure of wetlands results in considerable differences of environmental dispersivities d t eq 58 which represent the dispersion progress comparing the 2 layer and 3 layer wetlands dispersivity of 2 layer one is much greater which means that the 2 layer structure strengthens the dispersion progress while dispersivity of single layer wetland is much smaller one can find the main reason through the water phase based velocity fig 3 b with the variation of porosity distribution the long time asymptotic values of environmental dispersivities are related to the primitive integral of velocity chikwendu 1986 because the total variation of velocity of 3 layer wetland is the largest it leads to strong shear dispersion effects while the variation of velocity of 1 layer wetland flow is minor resulting in small dispersivities however the strong dispersion effects of 3 layer wetland are only in local regions 1 3 y 2 3 because of the low porosity of the second layer the whole shear effects due to the integral of the velocity of 2 layer wetland flows are stronger accordingly the layered structure of wetlands leads to different temporal variation of skewness as well as kurtosis as can be seen in fig 5 as a measure of asymmetry of distribution 51 positive skewness indicates that downstream concentration is fatter more uniform than upstream jiang et al 2017 the skewness of layered wetlands 2 layer and 3 layer differ markedly from that of the single layer wetland while variation of porosity distribution between layers results in minor differences of skewness of the studied 3 layer and 2 layer wetlands the temporal variation of kurtosis which can reflect the outliers of the solute cloud is depicted in fig 5 b similarly the layered structure also leads to great differences of kurtosis between the multi layered and single layer wetlands in the initial stage of solute transport t 0 5 both skewness and kurtosis of these studied cases vary greatly due to the influence of advection then they approach zero with large times which agrees with aris 1956 s long time asymptotic analysis in other words these non gaussian effects can not be neglected in the initial stage of transport chatwin 1970 wu et al 2016 which means that they will lead to considerable modifications to the classic gaussian mean distribution solution these effects are illustrated in the next section 4 1 2 mean distribution to account for above dispersion characteristics and the non gaussian effects like skewness and kurtosis we have derived the asymptotic mean concentration distribution by means of edgeworth expansion 56 as shown in fig 6 the layered structure of wetlands results in fundamentally different longitudinal distribution of mean concentration with greater dispersivities d t layered wetlands 2 layer and 3 layer have much more fatter tailed distribution larger variance than that of the single layer wetland and the distribution of the studied 2 layer wetland is the fattest due to the enhanced dispersion progress by the 2 layer porosity structure in addition the asymmetry of distribution of 3 layer and 1 layer wetlands is strong especially in smaller times in fig 6 a b these three distributions are slightly upstream tailed with positive skewness at the selected times however the distribution of 2 layer wetland becomes symmetric and gaussian more quickly as depicted in fig 6 c d nevertheless even at large times the differences of these curves caused by the layered structure of wetlands are considerable which is consistent with findings by previous studies wang et al 2015 4 2 two dimensional concentration distribution to further explore the impact of the layered structure on contaminant transport in these studied wetlands two dimensional concentration distribution is derived by mean of edgeworth expansion 54 as a heuristic illustration we first discuss density plots of concentration then we define and analyze the layer averaged concentration distribution for each layer as illustrated in fig 7 a b small time and fig 8 a b large time we can see the markedly layered structure of concentration distribution i e the jump discontinuity at the interfaces y 1 1 3 y 2 2 3 this is because of the definition of phase average superficial concentration c 4 with different porosity ϕ of each layer therefore there are interface conditions 11 27 of jump discontinuity of concentration among layers for the 3 layer wetland the porosity of second layer ϕ 2 0 9 is larger than other layers ϕ 1 0 5 ϕ 3 0 7 thus the concentration near the same longitudinal position are higher as depicted in figs 7 a and 8 a for 2 layer wetland it s equivalent that the second layer has higher concentration depicted in figs 7 b and 8 b at small time as illustrated in fig 7 vertical distribution of concentration is highly nonuniform in each layer for 1 layer wetlands local maxima of concentration are found on the boundaries jiang et al 2017 for layered wetlands local maxima are also found on boundaries or interfaces of each layer comparing concentration distributions of 2 layer and 3 layer wetland in fig 7 a b the layered structure variation of porosity distribution can change the positions of local maxima on the boundaries water surface y 1 as well as the values of the maxima since velocity near y 1 of 2 layer wetland are larger the position of maxima on the water surface moves downstream faster while at the bottom y 0 the velocities of these two cases are the same so their position of maxima are nearly the same and moves upstream together at lager time as illustrated in fig 8 the non uniformity of vertical distribution in the initial stage of transport fig 7 decreases finally in each layer for simple 1 layer wetlands the vertical concentration distribution gradually approaches to uniformity due to the dispersion progress wu and chen 2014b jiang et al 2017 it s also true for every layer of the layered wetlands however the whole vertical concentration distribution is not uniform because of the jump discontinuity at the interfaces as discussed above concentration distributions of each layer in layered wetlands are considerably different actually with the two dimensional concentration distribution 54 we can analyze the solute transport in each layer first we define mean operation on each layer for concentration distribution 60 c i 1 y i y i 1 y i 1 y i c x y t d y i 1 2 n we denote c i as the layer averaged concentration distribution of the i th layer in 3 layer wetland as depicted in fig 9 layers with different porosity result in differences of layer averaged concentration distributions accordingly in the initial stage of transport fig 9 a b the distribution of each layer is markedly skewed because shear dispersion effect due to advection is stronger than vertical diffusion thus the variation of velocity profile in fig 3 leads to great deviation of the expected value expectation of layer averaged distributions from mean distribution at large times fig 9 c d concentration distribution approaches to uniformity in each layer as discussed above which is due to the vertical diffusion therefore all the layer averaged distributions tend to be gaussian normal distribution the divergence of the center of these distributions decreases accordingly the discussion of the 2 layer wetland is similar 5 conclusions previous studies chen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 luo et al 2017 of superficial solute transport in layered wetland focused only on the gaussian longitudinal distribution of mean concentration with environmental dispersivity as the variance this work investigates the complete spatial concentration distribution after combining governing equations of different layers into a typical advection diffusion equation with variable parameters piecewise functions chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic technique is applied to obtain the two dimensional longitudinal and vertical concentration distribution the non gaussian distribution effects of skewness and kurtosis of are also included in the asymptotic expansion of mean distribution three wetlands of different number of layers 1 to 3 but with same mean porosity are studied to illustrate the impact of layered structure on solute transport the layered structure of wetlands leads to great changes in velocity profiles together with the different effective diffusion coefficients they result in significantly different evolution of mean concentration distribution characterized by environmental dispersivity skewness and kurtosis the layered structure can be seen markedly through jump discontinuity at the interfaces in two dimensional concentration distribution in each layer vertical distribution of concentration is highly nonuniform in the initial stage of solute transport additionally layers with different porosity result in essential difference between layer averaged concentrations of which all tend to be normally distributed at last declarations of interest none acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

6757,a general analytical procedure based on phase averaged formulation is presented in this work to investigate environmental dispersion in layered wetland based on concentration moments chatwin s long time asymptotic technique is applied to describe both the longitudinal distribution of the depth averaged concentration and the two dimensional concentration field including their longitudinal non gaussian effects of skewness and kurtosis three wetlands of equal depth averaged porosity but with different number of layers are studied to illustrate the impact of layered structure on solute transport the layered structure of wetlands leads to great changes in velocity profiles and evolution of environmental dispersivity skewness and kurtosis of depth averaged concentration distribution in each layer vertical distribution of concentration is highly nonuniform in the initial stage of transport layers with different porosity result in essential difference between layer averaged concentrations of which all tend to be normally distributed keywords solute transport environmental dispersion layered wetland 1 introduction solute transport in wetland is a basic issue of water quality since wetland plays an environmentally important role in water purification ecological restoration shoreline stability and many others costanza et al 1989 costanza et al 1997 wetland is a unique hydrological feature of the landscape and are essential for sustainable urban development mitsch and gosselink 2015 carvalho et al 2009 linder et al 1994 research on hydrological processes of solute transport in wetland also known as hydraulic dispersion or environmental dispersion can advance the physical understanding of wetland management and ecological functions of wetland zeng and chen 2011 wu et al 2011 much research has explored solute transport in wetland the presence of vegetation leads to complex flow and mass transport at multiple scales such as stem scale canopy scale and cross section scale of wetland channel ghisalberti and nepf 2002 zeng et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 to characterize such transport phenomena the basic model of taylor dispersion taylor 1954 taylor 1953 provides a fundamental tool of simplification which performs average over some scales and obtains the corresponding dispersion coefficients for emergent vegetation many laboratory measurements and simulations huai et al 2015 sonnenwald et al 2017 have been carried out to study the flow structure and lateral environmental dispersivity with respect to the width scale of wetland channel while for submerged vegetation researchers focus on vertical environmental dispersivity with respect to the height scale nepf 2012 luhar et al 2013 to systematically study the transport process in wetland chen et al 2010 used phase average method rajagopal and tao 1995 liu et al 2005 to deal with both the lateral and vertical environmental dispersivities by smearing out the discontinuity between water and vegetation phases zeng and chen 2009 together with aris moment analysis aris 1956 aris 1960 fischer 1972 they have obtained the gaussian cross sectional averaged concentration distribution zeng and chen 2011 and captured temporal evolution of the environmental dispersivity recently based on phase average method other analytical approaches such as multi scale perturbation analysis ng and yip 2001 wu et al 2011 paul and mazumder 2011 gill 1967 s generalized dispersion model jiang et al 2017 wang and huai 2018 gauss hermite expansion wang and chen 2017 have also been applied to solute transport in wetland typically wetlands have multiple layers such as heterogeneity of vegetation distribution especially the submerge vegetation soil substrate gravel bed małoszewski et al 2006 nepf 2012 chen et al 2012 many studies have explored solute transport in such layered wetland nepf et al 2007 used a two box canopy model to describe the vertical transport in submerged aquatic canopies murphy et al 2007 proposed a two zone layer model to characterize dispersion processes under submerged vegetation and discussed the influence of the relative submergence shucksmith et al 2010 applied chikwendu 1986 s n zone layer model to obtained the environmental dispersivity and verified the results of open channel flow with natural vegetation by experiments shucksmith et al 2011 based on the phase average transport equation chen et al 2012 obtained the analytical solution of the moments equation of a two layer wetland flow similarly wang et al 2013 extended such moments analysis to a three layer wetland while recently luo et al 2017 consider the impact of wind effect li et al 2017 on environmental dispersion in two layer wetland and wang et al 2018 discuss the three layer wetland other classic methods on solute transport such as generalized dispersion model has also been applied to layered wetland wang et al 2014 in addition similar to multi layer wetland solute transport in wetland flow dominated by wall bank effects with multiple zones with different plants in zones has also been investigated wu et al 2011 chen 2013 wang et al 2015 luo et al 2016 however above studies on solute transport in layered wetland using phase average method only discussed the depth averaged concentration distribution in fact vertical concentration distribution is an important issue for practical purpose such as residence time distributions hart et al 2016 critical length of solute cloud shao et al 2014 especially in wetland with layered structure due to heterogeneity of vegetation distribution soils and etc in open channel flow wu and chen 2014a demonstrated the slow decaying transient effect of variation of the vertical concentration due to the non uniform velocity zeng et al 2015 for single layer wetland flow recent studies wu et al 2015 fu et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 reached the same conclusion on the non uniformity of vertical distribution therefore it is necessary to discuss the vertical distribution in layered wetland moreover recent work jiang et al 2017 also captured the skewed depth averaged concentration distribution chatwin 1970 of solute transport in single layer wetland while previous studies chen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 luo et al 2017 about layered wetland only obtained the gaussian distribution with environmental dispersivity as the variance in fact chatwin 1970 showed that the non gaussian distribution effects such as skewness the measure of asymmetry and kurtosis excess kurtosis the comparison to the gaussian distribution are remarkable in the initial stage of solute transport andersson and berglin 1981 aminian et al 2016 experimentally and numerically studied the anomalous dispersion effects skewed distribution due to different cross sections of ducts in wetland flow the time scale of diffusion with respect to advection is large small péclet number huang et al 2008 chen et al 2010 guo et al 2018a thus the initial stage of solute transport is fairly long murphy et al 2007 experimentally revealed the deviation of depth averaged distribution from gaussian distribution therefore there is a need to capture such anomalous dispersion in layered wetland to investigate the complete solute transport in layered wetland this work obtains the two dimensional concentration distribution using chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic technique based on the phase average transport model through asymptotic expansion the non gaussian distribution effects of skewness and kurtosis of depth averaged distribution are also included for simplicity the governing equations of different layers are combined into one typical advection diffusion equation with variable parameters piecewise functions for the whole layered wetland next we obtain the coefficients of the series expansion of concentration distribution by solving the equations of spatial moments of concentration finally we study wetlands of different number of layers but with same depth averaged porosity as an illustration of the impact of the layered structure on solute transport 2 formulation for solute transport in layered wetland for solute transport in a layered wetland as depicted in fig 1 previous studies chen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 luo et al 2017 constructed governing equations for each layer which is cumbersome here we combine the equations of different layers into a typical advection diffusion equation with variable parameters piecewise functions firstly we consider a simple wetland of only one layer using phase average method the general advection diffusion equation for superficial solute transport can be adopted as liu et al 2005 chen et al 2010 1 ϕ c w t u c w κ λ ϕ c w κ k c w where ϕ is porosity dimensionless t is time s c w is water phase based superficial concentration kg m 3 u is superficial velocity m s 1 κ is tortuosity accounting for the spatial structure of vegetation dimensionless λ is concentration diffusivity m 2 s 1 and k is concentration dispersivity tensor m 2 s 1 notice that superscript denote the dimensional quantities for simplicity we assume ϕ λ κ and k are constant k is a diagonal matrix with components k x and k y for the unidirectional wetland flow eq 1 reduces to 2 ϕ c w t u y c w x κ λ ϕ k x 2 c w x 2 κ λ ϕ k y 2 c w y 2 where x is the longitudinal coordinate y is the vertical coordinate rewrite

of the i th i n 1 interface of layer is y i let 5 s face y 1 y 2 y n 1 be the set of these positions we also denote y 0 0 and y n h for convenience immediately we can extend the governing eq 3 for a one layer wetland to that for a multi layer wetland with variable parameters 6 c t u y c x d x y 2 c x 2 d y y 2 c y 2 0 y h y s face where water phase based velocity u y now is a piecewise function 7

condition can be adopted as 13 c t 0 c ini x y since the amount of released substance 14 q 0 h c ini x y d x d y is finite there are upstream and downstream conditions 15 c x c x 0 next we introduce dimensionless parameters at first we use bracket to denote the depth averaged mean hereafter use mean for short of a quantity e g 16 u 1 h 0 h u y d y 1 h i 1 n y i 1 y i u y d y is the mean velocity notice that such integral is riemann integral of the piecewise function particularly the mean of longitudinal dispersivity 17 d x 1 h i 1 n d xi y i y i 1 1 h i 1 n λ k xi ϕ i y i y i 1 and the mean vertical dispersivity 18 d y 1 h i 1 n d yi y i y i 1 1 h i 1 n λ k yi ϕ i y i y i 1 now we can introduce the dimensionless parameters analogous to the case of a single layer wetland zeng et al 2011

and chen 2014b notice that d y y is still a piecewise function 20 d y y d yi κ i d y λ k yi ϕ i y i 1 y y i i 1 2 n and the mean of new variables are 21 u 0 1 u y d y 0 d y 0 1 d y y d y 1 let 22 s face y 1 y 2 y n 1 be the set of dimensionless positions of interfaces finally the whole problem can be recast into 23 c t u y c x d x y pe 2 2 c x 2 d y y 2 c y 2 0 y 1 y s face 24 c y y 0 c y y 1 0 25 c t 0 c ini x y 26 c x 0 27 c ϕ i y y i c ϕ i 1 y y i i 1 2 n 1 28 d y y c y y y i d y y c y y y i i 1 2 n 1 hereafter we use the bar to denote the variables related to the mean concentration distribution c and 29 c c before solving the whole problem 23 of solute transport in layered wetlands we need to obtain the water phase based velocity u y the solution of velocity u y of the two zone and three layered wetlands have been derived by wu et al 2011 and wang et al 2013 respectively for multi layered wetlands we combine the momentum transport equations of different layers into a typical one with variable parameters to be consistent with above advection diffusion eq 6 see appendix a 3 method and solution for environmental dispersion we have extended the governing equation of solute transport for one layer wetlands 3 to that for multi layer wetlands 23 with variable parameters such as velocity and dispersivity therefore we can apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion edgeworth expansion directly to obtain both the one dimensional distribution of the mean concentration and the two dimensional field of spatial concentration firstly we solve the equation for spatial moments of concentration then we obtain the coefficients of the expansion in terms of cumulants of concentration distribution 3 1 spatial moments of concentration distribution the spatial moments of concentration distribution are defined as aris 1956 30 c n y t x n c x y t d x n 0 1 and moments of mean distribution 31 c n t x n c d x c n n 0 1 using these definitions with the assumption aris 1956 that concentration decays exponentially as x eq 23 gives barton 1983 32 c n t d y y 2 c n y 2 n n 1 d x y pe 2 c n 2 nu y c n 1 y s face n 0 1 where c 1 c 2 0 the boundary conditions are 33 c n y y 0 c n y y 1 0 n 0 1 and the initial conditions are 34 c n t 0 c ini x y d x n 0 1 interface conditions give 35 c n ϕ i y y i c n ϕ i 1 y y i i 1 2 n 1 n 0 1 36 d y y c n y y y i d y y c n y y y i i 1 2 n 1 n 0 1 notice that c n y t are also piecewise functions to solve concentration moments c n we consider the following associated eigenvalue problem 37 d y y 2 ψ y 2 β ψ 38 d ψ d y y 0 d ψ d y y 1 0 39 ψ ϕ i y y i ψ ϕ i 1 y y i i 1 2 n 1 40 d y y ψ y y y i d y y ψ y y y i i 1 2 n 1 where β is eigenvalue and ψ y is the corresponding eigenfunction the solution of above problem give a discrete set of eigenvalue β j j 1 and corresponding eigenfunctions ψ j y j 1 shown in appendix b notice that each eigenfunction is also piecewise 41 ψ j y ψ ji y i 1 y y i i 1 2 n j 1 2 finally using the integral transform technique the solution of c n y t can be represented by the expansion 42 c n y t j 1 b nj t ψ j y n 0 1 detailed solutions of coefficients b nj t can be found in barton 1983 s work immediately we can obtain the mean concentration 43 c n t j 1 b nj t ψ j y n 0 1 3 2 cumulants skewness and kurtosis the coefficients of edgeworth expansion are related to cumulants of distribution which are basic quantities alternative to the moments in probability theory moreover skewness and kurtosis are introduced to capture the non gaussian concentration distribution first we obtain probability density function pdf p x y t with respect to x from the longitudinal concentration distribution c x y t by normalization 44 p x y t c x y t c 0 y t similarly the pdf p x t of mean concentration is 45 p x t c x t c 0 t notice that p x t is not necessarily equal to p x y t the n th raw moments of pdf are 46 p n y t x n p x y t d x c n c 0 n 0 1 the central moments of pdf can be defined as 47 p n y t x p 1 n p x y t d x n 0 1 particularly we use x μ to denote the mean expected value 48 x μ y t p 1 y t and σ the standard deviation variance 49 σ y t p 2 y t as for pdf p of the mean concentration distribution c we can correspondingly obtain above basic quantities p n p n x μ and σ in statistics cumulants k n of a pdf are similar to moments stuart and ord 2009 chatwin 1972 cumulants can be expressed in terms of central moments or raw moments and vice versa the first few cumulants are 50 k 1 p 1 x μ k 2 p 2 σ k 3 p 3 k 4 p 4 2 p 2 2 moreover we can define skewness and kurtosis by cumulants skewness 51 γ 1 k 3 k 2 3 2 is a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a distribution to its mean while kurtosis or excess kurtosis γ 2 52 γ 2 k 4 k 2 2 is a measure of the outliers of a distribution the tail weight notice that both skewness and kurtosis of gaussian distribution are zero since all its cumulants of order 3 and higher are zero therefore these two quantities are often used to measure the deviation from gaussian distribution jiang and chen 2018 3 3 edgeworth expansion now we can directly apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion edgeworth expansion method to obtain the asymptotic solution of concentration distribution guo et al 2018b with the piecewise cumulants as the expansion coefficients with the assumption of the long time approximation for cumulants chatwin 1972 of pdf p x y t 53 σ o t 1 2 k n t o σ 2 n 2 the edgeworth s series give solution 54 c x y t c 0 e x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x k 4 4 σ 4 he 4 x 10 6 k 3 2 σ 6 he 6 x o σ 3 where x is the standardized variable x x x μ σ and he n x are the chebyshev hermite polynomials 55 he n x 1 n e x 2 2 d n d x n e x 2 2 n 0 1 2 notice that above asymptotic solution of concentration distribution contains the first fourth order cumulants thus such solution can reflect the non gaussian effects like skewness and kurtosis chatwin 1972 similarly we can also apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion for vertical concentration distribution replacing the variables with those with the bar 56 c x t c 0 e x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x k 4 4 σ 4 he 4 x 10 6 k 3 2 σ 6 he 6 x o σ 3 where x is the standardized variable of mean distribution 57 x x x μ σ in addition we can obtain the time dependent environmental dispersivity with respect to mean distribution wang and chen 2017 58 d t t 1 2 d σ d t 4 case study to investigate the solute transport in layered wetlands we consider a 3 layer wetland with dense vegetation smaller porosity ϕ in the first and third layers in comparison simpler 2 layer and 1 layer wetlands with the same mean porosity ϕ are also calculated the porosity distributions of these studied wetlands are listed in fig 2 we consider a uniform and instantaneous release at cross section x 0 then the initial condition can be adopted as 59 c t 0 δ x where δ x is the dirac delta function previous studies wang et al 2014 luo et al 2017 obtained only the environmental dispersivity and corresponding gaussian mean concentration distribution in this work the non gaussian effects of distribution such as skewness and kurtosis are illustrated by means of chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion additionally we also obtain the two dimensional concentration distribution to analyze the dispersion progress in each layer first we calculate the basic parameters of solute transport of these three wetlands see appendix c according to previous studies liu et al 2005 zeng and chen 2011 the important dimensionless parameters are listed in table 1 notice that both the péclet number and vegetation factor of these wetlands vary slightly the deviation of velocity distribution u y momentum transport problem a 12 and dimensionless water phase based velocity u y eq a 18 from of the 3 layer wetland for the other two cases are large as depicted in fig 3 different porosity distributions across layers cause great changes in velocity profiles higher layer porosity smaller shear factor leads to higher velocity additionally as shown in fig 3 a velocity distributions of 3 layer and 2 layer wetlands are piecewise continuous in fig 3 b the jump discontinuity layer interface position y 1 1 3 y 2 2 3 of water phase based velocity u y of 3 layer wetland flow is due to its definition 7 19 i e divided by the discontinuous porosity 4 1 mean concentration distribution as can be seen the layered structure of wetlands leads to great changes in velocity profiles moreover the effective diffusion coefficients are not uniform wetlands of 3 layer and 2 layer in table 1 it will result in different solute dispersion progress in these layered wetlands i e the evolution of mean concentration distribution c first we analyze the basic characteristics i e environmental dispersivity skewness and kurtosis wang and chen 2017 of the mean distribution 4 1 1 environmental dispersivity skewness and kurtosis as shown in fig 4 the layered structure of wetlands results in considerable differences of environmental dispersivities d t eq 58 which represent the dispersion progress comparing the 2 layer and 3 layer wetlands dispersivity of 2 layer one is much greater which means that the 2 layer structure strengthens the dispersion progress while dispersivity of single layer wetland is much smaller one can find the main reason through the water phase based velocity fig 3 b with the variation of porosity distribution the long time asymptotic values of environmental dispersivities are related to the primitive integral of velocity chikwendu 1986 because the total variation of velocity of 3 layer wetland is the largest it leads to strong shear dispersion effects while the variation of velocity of 1 layer wetland flow is minor resulting in small dispersivities however the strong dispersion effects of 3 layer wetland are only in local regions 1 3 y 2 3 because of the low porosity of the second layer the whole shear effects due to the integral of the velocity of 2 layer wetland flows are stronger accordingly the layered structure of wetlands leads to different temporal variation of skewness as well as kurtosis as can be seen in fig 5 as a measure of asymmetry of distribution 51 positive skewness indicates that downstream concentration is fatter more uniform than upstream jiang et al 2017 the skewness of layered wetlands 2 layer and 3 layer differ markedly from that of the single layer wetland while variation of porosity distribution between layers results in minor differences of skewness of the studied 3 layer and 2 layer wetlands the temporal variation of kurtosis which can reflect the outliers of the solute cloud is depicted in fig 5 b similarly the layered structure also leads to great differences of kurtosis between the multi layered and single layer wetlands in the initial stage of solute transport t 0 5 both skewness and kurtosis of these studied cases vary greatly due to the influence of advection then they approach zero with large times which agrees with aris 1956 s long time asymptotic analysis in other words these non gaussian effects can not be neglected in the initial stage of transport chatwin 1970 wu et al 2016 which means that they will lead to considerable modifications to the classic gaussian mean distribution solution these effects are illustrated in the next section 4 1 2 mean distribution to account for above dispersion characteristics and the non gaussian effects like skewness and kurtosis we have derived the asymptotic mean concentration distribution by means of edgeworth expansion 56 as shown in fig 6 the layered structure of wetlands results in fundamentally different longitudinal distribution of mean concentration with greater dispersivities d t layered wetlands 2 layer and 3 layer have much more fatter tailed distribution larger variance than that of the single layer wetland and the distribution of the studied 2 layer wetland is the fattest due to the enhanced dispersion progress by the 2 layer porosity structure in addition the asymmetry of distribution of 3 layer and 1 layer wetlands is strong especially in smaller times in fig 6 a b these three distributions are slightly upstream tailed with positive skewness at the selected times however the distribution of 2 layer wetland becomes symmetric and gaussian more quickly as depicted in fig 6 c d nevertheless even at large times the differences of these curves caused by the layered structure of wetlands are considerable which is consistent with findings by previous studies wang et al 2015 4 2 two dimensional concentration distribution to further explore the impact of the layered structure on contaminant transport in these studied wetlands two dimensional concentration distribution is derived by mean of edgeworth expansion 54 as a heuristic illustration we first discuss density plots of concentration then we define and analyze the layer averaged concentration distribution for each layer as illustrated in fig 7 a b small time and fig 8 a b large time we can see the markedly layered structure of concentration distribution i e the jump discontinuity at the interfaces y 1 1 3 y 2 2 3 this is because of the definition of phase average superficial concentration c 4 with different porosity ϕ of each layer therefore there are interface conditions 11 27 of jump discontinuity of concentration among layers for the 3 layer wetland the porosity of second layer ϕ 2 0 9 is larger than other layers ϕ 1 0 5 ϕ 3 0 7 thus the concentration near the same longitudinal position are higher as depicted in figs 7 a and 8 a for 2 layer wetland it s equivalent that the second layer has higher concentration depicted in figs 7 b and 8 b at small time as illustrated in fig 7 vertical distribution of concentration is highly nonuniform in each layer for 1 layer wetlands local maxima of concentration are found on the boundaries jiang et al 2017 for layered wetlands local maxima are also found on boundaries or interfaces of each layer comparing concentration distributions of 2 layer and 3 layer wetland in fig 7 a b the layered structure variation of porosity distribution can change the positions of local maxima on the boundaries water surface y 1 as well as the values of the maxima since velocity near y 1 of 2 layer wetland are larger the position of maxima on the water surface moves downstream faster while at the bottom y 0 the velocities of these two cases are the same so their position of maxima are nearly the same and moves upstream together at lager time as illustrated in fig 8 the non uniformity of vertical distribution in the initial stage of transport fig 7 decreases finally in each layer for simple 1 layer wetlands the vertical concentration distribution gradually approaches to uniformity due to the dispersion progress wu and chen 2014b jiang et al 2017 it s also true for every layer of the layered wetlands however the whole vertical concentration distribution is not uniform because of the jump discontinuity at the interfaces as discussed above concentration distributions of each layer in layered wetlands are considerably different actually with the two dimensional concentration distribution 54 we can analyze the solute transport in each layer first we define mean operation on each layer for concentration distribution 60 c i 1 y i y i 1 y i 1 y i c x y t d y i 1 2 n we denote c i as the layer averaged concentration distribution of the i th layer in 3 layer wetland as depicted in fig 9 layers with different porosity result in differences of layer averaged concentration distributions accordingly in the initial stage of transport fig 9 a b the distribution of each layer is markedly skewed because shear dispersion effect due to advection is stronger than vertical diffusion thus the variation of velocity profile in fig 3 leads to great deviation of the expected value expectation of layer averaged distributions from mean distribution at large times fig 9 c d concentration distribution approaches to uniformity in each layer as discussed above which is due to the vertical diffusion therefore all the layer averaged distributions tend to be gaussian normal distribution the divergence of the center of these distributions decreases accordingly the discussion of the 2 layer wetland is similar 5 conclusions previous studies chen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 luo et al 2017 of superficial solute transport in layered wetland focused only on the gaussian longitudinal distribution of mean concentration with environmental dispersivity as the variance this work investigates the complete spatial concentration distribution after combining governing equations of different layers into a typical advection diffusion equation with variable parameters piecewise functions chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic technique is applied to obtain the two dimensional longitudinal and vertical concentration distribution the non gaussian distribution effects of skewness and kurtosis of are also included in the asymptotic expansion of mean distribution three wetlands of different number of layers 1 to 3 but with same mean porosity are studied to illustrate the impact of layered structure on solute transport the layered structure of wetlands leads to great changes in velocity profiles together with the different effective diffusion coefficients they result in significantly different evolution of mean concentration distribution characterized by environmental dispersivity skewness and kurtosis the layered structure can be seen markedly through jump discontinuity at the interfaces in two dimensional concentration distribution in each layer vertical distribution of concentration is highly nonuniform in the initial stage of solute transport additionally layers with different porosity result in essential difference between layer averaged

6758,drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system the vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency the existing water management policy framework and its implementation the standardized drought vulnerability index sdvi is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system incorporating precipitation patterns the supply and demand trends and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability this work attempts to evolve the sdvi by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information at the same time it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept the new framework is applied in the south platte basin within colorado on the 2012 summer drought july september the proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers sdvi could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts thus it is believed that the sdvi could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions allowing for a more integrated management approach keywords drought drought vulnerability drought impacts sdvi water resources south platte 1 introduction drought is a recurrent natural phenomenon aggressive in many areas around the world defying their normal climatic conditions kiem et al 2016 it has diachronically manifested its existence in almost every place and culture by affecting social and economic welfare usually to a significant extent damages due to drought can be costlier than any other natural hazard loucks 2006 early on rosenberg 1980 stresses that vulnerability to drought in one water user group has a ripple effect to the society at large further recent evidence on this is the increased prices of agricultural products due to shortages attributed to the drought of 2011 2012 in the us grigg 2014 the combining effects of increased water demands and climate change impacts will further stress our ability to cope with droughts in the future mishra et al 2015 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the drought nature characteristics and impacts have continuously drawn the attention of the scientific community the state and federal entities as well as the general public resulting in the production of a rich menu of drought literature that mostly provides crucial information on its parameters and management strategies cancelliere et al 2005 fontane and frevert 1995 grigg 2014 grigg and vlachos 1993 hagman et al 1984 karavitis 1992 1998 karavitis et al 2012a 2015a 2015b loukas and vasiliades 2004 playán et al 2013 pulwarty and maia 2015 rosenberg 1978 1980 traore and fontane 2007 vasiliades and loukas 2009 vlachos 1982 wilhite 2004 zarch et al 2015 oikonomou et al 2018 wang et al 2016a drought is a dynamic creeping phenomenon without a definition that may be widely accepted as such its holistic description is very demanding consequently when a drought occurs is seemingly difficult to confront it being a non event in other words the absence of enough water bordi et al 2006 eriyagama et al 2009 karavitis 1999 karavitis et al 2014 yevjevich et al 1983 since drought characterization is a difficult task numerous indices have been developed and some are used quite frequently the standardized precipitation index spi developed by mckee et al 1993 and the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 serve as two of the most widely used ones furthermore some more recently established indices focus on examining drought within a different context such as the reconnaissance drought index tsakiris et al 2006 tsakiris and vangelis 2005 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index vicente serrano et al 2010 and the multivariate drought index rajsekhar et al 2015 whereas other more complex ones are referring directly or indirectly to vulnerability and water scarcity concepts jain et al 2015 karavitis et al 2014 sullivan 2002 vargas and paneque 2017 the concept of vulnerability to drought is very challenging to be accurately presented due to a disciplinary and or individually based series of interpretations gallopín 2006 thywissen 2006 and manyena 2006 also provide extensive lists of various definitions of vulnerability nevertheless the vulnerability concept mostly refers to the components affecting both a system s capacity to cope and its potential to be harmed and it is strongly influenced by a plethora of factors cardona et al 2012 jain et al 2015 karavitis et al 2014 turner et al 2003 defines vulnerability as the likelihood to experience harm due to exposure to hazard and encompasses exposure sensitivity and resilience to the concept according to ipcc vulnerability is defined as the propensity or the predisposition to be adversely affected and is the result of diverse historical social economic political cultural institutional natural resource and environmental conditions and processes lavell et al 2012 under this framework vulnerability the natural hazard and the exposure to it are related through the risk of an extreme event the vulnerability term could also be expressed as a function of two variables namely hazard and impacts karavitis et al 2014 which is adopted in the current effort in this respect without a disaster or a system in stress hazard there is no vulnerability furthermore it is difficult to exactly estimate the magnitude and duration of the hazard in time and space so as to exactly point out when a system s resilience threshold is exceeded or the ability of a system to cope with drought is collapsed karavitis et al 2014 vargas and paneque 2017 the vulnerability magnitude of various areas to that particular hazard depends on their exposure to water deficiency and to the existing water management policy framework implementation karavitis 2012 focusing on drought vulnerability the most pivotal contributing factors among others are rainfall patterns supply and demand trends both in the natural and anthropogenic scene along with the socioeconomic context societal drought vulnerability is affected by water demand therefore socio economic development in many parts of the world could be disrupted due to occurring supply deficits water demand deficits may increase due to supply failures or sudden changes in land use patterns i e increased irrigation requirements or urgent population needs defries and eshleman 2004 also early on it was pointed out that infrastructure status along with access to technology affect vulnerability levels rosenberg 1980 for example efficient irrigation practices could counterbalance some of the effects of drought events under such conditions some regions are more vulnerable than others and vulnerability is a fully dynamic phenomenon complying with the changes that emerge in the various systems adger 2006 eakin and luers 2006 o brien et al 2004 o brien and leichenko 2001 despite the abundance of environmental information drought impacts and the factors contributing to systems vulnerability are scarcely reported bachmair et al 2016 blauhut et al 2015 2016 even in developed states grigg 2014 underlines the eluding nature of drought impacts since they could occur in different ways times and places drought assessments are generally characterized by fragmentation and lack of synthesis thus failing to give an integrated perspective of impacts dow 2010 grigg 2014 maia et al 2015 at the same time impact data gathered by the relevant authorities are usually not very detailed and have a coarse spatial scale since they are often aggregated duncan et al 2015 argue that drought planning and management can be benefited by a high spatial resolution analysis since climatic and morphological conditions e g rainfall patterns plains mountainous chains may not be spotted in a regional analysis likewise factors affecting vulnerability to drought vary spatially such as demand and supply patterns infrastructure efficiency etc therefore drought vulnerability assessment in high spatial resolution could serve as an additional water resources management tool informing managers and planners on an area for priority actions the employment of indicators and indices is a common practice for describing complex phenomena and concepts the standardized drought vulnerability index sdvi was conceived as an integrated approach for assessing drought vulnerability karavitis et al 2014 with a multi component drought vulnerability characterization based on a classification system it was produced during the drought management centre in southeastern europe dmcsee project karavitis et al 2011 2012b 2014 the present effort is attempting to surpass some of the sdvi s earlier application limitations and assess the information improvement provided by the integration of satellite data in the calculation of sdvi this is accomplished by introducing a more transparent data rigorous methodology that replaces qualitative information with more quantitative data the enhancement of the sdvi to accurately depict occurring conditions in space and time is essential for the index utilization as an efficient timely and effective decision making tool in water resources planning and management under drought conditions better understanding of the vulnerability to drought and its different contributing components could convey drought information for mitigation and adaptation strategies to decision makers in a more holistic manner hence avoiding at the same time existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of reported impacts the 2012 summer drought affected a large portion of the us including a large part of the state of colorado and it was one of the driest periods ever recorded grigg 2014 noaa drought task force 2013 wang et al 2016c thus it was selected as the study event for this effort by expansion such a methodology may be introduced in less data rich environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the south platte river basin located at the northeast corner of colorado fig 1 a has total area of 49 000 km2 dennehy et al 1993 while its total population is estimated approximately at 3 700 000 inhabitants 70 of state s population colorado department of local affairs 2016 it is a semi arid basin with average annual precipitation of about 400 mm according to mckee et al 2000 the basin s climate in the mountainous region is wet during december april and dry in june and august october while the lower section is dry from november february and wet from april july the dependence on snow accumulation during the winter months is significant since it serves as a natural storage for the basin to meet the demands during the summer period along with several manmade storage structures the south platte is a highly developed basin with various competing and conflicting water demands oikonomou et al 2018 the agricultural sector is the largest water user and among the traditional water uses in the basin there is also relative high water demand for unconventional energy development oikonomou et al 2015a b 2016 the 2010 irrigated parcels spatial extent is shown in fig 1a with dark green color and their estimated total area was 3426 km2 846 634 acres colorado decision support systems 2016 colorado has faced the impacts of droughts several times during the 20th century mckee et al 2000 and most recently the 2002 and 2012 drought events during the 2012drought colorado experienced severe impacts resulting to damages of approximately 409 million in agricultural revenue pritchett et al 2013 thus the july august and september period of 2012 drought event was selected as a representative time frame for the application of vulnerability assessment in the south platte basin since it also includes the vegetation s growth season in addition the projected climate conditions in the basin suggest an increase in the severity of future droughts colorado water conservation board et al 2013 which makes well planned management strategies for coping with drought and mitigating its impacts even more imperative 2 2 the standardized drought vulnerability index the sdvi is a composite index that aims at providing an integrated estimation of drought vulnerability based on four drought manifestations namely meteorological hydrological social and economic karavitis et al 2014 the sdvi is comprised of six components eq 1 the 6 and 12 month standardized precipitation index spi demand supply infrastructure and impacts which capture the aforementioned drought manifestations and may complement each other more specifically the 6 month spi and 12 month spi describing the precipitation anomaly from normal conditions represent the hazard risk element the 6 month spi is capturing more accurately the seasonal variation thus may display water availability during the crop growing season especially for rain fed crops karavitis et al 2014 on the other hand the 12 month spi captures long term drought periods and thus it may reflect the urban tourism industrial reservoir storage and hydropower water availability karavitis et al 2014 as it is also depicted in other studies sullivan et al 2003 2009 sullivan 2011 sullivan and meigh 2007 a region with high positive spi values may still display high drought vulnerability conditions if it lacks the necessary water infrastructure and the corresponding water resources management framework the remaining four components demand supply infrastructure and socio economic inflicted drought damages represent the impact description in the vulnerability concept as described in the previous section hence the index s components describe both the effects of the precipitation deficits or surplus and the response conditions within the regions of interest those six index parameters are classified into four vulnerability categories labelled 0 to 3 according to their performance table 1 which is the product of extensive pertinent literature review and expert opinion categorization karavitis et al 2014 tsesmelis 2017 1 s d v i f s p i 6 s p i 12 d e m a n d s u p p l y i n f r a s t r u c t u r e i m p a c t s the vulnerability to drought is calculated using eq 2 karavitis et al 2014 which infers that the six sdvi components ci are of equal importance that particular technique has been chosen since it is most often applied in the development of composite indicators despite the pitfall for some components to be over or under estimated oecd and european commission 2008 furthermore assigning weights on the components of a complex phenomenon could be misleading with unfounded premises in addition an effort to assess the uncertainty caused by different weighting methods on the sdvi tsesmelis 2017 concluded that the equal weighting method is having similar results when compared to the more complex weighing forms of the sdvi finally the computed sdvi values are categorized into six classes of vulnerability as demarcated in table 2 2 s d v i 1 n i 1 n c i w h e r e n 6 2 3 index adjustment and data the sdvi application in the south platte basin is the first outside the geographical area of southeast europe see where it was developed and first tested the fact that see has a variety of climatic conditions and levels of socio economic development makes it suitable for developing a non geographically bounded index at the same time the various countries 11 in total of the see region follow different data standards and thus detailed space and time information is lacking which creates significant data challenges information for the index components at a basin or sub basin scale except from precipitation data may not reveal local variations of drought vulnerability levels furthermore a key limitation of previous applications is the static representation of the impacts component its estimation is based on the monetary yield loss annual representation which distorts the monthly calculation of the index lastly the ecosystem as well as the secondary socio economic impacts in see were not considered due to lack of dependable data the increasing amount of available in situ datasets especially in north america along with the employment of good quality remote sensing information gives the opportunity to reconsider the way the index was applied karavitis et al 2015a in this context the revision of the sdvi for the south platte basin application is an effort to overcome the most of the aforementioned limitations and establish a framework of index calculation transparency karavitis et al 2015a oikonomou 2017 oikonomou and waskom 2018 fig 2 outlines data integration procedure for the index space time calculation the datasets used for each sdvi component are shown in table 3 and described in detail below information from the datasets used was not available for a long enough common period although that might introduce some bias it was chosen to utilize the longest available period with good quality data for each data set thus the effect of the different periods would have less impact on the results the index is a composite one based on individual parameters estimation different spatial resolutions were chosen for the different parameters in order to have the most detailed representation based on the available information it is believed that more detailed and longer data sets periods will improve the representation of the components and will lead in having less error for the added values in the sdvi calculation the inclusion of higher resolution spatiotemporal datasets in the calculation of the index offers new capabilities of examining local vulnerability variations and allows comparison of adjacent areas the proposed holistic impact representation framework could help depict impacts extent and magnitude in a non fragmented way and thus increase the insight gained 2 3 1 standardized precipitation index the values of spi 6 and spi 12 are computed on point scale for every available meteorological station with the required data in this context monthly precipitation records from 24 meteorological stations fig 1b and table 4 with at least a 50 year record 1963 2012 were retrieved from the noaa s regional climate centers rccs applied climate information system acis http scacis rcc acis org if the rainfall time series had missing data the values were filled by multiple regression analysis using the hydrognomon software version 4 01 itia ntua 2010 the monthly precipitation data were used for the calculation of the spi utilizing the algorithm of the spei r package beguería 2013 several geostatistical approaches ordinary kriging simple kriging universal kriging cokriging and model types circular spherical tetraspherical pentaspherical exponential gaussian rational quadratic hole effect k bessel j bessel and stable have been tested in an arcgis environment for the spatial visualization of the calculated spi values the combined application of simple kriging and rational quadratic provided the smallest root mean square and average standard errors hence this combination has been chosen for the 6 month and 12 month spi visualization all in all the kriging method provides a way for minimum error distribution while correcting potential errors within the raw data karavitis et al 2012a the method works in accordance with the premise that two values that are nearby will have the same information this is a feature presenting a significant advantage while describing random phenomena such as precipitation patterns the interpolated spi 6 and spi 12 products 250 m resolution were transformed according to table 1 for the calculation of the sdvi 2 3 2 demand the 2011 national land cover database homer et al 2015 the most updated national land cover database for the us was used to identify the exact areal extent of the urban areas vegetated lands and areas with zero vulnerability to drought such as bare land permanent snow open water etc during drought events urban areas are potentially the most vulnerable locations with devastating impacts if water demand is not met in the current effort instead of showing by default the urban centers as highly vulnerable it was selected to depict the estimated experienced vulnerability level the main reason was that the monthly domestic water demand for the summer although a bit higher than the rest of the seasons is well accounted by the water authorities water plans and water development activities are based on scenario planning that include high growth rates and extreme drought conditions kenney et al 2004 throughout the years water authorities serving urban centers in the colorado s front range have bought senior water rights according to the prior appropriation doctrine from agriculturists in order to meet the increasing water demands kimball 2005 taylor and young 1995 in addition the urban areas are considered of high importance which have to be always supplied by water in many cases at all costs chen et al 2017 thus the urban areas are set to the lowest vulnerability classification reference evapotranspiration eto was utilized as an indicative measurement for the estimation of the basin s vegetation water demand due to the high importance of agriculture in the south platte basin there is a relative large number of eto monitoring stations but there are only 18 stations with long continuous record 2000 2016 the windy gap station 2418 m located outside the basin on the west slope of the continental divide it was preferred to approximate eto conditions for the south platte basin s mountainous region due to its location the 19 stations fig 1c and table 5 are part of the coagmet www coagmet colostate edu and the northern colorado water conservancy district ncwcd www northernwater org networks the average monthly eto for the whole period was compared with july august and september jas of 2012 and scaled based on table 1 for such a comparison the 2012 monthly values were excluded from the calculation of the long term average eto point information was transformed to spatial information based on the thiessen polygons methodology a simple technique was chosen rather a geostatistical approach due to the complexity of the phenomenon and the small number of eto stations especially at the lower part of the south platte basin based on the above methodology the integrated monthly areal representation of the sdvi demand component was produced by combining the layers of the calculated urban and vegetation water demands while superimposing areas with zero vulnerability in a gis environment 2 3 3 supply a plethora of information was utilized for the spatiotemporal representation of the supply component firstly colorado s division of water resources database provided monthly ditch diversion irrigation records http water state co us datamaps pages default aspx the amount of water diverted on each ditch is recorded at the head gate for the needs of the water administration in the south platte basin time series of 310 ditches which include all the major irrigation ditches in the basin were extracted with selection criterion of at least 25 years of data including information for 2012 the long term monthly average was calculated and compared with the amount diverted in 2012 in order to determine the supply anomaly the cultivated crops within the ditch service polygons were assumed to have a uniform spatial allocation of water supply anomaly under this assumption the point supply anomaly information was converted to spatial soil moisture at the root zone was chosen as a supply indicator for vegetation outside the ditch service areas the nldas 2 north american land data assimilation system noah land surface model lsm chen et al 1996 koren et al 1999 level 4 monthly dataset was used due to lack of measured data it has 0 125 decimal degree resolution and root depth is defined as 100 cm in the forested areas and 60 cm in the non forested ones rui and mocko 2014 the monthly root zone soil moisture anomaly for 2012 was estimated based on the 30 year 1980 2009 monthly average and classified according to table 1 the 2011 national land cover database was used to detect the spatial extent of different land uses the supply component for bare lands permanent snow areas and water features e g lakes reservoirs is classified as low vulnerability to drought these areas are having very limited anthropogenic activities in this regard it was chosen to be set as less vulnerable since impacts are also very few if no water supply is appropriated for urbanized areas the domestic water supply anomaly was estimated from monthly reservoir storage data by the water and climate center of the usda natural resources conservation service national http www wcc nrcs usda gov the monthly percent average reservoir storage serving these urban centers is a practical indication of water supply capacity especially in a semi arid setting which reservoir storage is central for meeting water demands in cases with no information meeting urban water demand was considered to have low vulnerability since us urban residents rarely if ever experience shortages at the tap kenney et al 2004 additionally reservoir storage could be used to depict impacts on hydroelectric capacity not applied in this area and recreation 2 3 4 infrastructure following the same notion as for the supply the sdvi infrastructure component portrays the actual adequacy status of the water supply system the development of adequate water supply infrastructure for agriculture became early on a necessity due to south platte basin s semi arid climate stenzel and cech 2013 agricultural production in northern colorado is a very important revenue sector and weld county is one of highest agricultural producing counties in the us this is possible mainly due to irrigated agriculture which is highly dependent on well operated reservoirs and canal networks to allocate water based on the prior appropriation doctrine for the above reasons the very good status of the existing infrastructure to deliver water in the south platte basin both for domestic and agricultural purposes creates low vulnerability for the region under drought thus it is classified as less vulnerable 2 3 5 impacts the estimation of drought impacts is an inherently difficult task to perform due to the spatial and temporal variability in previous sdvi applications drought impacts were associated with the societal cost this was done by assigning a theoretical high cost of not supplying water to urban centers and thus axiomatically depicting urban cities as most vulnerable and by calculating the monetary crop yield loss cost from relevant reports although the practice of measuring crop yield loss is a tangible way to portray the drought impacts its main disadvantage is that it cannot give any information of the temporal propagation of impacts at the same time the majority of reports regarding drought impacts focus on agriculture losses and leave great information gaps on the other categories such as environmental and socio economic gregorič 2012 grigg 2014 this fragmentation of usually circumstantial impact reports does not contribute towards their classification into the categories of interest e g social or economic the area of study did not escape such traits limiting our understanding regarding drought impacts remote sensing information was employed to capture both agricultural and environmental impacts the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse 1974 is a dimensionless transformation of spectral reflectance and has been successfully used in several drought related studies hurcom and harrison 1998 brown et al 2008 karnieli et al 2010 xu et al 2011 tadesse et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2015 van hoek et al 2016 it allows the quantification visualization and evaluation of healthy and abundance vegetation healthy vegetation compared to stressed or diseased vegetation have different spectrum signatures curran 1980 govender et al 2007 knipling 1970 wang et al 2016b combined moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis ndvi data smoothed and gap filled for the conterminous us conus for the period 2000 2015 with a temporal resolution of 8 days time lag of terra and aqua satellites and spatial of 250 m spruce et al 2016 were employed to portray the vegetation impact monthly average ndvi raster layers for july august and september within 2000 2015 were calculated based on the available measurements within each month and historical long term monthly averages for the whole period were computed the vegetation impact layer is portraying the ndvi anomaly for july august and september of 2012 in comparison to the long term 2000 2015 monthly average values on the other hand the delineation of impacts in urbanized areas was only possible through available reports retrieved from the drought impact reporter of the national drought mitigation center droughtreporter unl edu as mentioned in the supply section reservoir storage could be used to represent impacts on hydroelectric capacity generation in areas that would apply e g colorado river basin and for recreation purposes under this notion the area occupied by the reservoirs is classified based on table 1 using the anomaly of monthly average storage at the 1st of each month with 1981 2010 as a reference period the vegetation urban and reservoirs supplement impacts information are combined to generate the integrated monthly sdvi impact layer the integration of these different drought impacts overcome limitations pressed by information fragmentation and offers a methodology of synthesis while visualizing the spatiotemporal propagation of effects 3 results and discussion 3 1 computation of sdvi components this section starts by providing a summary and discussion of the individual calculated sdvi components such presentation and discussion of the individual sdvi components becomes imperative in order to assess the overall performance of the composite index the calculated spi 6 and spi 12 transformed into their respective scaled values are representing the hazard component in the function the classified 6 month and 12 month spi cspi 6 and cspi 12 portray predominantly the meteorological areal magnitude of the particular drought event the study area experiences vulnerability to drought due to short term precipitation deficit between 0 and 1 46 for its greatest part with august being the worst where 49 36 of the basin is characterized as extremely vulnerable fig 3 column 1 the basin shows signs of recovery on september apart from the north east corner and central east areas the shift could be explained since precipitation was significantly below normal levels drought conditions for the 12 month spi were below normal spi 0 in all precipitation stations and that is why approximately 95 of the basin is depicted as highly vulnerable fig 3 column 2 during august and september the area northeast of sterling was classified in the extremely vulnerable level for cspi 12 for both julesburg and sedgwick stations spi 12 values were less than 2 decreasing more in september overall the northeast tip of the south platte basin is depicted as the most vulnerable area for the 2012 drought event the most defining aspect of the 2012 drought in the area was abnormally high temperatures and evapotranspiration rates ryan and doesken 2015 the demand component for the south platte presented in the third column of fig 3 shows that during the months of july and august the plain part of the basin is at the most vulnerable state since 41 88 and 51 66 of it was classified as highly vulnerable respectively the phenomenon dissipated during september and only 4 08 of the basin was depicted with vegetation water requirements more than 15 of the historical average on july the demand at the mountainous part of the basin west side is classified as less vulnerable while during the following two months the whole area exhibits anomaly less than 15 and thus classified as vulnerable the csu ardec eto station had throughout the study period measured conditions of less eto than the historical average and that is why the northeast part of larimer county and northwest part of weld county are depicted with green color the other less vulnerable areas green color are either urban centers like the denver metropolitan area at the lower left side of the basin or reservoirs and land uses such as bare land the sdvi supply component was calculated based on information regarding monthly water diversions in irrigation canals the storage level of the reservoirs used for domestic demand as an indication of capacity to meet the urban water demand and lastly the root zone soil moisture content from the operational noah lsm model urban centers were classified as less vulnerable since storage percent anomaly for the reservoirs with domestic purpose across the basin did not exceed 50 of storage historic average for the whole period the reservoirs serving the cities of denver and aurora like the antero reservoir and elevenmile canyon reservoir had above the average storage and the spinney mountain reservoir almost the average storage at the same time reservoirs with mainly agricultural water use delivery were experiencing more than 50 lower storage than their monthly historic averages this could be associated with canal service areas that their delivery was classified in the extremely vulnerable level examples of this are the riverside reservoir and the north sterling reservoir and the water diversions at their respective canals service areas the deficits regarding the water diversions to the irrigation canals was intensified during september 2012 furthermore about half of the basin s area was classified as highly vulnerable in august and september since the noah lsm estimated the anomaly of the soil moisture content at the root zone for lands outside the ditch service areas to be less than 50 of the historic average the mountainous area of the south platte basin according to the data from the noah lsm indicated that there were vulnerable to drought and only pockets with average conditions were estimated by the model snowmelt is directly associated with runoff and thus it is included in the various supply deviations e g reservoir ditch diversions soil moisture in the index estimation the last sdvi component is the occurred impacts on a monthly time step as described in the methodology satellite derived datasets reservoirs storage information and reports from the drought impact reporter database regarding urban impacts were utilized in order to represent a composite spatial layer of multifaceted impacts overall cities on the front range did not have any significant impact thus were represented as less vulnerable from the maps illustrated in fig 3 may be derived that the vegetation outside ditch service areas is more vulnerable to drought and falls within the highly vulnerable component class in the mountainous part of the south platte basin the vegetation is experiencing some stress in relation to the monthly long term average but there are also a few areas classified as less vulnerable the anomaly recorded is less than 15 of average greenness at the same time it has to be noted that the spatial representation of ndvi should be interpreted as the deviation of the monthly long term average state it is not necessarily associated to drought impacts as other reasons e g land use changes might be responsible for such a low ndvi signal a characteristic example is the vegetated area at the northwestern part of larimer county that is classified as highly and extremely vulnerable to drought however these severe impacts are not credited to drought conditions but to the hewlett gulch wildfire that burned 31 km2 on may of 2012 and the high park fire that occurred in june of the same year and burned 350 km2 writer et al 2014 this observation stresses the fact that additional information for each area of application needs to be taken into account when interpreting the impact s spatial layer in order to identify eluding causes for depicted irregularities the infrastructure component since the south platte basin is highly developed and with a well maintained water infrastructure network it is classified in the less vulnerable condition for the whole period of study despite the evolution of the index calculation some limitations still exist water supply from groundwater was not possible to be incorporated since data were not available uncertainty in the input values for the index calculation is also one of the uncertainty sources affecting the results the components with the least certainty are the demand and supply evapotranspiration measurements tend to be spatially sparse with limited coverage and with usually short time records relying more on satellite driven data could lead to an operational version of the index with the ability to inform about drought vulnerability conditions in near real time in addition the incorporation of reservoirs demand and supply components would result to more precise assignment of overall drought vulnerability levels regarding ecological and societal aspects detailed status about the condition of the infrastructure for every water structure is a main factor contributing to system s vulnerability to drought its incorporation into the index calculation is an important piece of information which currently missing 3 2 sdvi results the overall sdvi results calculated for each month are presented and summarized based on the aforementioned framework the comparison of the index produced results with the existing condition show a very good relation as it was presented in the previous section further spots of extreme vulnerability along the south platte river are reservoirs whose storage was significantly lower than their historic monthly average representative are the cases of the empire riverside and jackson lake reservoirs that were completely dried out by 1st of august 2012 and north sterling reservoir by 1st of september consequently they were affecting not only the irrigation ditches they were serving but also producing recreation and environmental habitational impacts drought impact reporter database reports of media entries on drought impacts recreational industry was affected by the 2012 drought boating was disturbed on july at the prewitt reservoir waite 2012 and on august at horsetooth reservoir associated press 2012 both reservoirs are portrayed by the index component among the vulnerable spots on the impacts maps in fig 3 a significant part of the irrigated agriculture is under stress with the anomaly on the vegetation greenness in these areas to be classified as vulnerable 15 depicting the deficiency of meeting crop water requirements this is supported by the drought impact reporter database since farmers were asking permission from senior water rights to be allowed to pump groundwater from the alluvial aquifer at the same time the irrigated crops that are within normal conditions can be attributed to their priority in available water supply since the land is associated with senior water rights in morgan county the irrigated crops are depicted as experiencing some vegetation health issues also the ndvi anomaly is decreasing steadily from july throughout august without this indicating necessarily causal relationship for the reasons mentioned above on the other hand the rest of the vegetation at the plains is depicted as steadily highly vulnerable as expected since most of this area is classified as non irrigated grass pasture and the key characteristic of the 2012 drought event was high temperatures and increased evapotranspiration rates this high stress observed on grass pasture lands is in concordance with reports from the media retrieved from the drought impact reporter database there are several entries mentioning in the area there was not enough grass to feed cattle and thus forced of selling livestock or in other cases forced to feed alfalfa and hay which indirectly are displayed in the impacts component maps as grass and pasture lands were severely impacted all in all the reports retrieved from the drought impact reporter database are supporting the results of the selected methodology to portray the impacts in a holistic way however during interpretation of the results additional sources of information land uses wildfires etc should be taken into account for validation reasons fig 4 portrays the monthly vulnerability magnitude and extent produced by the sdvi in the south platte basin but also informs about the spatiotemporal propagation of the drought which was depicted by the index the sdvi results may also be directly connected to the spi results as the spi values were used in the sdvi estimation representing the hazard component since the most vulnerable area northeast of sterling displayed a significant precipitation stress in both spi components compared to the least vulnerable ones overall the total extent of the extremely vulnerable class does not surpass 3 of the total area the urban areas are characterized as the least vulnerable part of the basin along with parts of the basin in the higher elevations for the urban areas this low level of vulnerability during the study period is attributed to the high percent average of reservoirs storage supplying these areas and by the very few reports retrieved from the drought impact reporter database which refer to drought water shortages it is worth mentioning that the urban areas were expected to be classified as the least vulnerable compared to the other parts of the basin since the water planning priority given to these areas for mitigating possible effects of drought is the highest due to potentially catastrophic consequences the mountainous areas display less vulnerability to drought which is accredited predominantly to the lower water demand the aforementioned impacts of the two wildfires in the impact component estimation were somewhat masked in the sdvi calculation resulting in being classified as one scale more vulnerable compared to the adjacent areas the higher vulnerability of post fire areas is in accordance with recent findings that during drought years following the wildfires the vulnerability is higher in terms of forest recovery and favored species harvey et al 2016 thus in such areas it is suggested to give higher importance to the impacts component non irrigated grass pasture lands which constitute the vegetation with the greatest extent in the basin were classified among the most vulnerable parts of the basin for the 2012 drought this sdvi finding is in accordance and backed up by the numerous pertinent reports available in the drought impact reporter database the basin is depicted as more vulnerable to drought during august of 2012 which drought slightly dissipates on the next month from the components presented and discussed this slight intensification of about 5000 km2 shifting to the medium vulnerability class table 6 is a result of the combined result of the demand supply spi 6 and impacts components however the straight line borders of vulnerability classes which is not corresponding to natural gradual variation conditions a fact visible in almost all the three months is attributed to the coarser datasets used for the calculation of the demand and supply components of the index this denotes the need for incorporating and testing alternative datasets as they become available with a finer resolution even though recreational and environmental impacts from reservoirs were well portrayed in the pertinent component maps the sdvi calculations display lower vulnerability status of the reservoirs especially in the lower section of the south platte where some reservoirs were completely drained this is mainly because the minimum demand and supply components for recreational environmental uses were not considered in their operation thresholds data need to be incorporated for a more accurate display of the vulnerability levels but such information is not easily accessible lastly the incorporation of medium to high resolution datasets can relate information more effectively to farmers and show how they are doing compared to their neighbors this detailed information could be useful in order to go back and examine all the components of the sdvi in order to prioritize drought mitigation actions in local scale fig 5 illustrates the sdvi results of september 2012 for three areas within the south platte basin in high resolution it is believed that the benefit of the estimation of the index in fine scale reveals local special conditions and could assist drought planning and management hyperspectral instruments that measure hundreds of bands and argued to be the future of remote sensing information could be incorporated to drought studies to indicate for example evapotranspiration anomalies and plant health in farm level 4 conclusions the inherited complexity and uncertainty in the drought phenomenon per se and its multifaceted impacts make the task of their spatiotemporal assessment very challenging many indices have attempted to describe the severity duration frequency and spatial extent of droughts despite the fact that physical and anthropogenic systems are interwoven most of the time the assessments are following a fragmented approach and fail to link structural and socio economic components which are significant in order to portray drought vulnerability drought vulnerability is characterizing the susceptibility of a system s components vulnerability includes both hazards and impacts and it measures the ability to meet demands at a specific time step understanding the weaknesses and interconnections of physical and social systems can lead to informed drought management strategies since there is inherent difficulty and complexity the employment of indices that would incorporate different components of vulnerability is a viable way forward in developing implementable drought management tools sdvi had been conceived and constructed in such a way as to include aspects of physical structural and socio economic systems the south platte basin faces great challenges in water resources management that are further intensified due to extreme events it is an area of data abundance compared to other parts of the world and thus suitable for evolving the sdvi using less qualitative inputs and more detailed quantifiable information thus more accurately approximating the system s vulnerability to drought levels sdvi s original development and application has been assessed in a region of limited data availability and coarse resolution the approach adopted increases the spatial resolution and the transparency and reproducibility of the results are providing a relative measure such that finer scale areas can be compared and assessed in more detail it should be noted that the estimation of the index is difficult to be validated on the ground as in most composite indicators furthermore the individual components can be also validated and compared in different drought events with the goal to provide information to stakeholders and planners of priority actions at different scales farm to basin overall the sdvi results are directly correlated with the spi components since they are constituting one third of the index s value that being said the incorporation of the other index components results is delineating more focused vulnerability to drought levels based on the included societal physical and structural factors making crucial and necessary linkages the sdvi values produced for the south platte basin seems to offer a deeper understanding of vulnerability to drought of the different system s components drought impacts are time varying and most importantly the satellite derived information combined with in situ data and soft data reports is an integrated way to depict vegetation including agricultural crops ecosystem mainly natural vegetation and recreational and aquatic habitat impacts urban areas were classified as least vulnerable along with the forested land uses the irrigated agriculture is showing less vulnerability than vegetation on the plains located outside ditch service areas this is attributed to sdvi s supply component since the capacity to meet crop water requirements within the ditch service areas is potentially greater than outside of it at the same time the impacts measured are greater in the grass and pasture lands than in crops the identification of system s vulnerability to drought in an integrated way is critical to reveal its different contributing underlying causes giving a better understanding of the system s complexities to water planners and managers thus the vulnerability to drought categorization of the system s components based on multiple drought events could lead into triggering targeted actions that could result in a more integrated approach for drought management linking demand supply and impact focused measures and at the same time resulting in improved water and environmental security 
6758,drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system the vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency the existing water management policy framework and its implementation the standardized drought vulnerability index sdvi is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system incorporating precipitation patterns the supply and demand trends and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability this work attempts to evolve the sdvi by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information at the same time it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept the new framework is applied in the south platte basin within colorado on the 2012 summer drought july september the proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers sdvi could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts thus it is believed that the sdvi could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions allowing for a more integrated management approach keywords drought drought vulnerability drought impacts sdvi water resources south platte 1 introduction drought is a recurrent natural phenomenon aggressive in many areas around the world defying their normal climatic conditions kiem et al 2016 it has diachronically manifested its existence in almost every place and culture by affecting social and economic welfare usually to a significant extent damages due to drought can be costlier than any other natural hazard loucks 2006 early on rosenberg 1980 stresses that vulnerability to drought in one water user group has a ripple effect to the society at large further recent evidence on this is the increased prices of agricultural products due to shortages attributed to the drought of 2011 2012 in the us grigg 2014 the combining effects of increased water demands and climate change impacts will further stress our ability to cope with droughts in the future mishra et al 2015 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the drought nature characteristics and impacts have continuously drawn the attention of the scientific community the state and federal entities as well as the general public resulting in the production of a rich menu of drought literature that mostly provides crucial information on its parameters and management strategies cancelliere et al 2005 fontane and frevert 1995 grigg 2014 grigg and vlachos 1993 hagman et al 1984 karavitis 1992 1998 karavitis et al 2012a 2015a 2015b loukas and vasiliades 2004 playán et al 2013 pulwarty and maia 2015 rosenberg 1978 1980 traore and fontane 2007 vasiliades and loukas 2009 vlachos 1982 wilhite 2004 zarch et al 2015 oikonomou et al 2018 wang et al 2016a drought is a dynamic creeping phenomenon without a definition that may be widely accepted as such its holistic description is very demanding consequently when a drought occurs is seemingly difficult to confront it being a non event in other words the absence of enough water bordi et al 2006 eriyagama et al 2009 karavitis 1999 karavitis et al 2014 yevjevich et al 1983 since drought characterization is a difficult task numerous indices have been developed and some are used quite frequently the standardized precipitation index spi developed by mckee et al 1993 and the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 serve as two of the most widely used ones furthermore some more recently established indices focus on examining drought within a different context such as the reconnaissance drought index tsakiris et al 2006 tsakiris and vangelis 2005 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index vicente serrano et al 2010 and the multivariate drought index rajsekhar et al 2015 whereas other more complex ones are referring directly or indirectly to vulnerability and water scarcity concepts jain et al 2015 karavitis et al 2014 sullivan 2002 vargas and paneque 2017 the concept of vulnerability to drought is very challenging to be accurately presented due to a disciplinary and or individually based series of interpretations gallopín 2006 thywissen 2006 and manyena 2006 also provide extensive lists of various definitions of vulnerability nevertheless the vulnerability concept mostly refers to the components affecting both a system s capacity to cope and its potential to be harmed and it is strongly influenced by a plethora of factors cardona et al 2012 jain et al 2015 karavitis et al 2014 turner et al 2003 defines vulnerability as the likelihood to experience harm due to exposure to hazard and encompasses exposure sensitivity and resilience to the concept according to ipcc vulnerability is defined as the propensity or the predisposition to be adversely affected and is the result of diverse historical social economic political cultural institutional natural resource and environmental conditions and processes lavell et al 2012 under this framework vulnerability the natural hazard and the exposure to it are related through the risk of an extreme event the vulnerability term could also be expressed as a function of two variables namely hazard and impacts karavitis et al 2014 which is adopted in the current effort in this respect without a disaster or a system in stress hazard there is no vulnerability furthermore it is difficult to exactly estimate the magnitude and duration of the hazard in time and space so as to exactly point out when a system s resilience threshold is exceeded or the ability of a system to cope with drought is collapsed karavitis et al 2014 vargas and paneque 2017 the vulnerability magnitude of various areas to that particular hazard depends on their exposure to water deficiency and to the existing water management policy framework implementation karavitis 2012 focusing on drought vulnerability the most pivotal contributing factors among others are rainfall patterns supply and demand trends both in the natural and anthropogenic scene along with the socioeconomic context societal drought vulnerability is affected by water demand therefore socio economic development in many parts of the world could be disrupted due to occurring supply deficits water demand deficits may increase due to supply failures or sudden changes in land use patterns i e increased irrigation requirements or urgent population needs defries and eshleman 2004 also early on it was pointed out that infrastructure status along with access to technology affect vulnerability levels rosenberg 1980 for example efficient irrigation practices could counterbalance some of the effects of drought events under such conditions some regions are more vulnerable than others and vulnerability is a fully dynamic phenomenon complying with the changes that emerge in the various systems adger 2006 eakin and luers 2006 o brien et al 2004 o brien and leichenko 2001 despite the abundance of environmental information drought impacts and the factors contributing to systems vulnerability are scarcely reported bachmair et al 2016 blauhut et al 2015 2016 even in developed states grigg 2014 underlines the eluding nature of drought impacts since they could occur in different ways times and places drought assessments are generally characterized by fragmentation and lack of synthesis thus failing to give an integrated perspective of impacts dow 2010 grigg 2014 maia et al 2015 at the same time impact data gathered by the relevant authorities are usually not very detailed and have a coarse spatial scale since they are often aggregated duncan et al 2015 argue that drought planning and management can be benefited by a high spatial resolution analysis since climatic and morphological conditions e g rainfall patterns plains mountainous chains may not be spotted in a regional analysis likewise factors affecting vulnerability to drought vary spatially such as demand and supply patterns infrastructure efficiency etc therefore drought vulnerability assessment in high spatial resolution could serve as an additional water resources management tool informing managers and planners on an area for priority actions the employment of indicators and indices is a common practice for describing complex phenomena and concepts the standardized drought vulnerability index sdvi was conceived as an integrated approach for assessing drought vulnerability karavitis et al 2014 with a multi component drought vulnerability characterization based on a classification system it was produced during the drought management centre in southeastern europe dmcsee project karavitis et al 2011 2012b 2014 the present effort is attempting to surpass some of the sdvi s earlier application limitations and assess the information improvement provided by the integration of satellite data in the calculation of sdvi this is accomplished by introducing a more transparent data rigorous methodology that replaces qualitative information with more quantitative data the enhancement of the sdvi to accurately depict occurring conditions in space and time is essential for the index utilization as an efficient timely and effective decision making tool in water resources planning and management under drought conditions better understanding of the vulnerability to drought and its different contributing components could convey drought information for mitigation and adaptation strategies to decision makers in a more holistic manner hence avoiding at the same time existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of reported impacts the 2012 summer drought affected a large portion of the us including a large part of the state of colorado and it was one of the driest periods ever recorded grigg 2014 noaa drought task force 2013 wang et al 2016c thus it was selected as the study event for this effort by expansion such a methodology may be introduced in less data rich environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the south platte river basin located at the northeast corner of colorado fig 1 a has total area of 49 000 km2 dennehy et al 1993 while its total population is estimated approximately at 3 700 000 inhabitants 70 of state s population colorado department of local affairs 2016 it is a semi arid basin with average annual precipitation of about 400 mm according to mckee et al 2000 the basin s climate in the mountainous region is wet during december april and dry in june and august october while the lower section is dry from november february and wet from april july the dependence on snow accumulation during the winter months is significant since it serves as a natural storage for the basin to meet the demands during the summer period along with several manmade storage structures the south platte is a highly developed basin with various competing and conflicting water demands oikonomou et al 2018 the agricultural sector is the largest water user and among the traditional water uses in the basin there is also relative high water demand for unconventional energy development oikonomou et al 2015a b 2016 the 2010 irrigated parcels spatial extent is shown in fig 1a with dark green color and their estimated total area was 3426 km2 846 634 acres colorado decision support systems 2016 colorado has faced the impacts of droughts several times during the 20th century mckee et al 2000 and most recently the 2002 and 2012 drought events during the 2012drought colorado experienced severe impacts resulting to damages of approximately 409 million in agricultural revenue pritchett et al 2013 thus the july august and september period of 2012 drought event was selected as a representative time frame for the application of vulnerability assessment in the south platte basin since it also includes the vegetation s growth season in addition the projected climate conditions in the basin suggest an increase in the severity of future droughts colorado water conservation board et al 2013 which makes well planned management strategies for coping with drought and mitigating its impacts even more imperative 2 2 the standardized drought vulnerability index the sdvi is a composite index that aims at providing an integrated estimation of drought vulnerability based on four drought manifestations namely meteorological hydrological social and economic karavitis et al 2014 the sdvi is comprised of six components eq 1 the 6 and 12 month standardized precipitation index spi demand supply infrastructure and impacts which capture the aforementioned drought manifestations and may complement each other more specifically the 6 month spi and 12 month spi describing the precipitation anomaly from normal conditions represent the hazard risk element the 6 month spi is capturing more accurately the seasonal variation thus may display water availability during the crop growing season especially for rain fed crops karavitis et al 2014 on the other hand the 12 month spi captures long term drought periods and thus it may reflect the urban tourism industrial reservoir storage and hydropower water availability karavitis et al 2014 as it is also depicted in other studies sullivan et al 2003 2009 sullivan 2011 sullivan and meigh 2007 a region with high positive spi values may still display high drought vulnerability conditions if it lacks the necessary water infrastructure and the corresponding water resources management framework the remaining four components demand supply infrastructure and socio economic inflicted drought damages represent the impact description in the vulnerability concept as described in the previous section hence the index s components describe both the effects of the precipitation deficits or surplus and the response conditions within the regions of interest those six index parameters are classified into four vulnerability categories labelled 0 to 3 according to their performance table 1 which is the product of extensive pertinent literature review and expert opinion categorization karavitis et al 2014 tsesmelis 2017 1 s d v i f s p i 6 s p i 12 d e m a n d s u p p l y i n f r a s t r u c t u r e i m p a c t s the vulnerability to drought is calculated using eq 2 karavitis et al 2014 which infers that the six sdvi components ci are of equal importance that particular technique has been chosen since it is most often applied in the development of composite indicators despite the pitfall for some components to be over or under estimated oecd and european commission 2008 furthermore assigning weights on the components of a complex phenomenon could be misleading with unfounded premises in addition an effort to assess the uncertainty caused by different weighting methods on the sdvi tsesmelis 2017 concluded that the equal weighting method is having similar results when compared to the more complex weighing forms of the sdvi finally the computed sdvi values are categorized into six classes of vulnerability as demarcated in table 2 2 s d v i 1 n i 1 n c i w h e r e n 6 2 3 index adjustment and data the sdvi application in the south platte basin is the first outside the geographical area of southeast europe see where it was developed and first tested the fact that see has a variety of climatic conditions and levels of socio economic development makes it suitable for developing a non geographically bounded index at the same time the various countries 11 in total of the see region follow different data standards and thus detailed space and time information is lacking which creates significant data challenges information for the index components at a basin or sub basin scale except from precipitation data may not reveal local variations of drought vulnerability levels furthermore a key limitation of previous applications is the static representation of the impacts component its estimation is based on the monetary yield loss annual representation which distorts the monthly calculation of the index lastly the ecosystem as well as the secondary socio economic impacts in see were not considered due to lack of dependable data the increasing amount of available in situ datasets especially in north america along with the employment of good quality remote sensing information gives the opportunity to reconsider the way the index was applied karavitis et al 2015a in this context the revision of the sdvi for the south platte basin application is an effort to overcome the most of the aforementioned limitations and establish a framework of index calculation transparency karavitis et al 2015a oikonomou 2017 oikonomou and waskom 2018 fig 2 outlines data integration procedure for the index space time calculation the datasets used for each sdvi component are shown in table 3 and described in detail below information from the datasets used was not available for a long enough common period although that might introduce some bias it was chosen to utilize the longest available period with good quality data for each data set thus the effect of the different periods would have less impact on the results the index is a composite one based on individual parameters estimation different spatial resolutions were chosen for the different parameters in order to have the most detailed representation based on the available information it is believed that more detailed and longer data sets periods will improve the representation of the components and will lead in having less error for the added values in the sdvi calculation the inclusion of higher resolution spatiotemporal datasets in the calculation of the index offers new capabilities of examining local vulnerability variations and allows comparison of adjacent areas the proposed holistic impact representation framework could help depict impacts extent and magnitude in a non fragmented way and thus increase the insight gained 2 3 1 standardized precipitation index the values of spi 6 and spi 12 are computed on point scale for every available meteorological station with the required data in this context monthly precipitation records from 24 meteorological stations fig 1b and table 4 with at least a 50 year record 1963 2012 were retrieved from the noaa s regional climate centers rccs applied climate information system acis http scacis rcc acis org if the rainfall time series had missing data the values were filled by multiple regression analysis using the hydrognomon software version 4 01 itia ntua 2010 the monthly precipitation data were used for the calculation of the spi utilizing the algorithm of the spei r package beguería 2013 several geostatistical approaches ordinary kriging simple kriging universal kriging cokriging and model types circular spherical tetraspherical pentaspherical exponential gaussian rational quadratic hole effect k bessel j bessel and stable have been tested in an arcgis environment for the spatial visualization of the calculated spi values the combined application of simple kriging and rational quadratic provided the smallest root mean square and average standard errors hence this combination has been chosen for the 6 month and 12 month spi visualization all in all the kriging method provides a way for minimum error distribution while correcting potential errors within the raw data karavitis et al 2012a the method works in accordance with the premise that two values that are nearby will have the same information this is a feature presenting a significant advantage while describing random phenomena such as precipitation patterns the interpolated spi 6 and spi 12 products 250 m resolution were transformed according to table 1 for the calculation of the sdvi 2 3 2 demand the 2011 national land cover database homer et al 2015 the most updated national land cover database for the us was used to identify the exact areal extent of the urban areas vegetated lands and areas with zero vulnerability to drought such as bare land permanent snow open water etc during drought events urban areas are potentially the most vulnerable locations with devastating impacts if water demand is not met in the current effort instead of showing by default the urban centers as highly vulnerable it was selected to depict the estimated experienced vulnerability level the main reason was that the monthly domestic water demand for the summer although a bit higher than the rest of the seasons is well accounted by the water authorities water plans and water development activities are based on scenario planning that include high growth rates and extreme drought conditions kenney et al 2004 throughout the years water authorities serving urban centers in the colorado s front range have bought senior water rights according to the prior appropriation doctrine from agriculturists in order to meet the increasing water demands kimball 2005 taylor and young 1995 in addition the urban areas are considered of high importance which have to be always supplied by water in many cases at all costs chen et al 2017 thus the urban areas are set to the lowest vulnerability classification reference evapotranspiration eto was utilized as an indicative measurement for the estimation of the basin s vegetation water demand due to the high importance of agriculture in the south platte basin there is a relative large number of eto monitoring stations but there are only 18 stations with long continuous record 2000 2016 the windy gap station 2418 m located outside the basin on the west slope of the continental divide it was preferred to approximate eto conditions for the south platte basin s mountainous region due to its location the 19 stations fig 1c and table 5 are part of the coagmet www coagmet colostate edu and the northern colorado water conservancy district ncwcd www northernwater org networks the average monthly eto for the whole period was compared with july august and september jas of 2012 and scaled based on table 1 for such a comparison the 2012 monthly values were excluded from the calculation of the long term average eto point information was transformed to spatial information based on the thiessen polygons methodology a simple technique was chosen rather a geostatistical approach due to the complexity of the phenomenon and the small number of eto stations especially at the lower part of the south platte basin based on the above methodology the integrated monthly areal representation of the sdvi demand component was produced by combining the layers of the calculated urban and vegetation water demands while superimposing areas with zero vulnerability in a gis environment 2 3 3 supply a plethora of information was utilized for the spatiotemporal representation of the supply component firstly colorado s division of water resources database provided monthly ditch diversion irrigation records http water state co us datamaps pages default aspx the amount of water diverted on each ditch is recorded at the head gate for the needs of the water administration in the south platte basin time series of 310 ditches which include all the major irrigation ditches in the basin were extracted with selection criterion of at least 25 years of data including information for 2012 the long term monthly average was calculated and compared with the amount diverted in 2012 in order to determine the supply anomaly the cultivated crops within the ditch service polygons were assumed to have a uniform spatial allocation of water supply anomaly under this assumption the point supply anomaly information was converted to spatial soil moisture at the root zone was chosen as a supply indicator for vegetation outside the ditch service areas the nldas 2 north american land data assimilation system noah land surface model lsm chen et al 1996 koren et al 1999 level 4 monthly dataset was used due to lack of measured data it has 0 125 decimal degree resolution and root depth is defined as 100 cm in the forested areas and 60 cm in the non forested ones rui and mocko 2014 the monthly root zone soil moisture anomaly for 2012 was estimated based on the 30 year 1980 2009 monthly average and classified according to table 1 the 2011 national land cover database was used to detect the spatial extent of different land uses the supply component for bare lands permanent snow areas and water features e g lakes reservoirs is classified as low vulnerability to drought these areas are having very limited anthropogenic activities in this regard it was chosen to be set as less vulnerable since impacts are also very few if no water supply is appropriated for urbanized areas the domestic water supply anomaly was estimated from monthly reservoir storage data by the water and climate center of the usda natural resources conservation service national http www wcc nrcs usda gov the monthly percent average reservoir storage serving these urban centers is a practical indication of water supply capacity especially in a semi arid setting which reservoir storage is central for meeting water demands in cases with no information meeting urban water demand was considered to have low vulnerability since us urban residents rarely if ever experience shortages at the tap kenney et al 2004 additionally reservoir storage could be used to depict impacts on hydroelectric capacity not applied in this area and recreation 2 3 4 infrastructure following the same notion as for the supply the sdvi infrastructure component portrays the actual adequacy status of the water supply system the development of adequate water supply infrastructure for agriculture became early on a necessity due to south platte basin s semi arid climate stenzel and cech 2013 agricultural production in northern colorado is a very important revenue sector and weld county is one of highest agricultural producing counties in the us this is possible mainly due to irrigated agriculture which is highly dependent on well operated reservoirs and canal networks to allocate water based on the prior appropriation doctrine for the above reasons the very good status of the existing infrastructure to deliver water in the south platte basin both for domestic and agricultural purposes creates low vulnerability for the region under drought thus it is classified as less vulnerable 2 3 5 impacts the estimation of drought impacts is an inherently difficult task to perform due to the spatial and temporal variability in previous sdvi applications drought impacts were associated with the societal cost this was done by assigning a theoretical high cost of not supplying water to urban centers and thus axiomatically depicting urban cities as most vulnerable and by calculating the monetary crop yield loss cost from relevant reports although the practice of measuring crop yield loss is a tangible way to portray the drought impacts its main disadvantage is that it cannot give any information of the temporal propagation of impacts at the same time the majority of reports regarding drought impacts focus on agriculture losses and leave great information gaps on the other categories such as environmental and socio economic gregorič 2012 grigg 2014 this fragmentation of usually circumstantial impact reports does not contribute towards their classification into the categories of interest e g social or economic the area of study did not escape such traits limiting our understanding regarding drought impacts remote sensing information was employed to capture both agricultural and environmental impacts the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse 1974 is a dimensionless transformation of spectral reflectance and has been successfully used in several drought related studies hurcom and harrison 1998 brown et al 2008 karnieli et al 2010 xu et al 2011 tadesse et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2015 van hoek et al 2016 it allows the quantification visualization and evaluation of healthy and abundance vegetation healthy vegetation compared to stressed or diseased vegetation have different spectrum signatures curran 1980 govender et al 2007 knipling 1970 wang et al 2016b combined moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis ndvi data smoothed and gap filled for the conterminous us conus for the period 2000 2015 with a temporal resolution of 8 days time lag of terra and aqua satellites and spatial of 250 m spruce et al 2016 were employed to portray the vegetation impact monthly average ndvi raster layers for july august and september within 2000 2015 were calculated based on the available measurements within each month and historical long term monthly averages for the whole period were computed the vegetation impact layer is portraying the ndvi anomaly for july august and september of 2012 in comparison to the long term 2000 2015 monthly average values on the other hand the delineation of impacts in urbanized areas was only possible through available reports retrieved from the drought impact reporter of the national drought mitigation center droughtreporter unl edu as mentioned in the supply section reservoir storage could be used to represent impacts on hydroelectric capacity generation in areas that would apply e g colorado river basin and for recreation purposes under this notion the area occupied by the reservoirs is classified based on table 1 using the anomaly of monthly average storage at the 1st of each month with 1981 2010 as a reference period the vegetation urban and reservoirs supplement impacts information are combined to generate the integrated monthly sdvi impact layer the integration of these different drought impacts overcome limitations pressed by information fragmentation and offers a methodology of synthesis while visualizing the spatiotemporal propagation of effects 3 results and discussion 3 1 computation of sdvi components this section starts by providing a summary and discussion of the individual calculated sdvi components such presentation and discussion of the individual sdvi components becomes imperative in order to assess the overall performance of the composite index the calculated spi 6 and spi 12 transformed into their respective scaled values are representing the hazard component in the function the classified 6 month and 12 month spi cspi 6 and cspi 12 portray predominantly the meteorological areal magnitude of the particular drought event the study area experiences vulnerability to drought due to short term precipitation deficit between 0 and 1 46 for its greatest part with august being the worst where 49 36 of the basin is characterized as extremely vulnerable fig 3 column 1 the basin shows signs of recovery on september apart from the north east corner and central east areas the shift could be explained since precipitation was significantly below normal levels drought conditions for the 12 month spi were below normal spi 0 in all precipitation stations and that is why approximately 95 of the basin is depicted as highly vulnerable fig 3 column 2 during august and september the area northeast of sterling was classified in the extremely vulnerable level for cspi 12 for both julesburg and sedgwick stations spi 12 values were less than 2 decreasing more in september overall the northeast tip of the south platte basin is depicted as the most vulnerable area for the 2012 drought event the most defining aspect of the 2012 drought in the area was abnormally high temperatures and evapotranspiration rates ryan and doesken 2015 the demand component for the south platte presented in the third column of fig 3 shows that during the months of july and august the plain part of the basin is at the most vulnerable state since 41 88 and 51 66 of it was classified as highly vulnerable respectively the phenomenon dissipated during september and only 4 08 of the basin was depicted with vegetation water requirements more than 15 of the historical average on july the demand at the mountainous part of the basin west side is classified as less vulnerable while during the following two months the whole area exhibits anomaly less than 15 and thus classified as vulnerable the csu ardec eto station had throughout the study period measured conditions of less eto than the historical average and that is why the northeast part of larimer county and northwest part of weld county are depicted with green color the other less vulnerable areas green color are either urban centers like the denver metropolitan area at the lower left side of the basin or reservoirs and land uses such as bare land the sdvi supply component was calculated based on information regarding monthly water diversions in irrigation canals the storage level of the reservoirs used for domestic demand as an indication of capacity to meet the urban water demand and lastly the root zone soil moisture content from the operational noah lsm model urban centers were classified as less vulnerable since storage percent anomaly for the reservoirs with domestic purpose across the basin did not exceed 50 of storage historic average for the whole period the reservoirs serving the cities of denver and aurora like the antero reservoir and elevenmile canyon reservoir had above the average storage and the spinney mountain reservoir almost the average storage at the same time reservoirs with mainly agricultural water use delivery were experiencing more than 50 lower storage than their monthly historic averages this could be associated with canal service areas that their delivery was classified in the extremely vulnerable level examples of this are the riverside reservoir and the north sterling reservoir and the water diversions at their respective canals service areas the deficits regarding the water diversions to the irrigation canals was intensified during september 2012 furthermore about half of the basin s area was classified as highly vulnerable in august and september since the noah lsm estimated the anomaly of the soil moisture content at the root zone for lands outside the ditch service areas to be less than 50 of the historic average the mountainous area of the south platte basin according to the data from the noah lsm indicated that there were vulnerable to drought and only pockets with average conditions were estimated by the model snowmelt is directly associated with runoff and thus it is included in the various supply deviations e g reservoir ditch diversions soil moisture in the index estimation the last sdvi component is the occurred impacts on a monthly time step as described in the methodology satellite derived datasets reservoirs storage information and reports from the drought impact reporter database regarding urban impacts were utilized in order to represent a composite spatial layer of multifaceted impacts overall cities on the front range did not have any significant impact thus were represented as less vulnerable from the maps illustrated in fig 3 may be derived that the vegetation outside ditch service areas is more vulnerable to drought and falls within the highly vulnerable component class in the mountainous part of the south platte basin the vegetation is experiencing some stress in relation to the monthly long term average but there are also a few areas classified as less vulnerable the anomaly recorded is less than 15 of average greenness at the same time it has to be noted that the spatial representation of ndvi should be interpreted as the deviation of the monthly long term average state it is not necessarily associated to drought impacts as other reasons e g land use changes might be responsible for such a low ndvi signal a characteristic example is the vegetated area at the northwestern part of larimer county that is classified as highly and extremely vulnerable to drought however these severe impacts are not credited to drought conditions but to the hewlett gulch wildfire that burned 31 km2 on may of 2012 and the high park fire that occurred in june of the same year and burned 350 km2 writer et al 2014 this observation stresses the fact that additional information for each area of application needs to be taken into account when interpreting the impact s spatial layer in order to identify eluding causes for depicted irregularities the infrastructure component since the south platte basin is highly developed and with a well maintained water infrastructure network it is classified in the less vulnerable condition for the whole period of study despite the evolution of the index calculation some limitations still exist water supply from groundwater was not possible to be incorporated since data were not available uncertainty in the input values for the index calculation is also one of the uncertainty sources affecting the results the components with the least certainty are the demand and supply evapotranspiration measurements tend to be spatially sparse with limited coverage and with usually short time records relying more on satellite driven data could lead to an operational version of the index with the ability to inform about drought vulnerability conditions in near real time in addition the incorporation of reservoirs demand and supply components would result to more precise assignment of overall drought vulnerability levels regarding ecological and societal aspects detailed status about the condition of the infrastructure for every water structure is a main factor contributing to system s vulnerability to drought its incorporation into the index calculation is an important piece of information which currently missing 3 2 sdvi results the overall sdvi results calculated for each month are presented and summarized based on the aforementioned framework the comparison of the index produced results with the existing condition show a very good relation as it was presented in the previous section further spots of extreme vulnerability along the south platte river are reservoirs whose storage was significantly lower than their historic monthly average representative are the cases of the empire riverside and jackson lake reservoirs that were completely dried out by 1st of august 2012 and north sterling reservoir by 1st of september consequently they were affecting not only the irrigation ditches they were serving but also producing recreation and environmental habitational impacts drought impact reporter database reports of media entries on drought impacts recreational industry was affected by the 2012 drought boating was disturbed on july at the prewitt reservoir waite 2012 and on august at horsetooth reservoir associated press 2012 both reservoirs are portrayed by the index component among the vulnerable spots on the impacts maps in fig 3 a significant part of the irrigated agriculture is under stress with the anomaly on the vegetation greenness in these areas to be classified as vulnerable 15 depicting the deficiency of meeting crop water requirements this is supported by the drought impact reporter database since farmers were asking permission from senior water rights to be allowed to pump groundwater from the alluvial aquifer at the same time the irrigated crops that are within normal conditions can be attributed to their priority in available water supply since the land is associated with senior water rights in morgan county the irrigated crops are depicted as experiencing some vegetation health issues also the ndvi anomaly is decreasing steadily from july throughout august without this indicating necessarily causal relationship for the reasons mentioned above on the other hand the rest of the vegetation at the plains is depicted as steadily highly vulnerable as expected since most of this area is classified as non irrigated grass pasture and the key characteristic of the 2012 drought event was high temperatures and increased evapotranspiration rates this high stress observed on grass pasture lands is in concordance with reports from the media retrieved from the drought impact reporter database there are several entries mentioning in the area there was not enough grass to feed cattle and thus forced of selling livestock or in other cases forced to feed alfalfa and hay which indirectly are displayed in the impacts component maps as grass and pasture lands were severely impacted all in all the reports retrieved from the drought impact reporter database are supporting the results of the selected methodology to portray the impacts in a holistic way however during interpretation of the results additional sources of information land uses wildfires etc should be taken into account for validation reasons fig 4 portrays the monthly vulnerability magnitude and extent produced by the sdvi in the south platte basin but also informs about the spatiotemporal propagation of the drought which was depicted by the index the sdvi results may also be directly connected to the spi results as the spi values were used in the sdvi estimation representing the hazard component since the most vulnerable area northeast of sterling displayed a significant precipitation stress in both spi components compared to the least vulnerable ones overall the total extent of the extremely vulnerable class does not surpass 3 of the total area the urban areas are characterized as the least vulnerable part of the basin along with parts of the basin in the higher elevations for the urban areas this low level of vulnerability during the study period is attributed to the high percent average of reservoirs storage supplying these areas and by the very few reports retrieved from the drought impact reporter database which refer to drought water shortages it is worth mentioning that the urban areas were expected to be classified as the least vulnerable compared to the other parts of the basin since the water planning priority given to these areas for mitigating possible effects of drought is the highest due to potentially catastrophic consequences the mountainous areas display less vulnerability to drought which is accredited predominantly to the lower water demand the aforementioned impacts of the two wildfires in the impact component estimation were somewhat masked in the sdvi calculation resulting in being classified as one scale more vulnerable compared to the adjacent areas the higher vulnerability of post fire areas is in accordance with recent findings that during drought years following the wildfires the vulnerability is higher in terms of forest recovery and favored species harvey et al 2016 thus in such areas it is suggested to give higher importance to the impacts component non irrigated grass pasture lands which constitute the vegetation with the greatest extent in the basin were classified among the most vulnerable parts of the basin for the 2012 drought this sdvi finding is in accordance and backed up by the numerous pertinent reports available in the drought impact reporter database the basin is depicted as more vulnerable to drought during august of 2012 which drought slightly dissipates on the next month from the components presented and discussed this slight intensification of about 5000 km2 shifting to the medium vulnerability class table 6 is a result of the combined result of the demand supply spi 6 and impacts components however the straight line borders of vulnerability classes which is not corresponding to natural gradual variation conditions a fact visible in almost all the three months is attributed to the coarser datasets used for the calculation of the demand and supply components of the index this denotes the need for incorporating and testing alternative datasets as they become available with a finer resolution even though recreational and environmental impacts from reservoirs were well portrayed in the pertinent component maps the sdvi calculations display lower vulnerability status of the reservoirs especially in the lower section of the south platte where some reservoirs were completely drained this is mainly because the minimum demand and supply components for recreational environmental uses were not considered in their operation thresholds data need to be incorporated for a more accurate display of the vulnerability levels but such information is not easily accessible lastly the incorporation of medium to high resolution datasets can relate information more effectively to farmers and show how they are doing compared to their neighbors this detailed information could be useful in order to go back and examine all the components of the sdvi in order to prioritize drought mitigation actions in local scale fig 5 illustrates the sdvi results of september 2012 for three areas within the south platte basin in high resolution it is believed that the benefit of the estimation of the index in fine scale reveals local special conditions and could assist drought planning and management hyperspectral instruments that measure hundreds of bands and argued to be the future of remote sensing information could be incorporated to drought studies to indicate for example evapotranspiration anomalies and plant health in farm level 4 conclusions the inherited complexity and uncertainty in the drought phenomenon per se and its multifaceted impacts make the task of their spatiotemporal assessment very challenging many indices have attempted to describe the severity duration frequency and spatial extent of droughts despite the fact that physical and anthropogenic systems are interwoven most of the time the assessments are following a fragmented approach and fail to link structural and socio economic components which are significant in order to portray drought vulnerability drought vulnerability is characterizing the susceptibility of a system s components vulnerability includes both hazards and impacts and it measures the ability to meet demands at a specific time step understanding the weaknesses and interconnections of physical and social systems can lead to informed drought management strategies since there is inherent difficulty and complexity the employment of indices that would incorporate different components of vulnerability is a viable way forward in developing implementable drought management tools sdvi had been conceived and constructed in such a way as to include aspects of physical structural and socio economic systems the south platte basin faces great challenges in water resources management that are further intensified due to extreme events it is an area of data abundance compared to other parts of the world and thus suitable for evolving the sdvi using less qualitative inputs and more detailed quantifiable information thus more accurately approximating the system s vulnerability to drought levels sdvi s original development and application has been assessed in a region of limited data availability and coarse resolution the approach adopted increases the spatial resolution and the transparency and reproducibility of the results are providing a relative measure such that finer scale areas can be compared and assessed in more detail it should be noted that the estimation of the index is difficult to be validated on the ground as in most composite indicators furthermore the individual components can be also validated and compared in different drought events with the goal to provide information to stakeholders and planners of priority actions at different scales farm to basin overall the sdvi results are directly correlated with the spi components since they are constituting one third of the index s value that being said the incorporation of the other index components results is delineating more focused vulnerability to drought levels based on the included societal physical and structural factors making crucial and necessary linkages the sdvi values produced for the south platte basin seems to offer a deeper understanding of vulnerability to drought of the different system s components drought impacts are time varying and most importantly the satellite derived information combined with in situ data and soft data reports is an integrated way to depict vegetation including agricultural crops ecosystem mainly natural vegetation and recreational and aquatic habitat impacts urban areas were classified as least vulnerable along with the forested land uses the irrigated agriculture is showing less vulnerability than vegetation on the plains located outside ditch service areas this is attributed to sdvi s supply component since the capacity to meet crop water requirements within the ditch service areas is potentially greater than outside of it at the same time the impacts measured are greater in the grass and pasture lands than in crops the identification of system s vulnerability to drought in an integrated way is critical to reveal its different contributing underlying causes giving a better understanding of the system s complexities to water planners and managers thus the vulnerability to drought categorization of the system s components based on multiple drought events could lead into triggering targeted actions that could result in a more integrated approach for drought management linking demand supply and impact focused measures and at the same time resulting in improved water and environmental security 
6759,oscillatory pumping tests consist of injecting periodic discharge into an aquifer and measuring head response along vertical piezometers surrounding the well the aim is to identify the specific storativity s and conductivity k of the aquifer which are generally spatially variable recently an analytical solution for oscillating head in a homogeneous formation was derived and applied to the boise aquifer test site rabinovich et al 2015 equivalent properties s eq k eq were identified by best fit of the computed and measured heads here this approach is generalized for heterogeneous aquifers of spatially variable logconductivity y ln k which is modeled as a stationary space random function characterized by k g geometric mean σ y 2 variance i and i v horizontal and vertical integral scales semi analytical solutions are obtained for the mean head amplitude h and phase by a first order approximation in σ y 2 application to a given realization requires a large ratio between the well length and i v as well as availability of a large number of measurements ergodicity we define a correction term ψ representing the impact of heterogeneity on h investigating the dependence of ψ upon the distance from the pumping well reveals the existence of a few regimes namely a near well region in which it is independent of period and far away where the solution pertains to a homogeneous aquifer of effective properties the solution is applied to the boise aquifer test by a best fit of h with the measured head in 3 piezometers for a given value of σ y 2 0 5 in spite of the departure from ergodicity the identification of k g is quite robust and in agreement with previous tests while that of i is subject to uncertainty an additional method for improving the identification of k by conditioning on measured point wise head co kriging is also outlined keywords oscillatory pumping stochastic modelling stochastic inversion boise aquifer aquifer characterization 1 introduction an oscillatory pumping test is a technique which is drawing increased attention as an alternative to the common continuous pumping test hollaender et al 2002 rasmussen et al 2003 renner and messar 2006 cardiff et al 2013a bakhos et al 2014 cardiff and barrash 2015 guiltinan and becker 2015 marco et al 2018 the procedure consists of injecting a time periodic discharge through a pumping well and measuring head response by pressure sensors in surrounding piezometers the aim is to identify the aquifer properties storativity conductivity distribution in space by solving an inverse problem the main advantages are the absence of net discharge which is especially significant in case of polluted aquifers and the possibility to pump at different frequencies allowing to measure head response at larger zones surrounding the well with decreasing frequency this has led to the suggestion of considering the method as a potential hydraulic tomography tool gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 bakhos et al 2014 the inversion approach followed generally in the literature was deterministic and numerical in essence the equations of flow were discretized and the properties at the spatial nodes conductivity k and storativity s were regarded as unknowns to be determined as function of the known heads at the measurement points kitanidis 1996 cardiff et al 2012 while the procedure has shown promise it is computationally demanding and poses problems of identifiability as it is known from the vast literature on the inverse problem yeh 1986 mclaughlin and townley 1996 carrera et al 2005 the procedure adopted here is different and it follows the traditional one pursued for continuous pumping the forward problem for the hydraulic head is solved for given boundary and initial conditions in terms of a few parameters e g k s subsequently they are determined by a best fit with measured heads such a solution for a partially penetrating well of oscillating discharge in a homogeneous and anisotropic formation of finite thickness was presented by dagan and rabinovich 2014 the present paper extends the solution to heterogeneous aquifers of spatially variable properties along the stochastic approach e g indelman 2001 dagan and lessoff 2011 the formation properties primarily the hydraulic conductivity k x are regarded as a realization of a stationary space random function which is characterized by a few statistical moments mean variance integral scales then the approach is to solve the forward problem and to arrive at the dependence of the head moments amplitude and phase on those of the properties as well as on the frequency subsequently the property moments may be determined in principle by a best fit with the observed heads although the objectives are more modest than those pursued by a full inversion the current approach should prove helpful in understanding the processes and forms a starting point for obtaining more general solutions as well as benchmarking numerical solutions this solution is underlain by restricting assumptions like those of stationarity of a priori selected statistical structure e g multi gaussianity and of ergodic properties the possibility to identify moments of the ensemble from the one realization requiring availability of sufficient data the acid test of any method is its application to an actual pumping test for which properties were determined independently such an opportunity is offered by the numerous tests conducted at the boise aquifer site for continuous pumping e g barrash and clemo 1999 2002 barrash et al 2006 these served as field experiments for deterministic inversion kitanidis 1996 cardiff et al 2012 2013a b in the context of oscillatory pumping tests an experiment was recently conducted at the boise site and the solution for a homogeneous aquifer was used in order to arrive at the equivalent values of the properties rabinovich et al 2015 in the present study we derive the solution of the mean head for a heterogeneous aquifer by a first order approximation in the logconductivity variance and we shall examine its applicability to the boise aquifer test the steps we follow which constitute the plan of the paper are i derivation of the basic solution of the mean head for a point source of oscillating strength in an unbounded space domain and isotropic heterogeneity ii generalizations for anisotropic media for line source and confined aquifer of finite thickness iii examination of the local impact of a head measurement on the mean and variance of the logconductivity by co kriging and iv application to the boise experiment 2 definitions and mathematical statement of the problem 2 1 general we follow the definitions and formulation of dagan and rabinovich 2014 extended to a random heterogeneous medium flow is governed by the equation 1 s h t t k h t 0 where h t x t is the head x x y z is a cartesian coordinate t is the time s is the specific storativity assumed to be constant due to its small variability and k x is the spatially variable hydraulic conductivity for a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer k is constant the aquifer

period is discussed by bakhos et al 2014 the complex h the phasor can be written as h h e i ϕ where ϕ x is the phase while it is convenient to operate with h in applications the real part h tr h cos ω t ϕ is to be used for a well radius of r w l we replace the well by distributed sources of strength q w z such that q w 1 l d w d w l q w z dz then the equation satisfied by h t including the well boundary condition becomes 2 s h t t k h t e i ω t d w d w l q w z δ z z dz δ x δ y to be supplemented by the boundary conditions h 0 r and h z 0 for z 0 d pertaining to a confined aquifer the impact of a phreatic boundary condition is discussed in rabinovich et al 2015 we model y ln k x as a stationary space random function of mean y ln k g where stands for ensemble averaging and k g is the geometric mean and variance σ y 2 as usual the two point covariance of axisymmetric anisotropy c y y x y x ξ σ y 2 ρ ξ depends on ξ ξ x 2 ξ y 2 i 2 ξ z 2 i v 2 1 2 where y y y ξ is the lag vector ρ is the auto correlation and i i v are the horizontal and vertical integral scales respectively for a heterogeneous aquifer the flux along the well q w is variable and proportional to k 0 0 z k where k 1

section 4 for a discussion thus with h t he i ω t q w q w k 0 0 z k and k k g e y substituted in 2 and after division by k and taking into account that 1 k x y z δ z z δ x δ y 1 k 0 0 z δ z z δ x δ y the equation satisfied by the phasor h becomes 3 i ω s k g e y h 2 h y h q w k d w d w l δ z z dz δ x δ y the mathematical statement of the problem is then derive the statistical moments of the random

well known approximate approach namely a perturbation expansion h h 0 h 1 h 2 where h 0 o 1 h 1 o y h 2 o y 2 presumably applying to weak heterogeneity σ y 2 1 toward expanding 3 in power series in y we rewrite it as follows see a similar derivation for continuous pumping in dagan and lessoff 2011 i ω s k g 1 y y 2 2 h 0 h 1 h 2 2 h 0 h 1 h 2 y h 0 h 1 h 2 q w k d w d w l δ z z dz δ x δ y

deterministic and represents the solution of flow in a homogeneous aquifer solved by dagan and rabinovich 2014 furthermore h 1 0 since η 1 is linear in y while h 2 q w k h 2 x is proportional to σ y 2 since η 2 is quadratic in y the main aim of the paper is to derive h j j 0 1 2 and primarily the first order approximation in σ y 2 of the mean head h q w k h 0 h 2 while the quantitative result may be valid for weak heterogeneity the analysis may help to grasp the major features of the solution in general 2 2 formulation by the green s function following the steps of dagan and rabinovich 2014 we pursue the general solution of 4 with the aid of the green s function in an infinite domain which satisfies 5 γ 2 k g g 2 g δ x x δ y y δ z z of solution g r 1 4 π r e γ r k g where r x x carslaw and jaeger 1959 we shall also use the dimensionless complex parameter α γ i k g i ω s 1 2 i k g such that in 5 g r 4 π r 1 exp α r i then the general solution of 4 in an infinite domain can be written as follows 6 h j x η j x g x x d x to satisfy the boundary conditions on z 0 d we need to supplement g by the appropriate images across the boundary thus for a confined aquifer the total green s function is given by 7 g t x x m m g r r z z 2 md g r r z z 2 md where the vector r x y is a planar coordinate such that r r x x 2 y y 2 1 2 thus the solution for h 0 in the expression h 0 q w k h 0 is obtained by plugging 7 in 6 with η 0 from 4 and given by 8 h 0 d w d w l g t x y z z dz if we substitute k k g this is precisely the solution of dagan and rabinovich 2014 rabinovich et al 2015 for a homogeneous aquifer of conductivity k g thus h 0 8 is defined in the entire space as a line source over the well supplemented by the appropriate reflections across the boundaries z 0 d in a similar manner we arrive at 9 h 2 y h 1 γ 2 k g y h 1 x x γ 2 k g σ y 2 2 h 0 x g t x x dx dy dz which satisfies 6 leading at first order to h h 0 h 2 q w k h 0 h 2 see dagan and lessoff 2011 for a similar development for phreatic heterogeneous aquifers in the following we concentrate on deriving h 2 by integration in 9 3 the basic solution for a unit source in an unbounded domain 3 1 general it is seen that h 0 8 is a summation of sources of unit strength along the well axis and h 1 h 2 are linear in h 0 eq 4 thus the basic solution contributing to h 0 q w k h 0 is given by 10 h 0 s q w k h 0 s h 0 s g x y z z and h 0 d w d w l h 0 s dz where h 0 s is dimensionless while h 0 s is length 1 subsequently the first order correction to h 0 s becomes 11 h 1 s y h 0 s γ 2 k g y h 0 s x x g x x d x with integration over the entire space in order to arrive at h 2 s we have to plug h 0 s 10 and h 1 s 11 in 9 and average the detailed computations are given in appendix a leading to the final expression a 8 which is reproduced here 12 h 2 s x i σ y 2 d y d 2 ρ ξ d ξ 2 1 y α x y y 2 y 2 x y d ρ ξ d ξ α 1 y α y d ρ ξ d ξ α x y y 2 x y ρ ξ α 3 2 e y α 4 π y e α x y 8 π α 2 e α x 8 π where y y i x x i ξ y 1 2 y 2 2 y 3 2 f 2 1 2 and f i v i the general solution for h 2 s is seen to depend on the logconductivity autocorrelation ρ which has to be specified the computation requires 3 quadratures for an anisotropic axi symmetric ρ and 2 for isotropic ρ the solution generalizes the one for steady flow α 0 obtained by dagan and lessoff 2011 and by severino et al 2008 in the following we proceed with application to isotropic and anisotropic media for gaussian and exponential logconductivity autocorrelations ρ toward this aim it is convenient to operate with the complex function ψ x h 2 σ y 2 h 0 h 2 σ y 2 h 0 such that at first order h q w k h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ see e g iindelman and abramovich 1994 severino et al 2008 dagan and lessoff 2011 hence the dimensionless ψ x represents the effect of heterogeneity on the solution h for a unit source and an infinite isotropic medium ψ s is a function of r i and α where r x 2 y 2 z z 2 1 2 3 2 isotropic media the complex ψ s ψ s r i ψ s i function has been computed by 2 quadratures in appendix a for a gaussian and an exponential ρ respectively 13 ρ g exp π ξ 2 4 ρ e exp ξ starting with the amplitude of h s h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s we can write at first order h s h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s r where ψ s r is the real part of ψ s indeed 1 σ y 2 ψ s 1 σ y 2 ψ s r 2 σ y 4 ψ s i 2 1 2 1 σ y 2 ψ s r 0 σ y 4 in fig 2 a and b we have depicted ψ sg r and ψ se r the real part of ψ s for a gaussian and exponential auto correlation respectively as functions of r i and for a few values of the dimensionless parameter α γ i k g ω s 1 2 i k g the selected range is 0 α 0 7 i e between steady state and the highest considered frequency which was found to be compatible with common data similarly the displayed range of distance is 0 r i 4 since the solution h 0 s decays exponentially with distance for α 0 and it is negligible for r i 4 as illustrated in fig 2 starting with the steady state γ 0 α 0 h 0 s g 1 4 π r analytical solutions were derived in the past dagan and lessoff 2011 severino et al 2008 for ψ s which is real 14 ψ sg 1 3 1 1 π 2 r i 2 e π 4 r i 2 π 2 4 r i 3 erfc π 2 r i ψ se 1 3 1 1 r i 2 r i 2 2 e r i r i 3 2 ei r i for gaussian and exponential ρ 13 respectively the discussion of the results by dagan and lessoff 2011 is retaken here briefly it is seen fig 2 full lines that the solution 14 is made up from two parts the near field for r i r a i and the far field for r i r a i where r a i 2 3 for the gaussian and exponential ρ respectively in the near field ψ sg e are seen to grow from zero up to ψ sg e 1 3 and they remain constant for r r a the results in fig 2 for steady state were interpreted by dagan and lessoff 2011 as follows limiting here the discussion to the far field the solution pertains to a homogeneous medium of effective conductivity in uniform flow k ef k g 1 σ y 2 6 indeed with h s q w k h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s and for k k a k g 1 σ y 2 2 and ψ s 1 3 we arrive at first order at h s q w k g h 0 s 1 σ y 2 6 this is precisely the first order expansion of h s q w k ef h 0 s with h 0 s 1 4 π r we move now to the main objective of the present paper namely the computation of h s for oscillatory pumping γ 0 with h s q w k h 0 s h 2 s q w k h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s where both h 0 s and ψ s are complex we start with the amplitude as already mentioned above at first order it is given by h s q w k h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s r where h 0 s g 1 4 π r exp γ 2 k g r and γ ω s 1 2 in fig 2a and b we have plotted ψ sg r for gaussian ρ g and ψ se r for exponential ρ e derived from 12 as functions of r i for a few values of 0 α 0 7 we may discern now the existence of three zones i a near zone 0 r i r a i r a i 1 5 for which the unsteady ψ s r is close to the steady one for the examined α range in words heterogeneity correction is not affected by unsteadiness which nevertheless impacts h 0 s the solution for a homogeneous medium see fig 2 ii an intermediate zone r a i r i r b i for which ψ s r is non linear and larger than the steady one r b i 2 5 and iii an asymptotic zone r i r b i in which ψ s r grow linearly with r i with a slope depending on α but not on r i or the ρ shape the values of r a i r b i are approximately estimated from direct inspection of fig 2 although the asymptotic zone is of limited interest in applications due to the fast drop of the leading term h 0 s with r fig 2 it is of theoretical interest to discuss it thus in the terminology of the literature on perturbation expansions the expression 1 σ y 2 ψ s r is non uniform since no matter how small is σ y 2 for a sufficiently large r the second term becomes larger than unity the computations based on 12 show that the constant slope is given approximately by α 12 2 for α 0 3 but somewhat smaller for larger α however the leading term h 0 s drops to very small values for α 0 3 and r i 4 fig 2 making it again of little relevance to applications the result for sufficiently low frequencies α 0 3 can be explained similarly to the one pertaining to steady state far from the source the solution is the one prevailing in a homogeneous medium of effective conductivity in mean uniform flow k ef indeed with h s q w k ef 4 π r 1 exp γ r 2 k ef and k ef k g 1 σ y 2 6 expansion of the exponential term leads to exp γ r 2 k ef exp α 2 1 σ y 2 6 r i exp α 2 r i 1 σ y 2 α 12 2 r i and indeed the slope of ψ s r is α 12 2 moving now to the phase of h s h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s the argument of h s is given at first order by arg h 0 s σ y 2 ψ s im the detailed computation based on 12 led to the maximal value ψ s im 0 2 arg h 0 s for r i 4 and α 0 7 therefore the impact of heterogeneity on the phase is quite low and the isotropic aquifer can be regarded as homogeneous for phase estimation 3 3 anisotropic media it is reminded that statistical anisotropy is related to the existence of different integral scale i i v in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the computations leading to the complex h 2 s were carried out on the basis of the same general solution 12 but this time with the argument ξ ξ x 2 ξ y 2 i 2 ξ z 2 i v 2 1 2 substituted in ρ 13 the second order correction h 2 s which is now a function of r x 2 y 2 1 2 z z γ and f i v i 1 is computed by 3 quadratures in 12 with h 0 s 4 π r 1 exp γ k g r pertaining to a homogeneous medium of conductivity k g the correction ψ s h 2 s σ y 2 h 0 s becomes also a function of r i z z i γ k g and f concentrating now on the amplitude h s we have illustrated in fig 3 similarly to fig 2b the dependence of ψ se r on r i for z z 0 for the extreme values of α 0 steady state and maximal α 0 7 as well as for f 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 isotropic medium starting with the steady state α 0 it is seen that the behaviour for f 1 is similar to the isotropic case in the near field r i r a i ψ se r grows from zero and stabilizes to a constant however the value of r a decreases with f i e the transition zone is narrower than for f 1 in the far field r r a the analytical expression of the constant ψ se r is discussed in the sequel similarly to the isotropic case for the oscillatory pumping α 0 ψ se r as function of r i displays three zones in the first one r i r a i the solution is close to the steady solution however its size decreases with the diminishing of the anisotropy ratio f then an intermediate zone r a i r i r b i with r b i 2 of same behavior of non linear growth with r i finally for the asymptotic r i r b i ψ se r grows linearly with r i but with slopes depending on both α and f as for the dependence of ψ se r upon z z for r 0 it is of lesser interest in applications since observation wells are always at a finite r the dependence of ψ se r on z z for a fixed r can be derived by integration in 12 and it is illustrated in fig 5 similar to the isotropic case the plateau values for steady state and the slope for unsteady one can be determined analytically from the solution of flow in a homogeneous medium of local anisotropic effective conductivity in uniform flow toward the derivation we recall the solution of dagan and rabinovich 2014 15 h 0 s 1 4 π r exp γ r k efv with r k efv k efh r 2 z z 2 1 2 where k efh and k efv are the horizontal and vertical effective conductivities in uniform flow starting with the amplitude h s q w k a h 0 s we plugged in 15 the first order approximations for uniform flow k efh k g 1 σ y 2 2 1 λ k efv k g 1 σ y 2 2 2 λ 1 k efv k efh 1 σ y 2 2 3 λ 2 1 k a k g 1 σ y 2 2 where λ f 2 1 f 2 1 f 1 f 2 tan 1 1 f 2 1 1 gelhar and axness 1983 dagan 1989 subsequently after replacing k efh and k efv by their first order approximations we expanded h 0 s 15 in a consistent power series in σ y 2 starting with the steady state γ 0 the result is identical with the one based on the solution of dagan and lessoff 2011 eq 48 and given by h s q w k g h 0 s 1 σ y 2 λ 2 1 2 3 λ 4 r 2 r 2 where h 0 s 1 4 π r hence from the definition here h s q w k a h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s k a k g 1 σ y 2 2 we get at first order h s q w k g h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s 1 2 where ψ s ψ se ψ sg does not depend on the shape of ρ it is seen by comparing the two expressions that for z z 0 and r r ψ s 1 2 λ 4 in the far field and these are the values shown in fig 3 ψ s varies between 1 3 for f 1 λ 2 3 and 1 2 for f 0 λ 0 a similar far field behavior applies to the dependence of the steady state solution upon z z for r 0 not shown here in a similar vein it is found for the periodic case by the expansion of h 0 s 15 that the slope of the linear part for r i r b i is given approximately by α 4 2 1 λ and again these values were found in agreement with those derived by integration displayed in fig 3 for α 0 3 with slight differences for 0 3 α 0 7 the agreement was found to improve for diminishing f it is worthwhile to mention that the slopes vary between α 12 2 for f 1 λ 2 3 to α 4 2 for f 0 λ 0 thus the relative effect of heterogeneity for anisotropic media is larger than for isotropic ones similar trends show up in the solution ψ sg r for the gaussian ρ g ξ for illustration we have represented in fig 4 the solutions for ψ sg r ψ se r for the extreme cases f 0 1 1 and α 0 0 7 where the solution for α 0 and f 1 is given explicitly by 14 it is seen that while the solutions are somewhat different for the isotropic media in the first two zones they become closer similarly to the isotropic the phase is given at first order by arg h s arg h 0 s σ y 2 ψ s im the ratio ψ s im arg h 0 s derived from 12 increases with decreasing f and increasing r i still it does not exceed 0 2 for f 0 1 r i 3 and α 0 7 therefore the phase is dominated by that of h 0 s and heterogeneity effect can be generally neglected as far as phase is concerned though in principle the impact of heterogeneity upon the amplitude is reflected by the magnitude of σ y 2 ψ s r relative to unity what counts is the impact upon the total head h s h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s r thus although ψ s r grows with r i figs 3 and 4 the heterogeneity effect is quite limited for σ y 2 1 due to the steep drop of h 0 s with r i see fig 2 for illustration we present in fig 5 α 0 7 σ y 2 0 5 the dependence of h s and h 0 s upon z z for at a few fixed vertical lines at r i 0 5 1 2 and for different f the selected values for α σ y 2 and r i are relevant to the boise aquifer test discussed in section 6 at any rate this is the starting point for comparison with measured heads in piezometers surrounding the pumping well fig 5 reveals a few findings first the maximal heterogeneity impact at z z 0 across the source occurs for the highest degree of anisotropy f 0 1 secondly both h s and h 0 s and the difference between them drop with increasing r i and z z and can be neglected for practical purposes for say r i 2 and or z z 2 we note that heterogeneity may have a larger impact for large σ y 2 as shown by the derivation of k ef in 1d flow by rabinovich et al 2013 using a different method the extension of the computation of k ef to 3d well flow is a challenging task still to be pursued in the future 4 extension to well of finite length in a confined aquifer we consider first a well of finite length l fig 1 pumping periodically in an unbounded domain the zero order approximation h 0 is given by 8 a distribution of sources of unit strength along the well due to the linear dependence of the higher order approximations see eq 4 upon h 0 h 2 is also obtained by an additional integration of the solution h 2 s 12 for x x y z z over z in the interval d w z d w l fig 1 the zero order approximation is now obtained by integration over z in 8 and 5 which requires a numerical quadrature for γ 0 it simplifies for steady state γ 0 for which the solution has the well known analytical expression h 0 1 4 π ln d w l z r 2 d w l z 2 d w z r 2 d w z 2 for the periodic flow integration over z in h 2 s 12 requires four quadratures that were carried out numerically the correction ψ h 2 σ y 2 h 0 is now a function of the additional parameter l i for illustration we represent in fig 6 the dependence of the real part ψ e r exponential covariance on r i for the centerline z d w l 2 and for a few values of l i this is done for the extreme values f 0 1 1 and α 0 7 it is reminded that mean head amplitude is given at first order by h q w k g h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ r it is seen that the general behaviour is quite similar to that pertaining to a source see fig 3 the next and last step is to account for the no flow boundary condition h z 0 for z 0 d as already indicated above this is achieved by adding to the solution in an unbounded domain images in the z direction across the boundaries see eq 5 due to the exponential decay of h with distance the number of images required in order to ensure convergence even for large r is smaller than for steady state γ 0 to illustrate the impact of boundaries we have depicted in fig 7 the dependence of ψ se r on r i in an unbounded domain as well as a bounded one for α 0 0 7 and different d i for a source at the mid distance z d 2 it is seen that the presence of the impervious boundaries causes an increase of ψ se r relative to the unbounded domain for the smallest d i 4 and is insignificant for d i 10 at this point it is worthwhile to discuss briefly the issue of ergodicity of the average conductivity k 1 l k 0 0 z dz along the pumping well in the general derivations so far we have assumed that the ratio l i v is much larger than unity to allow exchanging k by the arithmetic mean k a numerical simulations firmani et al 2006 for steady flow and a fully penetrating well indicated that ensuring the exchange between k and k a requires a relatively large l i v a similar analysis for oscillating pumping still awaits accurate numerical simulations at present there are a few avenues for accounting for non ergodic behavior first in absence of additional data k a can be regraded as the best estimator of k as done here alternatively k can be regarded as random dagan 1989 of variance depending on l i v a task not undertaken here if in a field test the values of k were sampled along the well k may be regarded as deterministic and the k distribution in the neighborhood of the well can be derived by conditioning kriging this approach which is straightforward and leads to a non stationary y field in the neighborhood of the well is not pursued here either 5 stochastic inversion by conditional averaging co kriging the analysis so far focused on the dependence of the mean head upon the parameters characterizing statistically the aquifer structure k g σ y 2 i f however hydraulic tomography as defined and applied in deterministic inversion has the more ambitious goal of identifying the distribution of the conductivity k in space by using the actual measured values of the head in piezometers surrounding the pumping well a similar goal was pursued in the stochastic frame by the inversion procedure proposed for instance by dagan 1985 the simple idea is to derive first the unconditional covariances c yh x x y x h x and c h x x h x h x where y and h are residuals this can be achieved in the present case by using the first order solution h h 1 q w k h 1 where for a point source in an unbounded domain h 1 s is given by 11 next assuming that a set of head measurements is available e g along vertical piezometers the logconductivity moments y c x σ y 2 c conditioned on measurements are derived by solving first the co kriging system 16 j 1 m μ j x c h x j x k c yh x x k k 1 m where x j are the m points at which head measurements h j are available once the coefficients μ j x are derived by solving 16 the conditional logconductivity first two moments are given by 17 y c x y x j 1 m μ j x h j σ y 2 c x σ y 2 x j 1 m μ j x c yh x x j the procedure was applied by dagan 1985 to steady two dimensional mean uniform flow of constant mean head gradient j h in an unbounded medium characterized by an unconditional exponential isotropic y of auto correlation ρ e 13 in this case the unconditional covariances c h and c yh are stationary depending on x x and have analytical expressions the main objective was to examine the impact of reduction of the conditional variance i e of the uncertainty as quantified by the ratio σ y 2 c x σ y 2 x 1 ideally if the ratio is close to zero the inversion yields a deterministic field y c x y c x to determine the impact of measurement point density dagan 1985 fig 2 considered a square grid of side a and derived the variance reduction factor at the center of a square as function of the ratio a i for conditioning by either measured y or h the striking result was that unlike conditioning by y for which σ y 2 c x σ y 2 x tends to zero with a i 0 even for a very dense grid a i 1 head measurements could reduce the variance ratio to no less than 0 30 a result in line with findings in the literature on the limited effect of head measurements see e g dagan 1989 the procedure could be applied in principle to the oscillatory well flow however while the non stationary cross covariance c yh could be determined by two quadratures for a point source and isotropic y field the head covariance c h x x appearing in 16 needs six quadratures and its computation was not undertaken at present still to get an indication about the impact of head measurements upon identification of y c we consider 3d flow of mean gradient j dh 0 dr in the horizontal direction assumed to be locally uniform and use the analytical expressions c yh and c h derived by dagan 1989 eqs 3 7 8 3 7 12 figs 3 7 3 3 7 4 for isotropic media in order to derive the variance reduction at points in the neighborhood of a row of head measurement points along the vertical this may provide an indication of the impact of head conditioning for oscillatory well flow to be more specific we have considered a row of an even number of measurement points at x 0 y 0 z m i m 0 m m δ z i with m 0 1 2 and variable δ z i and computed the variance reduction σ y 2 c x 0 0 σ y 2 x 0 0 along a horizontal line x 0 the results is symmetrical for x 0 through the origin fig 8 such an analysis was not conducted before for 3d flow for a single measurement point 17 leads to μ 1 c yh x 0 0 σ h 2 and σ y 2 c σ y 2 1 c yh 2 x 0 0 σ h 2 which is represented by the dashed line in fig 8 it is seen that the graph of c yh 2 x 0 0 σ h 2 is similar to that of c yh x 0 0 dagan 1989 fig 3 7 3 c yh 0 for x i 0 and x i 1 and has a minimum around x i 1 4 consequently there is no variance reduction at the origin and far from the head measurement point while the maximal effect is σ y 2 c σ y 2 min 0 92 at x i 1 4 increasing the number of measurement points fig 8 with δ z i 1 leads to a similar behavior though the variance is further reduced and it reaches the maximal reduction σ y 2 c σ y 2 min 0 83 this saturation value is practically reached for m 2 5 conditioning points a slightly negligible larger reduction is achieved for smaller δ z i 0 5 0 25 for a larger number of conditioning points since the conditional variance is reduced to zero at a point of conductivity measurement and increases with distance in a zone of a few integral scales the conclusion is that head measurements along a vertical line in 3d are much less effective than measurements of y in reducing the uncertainty of the identified y c field we plan to extend the computations to the oscillatory well flow configuration in the future still the results for uniform flow indicate that the stochastic inversion by co kriging similar to tomography based on head measurements alone along piezometers is quite ineffective in identifying y 6 application to boise aquifer test the boise aquifer continuous pumping tests as well as their interpretations are discussed in a number of publications e g barrash and clemo 1999 barrash et al 2006 barrash and clemo 2002 cardiff et al 2012 2013b the oscillatory test was analyzed by rabinovich et al 2015 which is the basis of the present discussion one of their main results is summarized in their fig 7a displaying the dependence of the equivalent conductivity k eq on the period t the adopted definition of k eq and s eq is the one of a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer with same geometry and given q w ω which leads to a solution of the head field which provides a best approximation of the measured profiles of the head amplitude and phase in a few piezometers it is reminded that the homogeneous and isotropic aquifer solution for a point source see eq 5 is given by 18 h s hom q w k eq 4 π r 1 2 exp i ω s eq r k eq with r x 2 y 2 z z 2 1 2 while for the pumping well h hom is obtained by integrating over z along the well supplemented by the images across the boundaries after identifying the storativity s eq from the phase analysis rabinovich et al 2015 determined k eq by minimizing the difference between h hom and the measured head amplitude profiles in a few piezometers toward generalization of the procedure for heterogeneous aquifers along the present study we shall recall a few relevant features of the boise aquifer test thus pumping took place along 3 segments of length l 1 m at 3 different elevations in the pumping well the oscillating head response was measured along the selected 3 piezometers at distances r 3 75 m 6 26 m 10 55 m with ports at a distance of δ z 2 m along them the setup is depicted in of rabinovich et al 2015 fig 2 examination of the head amplitude profiles indicate that only some of them resemble the theoretical ones either for homogeneous or the mean head for heterogeneous these are the profiles associated with the mid interval in the pumping well for which d w 8 m the 9 profiles for the three piezometers and 3 frequencies are represented in fig 5a of rabinovich et al 2015 and we shall carry out the analysis for these ones solely the tests for these profiles were carried out at 3 frequencies ω 2 π t with t 28 5 40 69 s respectively the values of k eq identified by rabinovich et al 2015 and represented in their fig 7a are k eq 3 8 10 4 3 7 10 4 3 8 10 4 m s for t 28 5 40 69 s respectively this was achieved by using the experimental head profiles h as function of z represented in their fig 5a for the 3 values of r and the 3 values of t altogether 9 profiles for each t k eq was determined by a best fit of the theoretical and measured profiles simultaneously for the 3 piezometers differing in r the closeness of the resulting values of k eq is indeed an indication that the frequency impact is well accounted for by the theory in the specific range of t the identified s eq 10 5 m 1 varies also little with t rabinovich et al 2015 fig 5b we proceed now with the use of same 9 measured head profiles for the heterogeneous aquifer analysis by a similar procedure of best fit of the theoretical mean head amplitude h h 0 h 2 h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ e r and measurements it is important to mention that the length l of the pumping intervals relative to the vertical integral scale i v which was found to be around 1 2 m in previous investigations of the aquifer is much smaller than the one required in order to exchange the mean spatial k along the well with k a as assumed in the present theoretical derivations furthermore even if one would try to condition on the actual k we are not aware of available information about k distribution along the pumping well we are inclined to assume that k for the middle interval is closer to k a than for the others besides this assumption comparing the one realization limited set of measurements with the theoretical head ensemble mean is quite far reaching and the analysis shall be regarded as an illustrative one unlike the model of a homogeneous aquifer in which the only unknown parameters were s eq and k eq by adopting the assumption of isotropy used by rabinovich et al 2015 the theoretical mean amplitude h depends on s k g σ y 2 and i since the phase of h was shown to be insensitive to heterogeneity we adopt the value of s s eq 10 5 m 1 identified by rabinovich et al 2015 fig 7b based on phase analysis for a homogeneous aquifer due to the relatively small difference between the theoretical head profiles for a homogeneous aquifer and a heterogeneous one see fig 5 there are problems of identifiability of the 3 remaining parameters we limited therefore the search to the integral scale i after adopting values obtained independently by past analysis for the other two parameters thus we took σ y 2 0 5 cited by rabinovich et al 2015 this choice is motivated by practical considerations while k g and σ y 2 can be determined by analyzing samples of k along a few vertical profiles identification of i requires a variogram analysis in the horizontal direction which is based on a large number of observation wells and is much more difficult to achieve subsequently the analysis was conducted in the spirit of rabinovich et al 2015 as follows by plugging in the expression of the theoretical mean amplitude h h 0 h 2 h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ e pertaining to the boise data i e the pumping interval of length l 1 m in the confined aquifer of thickness d 19 m centered at an elevation of d w l 2 10 m beneath the top fig 1 the aforementioned values of s and σ y 2 h becomes a function of t r z and k g i we have derived the dependence of i upon k g by a best fit of the theoretical and measured profiles for the 3 values of r simultaneously and for each t the result is presented in fig 9 it is seen that the 3 graphs display similar trends but with a difference between the largest t 69 s and the other two however the maximal range 2 6 10 4 m s k g 3 4 10 4 m s is relatively narrow compared with values of k derived by different methods as summarized in table 2 in barrash and cardiff 2013 furthermore if we regard k eq 3 8 10 4 m s identified by rabinovich et al 2015 as an effective value k ef and assume that it is related to k g by the first order approximation for a stratified formation due to large weight of the head measurements in the closest piezometer at r 3 75 m k ef k a k g 1 σ y 2 2 we arrive at k g 3 10 4 m s this value is close to the one determined in the past by the tracer test nelson 2007 and confirmed by the hydraulic tomography cardiff et al 2012 for this value the corresponding range of integral scales in fig 9 is 7 m i 12 m which is compatible with those determined independently by cardiff and barrash 2011 and barrash and cardiff 2013 it is also seen that the identified i value is quite sensitive to that of k g and the latter should be based on analysis of measured k profiles rather than indirectly from hydraulic tests in any case while the identification of the range of k g values is quite robust and in agreement with the analysis based on the homogeneous aquifer model for the present conditions that of i is subjected to uncertainty we have also plotted in fig 10 the measured h profiles identical to those of rabinovich et al 2015 fig 5a the theoretical ones h o and h as well as the ones pertaining to a homogeneous aquifer of k eq it is emphasized that the best fit leading to k eq was carried out simultaneously for the 3 values of r and not just r 3 75 m as presented as it is expectable the theoretical h and those based on homogeneous of k eq are very close in contrast the difference between h o and h illustrate the impact of heterogeneity 7 summary and conclusions the present study is a direct continuation of the paper by dagan and rabinovich 2014 which derived the spatial distribution of the head phasor for a partially penetrating oscillatory pumping well in a homogeneous and confined aquifer of constant conductivity k and specific storativity s the present paper extends the solution to a spatially variable y ln k which in the stochastic context is regarded as a realization of a random and stationary space function the latter is parametrized by the geometric mean k g the variance σ y 2 and two point covariance exponential or gaussian characterized by the horizontal and vertical integral scales i and i v respectively the solution for the phasor expected value h is obtained by a first order approximation in σ y 2 applicable to weakly heterogeneous aquifers the solution is expressed by h h 0 h 2 h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ where h 0 pertains to a homogeneous aquifer of conductivity k g while the correction ψ h 2 h 0 depends on the spatial coordinates as well as on ω 2 π t s k g i and f i v i where t is the period the main theoretical result is the derivation of the function ψ in terms of a few quadratures by using the basic solution for a point source in an unbounded domain its integration along the length of the screen of the pumping well supplemented by appropriate images across the assumed impervious boundaries leads to the complete expression of h a first finding was that ψ has a minor effect upon the phase of h and therefore the diffusivity can be determined from that of h 0 by using the homogeneous aquifer solution precisely like in rabinovich et al 2015 the study was focused subsequently on the amplitude h h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ r the behavior of the real part ψ r which contributes to the amplitude at first order as a function of distance from the well was explored for different configurations generally the solution pertains to a homogeneous aquifer of conductivity k a the arithmetic mean near the well which is the assumed boundary condition and it varies with distance tending to the solution of a homogeneous aquifer of effective conductivity far from the well however due to the fast decay of h 0 with distance from the well for not very large periods the far field behavior may not be reached as a by product it is possible to derive the first order approximation of the two point head logconductivity and head covariances these can be used in order to condition the values of y upon measurements of h by co kriging in the spirit of the hydraulic tomography this task is outlined but not undertaken here to get an indication of the impact of measured h values upon the uncertainty of y an analysis is carried out for the first time for steady 3d uniform flow the result is that h measurements have little impact on reducing the uncertainty of conditioned y a future study for well flow shall elucidate the issue for non uniform flow finally we have applied the theoretical results to the boise aquifer test by demanding that the amplitude of the measured h in 3 selected profiles is equal to the one based on the theoretical mean head by assuming known values of previously determined s k eq and σ y 2 we have been able to identify the integral scale i for an isotropic medium as function of the period t the values are in a range compatible with independent previously derived values in spite of the many simplifying assumptions we conclude that the stochastic approach allows to gain understanding of the dependence of the head field on the various parameters characterizing the oscillatory pumping and the aquifer the application to boise aquifer test and inversion leads to reasonable range of values of the identified geometric mean k g while that of the integral scale i is quite sensitive to the choice of k g declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

6759,oscillatory pumping tests consist of injecting periodic discharge into an aquifer and measuring head response along vertical piezometers surrounding the well the aim is to identify the specific storativity s and conductivity k of the aquifer which are generally spatially variable recently an analytical solution for oscillating head in a homogeneous formation was derived and applied to the boise aquifer test site rabinovich et al 2015 equivalent properties s eq k eq were identified by best fit of the computed and measured heads here this approach is generalized for heterogeneous aquifers of spatially variable logconductivity y ln k which is modeled as a stationary space random function characterized by k g geometric mean σ y 2 variance i and i v horizontal and vertical integral scales semi analytical solutions are obtained for the mean head amplitude h and phase by a first order approximation in σ y 2 application to a given realization requires a large ratio between the well length and i v as well as availability of a large number of measurements ergodicity we define a correction term ψ representing the impact of heterogeneity on h investigating the dependence of ψ upon the distance from the pumping well reveals the existence of a few regimes namely a near well region in which it is independent of period and far away where the solution pertains to a homogeneous aquifer of effective properties the solution is applied to the boise aquifer test by a best fit of h with the measured head in 3 piezometers for a given value of σ y 2 0 5 in spite of the departure from ergodicity the identification of k g is quite robust and in agreement with previous tests while that of i is subject to uncertainty an additional method for improving the identification of k by conditioning on measured point wise head co kriging is also outlined keywords oscillatory pumping stochastic modelling stochastic inversion boise aquifer aquifer characterization 1 introduction an oscillatory pumping test is a technique which is drawing increased attention as an alternative to the common continuous pumping test hollaender et al 2002 rasmussen et al 2003 renner and messar 2006 cardiff et al 2013a bakhos et al 2014 cardiff and barrash 2015 guiltinan and becker 2015 marco et al 2018 the procedure consists of injecting a time periodic discharge through a pumping well and measuring head response by pressure sensors in surrounding piezometers the aim is to identify the aquifer properties storativity conductivity distribution in space by solving an inverse problem the main advantages are the absence of net discharge which is especially significant in case of polluted aquifers and the possibility to pump at different frequencies allowing to measure head response at larger zones surrounding the well with decreasing frequency this has led to the suggestion of considering the method as a potential hydraulic tomography tool gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 bakhos et al 2014 the inversion approach followed generally in the literature was deterministic and numerical in essence the equations of flow were discretized and the properties at the spatial nodes conductivity k and storativity s were regarded as unknowns to be determined as function of the known heads at the measurement points kitanidis 1996 cardiff et al 2012 while the procedure has shown promise it is computationally demanding and poses problems of identifiability as it is known from the vast literature on the inverse problem yeh 1986 mclaughlin and townley 1996 carrera et al 2005 the procedure adopted here is different and it follows the traditional one pursued for continuous pumping the forward problem for the hydraulic head is solved for given boundary and initial conditions in terms of a few parameters e g k s subsequently they are determined by a best fit with measured heads such a solution for a partially penetrating well of oscillating discharge in a homogeneous and anisotropic formation of finite thickness was presented by dagan and rabinovich 2014 the present paper extends the solution to heterogeneous aquifers of spatially variable properties along the stochastic approach e g indelman 2001 dagan and lessoff 2011 the formation properties primarily the hydraulic conductivity k x are regarded as a realization of a stationary space random function which is characterized by a few statistical moments mean variance integral scales then the approach is to solve the forward problem and to arrive at the dependence of the head moments amplitude and phase on those of the properties as well as on the frequency subsequently the property moments may be determined in principle by a best fit with the observed heads although the objectives are more modest than those pursued by a full inversion the current approach should prove helpful in understanding the processes and forms a starting point for obtaining more general solutions as well as benchmarking numerical solutions this solution is underlain by restricting assumptions like those of stationarity of a priori selected statistical structure e g multi gaussianity and of ergodic properties the possibility to identify moments of the ensemble from the one realization requiring availability of sufficient data the acid test of any method is its application to an actual pumping test for which properties were determined independently such an opportunity is offered by the numerous tests conducted at the boise aquifer site for continuous pumping e g barrash and clemo 1999 2002 barrash et al 2006 these served as field experiments for deterministic inversion kitanidis 1996 cardiff et al 2012 2013a b in the context of oscillatory pumping tests an experiment was recently conducted at the boise site and the solution for a homogeneous aquifer was used in order to arrive at the equivalent values of the properties rabinovich et al 2015 in the present study we derive the solution of the mean head for a heterogeneous aquifer by a first order approximation in the logconductivity variance and we shall examine its applicability to the boise aquifer test the steps we follow which constitute the plan of the paper are i derivation of the basic solution of the mean head for a point source of oscillating strength in an unbounded space domain and isotropic heterogeneity ii generalizations for anisotropic media for line source and confined aquifer of finite thickness iii examination of the local impact of a head measurement on the mean and variance of the logconductivity by co kriging and iv application to the boise experiment 2 definitions and mathematical statement of the problem 2 1 general we follow the definitions and formulation of dagan and rabinovich 2014 extended to a random heterogeneous medium flow is governed by the equation 1 s h t t k h t 0 where h t x t is the head x x y z is a cartesian coordinate t is the time s is the specific storativity assumed to be constant due to its small variability and k x is the spatially variable hydraulic conductivity for a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer k is constant the aquifer is assumed to be unbounded horizontally and of thickness d such that d z 0 the pumping well of length l is located at x 0 y 0 and along d w z d w l fig 1 flow is driven by a time periodic discharge q w e i ω t where q w q w total l is constant and real ω 2 π t is the frequency and t the period we assume that pumping takes a sufficient time so that h t h x e i ω t is also harmonic the transient period is discussed by bakhos et al 2014 the complex h the phasor can be written as h h e i ϕ where ϕ x is the phase while it is convenient to operate with h in applications the real part h tr h cos ω t ϕ is to be used for a well radius of r w l we replace the well by distributed sources of strength q w z such that q w 1 l d w d w l q w z dz then the equation satisfied by h t including the well boundary condition becomes 2 s h t t k h t e i ω t d w d w l q w z δ z z dz δ x δ y to be supplemented by the boundary conditions h 0 r and h z 0 for z 0 d pertaining to a confined aquifer the impact of a phreatic boundary condition is discussed in rabinovich et al 2015 we model y ln k x as a stationary space random function of mean y ln k g where stands for ensemble averaging and k g is the geometric mean and variance σ y 2 as usual the two point covariance of axisymmetric anisotropy c y y x y x ξ σ y 2 ρ ξ depends on ξ ξ x 2 ξ y 2 i 2 ξ z 2 i v 2 1 2 where y y y ξ is the lag vector ρ is the auto correlation and i i v are the horizontal and vertical integral scales respectively for a heterogeneous aquifer the flux along the well q w is variable and proportional to k 0 0 z k where k 1 l d w d w l k 0 0 z dz this boundary condition approximately ensures that the head is uniform along the well screen indelman and dagan 2004 firmani et al 2006 for l i v k k a the arithmetic mean see section 4 for a discussion thus with h t he i ω t q w q w k 0 0 z k and k k g e y substituted in 2 and after division by k and taking into account that 1 k x y z δ z z δ x δ y 1 k 0 0 z δ z z δ x δ y the equation satisfied by the phasor h becomes 3 i ω s k g e y h 2 h y h q w k d w d w l δ z z dz δ x δ y the mathematical statement of the problem is then derive the statistical moments of the random h satisfying 3 in terms of those of y this is a difficult problem which was solved by monte carlo simulations for steady flow ω 0 and a fully penetrating well e g firmani et al 2006 here we pursue a well known approximate approach namely a perturbation expansion h h 0 h 1 h 2 where h 0 o 1 h 1 o y h 2 o y 2 presumably applying to weak heterogeneity σ y 2 1 toward expanding 3 in power series in y we rewrite it as follows see a similar derivation for continuous pumping in dagan and lessoff 2011 i ω s k g 1 y y 2 2 h 0 h 1 h 2 2 h 0 h 1 h 2 y h 0 h 1 h 2 q w k d w d w l δ z z dz δ x δ y collecting terms of same order in y leads to a sequence of poisson equations for h j as follows 4 γ 2 k g h j 2 h j η j x j 0 1 2 η 0 q w k d w d w l δ z z dz δ x δ y η 1 y h 0 γ 2 k g y h 0 η 2 y h 1 γ 2 k g y h 1 γ 2 k g y 2 2 h 0 where γ i ω s 1 2 1 i ω s 2 1 2 is assumed to be constant eq 4 is supplemented with the boundary conditions h j z 0 for z 0 d it is seen that h 0 q w k h 0 x is deterministic and represents the solution of flow in a homogeneous aquifer solved by dagan and rabinovich 2014 furthermore h 1 0 since η 1 is linear in y while h 2 q w k h 2 x is proportional to σ y 2 since η 2 is quadratic in y the main aim of the paper is to derive h j j 0 1 2 and primarily the first order approximation in σ y 2 of the mean head h q w k h 0 h 2 while the quantitative result may be valid for weak heterogeneity the analysis may help to grasp the major features of the solution in general 2 2 formulation by the green s function following the steps of dagan and rabinovich 2014 we pursue the general solution of 4 with the aid of the green s function in an infinite domain which satisfies 5 γ 2 k g g 2 g δ x x δ y y δ z z of solution g r 1 4 π r e γ r k g where r x x carslaw and jaeger 1959 we shall also use the dimensionless complex parameter α γ i k g i ω s 1 2 i k g such that in 5 g r 4 π r 1 exp α r i then the general solution of 4 in an infinite domain can be written as follows 6 h j x η j x g x x d x to satisfy the boundary conditions on z 0 d we need to supplement g by the appropriate images across the boundary thus for a confined aquifer the total green s function is given by 7 g t x x m m g r r z z 2 md g r r z z 2 md where the vector r x y is a planar coordinate such that r r x x 2 y y 2 1 2 thus the solution for h 0 in the expression h 0 q w k h 0 is obtained by plugging 7 in 6 with η 0 from 4 and given by 8 h 0 d w d w l g t x y z z dz if we substitute k k g this is precisely the solution of dagan and rabinovich 2014 rabinovich et al 2015 for a homogeneous aquifer of conductivity k g thus h 0 8 is defined in the entire space as a line source over the well supplemented by the appropriate reflections across the boundaries z 0 d in a similar manner we arrive at 9 h 2 y h 1 γ 2 k g y h 1 x x γ 2 k g σ y 2 2 h 0 x g t x x dx dy dz which satisfies 6 leading at first order to h h 0 h 2 q w k h 0 h 2 see dagan and lessoff 2011 for a similar development for phreatic heterogeneous aquifers in the following we concentrate on deriving h 2 by integration in 9 3 the basic solution for a unit source in an unbounded domain 3 1 general it is seen that h 0 8 is a summation of sources of unit strength along the well axis and h 1 h 2 are linear in h 0 eq 4 thus the basic solution contributing to h 0 q w k h 0 is given by 10 h 0 s q w k h 0 s h 0 s g x y z z and h 0 d w d w l h 0 s dz where h 0 s is dimensionless while h 0 s is length 1 subsequently the first order correction to h 0 s becomes 11 h 1 s y h 0 s γ 2 k g y h 0 s x x g x x d x with integration over the entire space in order to arrive at h 2 s we have to plug h 0 s 10 and h 1 s 11 in 9 and average the detailed computations are given in appendix a leading to the final expression a 8 which is reproduced here 12 h 2 s x i σ y 2 d y d 2 ρ ξ d ξ 2 1 y α x y y 2 y 2 x y d ρ ξ d ξ α 1 y α y d ρ ξ d ξ α x y y 2 x y ρ ξ α 3 2 e y α 4 π y e α x y 8 π α 2 e α x 8 π where y y i x x i ξ y 1 2 y 2 2 y 3 2 f 2 1 2 and f i v i the general solution for h 2 s is seen to depend on the logconductivity autocorrelation ρ which has to be specified the computation requires 3 quadratures for an anisotropic axi symmetric ρ and 2 for isotropic ρ the solution generalizes the one for steady flow α 0 obtained by dagan and lessoff 2011 and by severino et al 2008 in the following we proceed with application to isotropic and anisotropic media for gaussian and exponential logconductivity autocorrelations ρ toward this aim it is convenient to operate with the complex function ψ x h 2 σ y 2 h 0 h 2 σ y 2 h 0 such that at first order h q w k h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ see e g iindelman and abramovich 1994 severino et al 2008 dagan and lessoff 2011 hence the dimensionless ψ x represents the effect of heterogeneity on the solution h for a unit source and an infinite isotropic medium ψ s is a function of r i and α where r x 2 y 2 z z 2 1 2 3 2 isotropic media the complex ψ s ψ s r i ψ s i function has been computed by 2 quadratures in appendix a for a gaussian and an exponential ρ respectively 13 ρ g exp π ξ 2 4 ρ e exp ξ starting with the amplitude of h s h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s we can write at first order h s h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s r where ψ s r is the real part of ψ s indeed 1 σ y 2 ψ s 1 σ y 2 ψ s r 2 σ y 4 ψ s i 2 1 2 1 σ y 2 ψ s r 0 σ y 4 in fig 2 a and b we have depicted ψ sg r and ψ se r the real part of ψ s for a gaussian and exponential auto correlation respectively as functions of r i and for a few values of the dimensionless parameter α γ i k g ω s 1 2 i k g the selected range is 0 α 0 7 i e between steady state and the highest considered frequency which was found to be compatible with common data similarly the displayed range of distance is 0 r i 4 since the solution h 0 s decays exponentially with distance for α 0 and it is negligible for r i 4 as illustrated in fig 2 starting with the steady state γ 0 α 0 h 0 s g 1 4 π r analytical solutions were derived in the past dagan and lessoff 2011 severino et al 2008 for ψ s which is real 14 ψ sg 1 3 1 1 π 2 r i 2 e π 4 r i 2 π 2 4 r i 3 erfc π 2 r i ψ se 1 3 1 1 r i 2 r i 2 2 e r i r i 3 2 ei r i for gaussian and exponential ρ 13 respectively the discussion of the results by dagan and lessoff 2011 is retaken here briefly it is seen fig 2 full lines that the solution 14 is made up from two parts the near field for r i r a i and the far field for r i r a i where r a i 2 3 for the gaussian and exponential ρ respectively in the near field ψ sg e are seen to grow from zero up to ψ sg e 1 3 and they remain constant for r r a the results in fig 2 for steady state were interpreted by dagan and lessoff 2011 as follows limiting here the discussion to the far field the solution pertains to a homogeneous medium of effective conductivity in uniform flow k ef k g 1 σ y 2 6 indeed with h s q w k h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s and for k k a k g 1 σ y 2 2 and ψ s 1 3 we arrive at first order at h s q w k g h 0 s 1 σ y 2 6 this is precisely the first order expansion of h s q w k ef h 0 s with h 0 s 1 4 π r we move now to the main objective of the present paper namely the computation of h s for oscillatory pumping γ 0 with h s q w k h 0 s h 2 s q w k h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s where both h 0 s and ψ s are complex we start with the amplitude as already mentioned above at first order it is given by h s q w k h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s r where h 0 s g 1 4 π r exp γ 2 k g r and γ ω s 1 2 in fig 2a and b we have plotted ψ sg r for gaussian ρ g and ψ se r for exponential ρ e derived from 12 as functions of r i for a few values of 0 α 0 7 we may discern now the existence of three zones i a near zone 0 r i r a i r a i 1 5 for which the unsteady ψ s r is close to the steady one for the examined α range in words heterogeneity correction is not affected by unsteadiness which nevertheless impacts h 0 s the solution for a homogeneous medium see fig 2 ii an intermediate zone r a i r i r b i for which ψ s r is non linear and larger than the steady one r b i 2 5 and iii an asymptotic zone r i r b i in which ψ s r grow linearly with r i with a slope depending on α but not on r i or the ρ shape the values of r a i r b i are approximately estimated from direct inspection of fig 2 although the asymptotic zone is of limited interest in applications due to the fast drop of the leading term h 0 s with r fig 2 it is of theoretical interest to discuss it thus in the terminology of the literature on perturbation expansions the expression 1 σ y 2 ψ s r is non uniform since no matter how small is σ y 2 for a sufficiently large r the second term becomes larger than unity the computations based on 12 show that the constant slope is given approximately by α 12 2 for α 0 3 but somewhat smaller for larger α however the leading term h 0 s drops to very small values for α 0 3 and r i 4 fig 2 making it again of little relevance to applications the result for sufficiently low frequencies α 0 3 can be explained similarly to the one pertaining to steady state far from the source the solution is the one prevailing in a homogeneous medium of effective conductivity in mean uniform flow k ef indeed with h s q w k ef 4 π r 1 exp γ r 2 k ef and k ef k g 1 σ y 2 6 expansion of the exponential term leads to exp γ r 2 k ef exp α 2 1 σ y 2 6 r i exp α 2 r i 1 σ y 2 α 12 2 r i and indeed the slope of ψ s r is α 12 2 moving now to the phase of h s h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s the argument of h s is given at first order by arg h 0 s σ y 2 ψ s im the detailed computation based on 12 led to the maximal value ψ s im 0 2 arg h 0 s for r i 4 and α 0 7 therefore the impact of heterogeneity on the phase is quite low and the isotropic aquifer can be regarded as homogeneous for phase estimation 3 3 anisotropic media it is reminded that statistical anisotropy is related to the existence of different integral scale i i v in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the computations leading to the complex h 2 s were carried out on the basis of the same general solution 12 but this time with the argument ξ ξ x 2 ξ y 2 i 2 ξ z 2 i v 2 1 2 substituted in ρ 13 the second order correction h 2 s which is now a function of r x 2 y 2 1 2 z z γ and f i v i 1 is computed by 3 quadratures in 12 with h 0 s 4 π r 1 exp γ k g r pertaining to a homogeneous medium of conductivity k g the correction ψ s h 2 s σ y 2 h 0 s becomes also a function of r i z z i γ k g and f concentrating now on the amplitude h s we have illustrated in fig 3 similarly to fig 2b the dependence of ψ se r on r i for z z 0 for the extreme values of α 0 steady state and maximal α 0 7 as well as for f 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 isotropic medium starting with the steady state α 0 it is seen that the behaviour for f 1 is similar to the isotropic case in the near field r i r a i ψ se r grows from zero and stabilizes to a constant however the value of r a decreases with f i e the transition zone is narrower than for f 1 in the far field r r a the analytical expression of the constant ψ se r is discussed in the sequel similarly to the isotropic case for the oscillatory pumping α 0 ψ se r as function of r i displays three zones in the first one r i r a i the solution is close to the steady solution however its size decreases with the diminishing of the anisotropy ratio f then an intermediate zone r a i r i r b i with r b i 2 of same behavior of non linear growth with r i finally for the asymptotic r i r b i ψ se r grows linearly with r i but with slopes depending on both α and f as for the dependence of ψ se r upon z z for r 0 it is of lesser interest in applications since observation wells are always at a finite r the dependence of ψ se r on z z for a fixed r can be derived by integration in 12 and it is illustrated in fig 5 similar to the isotropic case the plateau values for steady state and the slope for unsteady one can be determined analytically from the solution of flow in a homogeneous medium of local anisotropic effective conductivity in uniform flow toward the derivation we recall the solution of dagan and rabinovich 2014 15 h 0 s 1 4 π r exp γ r k efv with r k efv k efh r 2 z z 2 1 2 where k efh and k efv are the horizontal and vertical effective conductivities in uniform flow starting with the amplitude h s q w k a h 0 s we plugged in 15 the first order approximations for uniform flow k efh k g 1 σ y 2 2 1 λ k efv k g 1 σ y 2 2 2 λ 1 k efv k efh 1 σ y 2 2 3 λ 2 1 k a k g 1 σ y 2 2 where λ f 2 1 f 2 1 f 1 f 2 tan 1 1 f 2 1 1 gelhar and axness 1983 dagan 1989 subsequently after replacing k efh and k efv by their first order approximations we expanded h 0 s 15 in a consistent power series in σ y 2 starting with the steady state γ 0 the result is identical with the one based on the solution of dagan and lessoff 2011 eq 48 and given by h s q w k g h 0 s 1 σ y 2 λ 2 1 2 3 λ 4 r 2 r 2 where h 0 s 1 4 π r hence from the definition here h s q w k a h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s k a k g 1 σ y 2 2 we get at first order h s q w k g h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s 1 2 where ψ s ψ se ψ sg does not depend on the shape of ρ it is seen by comparing the two expressions that for z z 0 and r r ψ s 1 2 λ 4 in the far field and these are the values shown in fig 3 ψ s varies between 1 3 for f 1 λ 2 3 and 1 2 for f 0 λ 0 a similar far field behavior applies to the dependence of the steady state solution upon z z for r 0 not shown here in a similar vein it is found for the periodic case by the expansion of h 0 s 15 that the slope of the linear part for r i r b i is given approximately by α 4 2 1 λ and again these values were found in agreement with those derived by integration displayed in fig 3 for α 0 3 with slight differences for 0 3 α 0 7 the agreement was found to improve for diminishing f it is worthwhile to mention that the slopes vary between α 12 2 for f 1 λ 2 3 to α 4 2 for f 0 λ 0 thus the relative effect of heterogeneity for anisotropic media is larger than for isotropic ones similar trends show up in the solution ψ sg r for the gaussian ρ g ξ for illustration we have represented in fig 4 the solutions for ψ sg r ψ se r for the extreme cases f 0 1 1 and α 0 0 7 where the solution for α 0 and f 1 is given explicitly by 14 it is seen that while the solutions are somewhat different for the isotropic media in the first two zones they become closer similarly to the isotropic the phase is given at first order by arg h s arg h 0 s σ y 2 ψ s im the ratio ψ s im arg h 0 s derived from 12 increases with decreasing f and increasing r i still it does not exceed 0 2 for f 0 1 r i 3 and α 0 7 therefore the phase is dominated by that of h 0 s and heterogeneity effect can be generally neglected as far as phase is concerned though in principle the impact of heterogeneity upon the amplitude is reflected by the magnitude of σ y 2 ψ s r relative to unity what counts is the impact upon the total head h s h 0 s 1 σ y 2 ψ s r thus although ψ s r grows with r i figs 3 and 4 the heterogeneity effect is quite limited for σ y 2 1 due to the steep drop of h 0 s with r i see fig 2 for illustration we present in fig 5 α 0 7 σ y 2 0 5 the dependence of h s and h 0 s upon z z for at a few fixed vertical lines at r i 0 5 1 2 and for different f the selected values for α σ y 2 and r i are relevant to the boise aquifer test discussed in section 6 at any rate this is the starting point for comparison with measured heads in piezometers surrounding the pumping well fig 5 reveals a few findings first the maximal heterogeneity impact at z z 0 across the source occurs for the highest degree of anisotropy f 0 1 secondly both h s and h 0 s and the difference between them drop with increasing r i and z z and can be neglected for practical purposes for say r i 2 and or z z 2 we note that heterogeneity may have a larger impact for large σ y 2 as shown by the derivation of k ef in 1d flow by rabinovich et al 2013 using a different method the extension of the computation of k ef to 3d well flow is a challenging task still to be pursued in the future 4 extension to well of finite length in a confined aquifer we consider first a well of finite length l fig 1 pumping periodically in an unbounded domain the zero order approximation h 0 is given by 8 a distribution of sources of unit strength along the well due to the linear dependence of the higher order approximations see eq 4 upon h 0 h 2 is also obtained by an additional integration of the solution h 2 s 12 for x x y z z over z in the interval d w z d w l fig 1 the zero order approximation is now obtained by integration over z in 8 and 5 which requires a numerical quadrature for γ 0 it simplifies for steady state γ 0 for which the solution has the well known analytical expression h 0 1 4 π ln d w l z r 2 d w l z 2 d w z r 2 d w z 2 for the periodic flow integration over z in h 2 s 12 requires four quadratures that were carried out numerically the correction ψ h 2 σ y 2 h 0 is now a function of the additional parameter l i for illustration we represent in fig 6 the dependence of the real part ψ e r exponential covariance on r i for the centerline z d w l 2 and for a few values of l i this is done for the extreme values f 0 1 1 and α 0 7 it is reminded that mean head amplitude is given at first order by h q w k g h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ r it is seen that the general behaviour is quite similar to that pertaining to a source see fig 3 the next and last step is to account for the no flow boundary condition h z 0 for z 0 d as already indicated above this is achieved by adding to the solution in an unbounded domain images in the z direction across the boundaries see eq 5 due to the exponential decay of h with distance the number of images required in order to ensure convergence even for large r is smaller than for steady state γ 0 to illustrate the impact of boundaries we have depicted in fig 7 the dependence of ψ se r on r i in an unbounded domain as well as a bounded one for α 0 0 7 and different d i for a source at the mid distance z d 2 it is seen that the presence of the impervious boundaries causes an increase of ψ se r relative to the unbounded domain for the smallest d i 4 and is insignificant for d i 10 at this point it is worthwhile to discuss briefly the issue of ergodicity of the average conductivity k 1 l k 0 0 z dz along the pumping well in the general derivations so far we have assumed that the ratio l i v is much larger than unity to allow exchanging k by the arithmetic mean k a numerical simulations firmani et al 2006 for steady flow and a fully penetrating well indicated that ensuring the exchange between k and k a requires a relatively large l i v a similar analysis for oscillating pumping still awaits accurate numerical simulations at present there are a few avenues for accounting for non ergodic behavior first in absence of additional data k a can be regraded as the best estimator of k as done here alternatively k can be regarded as random dagan 1989 of variance depending on l i v a task not undertaken here if in a field test the values of k were sampled along the well k may be regarded as deterministic and the k distribution in the neighborhood of the well can be derived by conditioning kriging this approach which is straightforward and leads to a non stationary y field in the neighborhood of the well is not pursued here either 5 stochastic inversion by conditional averaging co kriging the analysis so far focused on the dependence of the mean head upon the parameters characterizing statistically the aquifer structure k g σ y 2 i f however hydraulic tomography as defined and applied in deterministic inversion has the more ambitious goal of identifying the distribution of the conductivity k in space by using the actual measured values of the head in piezometers surrounding the pumping well a similar goal was pursued in the stochastic frame by the inversion procedure proposed for instance by dagan 1985 the simple idea is to derive first the unconditional covariances c yh x x y x h x and c h x x h x h x where y and h are residuals this can be achieved in the present case by using the first order solution h h 1 q w k h 1 where for a point source in an unbounded domain h 1 s is given by 11 next assuming that a set of head measurements is available e g along vertical piezometers the logconductivity moments y c x σ y 2 c conditioned on measurements are derived by solving first the co kriging system 16 j 1 m μ j x c h x j x k c yh x x k k 1 m where x j are the m points at which head measurements h j are available once the coefficients μ j x are derived by solving 16 the conditional logconductivity first two moments are given by 17 y c x y x j 1 m μ j x h j σ y 2 c x σ y 2 x j 1 m μ j x c yh x x j the procedure was applied by dagan 1985 to steady two dimensional mean uniform flow of constant mean head gradient j h in an unbounded medium characterized by an unconditional exponential isotropic y of auto correlation ρ e 13 in this case the unconditional covariances c h and c yh are stationary depending on x x and have analytical expressions the main objective was to examine the impact of reduction of the conditional variance i e of the uncertainty as quantified by the ratio σ y 2 c x σ y 2 x 1 ideally if the ratio is close to zero the inversion yields a deterministic field y c x y c x to determine the impact of measurement point density dagan 1985 fig 2 considered a square grid of side a and derived the variance reduction factor at the center of a square as function of the ratio a i for conditioning by either measured y or h the striking result was that unlike conditioning by y for which σ y 2 c x σ y 2 x tends to zero with a i 0 even for a very dense grid a i 1 head measurements could reduce the variance ratio to no less than 0 30 a result in line with findings in the literature on the limited effect of head measurements see e g dagan 1989 the procedure could be applied in principle to the oscillatory well flow however while the non stationary cross covariance c yh could be determined by two quadratures for a point source and isotropic y field the head covariance c h x x appearing in 16 needs six quadratures and its computation was not undertaken at present still to get an indication about the impact of head measurements upon identification of y c we consider 3d flow of mean gradient j dh 0 dr in the horizontal direction assumed to be locally uniform and use the analytical expressions c yh and c h derived by dagan 1989 eqs 3 7 8 3 7 12 figs 3 7 3 3 7 4 for isotropic media in order to derive the variance reduction at points in the neighborhood of a row of head measurement points along the vertical this may provide an indication of the impact of head conditioning for oscillatory well flow to be more specific we have considered a row of an even number of measurement points at x 0 y 0 z m i m 0 m m δ z i with m 0 1 2 and variable δ z i and computed the variance reduction σ y 2 c x 0 0 σ y 2 x 0 0 along a horizontal line x 0 the results is symmetrical for x 0 through the origin fig 8 such an analysis was not conducted before for 3d flow for a single measurement point 17 leads to μ 1 c yh x 0 0 σ h 2 and σ y 2 c σ y 2 1 c yh 2 x 0 0 σ h 2 which is represented by the dashed line in fig 8 it is seen that the graph of c yh 2 x 0 0 σ h 2 is similar to that of c yh x 0 0 dagan 1989 fig 3 7 3 c yh 0 for x i 0 and x i 1 and has a minimum around x i 1 4 consequently there is no variance reduction at the origin and far from the head measurement point while the maximal effect is σ y 2 c σ y 2 min 0 92 at x i 1 4 increasing the number of measurement points fig 8 with δ z i 1 leads to a similar behavior though the variance is further reduced and it reaches the maximal reduction σ y 2 c σ y 2 min 0 83 this saturation value is practically reached for m 2 5 conditioning points a slightly negligible larger reduction is achieved for smaller δ z i 0 5 0 25 for a larger number of conditioning points since the conditional variance is reduced to zero at a point of conductivity measurement and increases with distance in a zone of a few integral scales the conclusion is that head measurements along a vertical line in 3d are much less effective than measurements of y in reducing the uncertainty of the identified y c field we plan to extend the computations to the oscillatory well flow configuration in the future still the results for uniform flow indicate that the stochastic inversion by co kriging similar to tomography based on head measurements alone along piezometers is quite ineffective in identifying y 6 application to boise aquifer test the boise aquifer continuous pumping tests as well as their interpretations are discussed in a number of publications e g barrash and clemo 1999 barrash et al 2006 barrash and clemo 2002 cardiff et al 2012 2013b the oscillatory test was analyzed by rabinovich et al 2015 which is the basis of the present discussion one of their main results is summarized in their fig 7a displaying the dependence of the equivalent conductivity k eq on the period t the adopted definition of k eq and s eq is the one of a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer with same geometry and given q w ω which leads to a solution of the head field which provides a best approximation of the measured profiles of the head amplitude and phase in a few piezometers it is reminded that the homogeneous and isotropic aquifer solution for a point source see eq 5 is given by 18 h s hom q w k eq 4 π r 1 2 exp i ω s eq r k eq with r x 2 y 2 z z 2 1 2 while for the pumping well h hom is obtained by integrating over z along the well supplemented by the images across the boundaries after identifying the storativity s eq from the phase analysis rabinovich et al 2015 determined k eq by minimizing the difference between h hom and the measured head amplitude profiles in a few piezometers toward generalization of the procedure for heterogeneous aquifers along the present study we shall recall a few relevant features of the boise aquifer test thus pumping took place along 3 segments of length l 1 m at 3 different elevations in the pumping well the oscillating head response was measured along the selected 3 piezometers at distances r 3 75 m 6 26 m 10 55 m with ports at a distance of δ z 2 m along them the setup is depicted in of rabinovich et al 2015 fig 2 examination of the head amplitude profiles indicate that only some of them resemble the theoretical ones either for homogeneous or the mean head for heterogeneous these are the profiles associated with the mid interval in the pumping well for which d w 8 m the 9 profiles for the three piezometers and 3 frequencies are represented in fig 5a of rabinovich et al 2015 and we shall carry out the analysis for these ones solely the tests for these profiles were carried out at 3 frequencies ω 2 π t with t 28 5 40 69 s respectively the values of k eq identified by rabinovich et al 2015 and represented in their fig 7a are k eq 3 8 10 4 3 7 10 4 3 8 10 4 m s for t 28 5 40 69 s respectively this was achieved by using the experimental head profiles h as function of z represented in their fig 5a for the 3 values of r and the 3 values of t altogether 9 profiles for each t k eq was determined by a best fit of the theoretical and measured profiles simultaneously for the 3 piezometers differing in r the closeness of the resulting values of k eq is indeed an indication that the frequency impact is well accounted for by the theory in the specific range of t the identified s eq 10 5 m 1 varies also little with t rabinovich et al 2015 fig 5b we proceed now with the use of same 9 measured head profiles for the heterogeneous aquifer analysis by a similar procedure of best fit of the theoretical mean head amplitude h h 0 h 2 h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ e r and measurements it is important to mention that the length l of the pumping intervals relative to the vertical integral scale i v which was found to be around 1 2 m in previous investigations of the aquifer is much smaller than the one required in order to exchange the mean spatial k along the well with k a as assumed in the present theoretical derivations furthermore even if one would try to condition on the actual k we are not aware of available information about k distribution along the pumping well we are inclined to assume that k for the middle interval is closer to k a than for the others besides this assumption comparing the one realization limited set of measurements with the theoretical head ensemble mean is quite far reaching and the analysis shall be regarded as an illustrative one unlike the model of a homogeneous aquifer in which the only unknown parameters were s eq and k eq by adopting the assumption of isotropy used by rabinovich et al 2015 the theoretical mean amplitude h depends on s k g σ y 2 and i since the phase of h was shown to be insensitive to heterogeneity we adopt the value of s s eq 10 5 m 1 identified by rabinovich et al 2015 fig 7b based on phase analysis for a homogeneous aquifer due to the relatively small difference between the theoretical head profiles for a homogeneous aquifer and a heterogeneous one see fig 5 there are problems of identifiability of the 3 remaining parameters we limited therefore the search to the integral scale i after adopting values obtained independently by past analysis for the other two parameters thus we took σ y 2 0 5 cited by rabinovich et al 2015 this choice is motivated by practical considerations while k g and σ y 2 can be determined by analyzing samples of k along a few vertical profiles identification of i requires a variogram analysis in the horizontal direction which is based on a large number of observation wells and is much more difficult to achieve subsequently the analysis was conducted in the spirit of rabinovich et al 2015 as follows by plugging in the expression of the theoretical mean amplitude h h 0 h 2 h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ e pertaining to the boise data i e the pumping interval of length l 1 m in the confined aquifer of thickness d 19 m centered at an elevation of d w l 2 10 m beneath the top fig 1 the aforementioned values of s and σ y 2 h becomes a function of t r z and k g i we have derived the dependence of i upon k g by a best fit of the theoretical and measured profiles for the 3 values of r simultaneously and for each t the result is presented in fig 9 it is seen that the 3 graphs display similar trends but with a difference between the largest t 69 s and the other two however the maximal range 2 6 10 4 m s k g 3 4 10 4 m s is relatively narrow compared with values of k derived by different methods as summarized in table 2 in barrash and cardiff 2013 furthermore if we regard k eq 3 8 10 4 m s identified by rabinovich et al 2015 as an effective value k ef and assume that it is related to k g by the first order approximation for a stratified formation due to large weight of the head measurements in the closest piezometer at r 3 75 m k ef k a k g 1 σ y 2 2 we arrive at k g 3 10 4 m s this value is close to the one determined in the past by the tracer test nelson 2007 and confirmed by the hydraulic tomography cardiff et al 2012 for this value the corresponding range of integral scales in fig 9 is 7 m i 12 m which is compatible with those determined independently by cardiff and barrash 2011 and barrash and cardiff 2013 it is also seen that the identified i value is quite sensitive to that of k g and the latter should be based on analysis of measured k profiles rather than indirectly from hydraulic tests in any case while the identification of the range of k g values is quite robust and in agreement with the analysis based on the homogeneous aquifer model for the present conditions that of i is subjected to uncertainty we have also plotted in fig 10 the measured h profiles identical to those of rabinovich et al 2015 fig 5a the theoretical ones h o and h as well as the ones pertaining to a homogeneous aquifer of k eq it is emphasized that the best fit leading to k eq was carried out simultaneously for the 3 values of r and not just r 3 75 m as presented as it is expectable the theoretical h and those based on homogeneous of k eq are very close in contrast the difference between h o and h illustrate the impact of heterogeneity 7 summary and conclusions the present study is a direct continuation of the paper by dagan and rabinovich 2014 which derived the spatial distribution of the head phasor for a partially penetrating oscillatory pumping well in a homogeneous and confined aquifer of constant conductivity k and specific storativity s the present paper extends the solution to a spatially variable y ln k which in the stochastic context is regarded as a realization of a random and stationary space function the latter is parametrized by the geometric mean k g the variance σ y 2 and two point covariance exponential or gaussian characterized by the horizontal and vertical integral scales i and i v respectively the solution for the phasor expected value h is obtained by a first order approximation in σ y 2 applicable to weakly heterogeneous aquifers the solution is expressed by h h 0 h 2 h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ where h 0 pertains to a homogeneous aquifer of conductivity k g while the correction ψ h 2 h 0 depends on the spatial coordinates as well as on ω 2 π t s k g i and f i v i where t is the period the main theoretical result is the derivation of the function ψ in terms of a few quadratures by using the basic solution for a point source in an unbounded domain its integration along the length of the screen of the pumping well supplemented by appropriate images across the assumed impervious boundaries leads to the complete expression of h a first finding was that ψ has a minor effect upon the phase of h and therefore the diffusivity can be determined from that of h 0 by using the homogeneous aquifer solution precisely like in rabinovich et al 2015 the study was focused subsequently on the amplitude h h 0 1 σ y 2 ψ r the behavior of the real part ψ r which contributes to the amplitude at first order as a function of distance from the well was explored for different configurations generally the solution pertains to a homogeneous aquifer of conductivity k a the arithmetic mean near the well which is the assumed boundary condition and it varies with distance tending to the solution of a homogeneous aquifer of effective conductivity far from the well however due to the fast decay of h 0 with distance from the well for not very large periods the far field behavior may not be reached as a by product it is possible to derive the first order approximation of the two point head logconductivity and head covariances these can be used in order to condition the values of y upon measurements of h by co kriging in the spirit of the hydraulic tomography this task is outlined but not undertaken here to get an indication of the impact of measured h values upon the uncertainty of y an analysis is carried out for the first time for steady 3d uniform flow the result is that h measurements have little impact on reducing the uncertainty of conditioned y a future study for well flow shall elucidate the issue for non uniform flow finally we have applied the theoretical results to the boise aquifer test by demanding that the amplitude of the measured h in 3 selected profiles is equal to the one based on the theoretical mean head by assuming known values of previously determined s k eq and σ y 2 we have been able to identify the integral scale i for an isotropic medium as function of the period t the values are in a range compatible with independent previously derived values in spite of the many simplifying assumptions we conclude that the stochastic approach allows to gain understanding of the dependence of the head field on the various parameters characterizing the oscillatory pumping and the aquifer the application to boise aquifer test and inversion leads to reasonable range of values of the identified geometric mean k g while that of the integral scale i is quite sensitive to the choice of k g declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
