15035,drinking water treatment residual dwtr derived from flocculation and sedimentation of raw water using aluminum coagulants is a valuable environmental remediation byproduct capable of inactivating phosphorus p however no generalizable model exists in the literature to describe reduction of releasable mobile p in lake sediment as a result of dwtr addition the reduction of mobile p sum of labile p and reductant soluble p was investigated in over 100 sub samples using five sediment samples from two lakes and three dwtrs from different water treatment plants a consistent relationship was determined across a range of mobile p contents 0 23 g m2 cm to 0 92 g m2 cm or 15 8 to 186 1 µg g dw and dwtrs the relationship was best described as a function of the mobile p content of the sediment and the oxalate extractable aluminum content of the dwtr an empirical model was developed to predict the immediate reduction in mobile p following the addition of dwtr containing aluminum this model was validated using two additional lake sediments and one additional dwtr r² 0 995 thus the immediate inactivation of p in lake sediment following dwtr addition can be predicted with this model which can be used with internal p loading or other water quality goals to determine an appropriate dwtr dose further recommendations were made about dosing dwtrs for lake restoration allowing practitioners to use dwtr to inactivate p in lake sediment without conducting individual sorption experiments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algae alum sludge cyanobacteria eutrophication langmuir isotherm water quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a result of anthropogenic activities many freshwater lakes around the world have elevated levels of phosphorus p in their sediments bhagowati and ahamad 2019 this elevated sediment p or legacy sediment p is a source of internal p loading søndergaard et al 2013 tammeorg et al 2022 that increases surface water p concentrations driving eutrophic conditions and the associated negative consequences including frequent harmful algal blooms dubey and dutta 2020 zamparas and zacharias 2014 a common strategy for reducing internal p loading from sediment and restoring eutrophic lakes has been the application of p immobilizing materials wang and jiang 2016 these p immobilizing materials bind with p to form stable minerals thereby reducing the amount of p available in the lake ecosystem agstam norlin et al 2020 several p immobilizing materials have been proposed kelly vargas and qi 2019 to date the most common is aluminum al salts which have been used for more than five decades in lake treatments around the world huser et al 2016b however global supply chain issues and changing consumptions patterns have led to global metal shortages li et al 2022 including shortages of the critical coagulant aluminum sulfate alum used in drinking water treatment therefore it is imperative to have alternative p immobilizing materials several of which have been proposed including lanthanum modified bentonites copetti et al 2016 calcium minerals yin and kong 2015 zeolites yang et al 2015 and drinking water treatment residual dwtr wang et al 2013b among these only dwtrs have the advantage of being a recycled material that is available anywhere tap water is produced which means less impact on global metal supply and the environment zhao et al 2021 dwtr the sludge byproduct generated during the production of drinking water and commonly landfilled as a waste product turner et al 2019 is a particularly attractive option as a p immobilizing material wang et al 2021 several studies have demonstrated that dwtrs can immobilize p in lake sediment and reduce internal p loading ichihara and nishio 2013 wang et al 2017 2013a the key component of dwtr that is associated with p sorption is its content of oxalate extractable al alox and fe feox kuster et al 2021 which primarily represents amorphous forms of the minerals bertsch and bloom 1996 dwtrs that are derived from coagulation using an al and or fe salt contain high levels of alox and feox al tahmazi and babatunde 2016 bai et al 2014 however reliably determining an appropriate dose of dwtr to immobilize p in lake sediment remains a barrier to field application proposed dosing methods in the literature have been based on a mass ratio of dwtr to lake sediment e g 10 w w wang et al 2012 yuan et al 2016c or a linear relationship to determine the amount of alox and feox needed to immobilize a specified amount of mobile p pmob wang et al 2013c another study suggested that most pmob could be immobilized once the amount of alox and feox exceeded a minimum concentration in the sediment shen et al 2020 none of the above dosing methodologies sufficiently account for the inherent variability of the dwtr p sorption capacity and sediment pmob content therefore existing dosing methodologies are unable to predict the remaining pmob in lake sediment following application of dwtr across a wide range of pmob and alox feox conditions in addition they don t account for other factors that have been shown to be important when immobilizing p in lake sediment for example the ratio of p binding with al salts is dependent on sediment density the depth of the active sediment layer and the targeted p pool kuster et al 2020 therefore the ability to predict the remaining pmob and thus remaining internal p loading following addition of dwtr to lake sediment remains limited this knowledge gap is notable when compared to the broad amount of literature discussing dosing methodologies for pure al salts kuster et al 2020 including a predictive model huser and pilgrim 2014 thus the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate how the addition of dwtr to lake sediment affected the reduction of pmob in lake sediment 2 to determine if this relationship was consistent over a broad range of pmob content and types of dwtrs and 3 to develop a predictive model that could overcome the dosing limitations described above five lake sediment samples from two lakes were treated with three dwtr samples from three different water treatment plants at multiple doses to create 130 individual samples to elucidate the relationship between dwtr and p binding in sediment the model was then validated with additional lake sediment and dwtr not used in the model calibration 2 methods and materials 2 1 dwtr sampling preparation and characterization dwtrs were collected from four different water treatment plants that supply domestic water in northeast thailand each plant used alum al2 so4 3 h2o polyaluminum chloride al2 oh ncl6 n m or a combination of the two coagulants with varying concentrations depending on the changing raw water quality raw dwtr was collected directly from the sedimentation tanks or from the adjacent drainage canal during regular emptying of the sedimentation tanks placed into plastic containers and transported back to the laboratory the dwtr was dried in an oven at 105 c for 48 72 h to dewater the dwtr the dewatered dwtr was ground and sieved to 150 µm sieve 100 the processed dwtr was then heat treated in oxygen limited conditions at 600 c in a muffle furnace isolab laborgeräte gmbh eschau germany under n₂ atmosphere for 6 h oxygen limited heat treatment greater than 400 c and longer than 4 h has been shown to improve adsorptive properties stabilize metals and reduce nitrogen leaching kuster et al 2021 wang et al 2016 each dwtr was analyzed for metals using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes following digestion with nitric acid and perchloric acid epa method 3050b total n and total p were determined using the dumas method with dry combustion and icp oes following microwave digestion epa method 3052 respectively specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined using the brunauer emmett teller bet theory and adsorption desorption isotherms generated with n₂ at 77 k from relative pressure p p0 from 0 to 1 belsorp mini x microtracbel osaka japan the concentrations of oxalate extractable fe al and p feox alox and pox respectively were determined using icp oes following extraction with 0 2 m ammonium oxalate and 0 2 m oxalic acid adjusted to ph 3 at a ratio of 100 ml g using an orbital shaker for 4 h dayton and basta 2005 the p saturation index psi was calculated according to the ratio of pox to the sum of feox and alox dayton and basta 2005 2 2 sediment sampling and characterization lake sediment was sampled from beung nong khot lake 16 25 50 n 102 47 55 e which is a hypereutrophic lake total p 0 1 mg l chlorophyll a 100 800 µg l typically dominated by microcystis and cylindrospermopsis genera of cyanobacteria kuster et al 2021 thongdam et al 2021 and from beung gii lake 16 26 00 n 102 45 34 e which is a shallow polymictic lake that is also hypereutrophic total p 0 1 mg l chlorophyll a 140 850 µg l and dominated by various cyanobacteria kuster et al 2020 a handheld pvc gravity sediment coring device davis and steinman 1998 was used to collect sediment cores 30 cm in july 2022 from three locations in beung nong khot lake and two locations in beung gii lake the top 10 cm of the sediment core were collected in the lab homogenized and refrigerated at 4 c a fourth and fifth sample were collected from different locations in beung nong khot lake using a grab sampler which was also homogenized and stored in refrigeration generating a total of seven sediment samples sequential extraction of p was conducted for each homogenized sediment sample following the method described by psenner et al 1988 and modified by hupfer et al 1995 to determine labile p di water extraction reductant soluble p fe p 0 11 m bicarbonate dithionite extraction ligand exchangeable p al p 0 1 m naoh extraction ca bound p ca p 0 5 m hcl extraction and organic p difference between naoh extraction digested with potassium persulfate and al p with one modification the extraction time for the first extraction di water was extended to 48 h instead of the standard 2 h the lengthened extraction time was used to provide consistent conditions to all other experiments which required a 48 hour contact time before starting sequential p extraction each extraction was performed in duplicate with average values used pmob was calculated as the sum of labile p and fe p water content was determined by oven drying at 105 c for 48 h and sediment density was calculated from water content according to håkanson and jansson 1983 2 3 phosphate sorption batch experiments the dried treated dwtrs were added to 15 ml centrifuge tubes at two different masses approximately 60 and 100 mg and mixed with 10 ml of 10 mg p l phosphate solution created from h₂po₄ standard solution each mass was performed in duplicate the tubes were shaken stored at room temperature 25 c for 48 h and then centrifuged at 500x g for 10 min the supernatant was sampled and analyzed for p concentration using ascorbic acid colorimetric spectrophotometry the amount of p sorbed to the dwtr was determined as the reduction in p the dwtr was then analyzed for labile p fe p al p and ca p according to the sequential p extraction technique described above the changes in p fractions following p sorption i e the fate of the phosphate solution were determined by comparing results to controls of dwtrs dissolved in di water 2 4 sediment p immobilization with dwtr dwtr addition experiments were conducted in duplicate using the five lake sediment samples and three dwtrs individual suspensions of dwtr were created for each pair of lake sediment and dwtr n 15 such that each provided the mass of alox and feox that was approximately 100 200 times the pmob in the target sediment then an aliquot of the dwtr suspension 0 1 2 5 5 or 10 ml was added to a 15 ml centrifuge tube containing wet sediment 250 mg wet weight such that the added mass of alox and feox was assessed at five different ratios including 0 control relative to the mass of pmob in the sediment di water was added to each centrifuge tube to fill to 10 ml the tubes were shaken and stored for 48 h at room temperature 25 c then centrifuged at 500x g next the sediment was analyzed using the modified sequential p extraction method described above in which the supernatant from the 48 hour equilibrium period was considered the first di water extraction the amount of sediment p sorbed by each dwtr dose was calculated as the reduction in pmob δpmob relative to the untreated control where pmob is the sum of labile p and fe p 2 5 development of empirical p binding model for dwtr the sorption of pmob to dwtr was modeled for each pair of dwtr and sediment using a one surface langmuir isotherm the langmuir isotherm has been widely applied to describe p sorption of dwtrs hou et al 2018 kuster et al 2020 with the ability to describe the rapid initial sorption that is mostly associated with ligand exchange makris et al 2004 for the 48 hour experiment a one surface isotherm that incorporated the ratio of sorbent to sorbate was used eq 1 1 q q m k r 1 k r where q is the amount of p sorbed according to the isotherm µmol g dw qm is the maximum p sorption µmol g dw r is the ratio µmol µmol of sorbent µmol g dw to sorbate initial pmob content in sediment µmol g dw and k is an adsorption constant g g the nash sutcliffe model efficiency measure e was calculated to assess goodness of fit nash and sutcliffe 1970 the values of qm and k were determined by maximizing e using the generalized reduced gradient solver within microsoft excel bolster and hornberger 2007 two sorption models were developed for each dwtr sediment pair considering two possible sorbents first the sorption was modeled as a function of alox only and second as the sum of alox and feox the ratio of sorbent δpmob unitless was calculated for each dwtr dose as mmol m2 cm or g m² cm from the langmuir isotherm the units of g m² cm represent a mass per volume manipulated into a form to facilitate dosing calculations then the dwtr dose required to achieve specific sorbent δpmob ratios e g 100 200 etc were interpolated from the measured ratios according to the isotherm for example one lake sediment with an initial mobile p concentration of 0 48 g p m² cm was treated in two experimental dosages of dwtr one with 8 9 g alox m² cm and a second with 22 1 g alox m² cm the ratios of alox δpmob from those two experiments were 65 0 and 106 9 respectively therefore the dose of alox needed to achieve a ratio of alox δpmob can be interpolated from the data to be 19 9 g alox m² cm for a sediment with initial pmob of 0 48 g p m² cm a dataset of dwtr doses needed to achieve specified sorbent δpmob ratios as a function of the initial pmob concentration in the sediment was generated from over 100 such experiments linear regression of these data was then used to generate empirical models that predict the dwtr doses necessary to achieve specific sorbent δpmob ratios according to the initial pmob content of the sediment huser and pilgrim 2014 kuster et al 2020 these empirical models were then used to predict the reduction in pmob following the addition of dwtr 2 6 model validation after the empirical model was developed two lake sediment samples and one dwtr were used to validate the model by conducting sediment p immobilization experiments neither the dwtr nor the lake sediments were used in the calibration of the model dwtr was added to lake sediment at several doses following the methods described above the predicted δpmob was calculated based on the model according to the dwtr dose using linear interpolation between specified ratios the predicted δpmob was compared to the measured δpmob residuals difference between predicted and measured δpmob were calculated for each dwtr dosage three validation statistics were calculated using the residuals including r² standard deviation of the residuals and mean of the absolute values of residuals the model was considered acceptably validated when these values were greater than 95 less than 10 of the range of observed values and less than 5 of the range of observed values respectively bias was assessed by plotting the residuals against model values to identify trends 3 results and discussion 3 1 physio chemical characterization of dwtrs all four dwtrs consisted primarily of al 119 900 mg kg to 289 100 mg kg and fe 36 650 mg kg to 87 000 mg kg table 1 eight of the ten heavy metals regulated by u s epa s part 503 regulations on land application of biosolids were analyzed u s epa 1994 in every dwtr these eight metals were below the pollution concentration limits for high quality biosolids required for land application raw dwtrs generated from water treatment plants using al based coagulants typically have al and fe contents ranging from 50 000 to 122 000 mg kg and 9750 to 28 300 mg kg respectively al tahmazi and babatunde 2016 ippolito 2015 therefore the al and fe contents in these treated dwtrs were higher than that of raw dwtrs which is expected following the oxygen limited heat treatment heat treatment substantially increases the relative concentration of al and fe kuster et al 2021 by pyrolyzing organic matter wang et al 2016 which typically comprises 100 000 300 000 mg kg of dwtrs zhao et al 2018 the contents of other metals were also representative of typical values of dwtrs babatunde and zhao 2007 because dwtrs consist primarily of the sediment in the raw water intake for the water treatment plant and the added coagulants heavy metal concentrations are similar to those found in natural sediments shen et al 2019 the three dwtrs used in the model calibration experiments ms ud and unkk represented a wide range of alox 1 92 to 6 49 mmol g 51 9 to 175 0 mg g and feox contents 0 22 to 0 82 mmol g 12 4 to 45 8 mg g table 1 the dwtr used in validation bp had alox and feox concentrations within these ranges the ud dwtr had the highest alox and feox concentrations other studies using dwtrs for p immobilization have reported alox and feox concentrations ranging from 24 to 165 mg g 0 88 to 6 11 mmol g and 0 1 to 21 4 mg g 0 001 to 0 38 mmol g respectively al tahmazi and babatunde 2016 dayton and basta 2005 kuster et al 2021 wang et al 2013c therefore these dwtrs were representative of typical dwtrs generated from drinking water production using al coagulants with ud dwtr having feox content higher than that of dwtrs that used only al based coagulants the psi for each dwtr was between 0 54 and 1 38 the adsorption desorption isotherms supplemental figure s1 for the dwtrs were classified as reversible type ii isotherms while the isotherm for the ud dwtr also included a type h3 hysteresis loop thommes et al 2015 thus the results of the n2 adsorption desorption analyses indicated that most of the pore space in the dwtrs was macroporous with some narrow interconnected pore spaces bet analyses of similar dwtrs collected from northeast thailand have also found that dwtrs are macroporous with the 600 c pyrolysis pre treatment that was used in these dwtrs having only minor effects on the pore structure kuster et al 2021 the ud dwtr also had the highest specific surface area according to bet theory 163 3 m2 g specific surface area which typically ranges from 5 to 100 m² g in raw dwtrs has been shown to be associated with p sorption makris et al 2005 xu et al 2020 the pre treatment pyrolysis likely increased specific surface area via increased aromaticity of the organic matter wang et al 2016 pre treatment with pyrolysis is not necessary for every dwtr in some cases dwtr can be used for environmental application without any pre treatment depending on the raw water source and coagulants used kuster et al 2022 however pyrolysis has been shown to increase p sorption create more stable forms of organic matter and reduce leaching of metals and nitrogen kuster et al 2021 wang et al 2018 2016 the drawback to pyrolysis is the economic and technical feasibility slow rate pyrolysis at 600 c requires substantial energy inputs and specialized commercial pyrolysis systems sørmo et al 2020 3 2 phosphorus fractions following sorption to dwtrs following the addition of 10 ml of phosphate solution with a concentration of 10 mg p l i e 0 1 mg of p to 60 or 100 mg of dwtr it was expected that nearly all the phosphate solution would be sorbed as determined by how much p remained in solution following equilibrium this hypothesis was confirmed in all three calibration dwtrs with only the lowest dose of the ms dwtr 60 mg having a non negligible amount p remaining in solution 7 7 of p added to the assays fig 1 the fate of the sorbed p was determined by p fractionation very little of the sorbed p was observed as an increase of fe p 0 9 to 6 3 of p added to the assay thus 79 to 99 of sorbed p was recovered as an increase in al p or ca p in some cases such as ud 100 and unkk 100 around 15 to 20 of the p was not recovered by inorganic components of sequential p extraction i e residual or organic p this result may be explained by at least three potential phenomenon first while some of the increase in ca p was likely the result of p binding with calcium and other minerals such as magnesium or manganese in the dwtr the increase of ca p may also be an artifact of the sequential p fractionation procedure in the naoh step which measures al p the extraction requires a high ph to release ligand exchangeable p hupfer et al 1995 psenner et al 1988 this high ph can create an artificial conversion of al p to ca p huser and pilgrim 2014 secondly organic acids present in the dwtrs may have caused the formation of precipitate that interfered with naoh step de vicente et al 2008b james 2011 thirdly because these samples were spiked with phosphate the amount of ligand exchangeable and ca bound p was higher than natural sediments generating concentrations higher than intended for the extraction method thus some of the p that was removed from solution may be missing from the extractions because no more p was able to enter the extraction solution thus these results have two implications first the reduction in pmob δpmob is the preferable measure of p inactivation in lake sediment as opposed to increases in al p ca p using δpmob is a common approach that has been taken in past studies using al salts huser and pilgrim 2014 kuster et al 2020 secondly despite the dwtrs containing feox p sorption generated substantially lower amounts of fe p compared to al p the molar ratio of alox to feox in these dwtrs was 7 9 to 9 4 in the ud and unkk dwtrs however the increase in al p relative to the increase in fe p was much higher ratio of 27 to 63 interestingly the increase of the al p fe p ratio was around 7 in the ms dwtr this dwtr had the lowest alox and feox concentrations and had the highest amount of p remaining in solution thus the ms dwtr likely reached its p sorption capacity these results indicated that p may preferentially sorb with alox and only begin to substantially sorb with feox once most alox sorption sites are occupied phosphate has been sown to preferentially sorb to alox instead of feox yan et al 2015 especially at higher doses eriksson et al 2015 notably most studies that related p sorption to the combination of both alox and feox used high concentrations of p 10 mg p l which would have created conditions whereby the p had already exceeded its preferential adsorption with alox bai et al 2014 bal krishna et al 2016 dayton and basta 2005 kuster et al 2021 a final consideration about the nature of these dwtrs is their inherent p content total p in these dwtrs ranged from 1000 to 5500 mg kg which is higher than most lake sediments table 1 the form of the p however is critical to determining whether that p can become biologically available and thus counteract the intended outcome sequential fractionation of the p in these dwtrs without the addition of phosphate solution found that less than 1 of the p was extractable as pmob with 51 to 71 of total p being recovered via extraction as al p and ca p supplementary table s1 p in the dwtrs was likely fixed into stable mineral forms or transformed into stable organic compounds during pyrolysis wang et al 2018 furthermore very little of the p was extractable using the strong oxalate extraction method pox overall the psi was less than around 1 5 in the dwtrs psi is a good indicator of p leachability in soils with values less than 12 5 associated with negligible p leaching maguire and sims 2002 however further long term research may be warranted to confirm that inherent p in dwtr will not be introduced to the lake system following application to lake sediments 3 3 modeling phosphorus inactivation in lake sediments by dwtr the five lake sediment samples included a range of pmob concentrations from low 0 23 g m2 cm to high 0 92 g m2 cm table 2 these concentrations were in the lower and middle range of pmob values reported for sediments of eutrophic lakes 0 04 to 2 8 g m2 cm huser and pilgrim 2014 and represented a wider range of pmob concentrations than most dosing studies using dwtrs wang et al 2013c or al salts de vicente et al 2008a following the addition of dwtr to these lake sediments the pmob concentration declined i e more δpmob as p was inactivated via conversion to al p or ca p forms δpmob was described well by the one surface langmuir isotherm and equally well using either only alox or the sum of feox and alox as the sorbent with e or r2 ranging from 0 981 to 0 999 in both cases supplementary figure s2 table s2 with isotherms describing δpmob relative to dwtr dose linear models were fit to dwtr dose described by only alox content and then next to the sum of alox and feox content the linear relationships between the initial pmob concentration and amount of alox necessary to form a specified ratio of alox δpmob were consistent over the full range of investigated pmob concentration fig 2 this relationship was able to be described using either molar fig 2a or mass fig 2b units when feox was also included the linear relationships fit equally well or worse i e r2 was lower supplementary figure s3 therefore the final model was based on only alox studies have noted that both alox and feox are important for p sorption in dwtrs shen et al 2020 however the inclusion of feox in previous work only marginally improved the description of variance in p sorption capacity kuster et al 2021 even when fe salts were used as coagulants in the dwtrs wang et al 2013c other studies have noted that alox was sufficient to describe p sorption without the inclusion of feox dayton and basta 2005 thus our model describing pmob reduction based on only alox content is consistent with the literature and is also more conservative than one including feox by not accounting for potential additional binding sites the model describing δpmob in sediment by dwtr was comparable to a similar model that described the formation of al p in lake sediments following the addition of al salts huser and pilgrim 2014 kuster et al 2020 in the al salt model the slopes of the regression lines were nearly equal to the ratio of sorbent δpmob e g slope was approximately equal to 100 for the line describing the ratio of al δpmob 100 in this dwtr model the slopes were around 20 g g less than the respective ratio for example the slope was approximately 80 g g for the ratio of alox δpmob 100 and so on thus a ratio of alox to δpmob was reached at a lower dose of alox in dwtr compared to al in al salts this result suggests that alox in dwtr may be less efficient at inactivating pmob in lake sediment than al from freshly reacted al salts on a per mass basis this finding is logical since the al hydroxides present in dwtrs are aged that is they are the byproduct of al salts that have undergone hydrolysis and formed amorphous compounds that are somewhat crystalized aged al hydroxides are different from those from freshly administered al salts al salt addition creates fresh amorphous al oh ₃ which will have maximum surface area and binding sites berkowitz et al 2006 after settling in the sedimentation tanks the al oh ₃ floc ages reducing the surface area and associated binding cites de vicente et al 2008a crystallization and reduction of surface area happens quickly within hours or days and continues for up to 6 months berkowitz et al 2005 however once aged the contents of alox remain relatively stable following years of additional aging agyin birikorang and o connor 2009 thus the results of this model that show p sorption is potentially less efficient on a per al mass basis compared to existing models developed from fresh al salts nevertheless some dwtrs used in this study had a higher alox mass basis e g 175 mg g than al in alum 81 mg g therefore the increased alox content in dwtr can counteract the reduced efficiency caused by aging 3 4 use and validation of model to predict reduction in mobile p the model derived from the dwtr addition experiments can be used to predict the immediate reduction in pmob for any lake sediment and al based dwtr which is demonstrated here the procedure first requires the pmob content labile p plus fe p and water content of the lake sediment using an example with previously reported data from a lake surface area 18 500 m² kuster et al 2020 we considered that the average pmob content was 208 5 µg p g dw and water content was 73 4 in the top 4 cm of the lake sediment table 3 according to the density function håkanson and jansson 1983 the density was 1 16 g cm³ resulting in a pmob content of 0 631 g p m² cm then the equations shown in fig 2b were used to estimate the amount of alox required to achieve alox δpmob ratios of 50 100 200 and 300 based on those equations the alox doses ranged from 11 3 to 128 9 g alox m² cm table 3 next the remaining pmob concentration pmob f was determined for each ratio using eq 2 2 p m o b f n p i a l o x n a l o x δ p m o b n where pi was the initial pmob 0 631 g p m² cm alox n was the alox dose for the nth ratio computed above and alox δpmob n was the desired ratio 50 100 200 300 using eq 2 the resulting pmob f concentrations ranged from 0 40 to 0 20 g p m² cm for the four alox doses table 3 if a specific sediment p concentration is desired linear interpolation can be used for example one intended goal of treatment may be to reduce pmob concentrations in the target sediment layer to below 0 100 μg g dw wagner et al 2017 given the sediment water content of 73 4 that p concentration equates to 0 309 g p m² cm according to the density function using interpolation we found that a ratio of alox to pmob of 108 1 was needed to achieve the desired p concentration of 0 309 g p m² cm in this sediment thus the dwtr dose would be 108 times the initial pmob 67 9 g alox m² cm using a target sediment depth of 4 cm resulted in a dwtr dose of 271 6 g alox m² finally the actual amount of dwtr added was based on the alox content in the dwtr using the bp dwtr 84 7 mg alox g required 59 3 tons of dwtr to treat the 18 500 m² lake 32 1 tons per hectare these results were comparable to the required mass of alum which was around 30 to 65 tons of alum kuster et al 2020 alternatively this model can be used to predict the immediate reduction in pmob following a specified dwtr treatment the above procedure was repeated for a few example initial pmob concentrations resulting in a predictive chart estimating final pmob concentration following the addition of a specified dwtr dose fig 3 this model created sharply sloping asymptotic curves that have been observed in dwtr dosing experiments reported in the literature wang et al 2013c interestingly the asymptotes approached a minimum pmob f concentration around 0 2 g p m² cm as opposed to zero this result suggests that not all pmob can be inactivated previous dwtr dosing experiments have also shown a limit to the minimum pmob f concentration despite high doses of dwtr wang et al 2013c similarly dosing experiments using al salts also approached a minimum albeit slightly lower huser and pilgrim 2014 the predictive model was validated using combinations of lake sediment and dwtr not used in the development of the model the model s predicted δpmob matched closely with the measured δpmob fig 4 the r² was 0 995 the standard deviation of the residuals was 6 4 of the range of observed values and the mean was 4 9 of the range of observed values furthermore the residuals did not demonstrate a bias in their trend therefore all model validation goals were met 3 5 considerations for dwtr dosing in lake restoration this model has an important limitation that should be considered when used in lake restoration projects the model represents only the immediate reduction in pmob that occurs primarily via ligand exchange makris et al 2004 and is based on laboratory studies in which the amount of p available for sorption is limited however in situ field conditions have a much greater amount of available p and take place over a longer time period additional p can be provided to binding sites on dwtr via several mechanisms including upward diffusion of p in sediment settling from the water column translocation and mineralization of organic p reitzel et al 2005 schütz et al 2017 long term introduction of additional p improves binding efficiency thus the high ratios of alox to p required in these laboratory studies to reduce pmob e g 100 1 are not expected to be required long term in the field observations in lakes following application of al salts have found binding ratios closer 11 1 or less huser 2017 therefore this model is most representative of the reduction in pmob to a limited pool of p i e near the sediment surface over the short term a more appropriate method for overall dosing however may be to specify a fixed ratio of alox to p e g 11 1 expected to occur over the long term e g more than 10 years with a sufficiently large pool of targeted p that p pool should consider the contribution of labile organic p to pmob organic p can be a substantial source of sediment p release especially in shallow lakes schütz et al 2017 the conversion of organic p to bioavailable inorganic p via mineralization and other processes ahlgren et al 2011 ni et al 2016 can contribute additional pmob that binds with p inactivating materials wang et al 2017 therefore the labile component of organic p should be included as part of the long term pmob pool for dose determination kuster et al 2020 additionally the targeted active sediment depth must be considered the active sediment layer is generally around 4 to 10 cm reitzel et al 2003 wagner et al 2017 but bioturbation and wind action can increase the active sediment layer huser et al 2016a previous work has shown that variations in these considerations can substantially affect the required dose of p inactivating material kuster et al 2020 thus we recommend that at a minimum a representative 30 cm sediment core should be collected and analyzed using sequential p extraction at 2 cm intervals this data should be used to identify the active sediment layer and how much labile organic p contributes to pmob the dose also depends on the intended goal dosing methodologies have aimed to reduce pmob below a specified level wagner et al 2017 to reduce internal p loading huser and pilgrim 2014 by estimating it from pmob concentration pilgrim et al 2007 or to reduce pmob by a specified percentage james 2011 this model can be used to determine how much alox is needed to achieve that goal alternatively a fixed ratio of alox to pmob may be chosen de vicente et al 2008a rydin and welch 1999 and the model can be used to determine the resulting pmob concentration the contribution of other metals and nutrients in a specific dwtr should be considered as well some dwtrs have labile nitrogen especially if they have not been pyrolyzed kuster et al 2021 which can increase nitrogen concentrations in the overlying water wang et al 2019 other dwtrs may have higher concentrations of metals that can be released to the surface water under reductive conditions yuan et al 2016c eco toxicological analyses of dwtr however showed that metals from the dwtr did not exhibit toxicity towards bacteria yuan et al 2016a aquatic plants yuan et al 2016b insects yuan et al 2016c zooplankton yuan et al 2020 or beneficial algae yuan et al 2017 furthermore the total dose could be broken into smaller doses to potentially improve binding efficiency or increase convenience agstam norlin et al 2020 huser 2017 finally it should be considered whether the application of a p inactivating material including dwtr is appropriate for the lake each lake has a unique system of ecology limnology and anthropogenic forcings zhou et al 2022 the optimal solution must be chosen based on a proper diagnosis of the problem including nutrient fluxes biology and function of the lake lürling and mucci 2020 furthermore the goals impact on ecology and cost must be carefully considered douglas et al 2016 for example shallow lakes with frequent hydrodynamic disturbances can resuspend particulate p that can potentially fuel algal growth even after being amended with dwtr wang et al 2022 4 conclusions a simple model was developed for the first time to effectively describe the immediate in vitro reduction of mobile phosphorus in lake sediment using drinking water treatment residual across a wide range of mobile phosphorus contents and multiple drinking water treatment residuals the model allows for the prediction of resulting mobile phosphorus concentration in lake sediment following the application of drinking water treatment residual requiring only the initial mobile phosphorus mass and content of oxalate extractible aluminum in the drinking water treatment residual the model facilitates the determination of drinking water treatment residual dosage to achieve a desired mobile phosphorus concentration or targeted internal phosphorus loading rate using existing empirical models this model reduces the need for costly and time consuming in vitro experiments thus accelerating the use of drinking water treatment residual to inactivate phosphorus in lake sediment in the field declaration of

15035,drinking water treatment residual dwtr derived from flocculation and sedimentation of raw water using aluminum coagulants is a valuable environmental remediation byproduct capable of inactivating phosphorus p however no generalizable model exists in the literature to describe reduction of releasable mobile p in lake sediment as a result of dwtr addition the reduction of mobile p sum of labile p and reductant soluble p was investigated in over 100 sub samples using five sediment samples from two lakes and three dwtrs from different water treatment plants a consistent relationship was determined across a range of mobile p contents 0 23 g m2 cm to 0 92 g m2 cm or 15 8 to 186 1 µg g dw and dwtrs the relationship was best described as a function of the mobile p content of the sediment and the oxalate extractable aluminum content of the dwtr an empirical model was developed to predict the immediate reduction in mobile p following the addition of dwtr containing aluminum this model was validated using two additional lake sediments and one additional dwtr r² 0 995 thus the immediate inactivation of p in lake sediment following dwtr addition can be predicted with this model which can be used with internal p loading or other water quality goals to determine an appropriate dwtr dose further recommendations were made about dosing dwtrs for lake restoration allowing practitioners to use dwtr to inactivate p in lake sediment without conducting individual sorption experiments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algae alum sludge cyanobacteria eutrophication langmuir isotherm water quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a result of anthropogenic activities many freshwater lakes around the world have elevated levels of phosphorus p in their sediments bhagowati and ahamad 2019 this elevated sediment p or legacy sediment p is a source of internal p loading søndergaard et al 2013 tammeorg et al 2022 that increases surface water p concentrations driving eutrophic conditions and the associated negative consequences including frequent harmful algal blooms dubey and dutta 2020 zamparas and zacharias 2014 a common strategy for reducing internal p loading from sediment and restoring eutrophic lakes has been the application of p immobilizing materials wang and jiang 2016 these p immobilizing materials bind with p to form stable minerals thereby reducing the amount of p available in the lake ecosystem agstam norlin et al 2020 several p immobilizing materials have been proposed kelly vargas and qi 2019 to date the most common is aluminum al salts which have been used for more than five decades in lake treatments around the world huser et al 2016b however global supply chain issues and changing consumptions patterns have led to global metal shortages li et al 2022 including shortages of the critical coagulant aluminum sulfate alum used in drinking water treatment therefore it is imperative to have alternative p immobilizing materials several of which have been proposed including lanthanum modified bentonites copetti et al 2016 calcium minerals yin and kong 2015 zeolites yang et al 2015 and drinking water treatment residual dwtr wang et al 2013b among these only dwtrs have the advantage of being a recycled material that is available anywhere tap water is produced which means less impact on global metal supply and the environment zhao et al 2021 dwtr the sludge byproduct generated during the production of drinking water and commonly landfilled as a waste product turner et al 2019 is a particularly attractive option as a p immobilizing material wang et al 2021 several studies have demonstrated that dwtrs can immobilize p in lake sediment and reduce internal p loading ichihara and nishio 2013 wang et al 2017 2013a the key component of dwtr that is associated with p sorption is its content of oxalate extractable al alox and fe feox kuster et al 2021 which primarily represents amorphous forms of the minerals bertsch and bloom 1996 dwtrs that are derived from coagulation using an al and or fe salt contain high levels of alox and feox al tahmazi and babatunde 2016 bai et al 2014 however reliably determining an appropriate dose of dwtr to immobilize p in lake sediment remains a barrier to field application proposed dosing methods in the literature have been based on a mass ratio of dwtr to lake sediment e g 10 w w wang et al 2012 yuan et al 2016c or a linear relationship to determine the amount of alox and feox needed to immobilize a specified amount of mobile p pmob wang et al 2013c another study suggested that most pmob could be immobilized once the amount of alox and feox exceeded a minimum concentration in the sediment shen et al 2020 none of the above dosing methodologies sufficiently account for the inherent variability of the dwtr p sorption capacity and sediment pmob content therefore existing dosing methodologies are unable to predict the remaining pmob in lake sediment following application of dwtr across a wide range of pmob and alox feox conditions in addition they don t account for other factors that have been shown to be important when immobilizing p in lake sediment for example the ratio of p binding with al salts is dependent on sediment density the depth of the active sediment layer and the targeted p pool kuster et al 2020 therefore the ability to predict the remaining pmob and thus remaining internal p loading following addition of dwtr to lake sediment remains limited this knowledge gap is notable when compared to the broad amount of literature discussing dosing methodologies for pure al salts kuster et al 2020 including a predictive model huser and pilgrim 2014 thus the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate how the addition of dwtr to lake sediment affected the reduction of pmob in lake sediment 2 to determine if this relationship was consistent over a broad range of pmob content and types of dwtrs and 3 to develop a predictive model that could overcome the dosing limitations described above five lake sediment samples from two lakes were treated with three dwtr samples from three different water treatment plants at multiple doses to create 130 individual samples to elucidate the relationship between dwtr and p binding in sediment the model was then validated with additional lake sediment and dwtr not used in the model calibration 2 methods and materials 2 1 dwtr sampling preparation and characterization dwtrs were collected from four different water treatment plants that supply domestic water in northeast thailand each plant used alum al2 so4 3 h2o polyaluminum chloride al2 oh ncl6 n m or a combination of the two coagulants with varying concentrations depending on the changing raw water quality raw dwtr was collected directly from the sedimentation tanks or from the adjacent drainage canal during regular emptying of the sedimentation tanks placed into plastic containers and transported back to the laboratory the dwtr was dried in an oven at 105 c for 48 72 h to dewater the dwtr the dewatered dwtr was ground and sieved to 150 µm sieve 100 the processed dwtr was then heat treated in oxygen limited conditions at 600 c in a muffle furnace isolab laborgeräte gmbh eschau germany under n₂ atmosphere for 6 h oxygen limited heat treatment greater than 400 c and longer than 4 h has been shown to improve adsorptive properties stabilize metals and reduce nitrogen leaching kuster et al 2021 wang et al 2016 each dwtr was analyzed for metals using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes following digestion with nitric acid and perchloric acid epa method 3050b total n and total p were determined using the dumas method with dry combustion and icp oes following microwave digestion epa method 3052 respectively specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined using the brunauer emmett teller bet theory and adsorption desorption isotherms generated with n₂ at 77 k from relative pressure p p0 from 0 to 1 belsorp mini x microtracbel osaka japan the concentrations of oxalate extractable fe al and p feox alox and pox respectively were determined using icp oes following extraction with 0 2 m ammonium oxalate and 0 2 m oxalic acid adjusted to ph 3 at a ratio of 100 ml g using an orbital shaker for 4 h dayton and basta 2005 the p saturation index psi was calculated according to the ratio of pox to the sum of feox and alox dayton and basta 2005 2 2 sediment sampling and characterization lake sediment was sampled from beung nong khot lake 16 25 50 n 102 47 55 e which is a hypereutrophic lake total p 0 1 mg l chlorophyll a 100 800 µg l typically dominated by microcystis and cylindrospermopsis genera of cyanobacteria kuster et al 2021 thongdam et al 2021 and from beung gii lake 16 26 00 n 102 45 34 e which is a shallow polymictic lake that is also hypereutrophic total p 0 1 mg l chlorophyll a 140 850 µg l and dominated by various cyanobacteria kuster et al 2020 a handheld pvc gravity sediment coring device davis and steinman 1998 was used to collect sediment cores 30 cm in july 2022 from three locations in beung nong khot lake and two locations in beung gii lake the top 10 cm of the sediment core were collected in the lab homogenized and refrigerated at 4 c a fourth and fifth sample were collected from different locations in beung nong khot lake using a grab sampler which was also homogenized and stored in refrigeration generating a total of seven sediment samples sequential extraction of p was conducted for each homogenized sediment sample following the method described by psenner et al 1988 and modified by hupfer et al 1995 to determine labile p di water extraction reductant soluble p fe p 0 11 m bicarbonate dithionite extraction ligand exchangeable p al p 0 1 m naoh extraction ca bound p ca p 0 5 m hcl extraction and organic p difference between naoh extraction digested with potassium persulfate and al p with one modification the extraction time for the first extraction di water was extended to 48 h instead of the standard 2 h the lengthened extraction time was used to provide consistent conditions to all other experiments which required a 48 hour contact time before starting sequential p extraction each extraction was performed in duplicate with average values used pmob was calculated as the sum of labile p and fe p water content was determined by oven drying at 105 c for 48 h and sediment density was calculated from water content according to håkanson and jansson 1983 2 3 phosphate sorption batch experiments the dried treated dwtrs were added to 15 ml centrifuge tubes at two different masses approximately 60 and 100 mg and mixed with 10 ml of 10 mg p l phosphate solution created from h₂po₄ standard solution each mass was performed in duplicate the tubes were shaken stored at room temperature 25 c for 48 h and then centrifuged at 500x g for 10 min the supernatant was sampled and analyzed for p concentration using ascorbic acid colorimetric spectrophotometry the amount of p sorbed to the dwtr was determined as the reduction in p the dwtr was then analyzed for labile p fe p al p and ca p according to the sequential p extraction technique described above the changes in p fractions following p sorption i e the fate of the phosphate solution were determined by comparing results to controls of dwtrs dissolved in di water 2 4 sediment p immobilization with dwtr dwtr addition experiments were conducted in duplicate using the five lake sediment samples and three dwtrs individual suspensions of dwtr were created for each pair of lake sediment and dwtr n 15 such that each provided the mass of alox and feox that was approximately 100 200 times the pmob in the target sediment then an aliquot of the dwtr suspension 0 1 2 5 5 or 10 ml was added to a 15 ml centrifuge tube containing wet sediment 250 mg wet weight such that the added mass of alox and feox was assessed at five different ratios including 0 control relative to the mass of pmob in the sediment di water was added to each centrifuge tube to fill to 10 ml the tubes were shaken and stored for 48 h at room temperature 25 c then centrifuged at 500x g next the sediment was analyzed using the modified sequential p extraction method described above in which the supernatant from the 48 hour equilibrium period was considered the first di water extraction the amount of sediment p sorbed by each dwtr dose was calculated as the reduction in pmob δpmob relative to the untreated control where pmob is the sum of labile p and fe p 2 5 development of empirical p binding model for dwtr the sorption of pmob to dwtr was modeled for each pair of dwtr and sediment using a one surface langmuir isotherm the langmuir isotherm has been widely applied to describe p sorption of dwtrs hou et al 2018 kuster et al 2020 with the ability to describe the rapid initial sorption that is mostly associated with ligand exchange makris et al 2004 for the 48 hour experiment a one surface isotherm that incorporated the ratio of sorbent to sorbate was used eq 1 1 q q m k r 1 k r where q is the amount of p sorbed according to the isotherm µmol g dw qm is the maximum p sorption µmol g dw r is the ratio µmol µmol of sorbent µmol g dw to sorbate initial pmob content in sediment µmol g dw and k is an adsorption constant g g the nash sutcliffe model efficiency measure e was calculated to assess goodness of fit nash and sutcliffe 1970 the values of qm and k were determined by maximizing e using the generalized reduced gradient solver within microsoft excel bolster and hornberger 2007 two sorption models were developed for each dwtr sediment pair considering two possible sorbents first the sorption was modeled as a function of alox only and second as the sum of alox and feox the ratio of sorbent δpmob unitless was calculated for each dwtr dose as mmol m2 cm or g m² cm from the langmuir isotherm the units of g m² cm represent a mass per volume manipulated into a form to facilitate dosing calculations then the dwtr dose required to achieve specific sorbent δpmob ratios e g 100 200 etc were interpolated from the measured ratios according to the isotherm for example one lake sediment with an initial mobile p concentration of 0 48 g p m² cm was treated in two experimental dosages of dwtr one with 8 9 g alox m² cm and a second with 22 1 g alox m² cm the ratios of alox δpmob from those two experiments were 65 0 and 106 9 respectively therefore the dose of alox needed to achieve a ratio of alox δpmob can be interpolated from the data to be 19 9 g alox m² cm for a sediment with initial pmob of 0 48 g p m² cm a dataset of dwtr doses needed to achieve specified sorbent δpmob ratios as a function of the initial pmob concentration in the sediment was generated from over 100 such experiments linear regression of these data was then used to generate empirical models that predict the dwtr doses necessary to achieve specific sorbent δpmob ratios according to the initial pmob content of the sediment huser and pilgrim 2014 kuster et al 2020 these empirical models were then used to predict the reduction in pmob following the addition of dwtr 2 6 model validation after the empirical model was developed two lake sediment samples and one dwtr were used to validate the model by conducting sediment p immobilization experiments neither the dwtr nor the lake sediments were used in the calibration of the model dwtr was added to lake sediment at several doses following the methods described above the predicted δpmob was calculated based on the model according to the dwtr dose using linear interpolation between specified ratios the predicted δpmob was compared to the measured δpmob residuals difference between predicted and measured δpmob were calculated for each dwtr dosage three validation statistics were calculated using the residuals including r² standard deviation of the residuals and mean of the absolute values of residuals the model was considered acceptably validated when these values were greater than 95 less than 10 of the range of observed values and less than 5 of the range of observed values respectively bias was assessed by plotting the residuals against model values to identify trends 3 results and discussion 3 1 physio chemical characterization of dwtrs all four dwtrs consisted primarily of al 119 900 mg kg to 289 100 mg kg and fe 36 650 mg kg to 87 000 mg kg table 1 eight of the ten heavy metals regulated by u s epa s part 503 regulations on land application of biosolids were analyzed u s epa 1994 in every dwtr these eight metals were below the pollution concentration limits for high quality biosolids required for land application raw dwtrs generated from water treatment plants using al based coagulants typically have al and fe contents ranging from 50 000 to 122 000 mg kg and 9750 to 28 300 mg kg respectively al tahmazi and babatunde 2016 ippolito 2015 therefore the al and fe contents in these treated dwtrs were higher than that of raw dwtrs which is expected following the oxygen limited heat treatment heat treatment substantially increases the relative concentration of al and fe kuster et al 2021 by pyrolyzing organic matter wang et al 2016 which typically comprises 100 000 300 000 mg kg of dwtrs zhao et al 2018 the contents of other metals were also representative of typical values of dwtrs babatunde and zhao 2007 because dwtrs consist primarily of the sediment in the raw water intake for the water treatment plant and the added coagulants heavy metal concentrations are similar to those found in natural sediments shen et al 2019 the three dwtrs used in the model calibration experiments ms ud and unkk represented a wide range of alox 1 92 to 6 49 mmol g 51 9 to 175 0 mg g and feox contents 0 22 to 0 82 mmol g 12 4 to 45 8 mg g table 1 the dwtr used in validation bp had alox and feox concentrations within these ranges the ud dwtr had the highest alox and feox concentrations other studies using dwtrs for p immobilization have reported alox and feox concentrations ranging from 24 to 165 mg g 0 88 to 6 11 mmol g and 0 1 to 21 4 mg g 0 001 to 0 38 mmol g respectively al tahmazi and babatunde 2016 dayton and basta 2005 kuster et al 2021 wang et al 2013c therefore these dwtrs were representative of typical dwtrs generated from drinking water production using al coagulants with ud dwtr having feox content higher than that of dwtrs that used only al based coagulants the psi for each dwtr was between 0 54 and 1 38 the adsorption desorption isotherms supplemental figure s1 for the dwtrs were classified as reversible type ii isotherms while the isotherm for the ud dwtr also included a type h3 hysteresis loop thommes et al 2015 thus the results of the n2 adsorption desorption analyses indicated that most of the pore space in the dwtrs was macroporous with some narrow interconnected pore spaces bet analyses of similar dwtrs collected from northeast thailand have also found that dwtrs are macroporous with the 600 c pyrolysis pre treatment that was used in these dwtrs having only minor effects on the pore structure kuster et al 2021 the ud dwtr also had the highest specific surface area according to bet theory 163 3 m2 g specific surface area which typically ranges from 5 to 100 m² g in raw dwtrs has been shown to be associated with p sorption makris et al 2005 xu et al 2020 the pre treatment pyrolysis likely increased specific surface area via increased aromaticity of the organic matter wang et al 2016 pre treatment with pyrolysis is not necessary for every dwtr in some cases dwtr can be used for environmental application without any pre treatment depending on the raw water source and coagulants used kuster et al 2022 however pyrolysis has been shown to increase p sorption create more stable forms of organic matter and reduce leaching of metals and nitrogen kuster et al 2021 wang et al 2018 2016 the drawback to pyrolysis is the economic and technical feasibility slow rate pyrolysis at 600 c requires substantial energy inputs and specialized commercial pyrolysis systems sørmo et al 2020 3 2 phosphorus fractions following sorption to dwtrs following the addition of 10 ml of phosphate solution with a concentration of 10 mg p l i e 0 1 mg of p to 60 or 100 mg of dwtr it was expected that nearly all the phosphate solution would be sorbed as determined by how much p remained in solution following equilibrium this hypothesis was confirmed in all three calibration dwtrs with only the lowest dose of the ms dwtr 60 mg having a non negligible amount p remaining in solution 7 7 of p added to the assays fig 1 the fate of the sorbed p was determined by p fractionation very little of the sorbed p was observed as an increase of fe p 0 9 to 6 3 of p added to the assay thus 79 to 99 of sorbed p was recovered as an increase in al p or ca p in some cases such as ud 100 and unkk 100 around 15 to 20 of the p was not recovered by inorganic components of sequential p extraction i e residual or organic p this result may be explained by at least three potential phenomenon first while some of the increase in ca p was likely the result of p binding with calcium and other minerals such as magnesium or manganese in the dwtr the increase of ca p may also be an artifact of the sequential p fractionation procedure in the naoh step which measures al p the extraction requires a high ph to release ligand exchangeable p hupfer et al 1995 psenner et al 1988 this high ph can create an artificial conversion of al p to ca p huser and pilgrim 2014 secondly organic acids present in the dwtrs may have caused the formation of precipitate that interfered with naoh step de vicente et al 2008b james 2011 thirdly because these samples were spiked with phosphate the amount of ligand exchangeable and ca bound p was higher than natural sediments generating concentrations higher than intended for the extraction method thus some of the p that was removed from solution may be missing from the extractions because no more p was able to enter the extraction solution thus these results have two implications first the reduction in pmob δpmob is the preferable measure of p inactivation in lake sediment as opposed to increases in al p ca p using δpmob is a common approach that has been taken in past studies using al salts huser and pilgrim 2014 kuster et al 2020 secondly despite the dwtrs containing feox p sorption generated substantially lower amounts of fe p compared to al p the molar ratio of alox to feox in these dwtrs was 7 9 to 9 4 in the ud and unkk dwtrs however the increase in al p relative to the increase in fe p was much higher ratio of 27 to 63 interestingly the increase of the al p fe p ratio was around 7 in the ms dwtr this dwtr had the lowest alox and feox concentrations and had the highest amount of p remaining in solution thus the ms dwtr likely reached its p sorption capacity these results indicated that p may preferentially sorb with alox and only begin to substantially sorb with feox once most alox sorption sites are occupied phosphate has been sown to preferentially sorb to alox instead of feox yan et al 2015 especially at higher doses eriksson et al 2015 notably most studies that related p sorption to the combination of both alox and feox used high concentrations of p 10 mg p l which would have created conditions whereby the p had already exceeded its preferential adsorption with alox bai et al 2014 bal krishna et al 2016 dayton and basta 2005 kuster et al 2021 a final consideration about the nature of these dwtrs is their inherent p content total p in these dwtrs ranged from 1000 to 5500 mg kg which is higher than most lake sediments table 1 the form of the p however is critical to determining whether that p can become biologically available and thus counteract the intended outcome sequential fractionation of the p in these dwtrs without the addition of phosphate solution found that less than 1 of the p was extractable as pmob with 51 to 71 of total p being recovered via extraction as al p and ca p supplementary table s1 p in the dwtrs was likely fixed into stable mineral forms or transformed into stable organic compounds during pyrolysis wang et al 2018 furthermore very little of the p was extractable using the strong oxalate extraction method pox overall the psi was less than around 1 5 in the dwtrs psi is a good indicator of p leachability in soils with values less than 12 5 associated with negligible p leaching maguire and sims 2002 however further long term research may be warranted to confirm that inherent p in dwtr will not be introduced to the lake system following application to lake sediments 3 3 modeling phosphorus inactivation in lake sediments by dwtr the five lake sediment samples included a range of pmob concentrations from low 0 23 g m2 cm to high 0 92 g m2 cm table 2 these concentrations were in the lower and middle range of pmob values reported for sediments of eutrophic lakes 0 04 to 2 8 g m2 cm huser and pilgrim 2014 and represented a wider range of pmob concentrations than most dosing studies using dwtrs wang et al 2013c or al salts de vicente et al 2008a following the addition of dwtr to these lake sediments the pmob concentration declined i e more δpmob as p was inactivated via conversion to al p or ca p forms δpmob was described well by the one surface langmuir isotherm and equally well using either only alox or the sum of feox and alox as the sorbent with e or r2 ranging from 0 981 to 0 999 in both cases supplementary figure s2 table s2 with isotherms describing δpmob relative to dwtr dose linear models were fit to dwtr dose described by only alox content and then next to the sum of alox and feox content the linear relationships between the initial pmob concentration and amount of alox necessary to form a specified ratio of alox δpmob were consistent over the full range of investigated pmob concentration fig 2 this relationship was able to be described using either molar fig 2a or mass fig 2b units when feox was also included the linear relationships fit equally well or worse i e r2 was lower supplementary figure s3 therefore the final model was based on only alox studies have noted that both alox and feox are important for p sorption in dwtrs shen et al 2020 however the inclusion of feox in previous work only marginally improved the description of variance in p sorption capacity kuster et al 2021 even when fe salts were used as coagulants in the dwtrs wang et al 2013c other studies have noted that alox was sufficient to describe p sorption without the inclusion of feox dayton and basta 2005 thus our model describing pmob reduction based on only alox content is consistent with the literature and is also more conservative than one including feox by not accounting for potential additional binding sites the model describing δpmob in sediment by dwtr was comparable to a similar model that described the formation of al p in lake sediments following the addition of al salts huser and pilgrim 2014 kuster et al 2020 in the al salt model the slopes of the regression lines were nearly equal to the ratio of sorbent δpmob e g slope was approximately equal to 100 for the line describing the ratio of al δpmob 100 in this dwtr model the slopes were around 20 g g less than the respective ratio for example the slope was approximately 80 g g for the ratio of alox δpmob 100 and so on thus a ratio of alox to δpmob was reached at a lower dose of alox in dwtr compared to al in al salts this result suggests that alox in dwtr may be less efficient at inactivating pmob in lake sediment than al from freshly reacted al salts on a per mass basis this finding is logical since the al hydroxides present in dwtrs are aged that is they are the byproduct of al salts that have undergone hydrolysis and formed amorphous compounds that are somewhat crystalized aged al hydroxides are different from those from freshly administered al salts al salt addition creates fresh amorphous al oh ₃ which will have maximum surface area and binding sites berkowitz et al 2006 after settling in the sedimentation tanks the al oh ₃ floc ages reducing the surface area and associated binding cites de vicente et al 2008a crystallization and reduction of surface area happens quickly within hours or days and continues for up to 6 months berkowitz et al 2005 however once aged the contents of alox remain relatively stable following years of additional aging agyin birikorang and o connor 2009 thus the results of this model that show p sorption is potentially less efficient on a per al mass basis compared to existing models developed from fresh al salts nevertheless some dwtrs used in this study had a higher alox mass basis e g 175 mg g than al in alum 81 mg g therefore the increased alox content in dwtr can counteract the reduced efficiency caused by aging 3 4 use and validation of model to predict reduction in mobile p the model derived from the dwtr addition experiments can be used to predict the immediate reduction in pmob for any lake sediment and al based dwtr which is demonstrated here the procedure first requires the pmob content labile p plus fe p and water content of the lake sediment using an example with previously reported data from a lake surface area 18 500 m² kuster et al 2020 we considered that the average pmob content was 208 5 µg p g dw and water content was 73 4 in the top 4 cm of the lake sediment table 3 according to the density function håkanson and jansson 1983 the density was 1 16 g cm³ resulting in a pmob content of 0 631 g p m² cm then the equations shown in fig 2b were used to estimate the amount of alox required to achieve alox δpmob ratios of 50 100 200 and 300 based on those equations the alox doses ranged from 11 3 to 128 9 g alox m² cm table 3 next the remaining pmob concentration pmob f was determined for each ratio using eq 2 2 p m o b f n p i a l o x n a l o x δ p m o b n where pi was the initial pmob 0 631 g p m² cm alox n was the alox dose for the nth ratio computed above and alox δpmob n was the desired ratio 50 100 200 300 using eq 2 the resulting pmob f concentrations ranged from 0 40 to 0 20 g p m² cm for the four alox doses table 3 if a specific sediment p concentration is desired linear interpolation can be used for example one intended goal of treatment may be to reduce pmob concentrations in the target sediment layer to below 0 100 μg g dw wagner et al 2017 given the sediment water content of 73 4 that p concentration equates to 0 309 g p m² cm according to the density function using interpolation we found that a ratio of alox to pmob of 108 1 was needed to achieve the desired p concentration of 0 309 g p m² cm in this sediment thus the dwtr dose would be 108 times the initial pmob 67 9 g alox m² cm using a target sediment depth of 4 cm resulted in a dwtr dose of 271 6 g alox m² finally the actual amount of dwtr added was based on the alox content in the dwtr using the bp dwtr 84 7 mg alox g required 59 3 tons of dwtr to treat the 18 500 m² lake 32 1 tons per hectare these results were comparable to the required mass of alum which was around 30 to 65 tons of alum kuster et al 2020 alternatively this model can be used to predict the immediate reduction in pmob following a specified dwtr treatment the above procedure was repeated for a few example initial pmob concentrations resulting in a predictive chart estimating final pmob concentration following the addition of a specified dwtr dose fig 3 this model created sharply sloping asymptotic curves that have been observed in dwtr dosing experiments reported in the literature wang et al 2013c interestingly the asymptotes approached a minimum pmob f concentration around 0 2 g p m² cm as opposed to zero this result suggests that not all pmob can be inactivated previous dwtr dosing experiments have also shown a limit to the minimum pmob f concentration despite high doses of dwtr wang et al 2013c similarly dosing experiments using al salts also approached a minimum albeit slightly lower huser and pilgrim 2014 the predictive model was validated using combinations of lake sediment and dwtr not used in the development of the model the model s predicted δpmob matched closely with the measured δpmob fig 4 the r² was 0 995 the standard deviation of the residuals was 6 4 of the range of observed values and the mean was 4 9 of the range of observed values furthermore the residuals did not demonstrate a bias in their trend therefore all model validation goals were met 3 5 considerations for dwtr dosing in lake restoration this model has an important limitation that should be considered when used in lake restoration projects the model represents only the immediate reduction in pmob that occurs primarily via ligand exchange makris et al 2004 and is based on laboratory studies in which the amount of p available for sorption is limited however in situ field conditions have a much greater amount of available p and take place over a longer time period additional p can be provided to binding sites on dwtr via several mechanisms including upward diffusion of p in sediment settling from the water column translocation and mineralization of organic p reitzel et al 2005 schütz et al 2017 long term introduction of additional p improves binding efficiency thus the high ratios of alox to p required in these laboratory studies to reduce pmob e g 100 1 are not expected to be required long term in the field observations in lakes following application of al salts have found binding ratios closer 11 1 or less huser 2017 therefore this model is most representative of the reduction in pmob to a limited pool of p i e near the sediment surface over the short term a more appropriate method for overall dosing however may be to specify a fixed ratio of alox to p e g 11 1 expected to occur over the long term e g more than 10 years with a sufficiently large pool of targeted p that p pool should consider the contribution of labile organic p to pmob organic p can be a substantial source of sediment p release especially in shallow lakes schütz et al 2017 the conversion of organic p to bioavailable inorganic p via mineralization and other processes ahlgren et al 2011 ni et al 2016 can contribute additional pmob that binds with p inactivating materials wang et al 2017 therefore the labile component of organic p should be included as part of the long term pmob pool for dose determination kuster et al 2020 additionally the targeted active sediment depth must be considered the active sediment layer is generally around 4 to 10 cm reitzel et al 2003 wagner et al 2017 but bioturbation and wind action can increase the active sediment layer huser et al 2016a previous work has shown that variations in these considerations can substantially affect the required dose of p inactivating material kuster et al 2020 thus we recommend that at a minimum a representative 30 cm sediment core should be collected and analyzed using sequential p extraction at 2 cm intervals this data should be used to identify the active sediment layer and how much labile organic p contributes to pmob the dose also depends on the intended goal dosing methodologies have aimed to reduce pmob below a specified level wagner et al 2017 to reduce internal p loading huser and pilgrim 2014 by estimating it from pmob concentration pilgrim et al 2007 or to reduce pmob by a specified percentage james 2011 this model can be used to determine how much alox is needed to achieve that goal alternatively a fixed ratio of alox to pmob may be chosen de vicente et al 2008a rydin and welch 1999 and the model can be used to determine the resulting pmob concentration the contribution of other metals and nutrients in a specific dwtr should be considered as well some dwtrs have labile nitrogen especially if they have not been pyrolyzed kuster et al 2021 which can increase nitrogen concentrations in the overlying water wang et al 2019 other dwtrs may have higher concentrations of metals that can be released to the surface water under reductive conditions yuan et al 2016c eco toxicological analyses of dwtr however showed that metals from the dwtr did not exhibit toxicity towards bacteria yuan et al 2016a aquatic plants yuan et al 2016b insects yuan et al 2016c zooplankton yuan et al 2020 or beneficial algae yuan et al 2017 furthermore the total dose could be broken into smaller doses to potentially improve binding efficiency or increase convenience agstam norlin et al 2020 huser 2017 finally it should be considered whether the application of a p inactivating material including dwtr is appropriate for the lake each lake has a unique system of ecology limnology and anthropogenic forcings zhou et al 2022 the optimal solution must be chosen based on a proper diagnosis of the problem including nutrient fluxes biology and function of the lake lürling and mucci 2020 furthermore the goals impact on ecology and cost must be carefully considered douglas et al 2016 for example shallow lakes with frequent hydrodynamic disturbances can resuspend particulate p that can potentially fuel algal growth even after being amended with dwtr wang et al 2022 4 conclusions a simple model was developed for the first time to effectively describe the immediate in vitro reduction of mobile phosphorus in lake sediment using drinking water treatment residual across a wide range of mobile phosphorus contents and multiple drinking water treatment residuals the model allows for the prediction of resulting mobile phosphorus concentration in lake sediment following the application of drinking water treatment residual requiring only the initial mobile phosphorus mass and content of oxalate extractible aluminum in the drinking water treatment residual the model facilitates the determination of drinking water treatment residual dosage to achieve a desired mobile phosphorus concentration or targeted internal phosphorus loading rate using existing empirical models this model reduces the need for costly and time consuming in vitro experiments thus accelerating the use of drinking water treatment residual to inactivate phosphorus in lake sediment in the field declaration of

15036,ubiquitous macromolecular natural organic matter nom in wastewater seriously influences the removal of emerging small molecule contaminants via heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes because this material covers active sites and quenches reactive oxygen species here sponge like magnetic manganese ferrite mnfe2o4 s with a three dimensional hierarchical porous structure was prepared via a facile solvent free molten method compared with the particle like structure of mnfe2o4 p the sponge like structure of mnfe2o4 s presents an enlarged specific surface area 112 14 m2 g 1 vs 58 73 m2 g 1 and a smaller macropore diameter 68 2 77 2 nm vs 946 5 nm enlarging the specific surface area increases the exposure of active sites and adjusting the pore size helps sieve nom and emerging contaminants these changes are expected to effectively improve the degradation activity and overcome interference to confirm the superiority of the sponge like structure mnfe2o4 s was used to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of multiple emerging contaminants and its ability to degrade bisphenol a with and without humic acid ha was compared with that of mnfe2o4 p the degradation activity of mnfe2o4 s was 1 6 times greater than that of mnfe2o4 p moreover 20 mg l 1 ha inhibited the degradation activity of mnfe2o4 s by only 7 1 which was much lower than that obtained for mnfe2o4 p 53 4 in addition the excellent performance was maintained in multiple water matrices notably under lake water matrices the degradation activity of mnfe2o4 p was inhibited by 35 6 while that of mnfe2o4 s was hardly inhibited more importantly the mnfe2o4 s pms system was also applicable to the treatment of actual wastewater and 73 0 and 90 1 of total organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand was removed from bio treated coking wastewater containing non biodegradable contaminants and nom this study provides an alternative route for the green production of high activity porous spinel ferrites with environmental anti interference properties graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese ferrite three dimensional structure peroxymonosulfate activation emerging contaminants anti interference data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction sulfate radical so4 advanced oxidation processes sr aops are considered a feasible and efficient technology for emerging contaminant degradation because of their high oxidative potential and wide applicable ph range ali et al 2020 guan et al 2013 liu et al 2019 recently metal based materials have been regarded as promising activators for the production of so4 by peroxymonosulfate pms activation owing to their multiple valence states and facile separation bao et al 2022 song et al 2022 zhao et al 2020 natural organic matter nom such as humic acid ha is ubiquitous in wastewater and may cover the active sites on activators and quench reactive oxygen species ros thereby dramatically decreasing the activation performance zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 therefore designing a metal based activator that can resist the interference of organic substances in wastewater is of great significance recent reports indicated that the interlacing pore structure of porous materials increases the specific surface area and reduces the diffusive resistance of mass transport thereby improving the ability of targeted molecules to access the inner active sites therefore porous materials have received significant sustained attention in various fields edwards et al 1997 liu et al 2022 zhu et al 2020 for example li et al prepared a yolk shell co c nanoreactors derived from zif 67 and used them for pms activation and they exhibited an enhanced bisphenol a bpa degradation rate despite the presence of ha zhang et al 2020 the outstanding anti interference and performance of the yolk shell co c nanoreactors are attributed to the synergetic effects of size exclusion and confinement specifically organic macromolecules are intercepted by porous shells to protect the inner active sites while targeted small molecules can pass through the material and bind to the inner active sites interestingly a similar phenomenon can be found in the co3o4 multi shelled hollow microspheres pms system resulting from its porous shell li et al 2022c nevertheless these activators have been difficult to industrialize because of their complicated synthesis processes harsh production conditions and low yield moreover despite the excellent anti interference of the above systems their low stability and difficulty achieving rapid separation from wastewater are vital problems that need to be solved in addition few reports have detailed the resistance of porous materials for nom in the degradation of emerging contaminants thus more porous activators with anti interference properties need to be developed spinel ferrites which are typical metal based materials are considered promising activators in fenton like reactions because of their facile preparation process high stability and magnetic separation feng et al 2016 ren et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 however the low specific surface area due to severe particle agglomeration and poor dispersibility of the active sites in spinel ferrites always results in limited exposure of the active sites and poor mass transfer efficiency hu et al 2021 meanwhile porous spinel ferrites can hardly be prepared via traditional synthetic methods such as co precipitation and hydrothermal methods peng et al 2021 the template method is a viable strategy for the preparation of porous spinel ferrites unfortunately the low yield toxic template scavengers and long synthesis time hinder its further application deng et al 2016 rashti et al 2021 thus developing a green and efficient method of constructing porous spinel ferrites and ensuring that the ferrites can selectively remove targeted contaminants in wastewater with nom via the sieving effect are key issues driving the widespread application of heterogeneous aops the gas release strategy involving the calcination of inorganic salts and organic matter has been widely applied for the preparation of porous materials badami et al 2020 liu et al 2022 inspired by these studies we propose an environmentally friendly and scalable method using citric acid to prepare sponge like mnfe2o4 mnfe2o4 s neither solvents nor extra energy consumption was required to obtain mnfe2o4 s in a short time to reveal the superiority of the sponge like structure for the selective and efficient removal of emerging contaminants mnfe2o4 s was applied to activate pms for multiple emerging contaminants degradation and its ability to degrade bpa with and without ha pollution was compared with that of mnfe2o4 particles mnfe2o4 p simultaneously the performance of the mnfe2o4 s pms and mnfe2o4 p pms systems was evaluated under multiple water matrices including tap water and lake water additionally the applicability of the mnfe2o4 s pms system for bio treated coking wastewater bcw with non biodegradable contaminant and nom was also explored this study provides an alternative route for the green and scalable production of porous spinel ferrites that possess anti interference properties and can selectively and efficiently remove emerging contaminants from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials information regarding the experimental materials is provided in text s1 the tap and lake water used in the experiments were obtained from shanghai and siyuan lake of shanghai jiao tong university respectively table s1 the bcw was obtained from the china pingmei shenma group in pingdingshan city henan province table s2 2 2 preparation of mnfe2o4 s the preparation process of mnfe2o4 s is presented in scheme 1 specifically 12 608 g of citric acid monohydrate c6h8o7 h2o ca 6 464 g of iron iii nitrate nonahydrate fe no3 3 9h2o and 1 961 g of manganese acetate tetrahydrate mn ch3coo 2 4h2o were mechanically ground in a mortar until they were uniformly mixed subsequently the mixture was heated to 400 c at 2 c min 1 and maintained for 120 min in a muffle furnace air atmosphere to obtain blackened products i e mnfe2o4 s additionally a series of single factor experiments was performed to optimize the molar ratio of the raw materials i e ca metal 2 3 characterization of spinel ferrites the preparation process of spinel ferrite was traced by simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry thermogravimetric analysis dsc tga the prepared spinel ferrites were characterized using x ray powder diffraction xrd raman microscopy scanning electron microscopy sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and n2 adsorption desorption isotherms etc the diameters of ha and tannic acid ta was measured by dynamic light scattering using a zeta potential particle sizer zeta pals details of the characterization are provided in text s2 2 4 experimental procedure and analytical method the degradation performance was assessed in a constant temperature bath an amount of activator 0 20 0 30 0 40 and 0 50 g l 1 was added to 50 ml of a solution of bpa 1 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 and then dispersed in a beaker the suspension was stirred for 15 min to guarantee the adsorption desorption equilibrium of bpa on the activator afterwards pms 0 05 0 10 0 20 and 0 40 g l 1 was added to the above suspension under vigorous stirring subsequently 1 0 ml of the suspension was collected and quenched rapidly with 1 0 ml of methanol meoh at certain time intervals 0 2 4 6 8 10 15 and 20 min the mixture was filtered by 0 22 μm membrane and then the bpa concentration in the filtrate was detected to investigate the environmental resistance and structure performance relationship the effect of inorganic ions and nom on the degradation of bpa was also studied by adding nacl nano3 nahco3 nah2po4 ha and ta additionally the main reactive oxygen species ros were explored via quenching experiments using meoh tert butanol tba n butanol nba phenol p benzoquinone bq and furfuryl alcohol ffa as scavengers the effects of the initial ph 3 8 6 6 9 2 and 11 0 and reaction temperature 15 25 and 35 c on the degradation of bpa were investigated and 1 0 m h2so4 and 1 0 m naoh were selected to adjust the initial ph of the bpa solution to evaluate the universality of mnfe2o4 s some emerging contaminants such as bisphenol f bpf bisphenol af bpaf phenol p chlorophenol pcp 2 4 dichlorophenol dcp 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp ciprofloxacin cip and tetracycline hydrochloride tc were selected to replace bpa in the degradation experiments the concentration of bpa in the filtrate was measured using high performance liquid chromatography hplc system lc 16 shimadzu japan with a wondasil c18 wr column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm a methanol ultra water solution containing 0 2 formic acid 65 35 v v was applied as the mobile phase and the flow rate was set at 1 0 ml min 1 the intermediates during the degradation of bpa were determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms thermo with eclipse plus c18 column 4 6 100 mm 3 5 μm the mobile phase was delivered at 0 50 ml min 1 by a gradient system and consisted of methanol and ultrapure water with 0 1 formic acid and 10 mm ammonium formate the mass spectra were gained in the m z range of 50 600 the total organic carbon toc was detected using a toc analyzer multi 3100 analytik jena ag germany the concentrations of cl no3 and so4 2 were measured using an ion chromatography system 761 compact ic metrohm switzerland the ph value was measured using a ph meter pb 10 sartorius germany and the conductivity level was measured using a conductivity meter dds 307 yueping china the codcr of the bcw was measured using the titrimetric method which employs dichromate as the oxidant in an acidic solution maintained at 180 c for 2 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization as shown in fig 1a seven diffraction peaks appear in the mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 p spectra that correspond to the 111 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes respectively and these findings are consistent with the spinel type mnfe2o4 icdd pdf 01 071 4919 liang et al 2022a this illustrates the successful synthesis of spinel mnfe2o4 s via the solvent free molten method simultaneously mnfe2o4 s with different ca metal ratios was also successfully prepared without impurities meaning that ca metal cannot affect the formation of the spinel type structure fig s1 in addition an obvious raman peak appears at 614 cm 1 for both mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 p which corresponds to the a1g mode of spinel mnfe2o4 fig 1b liu et al 2016 as shown in fig 1c the peaks of mn 2p fe 2p and o 1s appear in the wide scan xps spectra of mnfe2o4 s and they are similar to those of mnfe2o4 p thus confirming the co existence of mn fe and o liang et al 2022b no significant shift is observed in the mn 2p and fe 2p xps spectra of mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 s fig s2 therefore the results of the above characterizations jointly demonstrate that the structure of mnfe2o4 s is identical to that of mnfe2o4 p thus implying that the solvent free molten method does not influence the crystal structure of mnfe2o4 mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 p were characterized by sem to study their morphology a three dimensional interlacing macropore structure can be observed in mnfe2o4 s which is similar to a sponge structure fig 2a and b figure s3 indicates that mn fe and o are uniformly distributed in mnfe2o4 s to explore the formation mechanism of the sponge like structure in mnfe2o4 s dsc tga was conducted fig s4 and a possible formation mechanism was proposed scheme s1 briefly the three dimensional porous structure of mnfe2o4 s is likely produced by the release of gas products such as water vapor co2 and nitrogen oxides from the burning of ca as a fuel and pore forming agent during preparation additionally sem images of mnfe2o4 s with diverse ca metal ratios are shown in fig s5 to investigate the effect of the ca metal ratio on the morphology of mnfe2o4 s insufficient ca causes pores to shrink and even disappear whereas excessive ca can result in the collapse of the sponge like structure tao et al 2022 thus the sponge like structure of mnfe2o4 s depends on the ca metal ratio in contrast the nanoparticles in mnfe2o4 p were distributed in a disorderly manner and agglomerated severely thus forming variously sized particles fig 2c and d hence compared with mnfe2o4 p the sponge like structure in mnfe2o4 s may increase the specific surface area and facilitate mass transfer thereby exposing more active sites and improving the activity for pms activation and bpa degradation hu et al 2021 to reveal the pore size characteristics nano measure and n2 adsorption desorption experiments were carried out based on the information in fig 2a and b the average macropore diameter of mnfe2o4 s was 77 2 and 68 2 nm respectively fig 2e and f as for mnfe2o4 p the average macropore diameter formed by particle stacking reaches 946 5 nm which is much larger than that in mnfe2o4 s fig s6 notably the macropore diameter of mnfe2o4 s is more uniform than that of mnfe2o4 p the significant difference in the average pore diameter may have been the key factor underlying the anti interference property meanwhile a typical iupac type iv shape with h3 type hysteresis can be found in each isotherm indicating the presence of mesopores in mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 p fig 2g liang et al 2022b additionally as expected mnfe2o4 s exhibits a larger bet specific surface area and pore volume 112 14 m2 g 1 and 0 27 cm3 g 1 compared with mnfe2o4 p 58 73 m2 g 1 and 0 17 cm3 g 1 fig 2g and h based on the unique sponge like structure with a combination of interlacing macropores and mesopores which is in accordance with the sem results 3 2 degradation of bpa bpa was selected as the target contaminant to evaluate the degradation performance of mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 p in fig 3a pms or mnfe2o4 s alone shows negligible reactivity toward bpa degradation whereas more than 99 of bpa can be rapidly degraded within 15 min in mnfe2o4 s pms system mnfe2o4 p with particle agglomeration could degrade 91 of bpa with pms activation within 20 min and the apparent rate constant k is 0 163 min 1 which is much lower than that of the mnfe2o4 s pms system 0 256 min 1 fig s7 the enhanced performance can be attributed to the sponge like structure with a combination of three dimensional interlacing macropores and mesopores which exposes more active sites and accelerates mass transfer liu et al 2020 simultaneously the effects of the ca metal ratio and reaction parameters including activator dosage and pms dosage on the degradation of bpa in the mnfe2o4 s pms system were also investigated fig s8 and s9 a comparison of other metal oxides for bpa degradation is shown fig 3b the removal efficiencies of the typical activators e g fe3o4 and mn3o4 pms systems are all below 50 within 20 min in contrast the superior removal efficiency of the mnfe2o4 s pms system is prominent the mnfe2o4 s pms system performs better under a shorter reaction time or lower pms dosage than the other systems reported in table s3 a series of spinel type activators prepared via different synthesis methods for organic contaminants degradation is presented in table s4 compared with the typical methods e g co precipitation hydrothermal and sol gel methods the solvent free molten method significantly shortens the preparation time just 120 min for spinel type activators that maintain comparable or better degradation performance cai et al 2020 krishna et al 2020 sarkar et al 2022 moreover wastewater is not produced and extra energy is not consumed during preparation namely mnfe2o4 s with excellent degradation performance can be rapidly prepared using the solvent free molten method without any solvents or extra energy consumption interestingly this method was also successfully used to synthesize other sponge like porous spinel ferrites i e cofe2o4 s cufe2o4 s nife2o4 s and znfe2o4 s which also exhibit satisfactory degradation performance for bpa text s3 fig s10 s14 therefore this method is promising for environmentally friendly and scalable preparation of porous sponge like spinel ferrites 3 3 anti interference of mnfe2o4 s 3 3 1 effect of anions ubiquitous anions in water cl no3 hco3 and h2po4 may interfere with bpa degradation therefore their effect on the removal of bpa in mnfe2o4 s p pms systems was investigated in detail fig 4a c li et al 2022b with the addition of cl no3 and hco3 the removal efficiency of mnfe2o4 s pms system is enhanced and the corresponding k increases by 31 6 28 1 and 35 9 respectively this phenomenon can be ascribed to the generation of substances with higher activity e g cl2 and hocl and the change in ph ali et al 2020 wang et al 2020 a similar positive effect also occurs in the mnfe2o4 p pms system and the corresponding k increases by 12 3 17 8 and 19 6 in the existence cl no3 and hco3 respectively interestingly the positive effect of these anions on mnfe2o4 s pms is more significant than that on mnfe2o4 p pms which is likely due to the unique sponge like structure increasing the exposure of the active sites and improving the mass transfer efficiency thus allowing for a more obvious positive effect however after the addition of h2po4 obvious inhibition is observed in both the mnfe2o4 s pms and mnfe2o4 p pms systems with k sharply decreasing to 0 006 and 0 007 min 1 respectively this result may be attributed to the quenching effect of h2po4 on ros in addition the strong affinity of h2po4 for the transition metals may also be an important factor for the decreased performance because h2po4 can occupy the metal active sites on the surface of mnfe2o4 to impede the activation of pms and degradation of bpa xu et al 2016 yang et al 2021 3 3 2 effect of nom as a common nom ha is usually present in wastewater and inhibits the degradation of contaminants by covering active sites or quenching radical species in the system li et al 2022a zhang et al 2020 fig 5a c depicts the bpa degradation performance of the mnfe2o4 s p pms system in the presence of ha as presented in fig 5a bpa could still be completely removed within 20 min in the mnfe2o4 s pms system with 20 and 40 mg l 1 of ha in contrast when 20 mg l 1 40 mg l 1 of ha was added to in the mnfe2o4 p pms system only 73 60 of bpa was degraded within 20 min fig 5b additionally the corresponding k in the mnfe2o4 s pms system slightly decreases by 7 1 and 25 8 with the addition of 20 mg l 1 and 40 mg l 1 of ha whereas that in the mnfe2o4 p pms system sharply decreased by 53 4 and 66 3 respectively fig 5c this phenomenon reveals a stronger resistance to macromolecular nom i e ha in the mnfe2o4 s pms system compared with that in the mnfe2o4 p system which may be related to the unique structure of the mnfe2o4 s the diameter of ha was determined to reveal the resistance mechanism as shown in fig 5d the average diameter of ha is 783 6 nm which is much bigger than that of the mnfe2o4 s 77 2 or 68 2 nm but smaller than that of mnfe2o4 p 946 5 nm therefore the difference in the ha anti interference properties of both systems was likely based on the difference in pore diameter additionally tannic acid ta another typical nom similar to ha was selected as the macromolecular nom to further confirm the results proposed above fig s15 shao et al 2022 when ta with an average diameter of 836 4 nm fig s16 was added the k only decreases by 5 1 in the mnfe2o4 s pms system whereas it decreased by 41 7 in the mnfe2o4 p pms this further proves that mnfe2o4 s possesses a size sieving effect caused by the sponge structure and mediated by the pore size and porous structure thus leading to the efficient degradation of bpa in complex wastewater 3 3 3 effect of water matrix to further compare the effects of anions and organic macromolecules on bpa degradation in the two systems deionized water in the degradation experiments was replaced with tap water and lake water fig 6a c owing to the presence of cl and no3 in tap water the bpa degradation performance of both systems is enhanced meanwhile the corresponding k increases from 0 256 to 0 346 min 1 in the mnfe2o4 s pms system and from 0 163 to 0 256 min 1 in the mnfe2o4 p pms system fig 6c with lake water as a water matrix no obvious inhibition can be observed in the mnfe2o4 s pms system k only decreases by 0 8 whereas the removal efficiency declines significantly in the mnfe2o4 p pms system k decreases by 35 6 the nom in the lake water matrix may be the main reason for the severe inhibition observed for the mnfe2o4 p pms system luo et al 2021 however nom in the lake water is lower to verify this interpretation the effect of a lower ha concentration 5 mg l 1 on the degradation of bpa was also investigated as expected k is suppressed by 32 5 in the mnfe2o4 p pms system while it shows almost no inhibition in the mnfe2o4 s pms system under 5 mg l 1 of ha thus supporting the above assumption fig s17 based on the above results the sieving effect of the sponge structure and comparison with the particle structure are illustrated in scheme 2 mnfe2o4 p cannot sieve macromolecules e g nom and small molecules e g pms and bpa because it possesses the largest average macropore diameter formed by particle stacking subsequently because of the unprotected active sites serious competition for active sites occurs between nom and pms bpa during degradation once the active sites on the surface are occupied by nom the degradation performance declines steeply in contrast mnfe2o4 s presents a small macropore diameter and thus can intercept the macromolecules while allowing small molecules to traverse and reach active sites inside mnfe2o4 s this characteristic to some extent can effectively inhibit the competition between ha and pms bpa on the active sites and the quenching of ros thereby realizing the efficient activation of pms and degradation of bpa therefore the sponge like structure of mnfe2o4 s promotes the mass transfer efficiency and enlarges the bet specific surface area while the macropores can also effectively sieve and screen interfering macromolecules thus making mnfe2o4 s highly resistant to nom in summary mnfe2o4 s with a three dimensional interlacing macropore structure exhibits excellent anti interference in complex water matrices 3 4 mechanism of pms activation by mnfe2o4 s 3 4 1 identification of reactive oxygen species ros quenching experiments were conducted to identify the main ros in the mnfe2o4 s pms system during bpa degradation figure s18 as presented in figure s18 only slight inhibition of bpa degradation can be observed in the presence of meoh tba bq ffa and nba however the removal efficiency of bpa decreases sharply to 59 with the addition of 10 mm phenol and continues to decrease to 40 and 35 as the concentration of phenol increases to 20 and 30 mm respectively based on the above results surface bound so4 is considered the main ros in the mnfe2o4 s pms system for the degradation of bpa 3 4 2 mechanism of pms activation by mnfe2o4 s to further investigate the mechanism of pms activation by mnfe2o4 s xps and atr ftir tests were performed figures s19 and s20 based on the above results a possible mechanism of pms activation by mnfe2o4 s is proposed as follows scheme s2 in solution active sites on the surface of mnfe2o4 s such as m ii m mn and fe react with adsorbed water molecules to generate m ii oh groups dong et al 2020b with the addition of pms hso5 can couple with hydroxyl groups via electrostatic interactions surface adsorption and hydrogen chemical bonding thus leading to the formation of m ii oh oso3 complexes eqs s1 s5 feng et al 2016 ren et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 both fe ii and mn ii subsequently provide electrons to pms which triggers pms activation eqs s6 and s7 zhou et al 2020 meanwhile mn iii can activate pms via a path similar to that of mn ii to produce so4 and mn iv eq s8 liang et al 2022a in addition mn iii can react with hso5 to generate mn ii and so5 thereby regenerating mn ii eq s9 dong et al 2020a considering the standard redox potential of mn iii mn ii is 1 51 v vs nhe which is more positive than that of fe iii fe ii 0 77 v vs nhe and hso5 so5 1 11 v vs nhe huang et al 2017 hence the regeneration of mn iii and mn ii via the reaction with fe ii is thermodynamically feasible eqs s10 and s11 zhou et al 2020 however fe ii could not be regenerated by the interaction between hso5 and fe iii similarly mn iii is difficult to regenerate from mn iv by hso5 due to lower the standard redox potential of mn iv mn iii 0 95 v vs nhe in comparison with that of hso5 so5 ultimately the surface bound so4 is used to efficiently degrade bpa eq s12 possible degradation pathways for bpa in this system are proposed based on the formed intermediates scheme s3 and table s5 significantly the mineralization efficiency of bpa reaches 76 9 indicating that the mnfe2o4 s pms system possesses an excellent mineralization capacity figure s21 3 5 practicability of mnfe2o4 s to evaluate the application prospects of mnfe2o4 s under practical conditions the effects of reaction temperature ph and bpa concentration were also explored as shown in fig 7a with an increase in reaction temperature from 15 to 35 c the time to degrade bpa beyond 96 is shortened from 20 to 8 min while k increases from 0 186 to 0 435 min 1 fig s22a this is because heating contributes to pms activation to generate more ros facilitating bpa removal in the mnfe2o4 s pms system the activation energy e a of the degradation is 31 45 kj mol 1 which is lower than that of spinel ferrites e g mnfe2o4 36 10 kj mol 1 and cofe2o4 49 70 kj mol 1 fig s22b liang et al 2022a liang et al 2022b fig 7b depicts the excellent degradation of bpa over 97 within 20 min in the ph range of 3 8 11 0 the k increases from 0 168 min 1 to 0 602 min 1 as the initial ph increases from 3 8 to 11 0 fig s22c pms pka1 0 pka2 9 4 presents in the form of hso5 under acidic conditions feng et al 2016 in addition the hydrogen bonding formed by h with the o o structure in hso5 is more significant compared to that under neutral or basic conditions which hinders its interaction with the positively charged groups mn ii oh fe ii oh on the activator surface zhang et al 2013 moreover alkaline conditions are favorable for the formation of hydroxyl groups on the surface which provides more ligands for its reaction with pms eq s 1 s 5 thus promoting the degradation of bpa lai et al 2018 in addition under bpa concentrations of 1 5 or 10 mg l 1 the k remains at approximately 0 5 min 1 fig s22d while the corresponding removal efficiency maintains at 96 within 8 min fig 7c despite the increase in bpa concentration from 10 to 20 mg l 1 the removal efficiency is over 96 within 15 min which means that this system is applicable for the treatment of a wide range of bpa concentrations additionally the excellent removal efficiency of bpa can be maintained in tap water and lake water fig 6 to assess the universality of the system emerging contaminants i e bpf bpaf pcp dcp tcp phenol cip and tc were used as targeted contaminants as displayed in figs 7d and s22e nearly 100 of the bpa and bpf in the system can be removed within 20 min however the removal efficiency of bpaf is 57 within 30 min this finding may be related to the f atoms in bpaf acting as electron withdrawing groups which may weaken the reactivity of so4 towards bpaf and decrease the degradation efficiency of bpaf jia et al 2022 as shown in fig 7e the removal efficiencies are 47 92 98 and 100 for phenol pcp dcp and tcp respectively implying the universality of the system for degrading typical phenolic contaminants interestingly k follows the order phenol 0 023 min 1 pcp 0 085 min 1 dcp 0 125 min 1 tcp 0 183 min 1 fig s22f which shows a positive correlation with the number of chlorine substituents this may be because the degradation of pcp dcp and tcp is accompanied by dehalogenation yang et al 2014 the released cl reacts with so4 and further produces hocl and cl2 thereby accelerating the degradation of contaminants which is consistent with the results in section 3 3 1 in addition to multiple phenolic contaminants typical antibiotics such as tc and cip can be effectively removed by 80 0 and 95 0 respectively fig s23 these results indicate that the mnfe2o4 s pms system exhibits satisfactory universality to degrade multiple emerging contaminants that may occur in an actual water environment additionally four consecutive experiments a regenerative experiment and a magnetism experiment were performed as shown in fig s24 s26 and the findings confirm the excellent capability of mnfe2o4 s for reuse regeneration and magnetic recovery to further demonstrate the practical application potential of the system it was used to treat bcw with non biodegradable contaminant and nom fig 7f when pms alone was added almost no decrease in toc and uv254 is observed in the only mnfe2o4 s system approximately 25 0 of uv254 and 30 0 of toc were removed which was probably associated with the adsorption of porous material however in the mnfe2o4 s pms system nearly 63 0 of uv254 and 73 0 of toc are removed indicating the excellent performance of the system in bcw treatment more importantly in the mnfe2o4 s pms system the codcr of bcw sharply drops from 161 8 to 16 0 mg l 1 thus achieving the emission standard of pollutants for the coking chemical industry in china and even the grade i a for pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant in china overall these results indicate that the mnfe2o4 s pms system has promising potential for practical applications 4 conclusion in this work sponge like mnfe2o4 s with a three dimensional interlacing macropore and mesopore structure was successfully synthesized via a facile solvent free molten method this method simultaneously presents low energy consumption no wastewater discharge and no toxic reagents the prepared mnfe2o4 s exhibits a superior performance k 0 256 min 1 compared to mnfe2o4 p k 0 163 min 1 for pms activation for bpa degradation the improved performance is attributed to more active site exposure and more efficient mass transfer caused by the interconnected macropore structure and larger specific surface area in addition the mnfe2o4 s pms system exhibits an outstanding anti interference for the degradation of bpa in the presence of ha the k value was suppressed by 7 1 under 20 mg l 1 ha and this value was much lower than that in the mnfe2o4 p pms system 53 4 in the lake water matrices almost no inhibition is observed in the mnfe2o4 s pms system while k was inhibited by 35 6 in the mnfe2o4 p pms system these phenomena are ascribed to the sieving effect of the sponge structure resulting from the difference in pore size and diameter of the nom surface bound so4 is regarded as the main ros for bpa degradation in the mnfe2o4 s pms system its excellent removal efficiency can be maintained in the presence of anions and over a wide range of ph and bpa concentrations in addition the system also exhibits universality for the removal of multiple emerging contaminants e g bpf tcp tc and cip more importantly 63 0 73 0 and 90 1 of uv254 toc and codcr can be effectively removed from the bcw by the mnfe2o4 s pms system and the treated codcr conforms to the emission standard in china hence this work provides an alternative method for the industrial construction of high activity porous spinel ferrites with outstanding anti interference and is expected to drive the practical application of heterogeneous aops for the removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater

15036,ubiquitous macromolecular natural organic matter nom in wastewater seriously influences the removal of emerging small molecule contaminants via heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes because this material covers active sites and quenches reactive oxygen species here sponge like magnetic manganese ferrite mnfe2o4 s with a three dimensional hierarchical porous structure was prepared via a facile solvent free molten method compared with the particle like structure of mnfe2o4 p the sponge like structure of mnfe2o4 s presents an enlarged specific surface area 112 14 m2 g 1 vs 58 73 m2 g 1 and a smaller macropore diameter 68 2 77 2 nm vs 946 5 nm enlarging the specific surface area increases the exposure of active sites and adjusting the pore size helps sieve nom and emerging contaminants these changes are expected to effectively improve the degradation activity and overcome interference to confirm the superiority of the sponge like structure mnfe2o4 s was used to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of multiple emerging contaminants and its ability to degrade bisphenol a with and without humic acid ha was compared with that of mnfe2o4 p the degradation activity of mnfe2o4 s was 1 6 times greater than that of mnfe2o4 p moreover 20 mg l 1 ha inhibited the degradation activity of mnfe2o4 s by only 7 1 which was much lower than that obtained for mnfe2o4 p 53 4 in addition the excellent performance was maintained in multiple water matrices notably under lake water matrices the degradation activity of mnfe2o4 p was inhibited by 35 6 while that of mnfe2o4 s was hardly inhibited more importantly the mnfe2o4 s pms system was also applicable to the treatment of actual wastewater and 73 0 and 90 1 of total organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand was removed from bio treated coking wastewater containing non biodegradable contaminants and nom this study provides an alternative route for the green production of high activity porous spinel ferrites with environmental anti interference properties graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese ferrite three dimensional structure peroxymonosulfate activation emerging contaminants anti interference data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction sulfate radical so4 advanced oxidation processes sr aops are considered a feasible and efficient technology for emerging contaminant degradation because of their high oxidative potential and wide applicable ph range ali et al 2020 guan et al 2013 liu et al 2019 recently metal based materials have been regarded as promising activators for the production of so4 by peroxymonosulfate pms activation owing to their multiple valence states and facile separation bao et al 2022 song et al 2022 zhao et al 2020 natural organic matter nom such as humic acid ha is ubiquitous in wastewater and may cover the active sites on activators and quench reactive oxygen species ros thereby dramatically decreasing the activation performance zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 therefore designing a metal based activator that can resist the interference of organic substances in wastewater is of great significance recent reports indicated that the interlacing pore structure of porous materials increases the specific surface area and reduces the diffusive resistance of mass transport thereby improving the ability of targeted molecules to access the inner active sites therefore porous materials have received significant sustained attention in various fields edwards et al 1997 liu et al 2022 zhu et al 2020 for example li et al prepared a yolk shell co c nanoreactors derived from zif 67 and used them for pms activation and they exhibited an enhanced bisphenol a bpa degradation rate despite the presence of ha zhang et al 2020 the outstanding anti interference and performance of the yolk shell co c nanoreactors are attributed to the synergetic effects of size exclusion and confinement specifically organic macromolecules are intercepted by porous shells to protect the inner active sites while targeted small molecules can pass through the material and bind to the inner active sites interestingly a similar phenomenon can be found in the co3o4 multi shelled hollow microspheres pms system resulting from its porous shell li et al 2022c nevertheless these activators have been difficult to industrialize because of their complicated synthesis processes harsh production conditions and low yield moreover despite the excellent anti interference of the above systems their low stability and difficulty achieving rapid separation from wastewater are vital problems that need to be solved in addition few reports have detailed the resistance of porous materials for nom in the degradation of emerging contaminants thus more porous activators with anti interference properties need to be developed spinel ferrites which are typical metal based materials are considered promising activators in fenton like reactions because of their facile preparation process high stability and magnetic separation feng et al 2016 ren et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 however the low specific surface area due to severe particle agglomeration and poor dispersibility of the active sites in spinel ferrites always results in limited exposure of the active sites and poor mass transfer efficiency hu et al 2021 meanwhile porous spinel ferrites can hardly be prepared via traditional synthetic methods such as co precipitation and hydrothermal methods peng et al 2021 the template method is a viable strategy for the preparation of porous spinel ferrites unfortunately the low yield toxic template scavengers and long synthesis time hinder its further application deng et al 2016 rashti et al 2021 thus developing a green and efficient method of constructing porous spinel ferrites and ensuring that the ferrites can selectively remove targeted contaminants in wastewater with nom via the sieving effect are key issues driving the widespread application of heterogeneous aops the gas release strategy involving the calcination of inorganic salts and organic matter has been widely applied for the preparation of porous materials badami et al 2020 liu et al 2022 inspired by these studies we propose an environmentally friendly and scalable method using citric acid to prepare sponge like mnfe2o4 mnfe2o4 s neither solvents nor extra energy consumption was required to obtain mnfe2o4 s in a short time to reveal the superiority of the sponge like structure for the selective and efficient removal of emerging contaminants mnfe2o4 s was applied to activate pms for multiple emerging contaminants degradation and its ability to degrade bpa with and without ha pollution was compared with that of mnfe2o4 particles mnfe2o4 p simultaneously the performance of the mnfe2o4 s pms and mnfe2o4 p pms systems was evaluated under multiple water matrices including tap water and lake water additionally the applicability of the mnfe2o4 s pms system for bio treated coking wastewater bcw with non biodegradable contaminant and nom was also explored this study provides an alternative route for the green and scalable production of porous spinel ferrites that possess anti interference properties and can selectively and efficiently remove emerging contaminants from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials information regarding the experimental materials is provided in text s1 the tap and lake water used in the experiments were obtained from shanghai and siyuan lake of shanghai jiao tong university respectively table s1 the bcw was obtained from the china pingmei shenma group in pingdingshan city henan province table s2 2 2 preparation of mnfe2o4 s the preparation process of mnfe2o4 s is presented in scheme 1 specifically 12 608 g of citric acid monohydrate c6h8o7 h2o ca 6 464 g of iron iii nitrate nonahydrate fe no3 3 9h2o and 1 961 g of manganese acetate tetrahydrate mn ch3coo 2 4h2o were mechanically ground in a mortar until they were uniformly mixed subsequently the mixture was heated to 400 c at 2 c min 1 and maintained for 120 min in a muffle furnace air atmosphere to obtain blackened products i e mnfe2o4 s additionally a series of single factor experiments was performed to optimize the molar ratio of the raw materials i e ca metal 2 3 characterization of spinel ferrites the preparation process of spinel ferrite was traced by simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry thermogravimetric analysis dsc tga the prepared spinel ferrites were characterized using x ray powder diffraction xrd raman microscopy scanning electron microscopy sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and n2 adsorption desorption isotherms etc the diameters of ha and tannic acid ta was measured by dynamic light scattering using a zeta potential particle sizer zeta pals details of the characterization are provided in text s2 2 4 experimental procedure and analytical method the degradation performance was assessed in a constant temperature bath an amount of activator 0 20 0 30 0 40 and 0 50 g l 1 was added to 50 ml of a solution of bpa 1 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 and then dispersed in a beaker the suspension was stirred for 15 min to guarantee the adsorption desorption equilibrium of bpa on the activator afterwards pms 0 05 0 10 0 20 and 0 40 g l 1 was added to the above suspension under vigorous stirring subsequently 1 0 ml of the suspension was collected and quenched rapidly with 1 0 ml of methanol meoh at certain time intervals 0 2 4 6 8 10 15 and 20 min the mixture was filtered by 0 22 μm membrane and then the bpa concentration in the filtrate was detected to investigate the environmental resistance and structure performance relationship the effect of inorganic ions and nom on the degradation of bpa was also studied by adding nacl nano3 nahco3 nah2po4 ha and ta additionally the main reactive oxygen species ros were explored via quenching experiments using meoh tert butanol tba n butanol nba phenol p benzoquinone bq and furfuryl alcohol ffa as scavengers the effects of the initial ph 3 8 6 6 9 2 and 11 0 and reaction temperature 15 25 and 35 c on the degradation of bpa were investigated and 1 0 m h2so4 and 1 0 m naoh were selected to adjust the initial ph of the bpa solution to evaluate the universality of mnfe2o4 s some emerging contaminants such as bisphenol f bpf bisphenol af bpaf phenol p chlorophenol pcp 2 4 dichlorophenol dcp 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp ciprofloxacin cip and tetracycline hydrochloride tc were selected to replace bpa in the degradation experiments the concentration of bpa in the filtrate was measured using high performance liquid chromatography hplc system lc 16 shimadzu japan with a wondasil c18 wr column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm a methanol ultra water solution containing 0 2 formic acid 65 35 v v was applied as the mobile phase and the flow rate was set at 1 0 ml min 1 the intermediates during the degradation of bpa were determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc q tof ms thermo with eclipse plus c18 column 4 6 100 mm 3 5 μm the mobile phase was delivered at 0 50 ml min 1 by a gradient system and consisted of methanol and ultrapure water with 0 1 formic acid and 10 mm ammonium formate the mass spectra were gained in the m z range of 50 600 the total organic carbon toc was detected using a toc analyzer multi 3100 analytik jena ag germany the concentrations of cl no3 and so4 2 were measured using an ion chromatography system 761 compact ic metrohm switzerland the ph value was measured using a ph meter pb 10 sartorius germany and the conductivity level was measured using a conductivity meter dds 307 yueping china the codcr of the bcw was measured using the titrimetric method which employs dichromate as the oxidant in an acidic solution maintained at 180 c for 2 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization as shown in fig 1a seven diffraction peaks appear in the mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 p spectra that correspond to the 111 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes respectively and these findings are consistent with the spinel type mnfe2o4 icdd pdf 01 071 4919 liang et al 2022a this illustrates the successful synthesis of spinel mnfe2o4 s via the solvent free molten method simultaneously mnfe2o4 s with different ca metal ratios was also successfully prepared without impurities meaning that ca metal cannot affect the formation of the spinel type structure fig s1 in addition an obvious raman peak appears at 614 cm 1 for both mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 p which corresponds to the a1g mode of spinel mnfe2o4 fig 1b liu et al 2016 as shown in fig 1c the peaks of mn 2p fe 2p and o 1s appear in the wide scan xps spectra of mnfe2o4 s and they are similar to those of mnfe2o4 p thus confirming the co existence of mn fe and o liang et al 2022b no significant shift is observed in the mn 2p and fe 2p xps spectra of mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 s fig s2 therefore the results of the above characterizations jointly demonstrate that the structure of mnfe2o4 s is identical to that of mnfe2o4 p thus implying that the solvent free molten method does not influence the crystal structure of mnfe2o4 mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 p were characterized by sem to study their morphology a three dimensional interlacing macropore structure can be observed in mnfe2o4 s which is similar to a sponge structure fig 2a and b figure s3 indicates that mn fe and o are uniformly distributed in mnfe2o4 s to explore the formation mechanism of the sponge like structure in mnfe2o4 s dsc tga was conducted fig s4 and a possible formation mechanism was proposed scheme s1 briefly the three dimensional porous structure of mnfe2o4 s is likely produced by the release of gas products such as water vapor co2 and nitrogen oxides from the burning of ca as a fuel and pore forming agent during preparation additionally sem images of mnfe2o4 s with diverse ca metal ratios are shown in fig s5 to investigate the effect of the ca metal ratio on the morphology of mnfe2o4 s insufficient ca causes pores to shrink and even disappear whereas excessive ca can result in the collapse of the sponge like structure tao et al 2022 thus the sponge like structure of mnfe2o4 s depends on the ca metal ratio in contrast the nanoparticles in mnfe2o4 p were distributed in a disorderly manner and agglomerated severely thus forming variously sized particles fig 2c and d hence compared with mnfe2o4 p the sponge like structure in mnfe2o4 s may increase the specific surface area and facilitate mass transfer thereby exposing more active sites and improving the activity for pms activation and bpa degradation hu et al 2021 to reveal the pore size characteristics nano measure and n2 adsorption desorption experiments were carried out based on the information in fig 2a and b the average macropore diameter of mnfe2o4 s was 77 2 and 68 2 nm respectively fig 2e and f as for mnfe2o4 p the average macropore diameter formed by particle stacking reaches 946 5 nm which is much larger than that in mnfe2o4 s fig s6 notably the macropore diameter of mnfe2o4 s is more uniform than that of mnfe2o4 p the significant difference in the average pore diameter may have been the key factor underlying the anti interference property meanwhile a typical iupac type iv shape with h3 type hysteresis can be found in each isotherm indicating the presence of mesopores in mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 p fig 2g liang et al 2022b additionally as expected mnfe2o4 s exhibits a larger bet specific surface area and pore volume 112 14 m2 g 1 and 0 27 cm3 g 1 compared with mnfe2o4 p 58 73 m2 g 1 and 0 17 cm3 g 1 fig 2g and h based on the unique sponge like structure with a combination of interlacing macropores and mesopores which is in accordance with the sem results 3 2 degradation of bpa bpa was selected as the target contaminant to evaluate the degradation performance of mnfe2o4 s and mnfe2o4 p in fig 3a pms or mnfe2o4 s alone shows negligible reactivity toward bpa degradation whereas more than 99 of bpa can be rapidly degraded within 15 min in mnfe2o4 s pms system mnfe2o4 p with particle agglomeration could degrade 91 of bpa with pms activation within 20 min and the apparent rate constant k is 0 163 min 1 which is much lower than that of the mnfe2o4 s pms system 0 256 min 1 fig s7 the enhanced performance can be attributed to the sponge like structure with a combination of three dimensional interlacing macropores and mesopores which exposes more active sites and accelerates mass transfer liu et al 2020 simultaneously the effects of the ca metal ratio and reaction parameters including activator dosage and pms dosage on the degradation of bpa in the mnfe2o4 s pms system were also investigated fig s8 and s9 a comparison of other metal oxides for bpa degradation is shown fig 3b the removal efficiencies of the typical activators e g fe3o4 and mn3o4 pms systems are all below 50 within 20 min in contrast the superior removal efficiency of the mnfe2o4 s pms system is prominent the mnfe2o4 s pms system performs better under a shorter reaction time or lower pms dosage than the other systems reported in table s3 a series of spinel type activators prepared via different synthesis methods for organic contaminants degradation is presented in table s4 compared with the typical methods e g co precipitation hydrothermal and sol gel methods the solvent free molten method significantly shortens the preparation time just 120 min for spinel type activators that maintain comparable or better degradation performance cai et al 2020 krishna et al 2020 sarkar et al 2022 moreover wastewater is not produced and extra energy is not consumed during preparation namely mnfe2o4 s with excellent degradation performance can be rapidly prepared using the solvent free molten method without any solvents or extra energy consumption interestingly this method was also successfully used to synthesize other sponge like porous spinel ferrites i e cofe2o4 s cufe2o4 s nife2o4 s and znfe2o4 s which also exhibit satisfactory degradation performance for bpa text s3 fig s10 s14 therefore this method is promising for environmentally friendly and scalable preparation of porous sponge like spinel ferrites 3 3 anti interference of mnfe2o4 s 3 3 1 effect of anions ubiquitous anions in water cl no3 hco3 and h2po4 may interfere with bpa degradation therefore their effect on the removal of bpa in mnfe2o4 s p pms systems was investigated in detail fig 4a c li et al 2022b with the addition of cl no3 and hco3 the removal efficiency of mnfe2o4 s pms system is enhanced and the corresponding k increases by 31 6 28 1 and 35 9 respectively this phenomenon can be ascribed to the generation of substances with higher activity e g cl2 and hocl and the change in ph ali et al 2020 wang et al 2020 a similar positive effect also occurs in the mnfe2o4 p pms system and the corresponding k increases by 12 3 17 8 and 19 6 in the existence cl no3 and hco3 respectively interestingly the positive effect of these anions on mnfe2o4 s pms is more significant than that on mnfe2o4 p pms which is likely due to the unique sponge like structure increasing the exposure of the active sites and improving the mass transfer efficiency thus allowing for a more obvious positive effect however after the addition of h2po4 obvious inhibition is observed in both the mnfe2o4 s pms and mnfe2o4 p pms systems with k sharply decreasing to 0 006 and 0 007 min 1 respectively this result may be attributed to the quenching effect of h2po4 on ros in addition the strong affinity of h2po4 for the transition metals may also be an important factor for the decreased performance because h2po4 can occupy the metal active sites on the surface of mnfe2o4 to impede the activation of pms and degradation of bpa xu et al 2016 yang et al 2021 3 3 2 effect of nom as a common nom ha is usually present in wastewater and inhibits the degradation of contaminants by covering active sites or quenching radical species in the system li et al 2022a zhang et al 2020 fig 5a c depicts the bpa degradation performance of the mnfe2o4 s p pms system in the presence of ha as presented in fig 5a bpa could still be completely removed within 20 min in the mnfe2o4 s pms system with 20 and 40 mg l 1 of ha in contrast when 20 mg l 1 40 mg l 1 of ha was added to in the mnfe2o4 p pms system only 73 60 of bpa was degraded within 20 min fig 5b additionally the corresponding k in the mnfe2o4 s pms system slightly decreases by 7 1 and 25 8 with the addition of 20 mg l 1 and 40 mg l 1 of ha whereas that in the mnfe2o4 p pms system sharply decreased by 53 4 and 66 3 respectively fig 5c this phenomenon reveals a stronger resistance to macromolecular nom i e ha in the mnfe2o4 s pms system compared with that in the mnfe2o4 p system which may be related to the unique structure of the mnfe2o4 s the diameter of ha was determined to reveal the resistance mechanism as shown in fig 5d the average diameter of ha is 783 6 nm which is much bigger than that of the mnfe2o4 s 77 2 or 68 2 nm but smaller than that of mnfe2o4 p 946 5 nm therefore the difference in the ha anti interference properties of both systems was likely based on the difference in pore diameter additionally tannic acid ta another typical nom similar to ha was selected as the macromolecular nom to further confirm the results proposed above fig s15 shao et al 2022 when ta with an average diameter of 836 4 nm fig s16 was added the k only decreases by 5 1 in the mnfe2o4 s pms system whereas it decreased by 41 7 in the mnfe2o4 p pms this further proves that mnfe2o4 s possesses a size sieving effect caused by the sponge structure and mediated by the pore size and porous structure thus leading to the efficient degradation of bpa in complex wastewater 3 3 3 effect of water matrix to further compare the effects of anions and organic macromolecules on bpa degradation in the two systems deionized water in the degradation experiments was replaced with tap water and lake water fig 6a c owing to the presence of cl and no3 in tap water the bpa degradation performance of both systems is enhanced meanwhile the corresponding k increases from 0 256 to 0 346 min 1 in the mnfe2o4 s pms system and from 0 163 to 0 256 min 1 in the mnfe2o4 p pms system fig 6c with lake water as a water matrix no obvious inhibition can be observed in the mnfe2o4 s pms system k only decreases by 0 8 whereas the removal efficiency declines significantly in the mnfe2o4 p pms system k decreases by 35 6 the nom in the lake water matrix may be the main reason for the severe inhibition observed for the mnfe2o4 p pms system luo et al 2021 however nom in the lake water is lower to verify this interpretation the effect of a lower ha concentration 5 mg l 1 on the degradation of bpa was also investigated as expected k is suppressed by 32 5 in the mnfe2o4 p pms system while it shows almost no inhibition in the mnfe2o4 s pms system under 5 mg l 1 of ha thus supporting the above assumption fig s17 based on the above results the sieving effect of the sponge structure and comparison with the particle structure are illustrated in scheme 2 mnfe2o4 p cannot sieve macromolecules e g nom and small molecules e g pms and bpa because it possesses the largest average macropore diameter formed by particle stacking subsequently because of the unprotected active sites serious competition for active sites occurs between nom and pms bpa during degradation once the active sites on the surface are occupied by nom the degradation performance declines steeply in contrast mnfe2o4 s presents a small macropore diameter and thus can intercept the macromolecules while allowing small molecules to traverse and reach active sites inside mnfe2o4 s this characteristic to some extent can effectively inhibit the competition between ha and pms bpa on the active sites and the quenching of ros thereby realizing the efficient activation of pms and degradation of bpa therefore the sponge like structure of mnfe2o4 s promotes the mass transfer efficiency and enlarges the bet specific surface area while the macropores can also effectively sieve and screen interfering macromolecules thus making mnfe2o4 s highly resistant to nom in summary mnfe2o4 s with a three dimensional interlacing macropore structure exhibits excellent anti interference in complex water matrices 3 4 mechanism of pms activation by mnfe2o4 s 3 4 1 identification of reactive oxygen species ros quenching experiments were conducted to identify the main ros in the mnfe2o4 s pms system during bpa degradation figure s18 as presented in figure s18 only slight inhibition of bpa degradation can be observed in the presence of meoh tba bq ffa and nba however the removal efficiency of bpa decreases sharply to 59 with the addition of 10 mm phenol and continues to decrease to 40 and 35 as the concentration of phenol increases to 20 and 30 mm respectively based on the above results surface bound so4 is considered the main ros in the mnfe2o4 s pms system for the degradation of bpa 3 4 2 mechanism of pms activation by mnfe2o4 s to further investigate the mechanism of pms activation by mnfe2o4 s xps and atr ftir tests were performed figures s19 and s20 based on the above results a possible mechanism of pms activation by mnfe2o4 s is proposed as follows scheme s2 in solution active sites on the surface of mnfe2o4 s such as m ii m mn and fe react with adsorbed water molecules to generate m ii oh groups dong et al 2020b with the addition of pms hso5 can couple with hydroxyl groups via electrostatic interactions surface adsorption and hydrogen chemical bonding thus leading to the formation of m ii oh oso3 complexes eqs s1 s5 feng et al 2016 ren et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 both fe ii and mn ii subsequently provide electrons to pms which triggers pms activation eqs s6 and s7 zhou et al 2020 meanwhile mn iii can activate pms via a path similar to that of mn ii to produce so4 and mn iv eq s8 liang et al 2022a in addition mn iii can react with hso5 to generate mn ii and so5 thereby regenerating mn ii eq s9 dong et al 2020a considering the standard redox potential of mn iii mn ii is 1 51 v vs nhe which is more positive than that of fe iii fe ii 0 77 v vs nhe and hso5 so5 1 11 v vs nhe huang et al 2017 hence the regeneration of mn iii and mn ii via the reaction with fe ii is thermodynamically feasible eqs s10 and s11 zhou et al 2020 however fe ii could not be regenerated by the interaction between hso5 and fe iii similarly mn iii is difficult to regenerate from mn iv by hso5 due to lower the standard redox potential of mn iv mn iii 0 95 v vs nhe in comparison with that of hso5 so5 ultimately the surface bound so4 is used to efficiently degrade bpa eq s12 possible degradation pathways for bpa in this system are proposed based on the formed intermediates scheme s3 and table s5 significantly the mineralization efficiency of bpa reaches 76 9 indicating that the mnfe2o4 s pms system possesses an excellent mineralization capacity figure s21 3 5 practicability of mnfe2o4 s to evaluate the application prospects of mnfe2o4 s under practical conditions the effects of reaction temperature ph and bpa concentration were also explored as shown in fig 7a with an increase in reaction temperature from 15 to 35 c the time to degrade bpa beyond 96 is shortened from 20 to 8 min while k increases from 0 186 to 0 435 min 1 fig s22a this is because heating contributes to pms activation to generate more ros facilitating bpa removal in the mnfe2o4 s pms system the activation energy e a of the degradation is 31 45 kj mol 1 which is lower than that of spinel ferrites e g mnfe2o4 36 10 kj mol 1 and cofe2o4 49 70 kj mol 1 fig s22b liang et al 2022a liang et al 2022b fig 7b depicts the excellent degradation of bpa over 97 within 20 min in the ph range of 3 8 11 0 the k increases from 0 168 min 1 to 0 602 min 1 as the initial ph increases from 3 8 to 11 0 fig s22c pms pka1 0 pka2 9 4 presents in the form of hso5 under acidic conditions feng et al 2016 in addition the hydrogen bonding formed by h with the o o structure in hso5 is more significant compared to that under neutral or basic conditions which hinders its interaction with the positively charged groups mn ii oh fe ii oh on the activator surface zhang et al 2013 moreover alkaline conditions are favorable for the formation of hydroxyl groups on the surface which provides more ligands for its reaction with pms eq s 1 s 5 thus promoting the degradation of bpa lai et al 2018 in addition under bpa concentrations of 1 5 or 10 mg l 1 the k remains at approximately 0 5 min 1 fig s22d while the corresponding removal efficiency maintains at 96 within 8 min fig 7c despite the increase in bpa concentration from 10 to 20 mg l 1 the removal efficiency is over 96 within 15 min which means that this system is applicable for the treatment of a wide range of bpa concentrations additionally the excellent removal efficiency of bpa can be maintained in tap water and lake water fig 6 to assess the universality of the system emerging contaminants i e bpf bpaf pcp dcp tcp phenol cip and tc were used as targeted contaminants as displayed in figs 7d and s22e nearly 100 of the bpa and bpf in the system can be removed within 20 min however the removal efficiency of bpaf is 57 within 30 min this finding may be related to the f atoms in bpaf acting as electron withdrawing groups which may weaken the reactivity of so4 towards bpaf and decrease the degradation efficiency of bpaf jia et al 2022 as shown in fig 7e the removal efficiencies are 47 92 98 and 100 for phenol pcp dcp and tcp respectively implying the universality of the system for degrading typical phenolic contaminants interestingly k follows the order phenol 0 023 min 1 pcp 0 085 min 1 dcp 0 125 min 1 tcp 0 183 min 1 fig s22f which shows a positive correlation with the number of chlorine substituents this may be because the degradation of pcp dcp and tcp is accompanied by dehalogenation yang et al 2014 the released cl reacts with so4 and further produces hocl and cl2 thereby accelerating the degradation of contaminants which is consistent with the results in section 3 3 1 in addition to multiple phenolic contaminants typical antibiotics such as tc and cip can be effectively removed by 80 0 and 95 0 respectively fig s23 these results indicate that the mnfe2o4 s pms system exhibits satisfactory universality to degrade multiple emerging contaminants that may occur in an actual water environment additionally four consecutive experiments a regenerative experiment and a magnetism experiment were performed as shown in fig s24 s26 and the findings confirm the excellent capability of mnfe2o4 s for reuse regeneration and magnetic recovery to further demonstrate the practical application potential of the system it was used to treat bcw with non biodegradable contaminant and nom fig 7f when pms alone was added almost no decrease in toc and uv254 is observed in the only mnfe2o4 s system approximately 25 0 of uv254 and 30 0 of toc were removed which was probably associated with the adsorption of porous material however in the mnfe2o4 s pms system nearly 63 0 of uv254 and 73 0 of toc are removed indicating the excellent performance of the system in bcw treatment more importantly in the mnfe2o4 s pms system the codcr of bcw sharply drops from 161 8 to 16 0 mg l 1 thus achieving the emission standard of pollutants for the coking chemical industry in china and even the grade i a for pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant in china overall these results indicate that the mnfe2o4 s pms system has promising potential for practical applications 4 conclusion in this work sponge like mnfe2o4 s with a three dimensional interlacing macropore and mesopore structure was successfully synthesized via a facile solvent free molten method this method simultaneously presents low energy consumption no wastewater discharge and no toxic reagents the prepared mnfe2o4 s exhibits a superior performance k 0 256 min 1 compared to mnfe2o4 p k 0 163 min 1 for pms activation for bpa degradation the improved performance is attributed to more active site exposure and more efficient mass transfer caused by the interconnected macropore structure and larger specific surface area in addition the mnfe2o4 s pms system exhibits an outstanding anti interference for the degradation of bpa in the presence of ha the k value was suppressed by 7 1 under 20 mg l 1 ha and this value was much lower than that in the mnfe2o4 p pms system 53 4 in the lake water matrices almost no inhibition is observed in the mnfe2o4 s pms system while k was inhibited by 35 6 in the mnfe2o4 p pms system these phenomena are ascribed to the sieving effect of the sponge structure resulting from the difference in pore size and diameter of the nom surface bound so4 is regarded as the main ros for bpa degradation in the mnfe2o4 s pms system its excellent removal efficiency can be maintained in the presence of anions and over a wide range of ph and bpa concentrations in addition the system also exhibits universality for the removal of multiple emerging contaminants e g bpf tcp tc and cip more importantly 63 0 73 0 and 90 1 of uv254 toc and codcr can be effectively removed from the bcw by the mnfe2o4 s pms system and the treated codcr conforms to the emission standard in china hence this work provides an alternative method for the industrial construction of high activity porous spinel ferrites with outstanding anti interference and is expected to drive the practical application of heterogeneous aops for the removal of emerging contaminants from wastewater

15037,peracetic acid combined ultraviolet uv paa process has garnered growing attention as a promising advanced oxidation process aop for wastewater treatment but the corresponding transformation of ubiquitous dissolved organic matter dom under this aop remains unknown this study systematically investigated the changes in characteristics and composition of dom under uv paa as well as the underlying mechanisms by multiple spectroscopic analyses and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry uv paa treatment dramatically decreased aromaticity apparent molecular weight and fluorescent abundance of dom with the production of more oxidized and saturated compounds the reactive species i e oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo in uv paa contributed primarily to dom changes but showed different reaction selectivity and mechanisms oh reacts with dom components and mainly yields oxygenation products via a radical addition pathway comparatively the electron transfer route is more likely to occur in ch3c o o ch3c o oo induced dom transformation aside from oxygenation products electron transfer could exclusively generate decarboxylation products and distinguishes ch3c o o ch3c o oo based aops from oh based aops these findings significantly improve knowledge of dom alterations under uv paa aop at both the bulk and molecular levels graphic abstract image graphical

peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh is an organic peroxyl oxidant with high broad spectrum germicidal efficiency it has been widely used in the medical pulp textile and food processing industries since the 1940s luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 more recently due to its high antimicrobial activity and low potential for disinfection byproduct dbp formation paa has attracted intensive interest in water

2003 beber de souza et al 2015 hassaballah et al 2019 as shown in eqs 1 7 the homolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond in paa and coexisting h2o2 can occur under uv photolysis with the formation of oh and ch3c o o which may further initiate the formation of secondary radicals such as ch3c o oo ch3 and ooch3 cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 among all reactive radicals oh and acetyl per oxyl radicals i

carbamazepine diclofenac and ibuprofen under conditions of treatment with uv paa has been demonstrated to be dependent on the critical roles of oh ch3c o o and ch3c o oo cai et al 2017 a kinetic model has also been developed to predict the evolution of radical species and the corresponding degradation of micropollutants under uv paa zhang and huang 2020 in addition uv paa aop has been successfully applied in several pilot scale studies showing excellent disinfection efficiency and little dbps formation caretti and lubello 2003 hassaballah et al 2019 ao et al 2021a previous studies have suggested that uv paa technology has significant potential in engineering applications therefore it is necessary to comprehensively explore the reaction characteristics of the uv paa treatment 1 c h 3

oxidants and commonly produces adverse effects on treatment efficiency and water quality zhang et al 2021a meanwhile oxidation steps could significantly alter dom composition and characteristics such as aromaticity and molecular weight mw thereby having important implications for bioavailability ramseier et al 2011 contaminant mobility polubesova and chefetz 2014 subdiaga et al 2019 and reactivity with oxidants e g chlorine wenk et al 2013 bulman and remucal 2020 remucal et al 2020 fu et al 2022 notably the alteration of dom composition varies across different oxidation treatments and primarily depends on the reactions between dom and various types of reactive species ike et al 2019 remucal et al 2020 trainer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b 2021c previous study has reported that clo2 and hclo clo could both result in considerable decreases in electron donating capacities edcs and small aromaticity losses of dom conversely ozonation resulted in only slight edc decreases in addition to remarkable aromaticity reduction wenk et al 2013 the molecular transformation of effluent dom from wastewater discharge in typical uv based aops including uv h2o2 uv persulfate and uv chorine has also been investigated in which all processes could result in the generation of compounds with high o c values while the corresponding reactive moieties unique precursor products distribution aromaticity change and acute toxicity under these treatments showed distinct patterns due to different dominating reactive radicals ike et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b as mentioned the uv paa process also involves various reactive species i e oh ch3c o oo and ch3c o o and it has been commonly found that the presence of dom could inhibit the degradation of contaminants by competitively consuming these species chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020b ao et al 2021a accordingly it is expected that dom may reduce the lifetime of reactive species and limit the extent of disinfection and pollutants degradation under uv paa process meanwhile the dom composition and properties may also be altered and affect the quality of receiving waters however the detailed transformation of dom under uv paa as well as the selectivity of involved reactive radicals and mechanisms of reactivity with dom moieties remain unclear the present study aimed to unravel dom alterations and corresponding reaction mechanisms during uv paa oxidation particularly at the molecular level shanghai aladdin humic acid saha a widely used model humic substance in water treatments dong et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 was applied to discern the roles of various reactive radicals in dom transformation by uv paa specifically the optical parameters of saha during dose dependent treatments with paa uv paa uv paa tert butanol uv paa tba and uv h2o2 were measured fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was employed to analyze dom molecular transformation under different treatments the exclusively abated formed and common formulas under each treatment were identified and the precursor product pairs were recognized based on their specific mass differences to identify the decarboxylation and oxygenation reaction pathways to the best of our knowledge this study is among the first to comprehensively evaluate the changes in spectroscopic characteristics and composition of dom under uv paa treatment and elucidate the underlying reaction mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents paa stock solution 2 2 m paa 1 1 m h2o2 and 9 5 m acetic acid was prepared in the laboratory based on the reported method zhao et al 2007 supplementary material 1 text s1 the concentrations of paa and h2o2 were regularly determined using a titration method as described previously cai et al 2017 saha was obtained from aladdin shanghai china commercial supplier without further treatment further details on other materials are available in text s2 2 2 experimental setup uv irradiation experiments were conducted within a 150 ml cylindrical quartz reactor in a chamber equipped with a 6 w low pressure uv lamp 254 nm g6t5 hg lamp philips tuv6w and a running fan figure s1 the average uv fluence rate i0 was measured to be 6 78 mw cm 2 using the potassium ferrioxalate method harris et al 1987 and calculated to be 4 13 mw cm 2 in the reaction solution of 10 mg l 1 saha the average effective light path length l was determined to be 4 40 cm based on the effective area conversion figure s2 certain amounts of oxidants paa and h2o2 were spiked into the reaction solution containing 10 mg c l 1 of saha and buffered with phosphate 10 mm at ph 7 1 the information on reagent doses is listed in table s1 the uv lamp was preheated for 30 min and then the reactor was placed in the uv chamber to initiate the experiment to fully evaluate the alterations of dom caused by paa derived radicals the reaction solutions were exposed to uv irradiation for 3 h under which more than 89 of paa can be degraded and a sufficient reaction between reactive radicals and dom constituents was expected samples were then collected and quenched by excess sodium sulfite 10 folds of the oxidant concentration for spectroscopic analyses and further solid phase extraction for further exploring the contributions of individual factors related treatments including uv paa uv paa tba and uv h2o2 processes were also studied tba is a well known oh scavenger k tba oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and the addition of tba 10 fold of paa concentration in uv paa process can exclude the role of oh and reduce the concentrations of oh induced secondary radicals eqs 1 2 and 4 zhang and huang 2020 2 3 bulk measurements the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of saha working solution was obtained using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu tokyo japan as little doc loss of the single paa or tba solution under uv irradiation was observed the decreases in doc of the dom during treatments were calculated based on the doc difference between solutions before and after reactions ultraviolet visible absorbance and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were determined using a spectrophotometer aqualog kyoto japan eem data were corrected by background and inner filtering before being transformed into raman unit r u murphy et al 2013 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 indicates the dom aromaticity and was calculated by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm by the doc concentration of dom the slope ratio sr a proxy that is commonly inversely correlated with the dom mw was calculated as the ratio of the absorbance spectra slope at 275 295 nm s275 295 to that at 350 400 nm s350 400 e2 e3 is the absorbance ratio at 254 nm to that at 366 nm which is also an indicator of dom mw helms et al 2008 the biological index bix indicates the contribution of newly produced dom and was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence signal at emission wavelength em 380 nm to the maximum signal observed in the range of em 420 435 nm obtained at excitation wavelength ex 310 nm wilson and xenopoulos 2009 the humification index hix an indicator of humification degree was calculated to be the ratio of the em intensity area of 435 480 nm to that of 300 345 nm at ex 254 nm ohno 2002 the fluorescence index fi which indicates the dom source was determined as the ratio of em 470 nm to em 520 nm obtained at ex 370 nm cory et al 2010 all nomenclature and abbreviations are listed in table s2 2 4 esi ft icr ms characterization the molecular level compositional changes of dom samples were further analyzed in electrospray ionization esi with negative mode using a 9 4 t apex ultra ft icr ms bruker daltonics he et al 2020

icr ms is provided in supplementary material 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 bulk changes in dom characteristics after 3 h reaction at 0 60 mmol paa mmol doc a doc removal of 17 5 in uv paa treatment was observed and much higher than those in paa or uv alone 3 table s4 indicating the high radical yield under this treatment kim and huang 2021 zhang et al 2021b the decreased doc removal in uv h2o2 12 4 and uv paa tba 8 7 also supported the significant roles of reactive oxidative species i e oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo in the transformation of dom under uv paa treatment fig 1 and table s5 show the changes in spectroscopic properties of dom with increasing specific paa doses during all treatments the suva254 value of saha sample declined from 0 98 to 0 64 0 78 0 81 0 91 and 0 93 l mg c 1 m 1 after uv paa uv h2o2 uv paa tba uv and paa treatments at 0 60 mmol paa mmol doc respectively fig 1a this result suggests the decreasing aromaticity of dom in the studied treatments in addition as the parameters of sr and e2 e3 were inversely correlated with the electronic interactions between chromophores in larger dom molecules the increasing sr and e2 e3 values in figs 1b and 1c imply the decrease of dom apparent mw during all studied treatments for instance increases in sr from 0 78 to 1 11 and e2 e3 from 2 58 to 3 17 were found after uv paa treatment at 0 60 mmol paa mmol doc table s5 generally uv paa treatment led to the highest absolute alterations of aromaticity and dom mw among all treatments similar decreases in the aromaticity and mw of dom were commonly observed in other aops bulman and remucal 2020 remucal et al 2020 as the conjugated aromatic structures of dom could be partially destroyed by oxidative species with the generation of certain ring opening and lower mw products interestingly variations in bix values with increasing specific paa doses differed across treatments fig 1d moreover the humification degrees of dom samples by different treatments barely changed as little alteration was observed in hix values fig 1e similarly fi values remained stable in the range of 0 95 1 08 during all treatments fig 1f suggesting that the sources of studied dom samples are predominantly terrestrial and remained unchanged during all studied treatments zhang et al 2021d as expected only slight changes in dom spectroscopic parameters were observed by uv or paa alone table s5 accordingly the produced reactive radicals were the main contributors to the changes in dom characteristics in uv paa text s5 in agreement with previous studies reporting that oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo accounted for the rapid degradations of organic contaminants under uv paa cai et al 2017 zhang and huang 2020 ao et al 2021b 3 2 changes in fluorescent dom components here two fluorescent components c1 and c2 of dom samples were recognized from the parafac modeling figure s3 specifically c1 ex em maxima 260 440 nm is traditionally considered a terrestrial humic like component chen et al 2017 while c2 ex em maxima 260 530 nm is similar to sediment soil fulvic like fraction osburn and stedmon 2011 the changes in intensities of these two identified fluorescent components during different treatments were also studied specifically fig 2 and table s6 summarize the decreases in fluorescent components under different treatments the fluorescent intensity of the dom sample decreased with increasing specific paa doses under uv paa while paa alone hardly reacted with these two fluorescent components figs 2a and 2b the relative intensities of fluorescent components c1 and c2 were reduced by 41 7 and 54 2 at 0 60 mmol paa mmol doc in uv paa respectively table s6 unlike the limited contribution of uv alone treatment to doc removal and spectroscopic properties change uv alone read from specific paa dose of 0 in fig 2a decreased 31 0 of c1 and 21 8 of c2 respectively this result may be attributed to the fact that fluorescent components usually occupy a tiny fraction 5 of dom and are more vulnerable to irradiation than other constituents coble et al 2014 interestingly with the increasing paa dose in uv paa tba treatment more c2 component was removed from 8 6 to 15 2 but the intensity of c1 was nearly unchanged in contrast robust decreases in fluorescent components 65 8 of c1 and 79 8 of c2 were observed in oh dominated treatment of uv h2o2 fig 2d these results demonstrated that uv paa process could destroy fluorophores in dom in which oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo played important roles and exhibited different reaction selectivity text s5 3 3 changes in molecular composition of dom ft icr ms was further employed to evaluate the molecular composition of dom before and after the uv paa uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments at 0 60 mmol paa mmol doc at ph 7 1 it has been shown that uv or oxidants paa or h2o2 alone play limited roles in the oxidation of organics compared with the generated reactive species cai et al 2017 varanasi et al 2018 ike et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b table 1 summarizes the bulk molecular parameters abundance weighted averages and the relative abundances of cho chon chos and chons compounds which provides information on how dom changes when exposed to oxidative treatments specifically o cw and noscw increased after all treatments with the greatest increase observed in uv h2o2 similar increased o c ratios of dom by uv h2o2 aop has been widely reported using ft icr ms which indicated the increased degree of oxidation of dom and was attributed to oh additions and h abstractions from aromatic compounds xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b accordingly the oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo in uv paa may account for the increased o cw and noscw values by forming hydroxylated compounds in dom moreover the values of mww dbew and aimod w generally decreased after all treatments which were consistent with the results of changes in spectroscopy derived properties of dom these findings indicate a shift from more towards less aromatic formulas under uv paa process due to the continuous attacks of reactive species which ultimately leads to the destruction of aromatic rings and the formation of low mw products wenk et al 2013 remucal et al 2020 ao et al 2021a to further unravel the molecular level transformation of dom under uv paa the composition of dom after different treatments were characterized by van krevelen diagrams formulas that are present in both untreated and treated samples are denoted as common whereas those that are only present in the untreated sample i e not in the treated sample are termed abated while formulas that are only present in the treated samples i e not in the untreated sample are deemed formed there were 707 formulas abated in uv paa while 1374 formulas were newly formed fig 3a table s7 additionally a significant difference was also observed between the characteristics of abated and formed formulas during uv paa treatment specifically the abated formulas were clustered in the area with lower h c and o c and the corresponding h cw and o cw were 0 81 and 0 40 respectively table s7 in contrast the formed formulas occupied a wide range in h c and o c h cw 1 19 o cw 0 55 indicating the higher saturation and oxidation degree of formed formulas compared to the abated ones varanasi et al 2018 in addition the mww 416 86 da dbew 13 96 and aimod w 0 56 values of abated formulas in uv paa were much higher than those of formed formulas 335 21 da 7 10 and 0 28 respectively which also implies the loss of dom aromaticity unsaturation degree and molecular size the changes in relative intensity of the common formulas were also visualized by calculating the percentage change in relative intensity of a formula compared to that in the control sample bulman and remucal 2020 interestingly the common formulas that decreased in relative intensity were clustered in the low h c and o c region fig 3b in contrast the common formulas with increasing relative intensity were distributed in relatively high h c and o c region fig 3c this result confirmed that the reactive dom moieties in uv paa treatment are generally aromatic and less oxidized compounds which may undergo oxygen addition and or ring cleavage reactions cai et al 2017 zhang and huang 2020 thereby leading to the production of more oxidized saturated and lower mw compounds similar results were also observed in uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments figures s4 and s5 table s7 the decreases of dom mww dbew and aimod w values under these three treatments ranged 17 51 81 65 da 4 55 6 86 and 0 25 0 28 respectively the increases of h cw and o cw values ranged 0 19 0 38 and 0 14 0 29 respectively moreover as shown in table s7 and figure s6 the commonly abated and formed compounds in the three treatments uv paa uv paa tba and uv h2o2 followed the same trends it can thereby be concluded that oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo could all result in the significant loss of dom mw and aromaticity accompanied by an increase of dom saturation and oxidation degree however the differences between uv paa uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments also exist due to the corresponding variety of predominant reactive species among these treatments to further distinguish the different roles of oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo molecular dissimilarities of abated and formed formulas between uv paa tba ch3c o o ch3c o oo dominated and uv h2o2 oh dominated were analyzed by identifying the unique precursors and products in each system fig 4a and table s8 indicate that uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments shared more than 87 1 of abated formulas n 763 and there were 113 12 9 and 111 12 7 uniquely abated formulas for uv paa tba and uv h2o2 respectively in contrast less than 49 8 of formed formulas n 684 overlapped among these two treatments while the unique products rose to 376 35 5 and 690 50 2 for uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments respectively fig 4b these results suggested that ch3c o o ch3c o oo and oh may react with similar precursors but with high selectivity of product formation among all three treatments uv h2o2 is found with the highest number of formed formulas n 1374 table s7 this agrees with the lower selectivity and higher oxidative ability of oh than those of ch3c o o ch3c o oo thus the reaction of dom constituents with oh may yield more types of products than that with ch3c o o ch3c o oo gligorovski et al 2015 remucal et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b figs 4c and 4d present the molecular characteristics of exclusively abated and formed formulas in the two treatments respectively though ch3c o o ch3c o oo and oh shared most of the abated formulas the unique formulas abated by oh mainly featured o c of 0 2 0 3 o cw 0 26 and mw of 250 400 da mww 334 05 da while most of the exclusive precursors for ch3c o o ch3c o oo were observed with higher o c o cw 0 35 respectively and mw mww 357 13 da respectively values figure s7 table s8 this result suggests that compounds with a less oxidized extent and lower mw react more readily with oh than with ch3c o o ch3c o oo for formed products 92 9 of unique formulas from oh were located in o c 0 40 area while only 52 3 of the unique products from ch3c o o ch3c o oo were observed in the same space fig 4d table s8 in addition a few carbohydrate like compounds i e region of o c of 0 7 1 1 and h c of 1 5 2 4 were identified in the unique products from oh zhang et al 2021d which also implied the strong ability of oh to produce highly oxidized and saturated compounds overall these results demonstrated that dom moieties possess dissimilar reaction selectivity and undergo different pathways under the attack of various reactive species in uv paa system which are consistent with the changes in dom spectroscopic properties 3 4 reaction mechanism for different reactive radicals the mechanism of dom transformation in uv paa treatment was further investigated by identifying products compared to precursors from the results of uv paa tba ch3c o o ch3c o oo dominated and uv h2o2 oh dominated two typical oxidation pathways were tested oxygen addition 1o 2o 3o e g phenol to hydroquinone and decarboxylation co2 e g p hydroxybenzoic acid to phenol table s9 remucal et al 2020 trainer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b for each reaction pathway the formulas of predicted products from the untreated dom sample were searched in the unique products of reacted samples for example c7h6o3 is a verified formula in the untreated dom sample while c6h6o will be denoted as a co2 product if it can be searched in the exclusively formed formulas from the reacted samples predicted products based on the two tested oxidation pathways were searched and identified in samples after uv paa uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments fig 5 as expected the uv paa oxidation treatment newly produced 118 formulas corresponding to co2 as well as 213 formulas corresponding to oxygen addition 1o 2o 3o specifically there were 154 201 and 203 formulas denoted as 1o 2o and 3o respectively however they were highly overlapped figure s8 suggesting that a product could be attributable to multiple pathways e g c6h6o4 could result from c6h6o3 1o c6h6o2 2o and or c6h6o 3o kim et al 2019 remucal et al 2020 moreover most decarboxylation products were clustered in the area of o c 0 5 and h c 1 4 while the oxygenation products were mainly located in the region with higher o c and h c ratios this explains why the formed formulas from uv paa treatment were distributed in a vast space though the reaction pathways of co2 and o well described the transformation of dom under uv paa their related products only accounted for approximately one third of those identified other further oxidation reaction pathways such as dehydrogenation and dealkylation may have also occurred for example the oxygenation products may undergo further dehydrogenation reactions i e from hydroquinone to benzoquinone table s9 trainer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b and a total of 208 1o 2o 3o 2h products were recognized under uv paa figure s9 an apparent difference in the number of decarboxylation formulas between uv paa tba and uv h2o2 was observed figs 5b and 5c possibly suggesting the mechanistic differences between oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo there were 167 1o 2o 3o formulas and 96 co2 formulas 36 5 of the recognized formulas identified in uv paa tba whereas only 42 co2 formulas 16 were observed in uv h2o2 this can be attributed to the poor ability of oh to react with aromatic compounds via decarboxylation lee et al 2020 instead radical addition was more favorable in the oh dominated reaction with dom therefore oxygenation could occur in both oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo mediated reactions while decarboxylation was more common in ch3c o o ch3c o oo dominated treatment this is also supported by the result of co ii paa treatment figure s10 in which 167 1o 2o 3o formulas and 122 co2 formulas 42 2 were verified to be newly formed fig 6 presents the general reaction pathways for oxidation of aromatic substrates with oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo the aromatic substrate s usually reacts with oh via radical addition and forms a corresponding hydroxylated product s 1o lee et al 2020 in contrast ch3c o o ch3c o oo generally proceed via an electron transfer route to generate a radical cation s which then readily reacts with h2o and or oh to form the same oxygen addition product s 1o in addition s is also prone to release co2 when the structure of s contains a carboxyl group cooh kim et al 2020 lee et al 2020 the proposed reaction mechanism well explained the present results where more co2 products were found in the exclusive products from ch3c o o ch3c o oo than those from oh fig 5 therefore it was concluded that the decarboxylation pathway is more unique to ch3c o o ch3c o oo while oxygen addition is common to both oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo but via different routes i e radical addition and electron transfer respectively this is also supported by the products distribution results of dom transformation in so4 based aops in which electron transfer is the predominant reaction route and generates more decarboxylation products than conventional oh mediated aops lu et al 2016 chen et al 2020 accordingly ch3c o o ch3c o oo based aops and oh based aops can be well distinguished by identifying the decarboxylation products from aromatic carboxylic acids 4 conclusions and implications uv paa treatment significantly alters the characteristics and molecular composition of dom uv absorbance and fluorescence eem spectra measurements demonstrate the decreases in dom aromaticity apparent mw and fluorescence intensities the molecular level analysis by ft icr ms further reveals the elimination of compounds with low h c and o c values after uv paa treatment accompanied by the generation of lower mw as well as more oxidized and saturated products the results also confirm that the critical reactive species i e oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo in uv paa all participate in the reaction with dom but with different reaction selectivity and mechanisms oh reacts with dom moieties non selectively while radical addition induced oxygenation is proposed to be the primary reaction pathway in comparison the ch3c o o ch3c o oo initiated oxidation of dom is predominantly via electron transfer to produce radical cations which react further by oxygenation and or decarboxylation the decarboxylation of aromatic carboxylic acids is more favorable in ch3c o o ch3c o oo based aop than that in oh based aop the composition and properties of oxidized dom have implications for following wastewater treatment processes as well as waters that receive treated effluent many of the dom compounds observed in uv paa are located in the same van krevelen region as compounds associated with bioavailable dom composition hammes et al 2006 2007 remucal et al 2020 this implies that uv paa aop can produce assimilable organic carbon e g aldehydes and carboxylic acids kim et al 2019 2020 ao et al 2021a the reduced aromaticity of dom during uv paa may also lead to lower formation potential of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids when exposed to chorine wang et al 2015 the results of ft icr ms provide critical information on the transformation of dom in uv paa aop particularly at the molecular level with mechanism elucidation it should be noted that the assigned elemental formulas by mass spectra may have different isomeric structures and it is thus challenging to accurately unravel corresponding reaction mechanisms future studies are also required to determine the bioavailability and oxidation reactivity e g photodegradation and or chlorine reactivity of treated dom to further understand the fate of dom in paa based aops additionally the type of dom e g natural and wastewater dom of various sources and experimental condition could be expanded in the future and it is

15037,peracetic acid combined ultraviolet uv paa process has garnered growing attention as a promising advanced oxidation process aop for wastewater treatment but the corresponding transformation of ubiquitous dissolved organic matter dom under this aop remains unknown this study systematically investigated the changes in characteristics and composition of dom under uv paa as well as the underlying mechanisms by multiple spectroscopic analyses and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry uv paa treatment dramatically decreased aromaticity apparent molecular weight and fluorescent abundance of dom with the production of more oxidized and saturated compounds the reactive species i e oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo in uv paa contributed primarily to dom changes but showed different reaction selectivity and mechanisms oh reacts with dom components and mainly yields oxygenation products via a radical addition pathway comparatively the electron transfer route is more likely to occur in ch3c o o ch3c o oo induced dom transformation aside from oxygenation products electron transfer could exclusively generate decarboxylation products and distinguishes ch3c o o ch3c o oo based aops from oh based aops these findings significantly improve knowledge of dom alterations under uv paa aop at both the bulk and molecular levels graphic abstract image graphical

peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh is an organic peroxyl oxidant with high broad spectrum germicidal efficiency it has been widely used in the medical pulp textile and food processing industries since the 1940s luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 more recently due to its high antimicrobial activity and low potential for disinfection byproduct dbp formation paa has attracted intensive interest in water treatment as an alternative to chlorine based disinfectants coyle et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 domínguez henao et al 2018 du et al 2018 paa has increasingly been used for wastewater and stormwater

developed with the generation of various reactive species of all the paa based aops uv paa is considered the most promising technology in terms of feasibility and applicability caretti and lubello 2003 beber de souza et al 2015 hassaballah et al 2019 as shown in eqs 1 7 the homolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond in paa and coexisting h2o2 can occur under uv photolysis with the formation of oh and ch3c o o which may further initiate the formation of secondary radicals such as ch3c o oo ch3 and ooch3 cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 among all reactive radicals oh and acetyl per oxyl radicals i e ch3c o o and ch3c o oo have been identified to play predominant roles in uv paa aop via experimental and modeling methods zhang and huang 2020 ao et al 2021b due to the synergistic effect of paa uv and reactive radicals uv paa has shown enhanced efficiency for disinfection and decontamination cai et al 2017 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the rapid degradation of typical pharmaceuticals e g carbamazepine diclofenac and ibuprofen under conditions of treatment with uv paa has been demonstrated to be dependent on the critical roles of oh ch3c o o and ch3c o oo cai et al 2017 a kinetic model has also been developed to predict the evolution of radical species and the corresponding degradation of micropollutants under uv paa zhang and huang 2020 in addition uv paa aop has been successfully applied in several pilot scale studies showing excellent disinfection efficiency and little dbps formation caretti and lubello 2003 hassaballah et al 2019 ao et al 2021a previous studies have suggested that uv paa technology has significant potential in engineering applications therefore it is necessary to comprehensively explore the reaction characteristics of the uv paa treatment 1 c h 3

oxidants and commonly produces adverse effects on treatment efficiency and water quality zhang et al 2021a meanwhile oxidation steps could significantly alter dom composition and characteristics such as aromaticity and molecular weight mw thereby having important implications for bioavailability ramseier et al 2011 contaminant mobility polubesova and chefetz 2014 subdiaga et al 2019 and reactivity with oxidants e g chlorine wenk et al 2013 bulman and remucal 2020 remucal et al 2020 fu et al 2022 notably the alteration of dom composition varies across different oxidation treatments and primarily depends on the reactions between dom and various types of reactive species ike et al 2019 remucal et al 2020 trainer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b 2021c previous study has reported that clo2 and hclo clo could both result in considerable decreases in electron donating capacities edcs and small aromaticity losses of dom conversely ozonation resulted in only slight edc decreases in addition to remarkable aromaticity reduction wenk et al 2013 the molecular transformation of effluent dom from wastewater discharge in typical uv based aops including uv h2o2 uv persulfate and uv chorine has also been investigated in which all processes could result in the generation of compounds with high o c values while the corresponding reactive moieties unique precursor products distribution aromaticity change and acute toxicity under these treatments showed distinct patterns due to different dominating reactive radicals ike et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b as mentioned the uv paa process also involves various reactive species i e oh ch3c o oo and ch3c o o and it has been commonly found that the presence of dom could inhibit the degradation of contaminants by competitively consuming these species chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020b ao et al 2021a accordingly it is expected that dom may reduce the lifetime of reactive species and limit the extent of disinfection and pollutants degradation under uv paa process meanwhile the dom composition and properties may also be altered and affect the quality of receiving waters however the detailed transformation of dom under uv paa as well as the selectivity of involved reactive radicals and mechanisms of reactivity with dom moieties remain unclear the present study aimed to unravel dom alterations and corresponding reaction mechanisms during uv paa oxidation particularly at the molecular level shanghai aladdin humic acid saha a widely used model humic substance in water treatments dong et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 was applied to discern the roles of various reactive radicals in dom transformation by uv paa specifically the optical parameters of saha during dose dependent treatments with paa uv paa uv paa tert butanol uv paa tba and uv h2o2 were measured fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was employed to analyze dom molecular transformation under different treatments the exclusively abated formed and common formulas under each treatment were identified and the precursor product pairs were recognized based on their specific mass differences to identify the decarboxylation and oxygenation reaction pathways to the best of our knowledge this study is among the first to comprehensively evaluate the changes in spectroscopic characteristics and composition of dom under uv paa treatment and elucidate the underlying reaction mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents paa stock solution 2 2 m paa 1 1 m h2o2 and 9 5 m acetic acid was prepared in the laboratory based on the reported method zhao et al 2007 supplementary material 1 text s1 the concentrations of paa and h2o2 were regularly determined using a titration method as described previously cai et al 2017 saha was obtained from aladdin shanghai china commercial supplier without further treatment further details on other materials are available in text s2 2 2 experimental setup uv irradiation experiments were conducted within a 150 ml cylindrical quartz reactor in a chamber equipped with a 6 w low pressure uv lamp 254 nm g6t5 hg lamp philips tuv6w and a running fan figure s1 the average uv fluence rate i0 was measured to be 6 78 mw cm 2 using the potassium ferrioxalate method harris et al 1987 and calculated to be 4 13 mw cm 2 in the reaction solution of 10 mg l 1 saha the average effective light path length l was determined to be 4 40 cm based on the effective area conversion figure s2 certain amounts of oxidants paa and h2o2 were spiked into the reaction solution containing 10 mg c l 1 of saha and buffered with phosphate 10 mm at ph 7 1 the information on reagent doses is listed in table s1 the uv lamp was preheated for 30 min and then the reactor was placed in the uv chamber to initiate the experiment to fully evaluate the alterations of dom caused by paa derived radicals the reaction solutions were exposed to uv irradiation for 3 h under which more than 89 of paa can be degraded and a sufficient reaction between reactive radicals and dom constituents was expected samples were then collected and quenched by excess sodium sulfite 10 folds of the oxidant concentration for spectroscopic analyses and further solid phase extraction for further exploring the contributions of individual factors related treatments including uv paa uv paa tba and uv h2o2 processes were also studied tba is a well known oh scavenger k tba oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and the addition of tba 10 fold of paa concentration in uv paa process can exclude the role of oh and reduce the concentrations of oh induced secondary radicals eqs 1 2 and 4 zhang and huang 2020 2 3 bulk measurements the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of saha working solution was obtained using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu tokyo japan as little doc loss of the single paa or tba solution under uv irradiation was observed the decreases in doc of the

were determined using a spectrophotometer aqualog kyoto japan eem data were corrected by background and inner filtering before being transformed into raman unit r u murphy et al 2013 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 indicates the dom aromaticity and was calculated by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm by the doc concentration of dom the slope ratio sr a proxy that is commonly inversely correlated with the dom mw was calculated as the ratio of the absorbance spectra slope at 275 295 nm s275 295 to that at 350 400 nm s350 400 e2 e3 is the absorbance ratio at 254 nm to that at 366 nm which is also an indicator of dom mw helms et al 2008 the biological index bix indicates the contribution of newly produced dom and was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence

icr ms is provided in supplementary material 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 bulk changes in dom characteristics after 3 h reaction at 0 60 mmol paa mmol doc a doc removal of 17 5 in uv paa treatment was observed and much higher than those in paa or uv alone 3 table s4 indicating the high radical yield under this treatment kim and huang 2021 zhang et al 2021b the decreased doc removal in uv h2o2 12 4 and uv paa tba 8 7 also supported the significant roles of reactive oxidative species i e oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo in the transformation of dom under uv paa treatment fig 1 and table s5 show the changes in spectroscopic properties of dom with increasing specific paa doses during all treatments the suva254 value of saha sample declined from 0 98 to 0 64 0 78 0 81 0 91 and 0 93 l mg c 1 m 1 after uv paa uv h2o2 uv paa tba uv and paa treatments at 0 60 mmol paa mmol doc respectively fig 1a this result suggests the decreasing aromaticity of dom in the studied treatments in addition as the parameters of sr and e2 e3 were inversely correlated with the electronic interactions between chromophores in larger dom molecules the increasing sr and e2 e3 values in figs 1b and 1c imply the decrease of dom apparent mw during all studied treatments for instance increases in sr from 0 78 to 1 11 and e2 e3 from 2 58 to 3 17 were found after uv paa treatment at 0 60 mmol paa mmol doc table s5 generally uv paa treatment led to the highest absolute alterations of aromaticity and dom mw among all treatments similar decreases in the aromaticity and mw of dom were commonly observed in other aops bulman and remucal 2020 remucal et al 2020 as the conjugated aromatic structures of dom could be partially destroyed by oxidative species with the generation of certain ring opening and lower mw products interestingly variations in bix values with increasing specific paa doses differed across treatments fig 1d moreover the humification degrees of dom samples by different treatments barely changed as little alteration was observed in hix values fig 1e similarly fi values remained stable in the range of 0 95 1 08 during all treatments fig 1f suggesting that the sources of studied dom samples are predominantly terrestrial and remained unchanged during all studied treatments zhang et al 2021d as expected only slight changes in dom spectroscopic parameters were observed by uv or paa alone table s5 accordingly the produced reactive radicals were the main contributors to the changes in dom characteristics in uv paa text s5 in agreement with previous studies reporting that oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo accounted for the rapid degradations of organic contaminants under uv paa cai et al 2017 zhang and huang 2020 ao et al 2021b 3 2 changes in fluorescent dom components here two fluorescent components c1 and c2 of dom samples were recognized from the parafac modeling figure s3 specifically c1 ex em maxima 260 440 nm is traditionally considered a terrestrial humic like component chen et al 2017 while c2 ex em maxima 260 530 nm is similar to sediment soil fulvic like fraction osburn and stedmon 2011 the changes in intensities of these two identified fluorescent components during different treatments were also studied specifically fig 2 and table s6 summarize the decreases in fluorescent components under different treatments the fluorescent intensity of the dom sample decreased with increasing specific paa doses under uv paa while paa alone hardly reacted with these two fluorescent components figs 2a and 2b the relative intensities of fluorescent components c1 and c2 were reduced by 41 7 and 54 2 at 0 60 mmol paa mmol doc in uv paa respectively table s6 unlike the limited contribution of uv alone treatment to doc removal and spectroscopic properties change uv alone read from specific paa dose of 0 in fig 2a decreased 31 0 of c1 and 21 8 of c2 respectively this result may be attributed to the fact that fluorescent components usually occupy a tiny fraction 5 of dom and are more vulnerable to irradiation than other constituents coble et al 2014 interestingly with the increasing paa dose in uv paa tba treatment more c2 component was removed from 8 6 to 15 2 but the intensity of c1 was nearly unchanged in contrast robust decreases in fluorescent components 65 8 of c1 and 79 8 of c2 were observed in oh dominated treatment of uv h2o2 fig 2d these results demonstrated that uv paa process could destroy fluorophores in dom in which oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo played important roles and exhibited different reaction selectivity text s5 3 3 changes in molecular composition of dom ft icr ms was further employed to evaluate the molecular composition of dom before and after the uv paa uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments at 0 60 mmol paa mmol doc at ph 7 1 it has been shown that uv or oxidants paa or h2o2 alone play limited roles in the oxidation of organics compared with the generated reactive species cai et al 2017 varanasi et al 2018 ike et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b table 1 summarizes the bulk molecular parameters abundance weighted averages and the relative abundances of cho chon chos and chons compounds which provides information on how dom changes when exposed to oxidative treatments specifically o cw and noscw increased after all treatments with the greatest increase observed in uv h2o2 similar increased o c ratios of dom by uv h2o2 aop has been widely reported using ft icr ms which indicated the increased degree of oxidation of dom and was attributed to oh additions and h abstractions from aromatic compounds xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b accordingly the oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo in uv paa may account for the increased o cw and noscw values by forming hydroxylated compounds in dom moreover the values of mww dbew and aimod w generally decreased after all treatments which were consistent with the results of changes in spectroscopy derived properties of dom these findings indicate a shift from more towards less aromatic formulas under uv paa process due to the continuous attacks of reactive species which ultimately leads to the destruction of aromatic rings and the formation of low mw products wenk et al 2013 remucal et al 2020 ao et al 2021a to further unravel the molecular level transformation of dom under uv paa the composition of dom after different treatments were characterized by van krevelen diagrams formulas that are present in both untreated and treated samples are denoted as common whereas those that are only present in the untreated sample i e not in the treated sample are termed abated while formulas that are only present in the treated samples i e not in the untreated sample are deemed formed there were 707 formulas abated in uv paa while 1374 formulas were newly formed fig 3a table s7 additionally a significant difference was also observed between the characteristics of abated and formed formulas during uv paa treatment specifically the abated formulas were clustered in the area with lower h c and o c and the corresponding h cw and o cw were 0 81 and 0 40 respectively table s7 in contrast the formed formulas occupied a wide range in h c and o c h cw 1 19 o cw 0 55 indicating the higher saturation and oxidation degree of formed formulas compared to the abated ones varanasi et al 2018 in addition the mww 416 86 da dbew 13 96 and aimod w 0 56 values of abated formulas in uv paa were much higher than those of formed formulas 335 21 da 7 10 and 0 28 respectively which also implies the loss of dom aromaticity unsaturation degree and molecular size the changes in relative intensity of the common formulas were also visualized by calculating the percentage change in relative intensity of a formula compared to that in the control sample bulman and remucal 2020 interestingly the common formulas that decreased in relative intensity were clustered in the low h c and o c region fig 3b in contrast the common formulas with increasing relative intensity were distributed in relatively high h c and o c region fig 3c this result confirmed that the reactive dom moieties in uv paa treatment are generally aromatic and less oxidized compounds which may undergo oxygen addition and or ring cleavage reactions cai et al 2017 zhang and huang 2020 thereby leading to the production of more oxidized saturated and lower mw compounds similar results were also observed in uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments figures s4 and s5 table s7 the decreases of dom mww dbew and aimod w values under these three treatments ranged 17 51 81 65 da 4 55 6 86 and 0 25 0 28 respectively the increases of h cw and o cw values ranged 0 19 0 38 and 0 14 0 29 respectively moreover as shown in table s7 and figure s6 the commonly abated and formed compounds in the three treatments uv paa uv paa tba and uv h2o2 followed the same trends it can thereby be concluded that oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo could all result in the significant loss of dom mw and aromaticity accompanied by an increase of dom saturation and oxidation degree however the differences between uv paa uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments also exist due to the corresponding variety of predominant reactive species among these treatments to further distinguish the different roles of oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo molecular dissimilarities of abated and formed formulas between uv paa tba ch3c o o ch3c o oo dominated and uv h2o2 oh dominated were analyzed by identifying the unique precursors and products in each system fig 4a and table s8 indicate that uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments shared more than 87 1 of abated formulas n 763 and there were 113 12 9 and 111 12 7 uniquely abated formulas for uv paa tba and uv h2o2 respectively in contrast less than 49 8 of formed formulas n 684 overlapped among these two treatments while the unique products rose to 376 35 5 and 690 50 2 for uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments respectively fig 4b these results suggested that ch3c o o ch3c o oo and oh may react with similar precursors but with high selectivity of product formation among all three treatments uv h2o2 is found with the highest number of formed formulas n 1374 table s7 this agrees with the lower selectivity and higher oxidative ability of oh than those of ch3c o o ch3c o oo thus the reaction of dom constituents with oh may yield more types of products than that with ch3c o o ch3c o oo gligorovski et al 2015 remucal et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b figs 4c and 4d present the molecular characteristics of exclusively abated and formed formulas in the two treatments respectively though ch3c o o ch3c o oo and oh shared most of the abated formulas the unique formulas abated by oh mainly featured o c of 0 2 0 3 o cw 0 26 and mw of 250 400 da mww 334 05 da while most of the exclusive precursors for ch3c o o ch3c o oo were observed with higher o c o cw 0 35 respectively and mw mww 357 13 da respectively values figure s7 table s8 this result suggests that compounds with a less oxidized extent and lower mw react more readily with oh than with ch3c o o ch3c o oo for formed products 92 9 of unique formulas from oh were located in o c 0 40 area while only 52 3 of the unique products from ch3c o o ch3c o oo were observed in the same space fig 4d table s8 in addition a few carbohydrate like compounds i e region of o c of 0 7 1 1 and h c of 1 5 2 4 were identified in the unique products from oh zhang et al 2021d which also implied the strong ability of oh to produce highly oxidized and saturated compounds overall these results demonstrated that dom moieties possess dissimilar reaction selectivity and undergo different pathways under the attack of various reactive species in uv paa system which are consistent with the changes in dom spectroscopic properties 3 4 reaction mechanism for different reactive radicals the mechanism of dom transformation in uv paa treatment was further investigated by identifying products compared to precursors from the results of uv paa tba ch3c o o ch3c o oo dominated and uv h2o2 oh dominated two typical oxidation pathways were tested oxygen addition 1o 2o 3o e g phenol to hydroquinone and decarboxylation co2 e g p hydroxybenzoic acid to phenol table s9 remucal et al 2020 trainer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b for each reaction pathway the formulas of predicted products from the untreated dom sample were searched in the unique products of reacted samples for example c7h6o3 is a verified formula in the untreated dom sample while c6h6o will be denoted as a co2 product if it can be searched in the exclusively formed formulas from the reacted samples predicted products based on the two tested oxidation pathways were searched and identified in samples after uv paa uv paa tba and uv h2o2 treatments fig 5 as expected the uv paa oxidation treatment newly produced 118 formulas corresponding to co2 as well as 213 formulas corresponding to oxygen addition 1o 2o 3o specifically there were 154 201 and 203 formulas denoted as 1o 2o and 3o respectively however they were highly overlapped figure s8 suggesting that a product could be attributable to multiple pathways e g c6h6o4 could result from c6h6o3 1o c6h6o2 2o and or c6h6o 3o kim et al 2019 remucal et al 2020 moreover most decarboxylation products were clustered in the area of o c 0 5 and h c 1 4 while the oxygenation products were mainly located in the region with higher o c and h c ratios this explains why the formed formulas from uv paa treatment were distributed in a vast space though the reaction pathways of co2 and o well described the transformation of dom under uv paa their related products only accounted for approximately one third of those identified other further oxidation reaction pathways such as dehydrogenation and dealkylation may have also occurred for example the oxygenation products may undergo further dehydrogenation reactions i e from hydroquinone to benzoquinone table s9 trainer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b and a total of 208 1o 2o 3o 2h products were recognized under uv paa figure s9 an apparent difference in the number of decarboxylation formulas between uv paa tba and uv h2o2 was observed figs 5b and 5c possibly suggesting the mechanistic differences between oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo there were 167 1o 2o 3o formulas and 96 co2 formulas 36 5 of the recognized formulas identified in uv paa tba whereas only 42 co2 formulas 16 were observed in uv h2o2 this can be attributed to the poor ability of oh to react with aromatic compounds via decarboxylation lee et al 2020 instead radical addition was more favorable in the oh dominated reaction with dom therefore oxygenation could occur in both oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo mediated reactions while decarboxylation was more common in ch3c o o ch3c o oo dominated treatment this is also supported by the result of co ii paa treatment figure s10 in which 167 1o 2o 3o formulas and 122 co2 formulas 42 2 were verified to be newly formed fig 6 presents the general reaction pathways for oxidation of aromatic substrates with oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo the aromatic substrate s usually reacts with oh via radical addition and forms a corresponding hydroxylated product s 1o lee et al 2020 in contrast ch3c o o ch3c o oo generally proceed via an electron transfer route to generate a radical cation s which then readily reacts with h2o and or oh to form the same oxygen addition product s 1o in addition s is also prone to release co2 when the structure of s contains a carboxyl group cooh kim et al 2020 lee et al 2020 the proposed reaction mechanism well explained the present results where more co2 products were found in the exclusive products from ch3c o o ch3c o oo than those from oh fig 5 therefore it was concluded that the decarboxylation pathway is more unique to ch3c o o ch3c o oo while oxygen addition is common to both oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo but via different routes i e radical addition and electron transfer respectively this is also supported by the products distribution results of dom transformation in so4 based aops in which electron transfer is the predominant reaction route and generates more decarboxylation products than conventional oh mediated aops lu et al 2016 chen et al 2020 accordingly ch3c o o ch3c o oo based aops and oh based aops can be well distinguished by identifying the decarboxylation products from aromatic carboxylic acids 4 conclusions and implications uv paa treatment significantly alters the characteristics and molecular composition of dom uv absorbance and fluorescence eem spectra measurements demonstrate the decreases in dom aromaticity apparent mw and fluorescence intensities the molecular level analysis by ft icr ms further reveals the elimination of compounds with low h c and o c values after uv paa treatment accompanied by the generation of lower mw as well as more oxidized and saturated products the results also confirm that the critical reactive species i e oh and ch3c o o ch3c o oo in uv paa all participate in the reaction with dom but with different reaction selectivity and mechanisms oh reacts with dom moieties non selectively while radical addition induced oxygenation is proposed to be the primary reaction pathway in comparison the ch3c o o ch3c o oo initiated oxidation of dom is predominantly via electron transfer to produce radical cations which react further by oxygenation and or decarboxylation the decarboxylation of aromatic carboxylic acids is more favorable in ch3c o o ch3c o oo based aop than that in oh based aop the composition and properties of oxidized dom have implications for following wastewater treatment processes as well as waters that receive treated effluent many of the dom compounds observed in uv paa are located in the same van krevelen region as compounds associated with bioavailable dom composition hammes et al 2006 2007 remucal et al 2020 this implies that uv paa aop can produce assimilable organic carbon e g aldehydes and carboxylic acids kim et al 2019 2020 ao et al 2021a the reduced aromaticity of dom during uv paa may also lead to lower formation potential of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids when exposed to chorine wang et al 2015 the results of ft icr ms provide critical information on the transformation of dom in uv paa aop particularly at the molecular level with mechanism elucidation it should be noted that the assigned elemental formulas by mass spectra may have different isomeric structures and it is thus challenging to accurately unravel corresponding reaction mechanisms future studies are also required to determine the bioavailability and oxidation reactivity e g photodegradation and or chlorine reactivity of treated dom to further understand the fate of dom in paa based aops additionally the type of dom e g natural and wastewater dom of various sources and experimental condition could be expanded in the future and it is also necessary to further test the transformation of dom by uv paa process under the impacts of other coexisting water constituents e g nitrate nitrite and halide ions declaration of competing

dissolved organic matter dom is a complex organic compound consisting of thousands of molecules of carbon c hydrogen h oxygen o nitrogen n and sulfur s representing one of the largest and most dynamic pools of organic carbon in the global carbon cycle with an estimated carbon stock of approximately 662 pg c hansell et al 2009 these compounds differ not only in concentration and structure but also originate from a variety of planktonic microbial and marine environments marine dom comes mainly from the primary production of phytoplankton in the surface waters of the ocean approximately 50 pg c yr 1 where it is rapidly recycled and used as an energy source for heterotrophic microorganisms carlson and hansell 2015 a portion of the dom is eventually transported to the ocean interior which holds most of the ocean s dissolved organic carbon pool microbial mineralization and photodegradation can lead to changes in the atomic number and arrangement of dom compounds in aquatic environments this type of dom is a highly modified component that remains after long time scales of exposure to sunlight and interaction with microorganisms tracing back to 2010 jiao et al introduced the concept of the microbial carbon pump mcp jiao et al 2010 the recalcitrant dom rdom hard to degrade part of the dom that has been buried deep sea for thousands of years through the action of microorganisms the origin and fate of rdom affects the global carbon cycle due to its large inventory and long term stability in the ocean even organic compounds from the same source and age may have undergone different processes before accumulating in the dom pool over 95 of marine dom is rdom with an average radiocarbon age of 5000 years and due to its complexity 90 of it remains uncharacterized carlson and hansell 2015 in addition to the marine environment dom also plays a pivotal role in the biogeochemical cycles of elements in other ecological environments e g atmosphere forests soils rivers and microorganisms therefore there is a strong need to understand the origin and composition of dom molecules which provides important theoretical and data support to elucidate their important role in the global ecosystem with the development of ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is coming to the forefront of scientists minds providing detailed dom molecular compositions with thousands of molecular formulas hertkorn et al 2013 this technique is now widely used in environmental science engineering e g freshwater marine and polar environments li et al 2019 ye et al 2021 he et al 2022 in addition dittmar et al 2008 established an efficient method for the concentration and desalination of dom from seawater which facilitates the characterization of dom by ft icr ms and provides methodological support for obtaining sample sources of dom in the ocean furthermore it provides a new perspective for resolving dom at the molecular and isomeric levels excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy is a prevalent approach for analyzing organic matter due to the vast quantity of three dimensional information and visual maps it provides castillo et al 2010 protein and humic like fluorophores have been found in previous studies and their peak locations in eem spectroscopy make it straightforward to distinguish between them coble 1996 coble et al 1998 to date eem fluorescence spectroscopy combined with farallel factor analysis eem parafac can extract and analyze information on a large portion of dom and is already widely used in aquatic ecosystems stedmon et al 2003 murphy et al 2018 the eastern indian ocean eio is the world s largest tropical nutrient poor marine domain and forms a major part of the world s largest warm pool it also has a range of unique environmental and natural ecosystems paulmier and ruiz pino 2009 the bay of bengal bob in the northeastern indian ocean is an important oceanic carbon sink area ittekkot et al 1991 and its regional environment open to the indian ocean in the south is influenced by both seasonally reversing coastal currents and seasonal coastal upwelling in this study we collected 12 water samples from four stations e87 22 e87 24 e87 28 and e87 30 in the eio during a cruise in spring april to may 2022 including surface 5 m deep

dom samples the dom samples were filtered through 0 22 μm pore size acid cleaned polycarbonate membranes millipore into precleaned brown glass vials these samples were then stored in a 20 c refrigerator under dark conditions until they were returned to the laboratory for eem parafac analysis notably to remove additional organic carbon interference all glass material needed to be washed with hydrochloric acid and ultrapure water and then cauterized in a muffle furnace at 400 c for 5 h in addition dom was extracted from 2 l of seawater samples using solid phase extraction spe with cartridges filled with a styrene divinyl benzene polymer bond elut ppl 200 mg 3 ml agilent america as described by dittmar et al 2008 the ppl cartridges were rinsed with three volumes of pure methanol liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms grade and acidified ultra pure water ph 2 then the dom seawater went through teflon tubes to the extraction column and cartridges via natural gravity 2 3

china we referenced a standard method for the specific parameter settings and operational procedure of the machine he et al 2020 the formula assignments were based on the following numbers of atoms c5

the double bond equivalents dbe were calculated by 2c h n p 2 2 for each formula hertkorn et al 2006 the molecular lability boundary mlb calculated by dividing the number of formulas with h c 1 5 with

nutrients fig 1b and table s1 show the vertical variation in hydrological parameters and nutrients from the four stations e87 22 e87 24 e87 28 and e87 30 in the eio the trend in temperature was consistent across the four stations with values ranging from 2 62 to 30 56 c dsi values did not differ much in the surface and dcm layers 0 60 5 10 μmol l 1 but there was a significant increase in the deeper layers and the values showed significant differences between stations with a maximum value 80 79 μmol l 1 at station e87 24 the values of dip ranged from 0 03 to 1 83 stations e87 22 and e87 24 showed a decreasing and then increasing trend and e87 28 and 87 30 showed a gradual increase generally with a maximum at depth the nh4 n had a minimum value 0 19 μmol l 1 in the surface layer of e87 28 and a maximum value 5 26 μmol l 1 in the deeper layer of station e87 24 and overall there was no clear pattern of variation in nh4 n similar to the data we reported previously liu et al 2021b the vertical distribution of no2 n showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with the minimum value 0 04 μmol l 1 occurring in the surface layer and the maximum value 0 40 μmol l 1 in the dcm layer with values ranging from 0 04 to 0 40 μmol l 1 there was a general trend of increasing values of no3 n with increasing depth ranging from 0 37 to 33 65 μmol l 1 with the maximum value occurring in the deeper layers of station e87 24 doc concentrations decreased steadily with increasing depth taking values in the range from 0 16 to 1 11 mg l 1 and previous studies have shown that on the vertical scale of seawater labile doc is gradually converted to recalcitrant doc stored in the deep sea through the transformation of microorganisms jiao et al 2010 chl a generally has a maximum in the dcm layer and the maximum occurs at station e87 30 this may be due to the e87 30 and its proximity to the bay of bengal high chlorophyll concentrations represent relatively high primary productivity suggesting that phytoplankton produce appreciable amounts of active dom molecules that are mostly not deeply degraded by microorganisms and therefore exhibit relatively active characteristics previous studies have shown that nutrients stimulate primary production and produce fresh dom which may have a positive or negative impact on the marine dom pool zarnetske et al 2011 marín spiotta et al 2014 3 2 molecular composition of dom via ft icr ms fig 2 shows the ft icr ms spectra of station e87 22 e87 24 e87 28 and e87 30 dom samples similar to other studies of seawater dom spectra sleighter et al 2012 medeiros et al 2015a where 3716 to 6986 dom molecules could be detected showing a gaussian distribution kujawinski et al 2009 roth et al 2014 several thousand peaks were detected in the mass range of 100 700 da the higher intensity molecules were mainly in the m z range of 350 450 da and the highest molecular intensities were close to 6 108 overall the specified formulations in all dom samples were divided into four categories based on the elements present carbon hydrogen oxygen cho carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen chno carbon hydrogen oxygen sulfur chos and carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen sulfur chnos fig s1 all dom samples were dominated by cho formulas with proportions ranging from 71 11 to 82 22 by intensity and the smallest and largest percentages occurred in the surface layer of station e87 24 and the deep layer of station e87 28 respectively fig 3a table 1 the chno and chos formulas ranged from 11 94 21 46 and 2 67 14 87 respectively the lowest percentage was for chnos with a range of 0 32 1 39 overall the order of the percentages of the intensity of molecules in the four categories was cho chno chos chnos these results suggest that the four categories account for different proportions of compounds in different water layers in the ocean it is noteworthy that previous publications have reported that the proportion of chos formulas in natural water dom is 5 20 the reason for this phenomenon is that chos compounds were formed by the addition of reduced sulfur anions to lignin cho compounds via kraft reactions sulfide cho chos melendez perez et al 2016 wang et al 2019 dissolved organic sulfur dos forms refractory dos reservoirs in the ocean further exhibiting high hydrogen and oxygen contents many s containing dom molecules contain high hydrogen to carbon and oxygen to carbon ratios and these compounds contribute to the accumulation of dos in the ocean there was a certain regular trend in the variation in the relevant parameters of dom molecules at the vertical scale of the ocean for the four stations fig 4 the maximum and minimum values of the total number of molecules were found in the dcm layers of stations e87 22 and e87 28 with values of 6986 and 3716 respectively and showed an overall trend of increasing and then decreasing from the surface to the bottom except for station e87 28 which decreased and then increased in the deep layer the total number of molecules is similar for the four stations in this study the values of hydrogen to carbon h c and oxygen to carbon o c ratios were taken in the ranges of 1 33 1 42 and 0 39 0 42 respectively generally the maximum values occurred in the surface layer and the minimum values occurred in the deep layer h c and o c as general indicators of the molecular composition of marine dom generally showed a gradual decrease with increasing water depth which was similar to the results in the mediterranean sea martínez pérez et al 2017a and north pacific ocean medeiros et al 2015a these results suggest that the ability of dom molecules to oxidize was diminished with increasing seawater depth and that hydrogen ion loss was also a process in addition h c could be used to indicate the stability of the dom d andrilli et al 2015 which becomes more recalcitrant with increasing depth due to a decrease in h c a result that is consistent with previous studies hansell 2013 this phenomenon is associated with the processing of dom by microorganisms since biodegradation has been shown to selectively remove compounds with high o c kim et al 2006 flerus et al 2012 in addition the high h c ratios of compounds enriched at the surface are also possibly associated with selective photodegradation of aromatic compounds chen et al 2014 the molecular instability boundary mlb represents the proportion of unstable compounds with higher values indicating a higher proportion of unstable compounds mlb had a maximum value 39 33 in the surface layer which occurred at station e87 24 and a minimum value 25 30 in the dcm layer at station e87 28 as the depth of seawater increases the mlb values gradually decrease indicating a decrease in the proportion of labile compounds and gradual transformation to recalcitrant compounds in the deeper layers this was further supported by the decreasing mlb suggesting that dom ages e g rdom from the surface to the deep water layer martínez pérez et al 2017b here the modified aromaticity index aimod was calculated according to the corrected version and has been widely used to estimate the aromaticity of om in aquatic environments koch and dittmar 2006 song et al 2018 we found a maximum value of aimod in the dcm layer at station e87 28 the maximum values at stations e87 22 e87 24 and e87 30 were all found in the deep layer at 22 47 23 26 and 24 01 respectively while the minimum values were found in the surface layer this indicates that the deeper layers of seawater are more dominated by molecules with higher aromaticity than the surface layers formulas were classified into polycyclic aromatic compounds aimod 0 67 aromatic compounds 0 5 aimod 0 67 highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds aimod 0 5 and h c 1 5 and aliphatic compounds aimod 0 5 and h c 1 5 fig 3b the bioavailability of these four classes of compounds increases with a gradual decrease in recalcitrance lechtenfeld et al 2015 medeiros et al 2015a considering the rough order of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds 66 93 83 30 aliphatic compounds 15 39 31 50 aromatic compounds 0 69 2 91 polycyclic aromatic compounds 0 14 0 60 by relative intensity fig 3b table s2 we found that highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds were mainly detected in the deep layer while aliphatic compounds were mainly distributed in the surface layer of seawater the proportion of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds was higher in the deeper layers than in the surface and dcm layers the small contribution of aromatic compounds enriched in the surface dom is possibly because similar to other dissolved aromatic compounds polycyclic aromatic aromatic compounds are highly photodegradable making the surface ocean a sink of thermogenic compounds dittmar and paeng 2009 stubbins et al 2012 the double bond equivalents dbe reflect the degree of unsaturation within dom molecules fig 4 clearly demonstrates the increasing dbe with increasing depth the lowest value 6 91 was found in the surface layer of station e87 24 while the highest value 7 93 occurred in the deeper layers indicating that the unsaturation of seawater dom increases with increasing depth in summary the aimod and dbe increased from the surface 5 m to the deep layer 2000 m indicating increasing aromaticity and unsaturation degree with depth in line with previous studies in the mariana trench and mediterranean sea martínez pérez et al 2017b li et al 2019 a higher dbe to c ratio dbe c and dbe to o ratio dbe o indicate a higher density of c c double bonds and a lower number of c o bonds dbe c and dbe o increased with increasing water depth at stations e87 22 e87 24 and e87 30 suggesting that there was a higher density of c c double bonds and a lower number of c o bonds in the deep layer interestingly station e87 28 had a trend that was different from the other three stations with a maximum in the dcm layer which might be related to the community composition of microorganisms furthermore during the repeated use of dissolved organic carbon by microorganisms dom is modified to contain more oxygen or heteroatoms and is highly cyclized to form compounds with higher molecular bonding energy i e the dom is gradually converted to rdom from another perspective the distribution of oceanic dom is influenced by the microbial and physical environment the surface layer of the ocean is the main source of dom and energy and with increasing depth the number of phytoplankton decreases sharply while heterotrophic microorganisms become dominant and heterotrophic microorganisms continuously degrade the doc input from the surface layer of the ocean in addition photodegradation by ultraviolet rays changes the structure of dom so that the dom composition in the deep ocean becomes similar to that of surface seawater and this reaction causes the transition from rdom to dom medeiros et al 2015a these results suggested that both phytoplankton derived dom inputs and photochemical reactions play important roles van krevelen vk diagrams demonstrate the similarity of dom molecules in different water layers fig s2 based on the h c and o c ratios dom molecules could be classified into different regions including lignin like 72 79 87 55 aliphatic peptide like 7 98 19 15 lipid like 2 94 6 90 carbohydrate like 0 07 0 92 tannin like 0 18 0 41 aromatic structure 0 04 0 19 and unsaturated hydrocarbon 0 01 0 03 fig s3 the accumulation of rdom appears to have occurred in deep oceanic waters an environment lacking attendant reactive oxygen species in this environment the most persistent molecules are those that are biodegradable with high h c or contain low o c aromatic molecules lignin like very few dom molecules are defined to be of aromatic structure which has a low h c ratio and a high o c ratio this unsaturated organic matter is resistant to microbial transformation rossel et al 2013 and is sequestered in seawater for thousands of years as a carbon sink notably in the surface layer of seawater many low o c aromatic molecules are readily converted to oxidized or biodegradable aliphatic molecules when exposed to light radiation in addition highly condensed compounds degrade when exposed to uv radiation at the surface of the ocean stubbins et al 2012 according to the hansell 2013 definition throughout the water column surface seawater contains both active and recalcitrant dom while the deep sea is occupied by rdom deep sea dom is upwelled into the photic zone by large scale circulation primeau 2005 and photochemical reactions transform the dom such that its composition becomes more similar to surface dom this is consistent with a study by helms et al 2013 who showed that the optical characteristics of extensively bleached dom collected in the north pacific at the thermocline level are comparable to those of surface waters indeed photochemical reactions of dom often lead to the enrichment of compounds with high h c ratios medeiros et al 2015b the influence of photochemical transformations seems to extend far beyond the photic zone likely due to horizontal transport of doc that has been previously exported from the surface layer to vertical mixing 3 3 the most persistent dom crams and ios carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules crams are considered to be rdom molecules in the ocean in this study crams represent a large proportion of dom molecules 74 57 1 29 with a maximum in the deeper layers 2000 m table 1 this suggests a clear contribution to the accumulation of rdom in the deeper layers of seawater however it must be noted that the elemental composition can represent a large variety of possible structural isomers hertkorn et al 2007 previous studies have shown that the structural variability represented by a single elemental formula in ft icr mass spectra is probably not as high as expected for natural organic matter witt et al 2009 research evidence has shown that the main driver of labile dom transformation is microbial activity lechtenfeld et al 2015 epiphytic bacteria are essential for the production and transformation of algae derived crams liu et al 2021a this further reflects an understanding of the detailed processes of rdom accumulation through mcp induced microbial activity ogawa et al 2001 jiao et al 2010 as a new addition to the rdom concept island of stability ios was proposed by lechtenfeld et al 2014 our data showed that the relative intensities of ios for all dom samples ranged from 3 99 to 11 22 and increased with increasing depth of seawater with a maximum present in the deeper layers of the ocean table 1 the percentage was much lower compared to the atlantic ocean lechtenfeld et al 2014 suggesting that the relative intensity of ios in seawater accumulates more in the deeper layers of the ocean and is also related to the different sea areas and marine microbes most of the organic carbon is turned into carbon dioxide due to microbial respiration part of it becomes microbial biomass and a small part is metabolized to the water column by microorganisms which further produces ios molecules through the repeated action of mcp ios molecules persisted in the ocean on geological time scales that were 1 5 times longer than the average residence time of doc lechtenfeld et al 2014 once a molecule enters the dom pool it is biologically or photochemically modified until it is either fully remineralized or ends up in the ios where it is subject to much slower degradation and has a low saturation and high oxygen content koch et al 2012 ios molecules contain elemental ratios h c and o c that overlap with crams fig 5 s4 hertkorn et al 2013 previous studies have shown that ios compounds have a higher carboxyl content along with a higher noncarboxyl unsaturated or cyclic structure lechtenfeld et al 2014 it has been suggested that a proportion of ios molecules without n elements are defined as cram molecules and furthermore ios molecules at higher mass centers 500 da are composed of c h and o only hertkorn et al 2006 although this definition ignores the large potential isomeric space of natural organic molecules a cyclic carbon backbone with few olefinic double bonds also applies to cram molecules hertkorn et al 2013 therefore these molecules which are similar to crams are a further recognition of the degradation continuum therefore how are these rdoms produced in natural seawater ogawa et al 2001 showed that marine bacteria continuously degrade active organic matter and produce recalcitrant organic matter a laboratory experiment demonstrated that microorganisms used active glucose and converted it into recalcitrant organic matter while it was found that the higher the substrate concentration was the higher the concentration of recalcitrant organic matter after incubation koch et al 2014 in addition environmental microbial communities can convert active dom to cram in a short period of time accounting for 30 of the final dom product lechtenfeld et al 2015 these findings all refer to the metabolic activities of microorganisms from which rdom in natural seawater originates thus the microbial dominated mcp theory explains the distribution of marine dom and rdom production the widespread presence of rdom in the ocean and the tendency of rdom molecules to accumulate in the deep sea environment further deepen the understanding of the carbon storage mechanism of the deep sea rdom pool 3 4 distribution of oxygen containing compounds the o1 o17 compound subgroups were detected in all dom samples fig 6 these subgroups were classified according to the number of oxygen atoms in the dom molecule for the cho compounds a normal distribution was shown most of the molecules are mainly distributed in o6 o9 and the number of molecules in this subgroup decreases with increasing depth notably o17 molecules were detected only in the dcm layer of station e87 22 we speculated that the occurrence of hyperoxic molecules is more likely to occur in the dcm layer which may be related to specific microbial species and activities carlson et al 2010 the chon compound exhibited a similar phenomenon to the cho compound however the subgroups o1 and o16 were missing and the number of molecules was less compared to the cho compounds chos compounds contained mainly the o4 o14 subgroup and were mostly detected in the surface and dcm layers however there was little presence of chos in the deeper layers which is due to methylation and hydrogenation and most of the chos in the sample would be lost the chnos compounds exhibited similar distribution characteristics to the other three compounds however it contained a number of low oxygen subgroup molecules mainly divided into the o3 o12 subgroup 3 5 spectroscopic indices and fluorescent components the spectroscopic indices fi β α bix and hix are presented in fig 7 a and table s3 fi values ranged from 2 09 to 3 20 mean s d 2 61 0 35 the β α values ranged from 0 85 to 1 27 with a mean value of 1 03 0 12 the bix range was 0 95 1 39 1 19 0 17 hix values ranged from 0 32 to 0 65 0 45 0 10 fi β α and bix had similar trends with values increasing first from surface to dcm and then decreasing to deep layers there was a significant correlation between the three indices p 0 05 it has been shown that an fi 1 8 suggests that the fluorescent component in dom is mainly produced by microorganisms lavonen et al 2015 in addition β α can indicate the proportion of dom production and decomposition and bix can be used as an indicator of dom traceability in aquatic ecosystems we found maximum values in the dcm layer for β α and bix suggesting that microbial activity plays a key role in the production of dom higher hix values represent higher molecular weight aromatic compounds huguet et al 2009 there was a gradual increase in hix values from the surface to the deeper layers this suggests that humic substances are more abundant in the deep layers of the ocean and are stored in the deep sea as the water mass ages yamashita and tanoue 2008 jørgensen et al 2014 which is consistent with the mcp jiao et al 2010 four fluorescent components were obtained by eem parafac including two protein like components tyrosine like ex em 225 305 nm c1 and tryptophan like ex em 225 275 340 nm c2 and two humic like components marine humic like ex em 250 425 nm c3 and terrestrial humic like ex em 270 425 nm c4 fig 7b the proportions of c1 and c2 protein like c3 and c4 humic like in all dom samples ranged from 18 32 to 35 73 16 88 to 30 22 17 28 to 39 55 and 15 13 to 25 25 respectively fig 7c however c1 and c2 were more represented in the surface and dcm layers of seawater and less represented in the deep layers while c3 and c4 showed the opposite trend fig 7d four components were significantly different in the deep layer from the surface and dcm layers in general in situ biological activity dominates dom production with a gradual shift from protein like to humic like components and storage to the deep sea previous studies have shown that the protein like components were highest in surface waters and decreased with depth in the northwestern north pacific ocean and the okhotsk sea yamashita et al 2010 humic like components increased with depth and were still detectable in the deeper layers 1000 m bottom but with little gradient change yamashita and tanoue 2008 2009 yamashita et al 2010 these components are difficult for microorganisms to transform further in a short time and are preserved in the deep sea for thousands of years yamashita and tanoue 2008 3 6 correlation analysis of hydrological molecular and fluorescent parameters overall most hydrological parameters molecular parameters and fluorescent parameters were significantly positively or negatively correlated by pearson s correlation analysis fig 8 we found that depth was extremely significantly positively correlated with dip no3 n dsi ios and hix p 0 001 very significantly positively correlated with dbe crams c3 and c4 p 0 01 and only significantly positively correlated with lignin like p 0 05 in contrast depth was extremely significantly negatively correlated with temperature doc c2 and bix p 0 001 very significantly negatively correlated with β α p 0 01 and significantly negatively correlated with chl a mlb and aliphatic peptide like content p 0 05 these results suggest that most physical chemical and biological parameters vary with depth over the vertical distribution of the ocean the values of temperature doc c2 bix β α chl a mlb and aliphatic peptide like progressively decrease with increasing seawater depth furthermore certain nutrients dip dsi and no3 n and rdom components crams ios lignin like hix c3 and c4 were more likely to accumulate in the deeper layers of the ocean water column stratification is a major cause of vertical variation in nutrient salts atmospheric transport and physical deposition result in a portion of nutrients being stored in deeper layers this part of nutrients cannot reach the upper layer of seawater and microorganisms in the upper layer cannot go down to the deeper layer to consume nutrients from another point of view nutrients are used and consumed by microorganisms to synthesize their own energy in which phytoplankton play a very important role e g diatoms are the main organisms responsible for the low dsi content in the surface ocean nelson et al 1995 struyf et al 2009 in turn some of the nutrients that are difficult to use are physically deposited at ocean depths this ultimately causes a large concentration of nutrients to accumulate in the deeper layers the lowest levels of both humic like components c3 and c4 in the surface layer may have resulted from the degradation of humic like fluorophores in the photic zone it is well known that while humic like fluorescence intensity remarkably decreases during photoirradiation mopper et al 1991 nieto cid et al 2006 it tends to increase during microbial degradation of organic matter to ocean depths yamashita and tanoue 2004 nieto cid et al 2006 previous studies have demonstrated that fresh and highly reactive dom is rapidly consumed by prokaryotes and partially converted to low reactivity dom which ages in the thermohaline circulation and eventually sinks to the deeper layers of the ocean carlson and ducklow 1996 ogawa et al 2001 ogawa and tanoue 2003 in general mcp provides a conceptual framework for a better understanding of the role of microbial processes in the generation of rdom and carbon storage in the ocean jiao et al 2010 4 conclusions in the present study thousands of molecules were detected and showed a gaussian distribution by ft icr ms in spe dom samples from the eio the molecules in seawater dom are dominated by carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and sulfur atoms in addition the composition of dom molecules in the surface dcm and deep layers of the eio were highly different crams ios and humic like substances were considered to be the refractory substances of rdom in the ocean with a high proportion in seawater dom especially in the deep layer in other words as the depth of seawater increases seawater becomes progressively older and more difficult to degrade and recalcitrant substances accumulate in the deep sea specifically due to the stratification of seawater there are differences in the composition and chemical properties of dom across the vertical gradient of the ocean microorganisms and photodegradation play an important role in this process this will certainly provide important scientific indications for future studies of microorganisms in the chemical elemental cycle of the ocean meanwhile this study provides some data support to study the composition and distribution of dom molecules in oligotrophic seas due to the limited number of sampling stations and samples in this work

15038,oceans cover approximately 71 of the earth s surface area which is why some people refer to the earth as a large water sphere marine dissolved organic matter dom constitutes the main carbon pool for biogeochemical cycles and plays an important role in global carbon dynamics here the molecular composition and component characteristics of surface 5 m deep chlorophyll maximum dcm and deep 2000 m layer dom in the eastern indian ocean eio were investigated using fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy thousands of individual dom formulas approximately 3716 6986 formulas were detected at 100 700 da showing a gaussian distribution the elements carbon c hydrogen h oxygen o nitrogen n and sulfur s were detected and constituted four formula classes in solid phase extracted marine dom samples furthermore the order of the percent intensity of the formulas was cho chno chos chnos carboxylic rich alicyclic molecule cram compounds as part of recalcitrant dom rdom were detected at 61 32 78 77 by intensity in addition the concept of islands of stability ios approximately 3 99 11 22 has been proposed in this study representing the most stable components in the marine environment such molecular formulas as described above probably contribute to increased rdom content in the eio and potentially reflect enhanced accumulation or sequestration of rdom in the deep layer the variation in the spectroscopic indices fi β α bix and hix and fluorescent components c1 to c4 with depth indicates a shift from protein like to humic like components leading to gradual aging of the water column in brief this study relies on data from marine dom in the eio to provide a molecular and chemical background for global models of marine dom production transformation and sequestration graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter dom fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules crams recalcitrant dom rdom spectroscopic indices fluorescent components data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction marine dissolved organic matter dom is a complex organic compound consisting of thousands of molecules of carbon c hydrogen h oxygen o nitrogen n and sulfur s representing one of the largest and most dynamic pools of organic carbon in the global carbon cycle with an estimated carbon stock of approximately 662 pg c hansell et al 2009 these compounds differ not only in concentration and structure but also originate from a variety of planktonic microbial and marine environments marine dom comes mainly from the primary production of phytoplankton in the surface waters of the ocean approximately 50 pg c yr 1 where it is rapidly recycled and used as an energy source for heterotrophic microorganisms carlson and hansell 2015 a portion of the dom is eventually transported to the ocean interior which holds most of the ocean s dissolved organic carbon pool microbial mineralization and photodegradation can lead to changes in the atomic number and arrangement of dom compounds in aquatic environments this type of dom is a highly modified component that remains after long time scales of exposure to sunlight and interaction with microorganisms tracing back to 2010 jiao et al introduced the concept of the microbial carbon pump mcp jiao et al 2010 the recalcitrant dom rdom hard to degrade part of the dom that has been buried deep sea for thousands of years through the action of microorganisms the origin and fate of rdom affects the global carbon cycle due to its large inventory and long term stability in the ocean even organic compounds from the same source and age may have undergone different processes before accumulating in the dom pool over 95 of marine dom is rdom with an average radiocarbon age of 5000 years and due to its complexity 90 of it remains uncharacterized carlson and hansell 2015 in addition to the marine environment dom also plays a pivotal role in the biogeochemical cycles of elements in other ecological environments e g atmosphere forests soils rivers and microorganisms therefore there is a strong need to understand the origin and composition of dom molecules which provides important theoretical and data support to elucidate their important role in the global ecosystem with the development of ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is coming to the forefront of scientists minds providing detailed dom molecular compositions with thousands of molecular formulas hertkorn et al 2013 this technique is now widely used in environmental science engineering e g freshwater marine and polar environments li et al 2019 ye et al 2021 he et al 2022 in addition dittmar et al 2008 established an efficient method for the concentration and desalination of dom from seawater which facilitates the characterization of dom by ft icr ms and provides methodological support for obtaining sample sources of dom in the ocean furthermore it provides a new perspective for resolving dom at the molecular and isomeric levels excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy is a prevalent approach for analyzing organic matter due to the vast quantity of three dimensional information and visual maps it provides castillo et al 2010 protein and humic like fluorophores have been found in previous studies and their peak locations in eem spectroscopy make it straightforward to distinguish between them coble 1996 coble et al 1998 to date eem fluorescence spectroscopy combined with farallel factor analysis eem parafac can extract and analyze information on a large portion of dom and is already widely used in aquatic ecosystems stedmon et al 2003 murphy et al 2018 the eastern indian ocean eio is the world s largest tropical nutrient poor marine domain and forms a major part of the world s largest warm pool it also has a range of unique environmental and natural ecosystems paulmier and ruiz pino 2009 the bay of bengal bob in the northeastern indian ocean is an important oceanic carbon sink area ittekkot et al 1991 and its regional environment open to the indian ocean in the south is influenced by both seasonally reversing coastal currents and seasonal coastal upwelling in this study we collected 12 water samples from four stations e87 22 e87 24 e87 28 and e87 30 in the eio during a cruise in spring april to may 2022 including surface 5 m deep chlorophyll maximum dcm 69 72 76 m and deep 2000 m layers with the aim of studying the molecular and compositional composition of the open ocean dom by ft icr ms and eem parafac techniques this work will contribute to a better understanding of the vertical distribution characteristics of dom and its impact on the ocean carbon cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection stations e87 22 e87

and salinity were measured via ctd sensors seawater samples were typically collected from three depths including surface 5 m dcm 69 72 76 m and deep 2000 m layers 2 2 collection and pretreatment of dom samples the dom samples were filtered through 0 22 μm pore size acid cleaned polycarbonate membranes millipore into precleaned brown glass vials these samples were then stored in a 20 c refrigerator under dark conditions until they were returned to the laboratory for eem parafac analysis notably to remove additional organic carbon interference all glass material needed to be washed with hydrochloric acid and ultrapure water and then cauterized in a muffle furnace at 400 c for 5 h in addition dom was extracted from 2 l of seawater samples using solid phase extraction spe with cartridges filled with a styrene divinyl benzene polymer bond elut ppl 200 mg 3 ml agilent america as described by dittmar et al 2008 the ppl cartridges were rinsed with three volumes of pure methanol liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms grade and acidified ultra pure water ph 2 then the dom seawater went through teflon tubes to the extraction column and cartridges via natural gravity 2 3

nutrients fig 1b and table s1 show the vertical variation in hydrological parameters and nutrients from the four stations e87 22 e87 24 e87 28 and e87 30 in the eio the trend in temperature was consistent across the four stations with values ranging from 2 62 to 30 56 c dsi values did not differ much in the surface and dcm layers 0 60 5 10 μmol l 1 but there was a significant increase in the deeper layers and the values showed significant differences between stations with a maximum value 80 79 μmol l 1 at station e87 24 the values of dip ranged from 0 03 to 1 83 stations e87 22 and e87 24 showed a decreasing and then increasing trend and e87 28 and 87 30 showed a gradual increase generally with a maximum at depth the nh4 n had a minimum value 0 19 μmol l 1 in the surface layer of e87 28 and a maximum value 5 26 μmol l 1 in the deeper layer of station e87 24 and overall there was no clear pattern of variation in nh4 n similar to the data we reported previously liu et al 2021b the vertical distribution of no2 n showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with the minimum value 0 04 μmol l 1 occurring in the surface layer and the maximum value 0 40 μmol l 1 in the dcm layer with values ranging from 0 04 to 0 40 μmol l 1 there was a general trend of increasing values of no3 n with increasing depth ranging from 0 37 to 33 65 μmol l 1 with the maximum value occurring in the deeper layers of station e87 24 doc concentrations decreased steadily with increasing depth taking values in the range from 0 16 to 1 11 mg l 1 and previous studies have shown that on the vertical scale of seawater labile doc is gradually converted to recalcitrant doc stored in the deep sea through the transformation of microorganisms jiao et al 2010 chl a generally has a maximum in the dcm layer and the maximum occurs at station e87 30 this may be due to the e87 30 and its proximity to the bay of bengal high chlorophyll concentrations represent relatively high primary productivity suggesting that phytoplankton produce appreciable amounts of active dom molecules that are mostly not deeply degraded by microorganisms and therefore exhibit relatively active characteristics previous studies have shown that nutrients stimulate primary production and produce fresh dom which may have a positive or negative impact on the marine dom pool zarnetske et al 2011 marín spiotta et al 2014 3 2 molecular composition of dom via ft icr ms fig 2 shows the ft icr ms spectra of station e87 22 e87 24 e87 28 and e87 30 dom samples similar to other studies of seawater dom spectra sleighter et al 2012 medeiros et al 2015a where 3716 to 6986 dom molecules could be detected showing a gaussian distribution kujawinski et al 2009 roth et al 2014 several thousand peaks were detected in the mass range of 100 700 da the higher intensity molecules were mainly in the m z range of 350 450 da and the highest molecular intensities were close to 6 108 overall the specified formulations in all dom samples were divided into four categories based on the elements present carbon hydrogen oxygen cho carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen chno carbon hydrogen oxygen sulfur chos and carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen sulfur chnos fig s1 all dom samples were dominated by cho formulas with proportions ranging from 71 11 to 82 22 by intensity and the smallest and largest percentages occurred in the surface layer of station e87 24 and the deep layer of station e87 28 respectively fig 3a table 1 the chno and chos formulas ranged from 11 94 21 46 and 2 67 14 87 respectively the lowest percentage was for chnos with a range of 0 32 1 39 overall the order of the percentages of the intensity of molecules in the four categories was cho chno chos chnos these results suggest that the four categories account for different proportions of compounds in different water layers in the ocean it is noteworthy that previous publications have reported that the proportion of chos formulas in natural water dom is 5 20 the reason for this phenomenon is that chos compounds were formed by the addition of reduced sulfur anions to lignin cho compounds via kraft reactions sulfide cho chos melendez perez et al 2016 wang et al 2019 dissolved organic sulfur dos forms refractory dos reservoirs in the ocean further exhibiting high hydrogen and oxygen contents many s containing dom molecules contain high hydrogen to carbon and oxygen to carbon ratios and these compounds contribute to the accumulation of dos in the ocean there was a certain regular trend in the variation in the relevant parameters of dom molecules at the vertical scale of the ocean for the four stations fig 4 the maximum and minimum values of the total number of molecules were found in the dcm layers of stations e87 22 and e87 28 with values of 6986 and 3716 respectively and showed an overall trend of increasing and then decreasing from the surface to the bottom except for station e87 28 which decreased and then increased in the deep layer the total number of molecules is similar for the four stations in this study the values of hydrogen to carbon h c and oxygen to carbon o c ratios were taken in the ranges of 1 33 1 42 and 0 39 0 42 respectively generally the maximum values occurred in the surface layer and the minimum values occurred in the deep layer h c and o c as general indicators of the molecular composition of marine dom generally showed a gradual decrease with increasing water depth which was similar to the results in the mediterranean sea martínez pérez et al 2017a and north pacific ocean medeiros et al 2015a these results suggest that the ability of dom molecules to oxidize was diminished with increasing seawater depth and that hydrogen ion loss was also a process in addition h c could be used to indicate the stability of the dom d andrilli et al 2015 which becomes more recalcitrant with increasing depth due to a decrease in h c a result that is consistent with previous studies hansell 2013 this phenomenon is associated with the processing of dom by microorganisms since biodegradation has been shown to selectively remove compounds with high o c kim et al 2006 flerus et al 2012 in addition the high h c ratios of compounds enriched at the surface are also possibly associated with selective photodegradation of aromatic compounds chen et al 2014 the molecular instability boundary mlb represents the proportion of unstable compounds with higher values indicating a higher proportion of unstable compounds mlb had a maximum value 39 33 in the surface layer which occurred at station e87 24 and a minimum value 25 30 in the dcm layer at station e87 28 as the depth of seawater increases the mlb values gradually decrease indicating a decrease in the proportion of labile compounds and gradual transformation to recalcitrant compounds in the deeper layers this was further supported by the decreasing mlb suggesting that dom ages e g rdom from the surface to the deep water layer martínez pérez et al 2017b here the modified aromaticity index aimod was calculated according to the corrected version and has been widely used to estimate the aromaticity of om in aquatic environments koch and dittmar 2006 song et al 2018 we found a maximum value of aimod in the dcm layer at station e87 28 the maximum values at stations e87 22 e87 24 and e87 30 were all found in the deep layer at 22 47 23 26 and 24 01 respectively while the minimum values were found in the surface layer this indicates that the deeper layers of seawater are more dominated by molecules with higher aromaticity than the surface layers formulas were classified into polycyclic aromatic compounds aimod 0 67 aromatic compounds 0 5 aimod 0 67 highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds aimod 0 5 and h c 1 5 and aliphatic compounds aimod 0 5 and h c 1 5 fig 3b the bioavailability of these four classes of compounds increases with a gradual decrease in recalcitrance lechtenfeld et al 2015 medeiros et al 2015a considering the rough order of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds 66 93 83 30 aliphatic compounds 15 39 31 50 aromatic compounds 0 69 2 91 polycyclic aromatic compounds 0 14 0 60 by relative intensity fig 3b table s2 we found that highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds were mainly detected in the deep layer while aliphatic compounds were mainly distributed in the surface layer of seawater the proportion of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds was higher in the deeper layers than in the surface and dcm layers the small contribution of aromatic compounds enriched in the surface dom is possibly because similar to other dissolved aromatic compounds polycyclic aromatic aromatic compounds are highly photodegradable making the surface ocean a sink of thermogenic compounds dittmar and paeng 2009 stubbins et al 2012 the double bond equivalents dbe reflect the degree of unsaturation within dom molecules fig 4 clearly demonstrates the increasing dbe with increasing depth the lowest value 6 91 was found in the surface layer of station e87 24 while the highest value 7 93 occurred in the deeper layers indicating that the unsaturation of seawater dom increases with increasing depth in summary the aimod and dbe increased from the surface 5 m to the deep layer 2000 m indicating increasing aromaticity and unsaturation degree with depth in line with previous studies in the mariana trench and mediterranean sea martínez pérez et al 2017b li et al 2019 a higher dbe to c ratio dbe c and dbe to o ratio dbe o indicate a higher density of c c double bonds and a lower number of c o bonds dbe c and dbe o increased with increasing water depth at stations e87 22 e87 24 and e87 30 suggesting that there was a higher density of c c double bonds and a lower number of c o bonds in the deep layer interestingly station e87 28 had a trend that was different from the other three stations with a maximum in the dcm layer which might be related to the community composition of microorganisms furthermore during the repeated use of dissolved organic carbon by microorganisms dom is modified to contain more oxygen or heteroatoms and is highly cyclized to form compounds with higher molecular bonding energy i e the dom is gradually converted to rdom from another perspective the distribution of oceanic dom is influenced by the microbial and physical environment the surface layer of the ocean is the main source of dom and energy and with increasing depth the number of phytoplankton decreases sharply while heterotrophic microorganisms become dominant and heterotrophic microorganisms continuously degrade the doc input from the surface layer of the ocean in addition photodegradation by ultraviolet rays changes the structure of dom so that the dom composition in the deep ocean becomes similar to that of surface seawater and this reaction causes the transition from rdom to dom medeiros et al 2015a these results suggested that both phytoplankton derived dom inputs and photochemical reactions play important roles van krevelen vk diagrams demonstrate the similarity of dom molecules in different water layers fig s2 based on the h c and o c ratios dom molecules could be classified into different regions including lignin like 72 79 87 55 aliphatic peptide like 7 98 19 15 lipid like 2 94 6 90 carbohydrate like 0 07 0 92 tannin like 0 18 0 41 aromatic structure 0 04 0 19 and unsaturated hydrocarbon 0 01 0 03 fig s3 the accumulation of rdom appears to have occurred in deep oceanic waters an environment lacking attendant reactive oxygen species in this environment the most persistent molecules are those that are biodegradable with high h c or contain low o c aromatic molecules lignin like very few dom molecules are defined to be of aromatic structure which has a low h c ratio and a high o c ratio this unsaturated organic matter is resistant to microbial transformation rossel et al 2013 and is sequestered in seawater for thousands of years as a carbon sink notably in the surface layer of seawater many low o c aromatic molecules are readily converted to oxidized or biodegradable aliphatic molecules when exposed to light radiation in addition highly condensed compounds degrade when exposed to uv radiation at the surface of the ocean stubbins et al 2012 according to the hansell 2013 definition throughout the water column surface seawater contains both active and recalcitrant dom while the deep sea is occupied by rdom deep sea dom is upwelled into the photic zone by large scale circulation primeau 2005 and photochemical reactions transform the dom such that its composition becomes more similar to surface dom this is consistent with a study by helms et al 2013 who showed that the optical characteristics of extensively bleached dom collected in the north pacific at the thermocline level are comparable to those of surface waters indeed photochemical reactions of dom often lead to the enrichment of compounds with high h c ratios medeiros et al 2015b the influence of photochemical transformations seems to extend far beyond the photic zone likely due to horizontal transport of doc that has been previously exported from the surface layer to vertical mixing 3 3 the most persistent dom crams and ios carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules crams are considered to be rdom molecules in the ocean in this study crams represent a large proportion of dom molecules 74 57 1 29 with a maximum in the deeper layers 2000 m table 1 this suggests a clear contribution to the accumulation of rdom in the deeper layers of seawater however it must be noted that the elemental composition can represent a large variety of possible structural isomers hertkorn et al 2007 previous studies have shown that the structural variability represented by a single elemental formula in ft icr mass spectra is probably not as high as expected for natural organic matter witt et al 2009 research evidence has shown that the main driver of labile dom transformation is microbial activity lechtenfeld et al 2015 epiphytic bacteria are essential for the production and transformation of algae derived crams liu et al 2021a this further reflects an understanding of the detailed processes of rdom accumulation through mcp induced microbial activity ogawa et al 2001 jiao et al 2010 as a new addition to the rdom concept island of stability ios was proposed by lechtenfeld et al 2014 our data showed that the relative intensities of ios for all dom samples ranged from 3 99 to 11 22 and increased with increasing depth of seawater with a maximum present in the deeper layers of the ocean table 1 the percentage was much lower compared to the atlantic ocean lechtenfeld et al 2014 suggesting that the relative intensity of ios in seawater accumulates more in the deeper layers of the ocean and is also related to the different sea areas and marine microbes most of the organic carbon is turned into carbon dioxide due to microbial respiration part of it becomes microbial biomass and a small part is metabolized to the water column by microorganisms which further produces ios molecules through the repeated action of mcp ios molecules persisted in the ocean on geological time scales that were 1 5 times longer than the average residence time of doc lechtenfeld et al 2014 once a molecule enters the dom pool it is biologically or photochemically modified until it is either fully remineralized or ends up in the ios where it is subject to much slower degradation and has a low saturation and high oxygen content koch et al 2012 ios molecules contain elemental ratios h c and o c that overlap with crams fig 5 s4 hertkorn et al 2013 previous studies have shown that ios compounds have a higher carboxyl content along with a higher noncarboxyl unsaturated or cyclic structure lechtenfeld et al 2014 it has been suggested that a proportion of ios molecules without n elements are defined as cram molecules and furthermore ios molecules at higher mass centers 500 da are composed of c h and o only hertkorn et al 2006 although this definition ignores the large potential isomeric space of natural organic molecules a cyclic carbon backbone with few olefinic double bonds also applies to cram molecules hertkorn et al 2013 therefore these molecules which are similar to crams are a further recognition of the degradation continuum therefore how are these rdoms produced in natural seawater ogawa et al 2001 showed that marine bacteria continuously degrade active organic matter and produce recalcitrant organic matter a laboratory experiment demonstrated that microorganisms used active glucose and converted it into recalcitrant organic matter while it was found that the higher the substrate concentration was the higher the concentration of recalcitrant organic matter after incubation koch et al 2014 in addition environmental microbial communities can convert active dom to cram in a short period of time accounting for 30 of the final dom product lechtenfeld et al 2015 these findings all refer to the metabolic activities of microorganisms from which rdom in natural seawater originates thus the microbial dominated mcp theory explains the distribution of marine dom and rdom production the widespread presence of rdom in the ocean and the tendency of rdom molecules to accumulate in the deep sea environment further deepen the understanding of the carbon storage mechanism of the deep sea rdom pool 3 4 distribution of oxygen containing compounds the o1 o17 compound subgroups were detected in all dom samples fig 6 these subgroups were classified according to the number of oxygen atoms in the dom molecule for the cho compounds a normal distribution was shown most of the molecules are mainly distributed in o6 o9 and the number of molecules in this subgroup decreases with increasing depth notably o17 molecules were detected only in the dcm layer of station e87 22 we speculated that the occurrence of hyperoxic molecules is more likely to occur in the dcm layer which may be related to specific microbial species and activities carlson et al 2010 the chon compound exhibited a similar phenomenon to the cho compound however the subgroups o1 and o16 were missing and the number of molecules was less compared to the cho compounds chos compounds contained mainly the o4 o14 subgroup and were mostly detected in the surface and dcm layers however there was little presence of chos in the deeper layers which is due to methylation and hydrogenation and most of the chos in the sample would be lost the chnos compounds exhibited similar distribution characteristics to the other three compounds however it contained a number of low oxygen subgroup molecules mainly divided into the o3 o12 subgroup 3 5 spectroscopic indices and fluorescent components the spectroscopic indices fi β α bix and hix are presented in fig 7 a and table s3 fi values ranged from 2 09 to 3 20 mean s d 2 61 0 35 the β α values ranged from 0 85 to 1 27 with a mean value of 1 03 0 12 the bix range was 0 95 1 39 1 19 0 17 hix values ranged from 0 32 to 0 65 0 45 0 10 fi β α and bix had similar trends with values increasing first from surface to dcm and then decreasing to deep layers there was a significant correlation between the three indices p 0 05 it has been shown that an fi 1 8 suggests that the fluorescent component in dom is mainly produced by microorganisms lavonen et al 2015 in addition β α can indicate the proportion of dom production and decomposition and bix can be used as an indicator of dom traceability in aquatic ecosystems we found maximum values in the dcm layer for β α and bix suggesting that microbial activity plays a key role in the production of dom higher hix values represent higher molecular weight aromatic compounds huguet et al 2009 there was a gradual increase in hix values from the surface to the deeper layers this suggests that humic substances are more abundant in the deep layers of the ocean and are stored in the deep sea as the water mass ages yamashita and tanoue 2008 jørgensen et al 2014 which is consistent with the mcp jiao et al 2010 four fluorescent components were obtained by eem parafac including two protein like components tyrosine like ex em 225 305 nm c1 and tryptophan like ex em 225 275 340 nm c2 and two humic like components marine humic like ex em 250 425 nm c3 and terrestrial humic like ex em 270 425 nm c4 fig 7b the proportions of c1 and c2 protein like c3 and c4 humic like in all dom samples ranged from 18 32 to 35 73 16 88 to 30 22 17 28 to 39 55 and 15 13 to 25 25 respectively fig 7c however c1 and c2 were more represented in the surface and dcm layers of seawater and less represented in the deep layers while c3 and c4 showed the opposite trend fig 7d four components were significantly different in the deep layer from the surface and dcm layers in general in situ biological activity dominates dom production with a gradual shift from protein like to humic like components and storage to the deep sea previous studies have shown that the protein like components were highest in surface waters and decreased with depth in the northwestern north pacific ocean and the okhotsk sea yamashita et al 2010 humic like components increased with depth and were still detectable in the deeper layers 1000 m bottom but with little gradient change yamashita and tanoue 2008 2009 yamashita et al 2010 these components are difficult for microorganisms to transform further in a short time and are preserved in the deep sea for thousands of years yamashita and tanoue 2008 3 6 correlation analysis of hydrological molecular and fluorescent parameters overall most hydrological parameters molecular parameters and fluorescent parameters were significantly positively or negatively correlated by pearson s correlation analysis fig 8 we found that depth was extremely significantly positively correlated with dip no3 n dsi ios and hix p 0 001 very significantly positively correlated with dbe crams c3 and c4 p 0 01 and only significantly positively correlated with lignin like p 0 05 in contrast depth was extremely significantly negatively correlated with temperature doc c2 and bix p 0 001 very significantly negatively correlated with β α p 0 01 and significantly negatively correlated with chl a mlb and aliphatic peptide like content p 0 05 these results suggest that most physical chemical and biological parameters vary with depth over the vertical distribution of the ocean the values of temperature doc c2 bix β α chl a mlb and aliphatic peptide like progressively decrease with increasing seawater depth furthermore certain nutrients dip dsi and no3 n and rdom components crams ios lignin like hix c3 and c4 were more likely to accumulate in the deeper layers of the ocean water column stratification is a major cause of vertical variation in nutrient salts atmospheric transport and physical deposition result in a portion of nutrients being stored in deeper layers this part of nutrients cannot reach the upper layer of seawater and microorganisms in the upper layer cannot go down to the deeper layer to consume nutrients from another point of view nutrients are used and consumed by microorganisms to synthesize their own energy in which phytoplankton play a very important role e g diatoms are the main organisms responsible for the low dsi content in the surface ocean nelson et al 1995 struyf et al 2009 in turn some of the nutrients that are difficult to use are physically deposited at ocean depths this ultimately causes a large concentration of nutrients to accumulate in the deeper layers the lowest levels of both humic like components c3 and c4 in the surface layer may have resulted from the degradation of humic like fluorophores in the photic zone it is well known that while humic like fluorescence intensity remarkably decreases during photoirradiation mopper et al 1991 nieto cid et al 2006 it tends to increase during microbial degradation of organic matter to ocean depths yamashita and tanoue 2004 nieto cid et al 2006 previous studies have demonstrated that fresh and highly reactive dom is rapidly consumed by prokaryotes and partially converted to low reactivity dom which ages in the thermohaline circulation and eventually sinks to the deeper layers of the ocean carlson and ducklow 1996 ogawa et al 2001 ogawa and tanoue 2003 in general mcp provides a conceptual framework for a better understanding of the role of microbial processes in the generation of rdom and carbon storage in the ocean jiao et al 2010 4 conclusions in the present study thousands of molecules were detected and showed a gaussian distribution by ft icr ms in spe dom samples from the eio the molecules in seawater dom are dominated by carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and sulfur atoms in addition the composition of dom molecules in the surface dcm and deep layers of the eio were highly different crams ios and humic like substances were considered to be the refractory substances of rdom in the ocean with a high proportion in seawater dom especially in the deep layer in other words as the depth of seawater increases seawater becomes progressively older and more difficult to degrade and recalcitrant substances accumulate in the deep sea specifically due to the stratification of seawater there are differences in the composition and chemical properties of dom across the vertical gradient of the ocean microorganisms and photodegradation play an important role in this process this will certainly provide important scientific indications for future studies of microorganisms in the chemical elemental cycle of the ocean meanwhile this study provides some data support to study the composition and distribution of dom molecules in oligotrophic seas due to the limited number of sampling stations and samples in this work

15039,hematite the most abundant iron oxide polymorph is widely detected in the water environment and has attracted considerable attention natural nanocolloids ncs exist ubiquitously in surface waters and play critical roles in biogeochemical processes however the influences of ncs on the fate and phytotoxicity of hematite remain unknown in this study the infrared absorption spectra coupled with two dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis reveal that the specific binding interactions between ncs and hematite primarily occur via hydrophilic effects and π π interactions with an increase in the ncs contact time moreover binding with ncs slightly promoted the aggregation rates of hematite particles in the bg 11 medium interestingly ncs remarkably mitigate the phytotoxicity e g growth inhibition oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicity of nanosized and submicrosized hematite particles to chlorella vulgaris after a 96 h exposure the integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals that the regulated urea cycle amino acids and fatty acid related metabolites e g urea serine glutamate and hexadecenoic acid and genes e g acy1 cysc and gla contribute to persistent phytotoxicity this study provides new insights into the roles and mechanisms of natural ncs in regulating the environmental risk of iron oxide minerals in aqueous media graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hematite natural nanocolloids chlorella vulgaris environmental risk aquatic environment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction recently hematite the most abundant iron oxide polymorph has received increasing attention due to its excellent properties and has shown many applications in various areas such as energy storage wu et al 2016 catalysis tilley et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 industrial pigments and paints argote et al 2020 hashimoto et al 2020 and environmental protection liu et al 2020 hematite nanoparticles nps have been widely found in natural waters and sediments hassellov et al 2008 kandler et al 2009 zhou et al 2022b so they can be used as a representative oxide nanomaterial to study behavior and fate of nps in natural water systems particle size plays a major role in the biocompatibility of hematite although size dependent behavior and toxicity of hematite has been experimentally and theoretically studied in many previous researches there is still an on going debate about the relationship between behavior toxicity of particles and their primary particle size freyria et al 2012 li et al 2019 zhou et al 2022a natural nanocolloids ncs sizes of approximately 1 100 nm are widely present in aquatic environments ouyang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 currently the separation and characterization of ncs in aquatic systems have been widely investigated hartland et al 2013 lead et al 2006 but the adverse effects e g cytotoxicity oxidative stress and metabolism of ncs are infrequently reported kang et al 2019 ouyang et al 2018 moreover ncs play an important role in the environmental processes and the ecotoxicity of engineered nanoparticles enps in aquatic environments ouyang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 since hematite enters aqueous systems it will likely interact with ncs however the impacts of natural ncs on the environmental fate and risks of hematite particles remain unknown in natural and physiological environments natural ncs are inclined to adhere to the surface of enps which can dramatically impact the aggregation behavior and bioavailability of both ncs and enps ouyang et al 2020 given the complex compositions of ncs the detection of interfacial interactions between ncs and enps is still a challenging issue two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos can remedy this defect and provide an in depth understanding of the interaction mechanisms of complex compounds chen et al 2019 herein fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir coupled with 2dcos analysis was performed to explore the characteristic binding mechanisms of ncs to hematite particles at the molecular level the colloidal behaviors of hematite particles with other enps e g carbon nanotubes graphene oxide and nanosilver have been extensively studied feng et al 2017 huynh et al 2012 huynh et al 2014 however the effects of natural ncs on the aggregation of hematite particles are rarely considered and deserve further investigations substantial research reports have verified that both ncs and hematite particles especially nanoparticles exhibit toxic effects on aquatic organisms e g bacteria algae and fish bin et al 2019 huang et al 2020 ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2019 qu et al 2019 nevertheless until recently the combined toxicity of ncs with hematite particles toward aquatic organisms remained unknown given the wide distribution of natural ncs and the rapid development of hematite related applications studying the combined ecological effects of hematite particles and ncs is more environmentally meaningful than probing the toxic effects of pristine hematite particles in this study the main objectives are to investigate the impact of natural ncs on the molecular structural variations aggregation uptake and ecotoxicity of nanosized and submicrosized hematite particles herein chlorella vulgaris c vulgaris was selected as a model test organism for traditional algal toxicity analysis only a few metabolites or genes are used as biological end points to examine toxicological mechanisms and important biological information may be missed ouyang et al 2020 omics is a powerful tool to provide global insights into biological responses providing a deeper understanding and more comprehensive and definitive evaluations of nanotoxicity than traditional analyses zou et al 2020 we integrate omics techniques metabolomics and transcriptomics to reveal phytotoxicity mechanisms by building the relationships between biological responses and the identified metabolites or differentially expressed genes degs in the key kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg metabolic pathways this study provides the first insights into the environmental health and risks of iron oxide minerals influenced by ncs in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 water collection and isolation of ncs natural surface water samples depth of 0 5 m were collected to study the isolation and characterization of ncs in the haihe river mainstream on october 30 2019 under dry weather conditions based on our previous report the physical and chemical properties e g morphologies size distribution and chemical compositions of ncs are very similar except for the concentration ranging from 3 7 to 7 2 mg l in different locations along the haihe river mainstream ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2020 moreover the ncs concentration at the haihe river bridge located in the middle of the haihe river mainstream was 4 3 0 5 mg l table s1 which was close to the average concentration of ncs in the haihe river mainstream ouyang et al 2018 therefore natural surface water was sampled from the haihe river bridge and the basic characteristics and sampling site locations were shown in table s1 the detailed water sampling and handling processes were provided in supporting information si text s1 ncs were isolated from the surface water by using a three step method including membrane filtration tangential flow ultrafiltration and dialysis as previously described ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2020 and the details were also provided in si text s2 2 2 hematite particle synthesis hematite particles of two different sizes were synthesized by forced hydrolysis of iron chloride fecl3 6h2o according to the method reported by schwertmann and cornell schwertmann and cornell 2008 key parameters that affected both the size and morphology of the hematite particles including the fe3 ion concentration ph aging time and temperature of hydrolysis were carefully controlled during the synthesis more details about the synthesis of the hematite particles were described in si text s3 2 3 characterization of ncs and hematite particles the sizes and crystalline phases of ncs and synthetic hematite particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem and powder x ray diffraction xrd respectively the details about the ncs and synthetic hematite particle characterization were provided in si text s4 2 4 ftir measurements and 2dcos analysis to further study the interactions between ncs and hematite particles 2dcos was performed using ftir with the interaction time 0 0 25 0 5 1 2 6 12 24 48 72 and 96 h serving as the external perturbation the details of the ftir data collection and deconvolution are provided in si text s5 before the analysis the ftir spectra of each sample were baseline corrected and smoothed by opus 5 0 software to obtain the structural variation information and interaction on the ncs bound hematite particles two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos was employed using ftir spectra with the interaction time as the external perturbation the background signal incubation time at 0 h was subtracted from the spectra of each sample for the 2dcos analysis synchronous and asynchronous maps of 2d ftir correlation spectroscopy were plotted using 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan and origin 9 0 software the general interpretation of the event s sequence was based on noda and ozaki s rules chen et al 2015 liu et al 2017 in the synchronous map cross peaks φ v1 v2 refer to the simultaneous changes of the spectral variables observed at two bands v1 v2 positive cross and negative cross peaks indicated the two variables changing in the same direction and opposite trend respectively moreover cross peaks ψ v1 v2 in the asynchronous map represented the sequence of variable shifts by given perturbations if the signs of cross peaks in synchronous φ v1 v2 and asynchronous ψ v1 v2 maps were the same the spectral change of one variable precedes that of the other on the contrary the orders of the changes would be reversed if the signs were different 2 5 aggregation kinetics of hematite particles in the presence of ncs the aggregation experiments on two types of hematite particles were conducted at room temperature and ph 7 0 in the presence of ncs at the environmental concentration 4 mg l in bg 11 media hematite particles at 1 mg l were selected in this assay because they could provide a robust dynamic light scattering dls signal dls and zeta potential measurements of the final mixed suspension with different interaction times 0 24 48 72 and 96 h were performed using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls measurements were used to determine the aggregation kinetics and rates of particles the hydrodynamic diameters dh of each particle suspension were recorded at 0 25 min the initial aggregation could be defined as the period from experiment initiation t0 to the time when the measured dh was 1 5 dh initial zou et al 2021 the initial aggregation rate constant k a of particles was defined by the following equation zhou et al 2019

predicted environmental enms concentrations 0 01 0 1 and 1 0 mg l of hematite particles were tested on c vulgaris given that the isolated environmental concentrations of ncs from the haihe river were

software at a p value 0 05 level the metabolic data and pathway analysis were performed using metaboanalyst version 5 0 https www metaboanalyst ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ncs and hematite particles the concentration of ncs separated from the haihe river surface water was 4 3 0 5 mg l table s1 the visual inspection fig 1 a of ncs suspension 10 mg l was transparent and the initial ph of ncs suspension was 7 1 0 2 table s2 atomic force microscopy afm fig s1a and tem fig 1a images showed that the ncs exhibited fibrillar irregular particle or flake morphologies the thicknesses of ncs were approximately 8 nm fig s1a most of the ncs particles 80 were less than 40 nm in size and the mean size of the ncs was 26 9 14 3 nm fig 1b the morphology and size distribution of ncs in this study were consistent with our previous report ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2020 integrating energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis revealed that the main chemical compositions of ncs included carbon oxygen nitrogen and heavy metals as shown in fig s1b c the details are presented in the si moreover multiple spectral analyses such as uv vis fig s1d excitation emission matrix spectra fig s1e ftir fig s1f and xrd fig 1c implied that there were abundant organic compounds e g aromatic compounds humic like fluorescence and protein like fractions and hydrophilic functional groups e g carboxyl groups on the surface of the ncs the above details for the optical properties of ncs are presented in the si the compositions of natural ncs were difficult to illustrate clearly mainly due to the variable and complex sources over space and time kang et al 2022 overall the compositions of ncs were a mixture of organic matter e g protein like polysaccharides and humic acid substances and inorganic matter e g na mg ca and fe this result was consistent with our previous reports ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2019 the representative tem images n 15 and the corresponding size distributions of the particles n 500 indicated that the primary particle sizes of the two hematite samples were 46 7 6 7 nm hm50 and 402 0 47 1 nm hm400 respectively fig 1a 1b the dramatic color change between the hm50 and hm400 suspension confirmed that redder more opaque solutions contain smaller particles fig 1a moreover both hm50 and hm400 showed a nearly isotropic shape with similar surface roughness which was consistent with previous studies li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the xrd results fig 1c indicated that only the hematite phase existed in synthetic hm50 and hm400 moreover the average crystallite sizes of the hm50 and hm400 samples were 34 9 2 5 nm and 350 8 33 2 nm respectively as determined using the scherrer and hall equations dorofeev et al 2012 holzwarth and gibson 2011 this calculated value was consistent with the tem statistical analysis results fig 1b 3 2 adhesion of ncs to hematite particles as determined by ftir 2dcos interactions of ncs with enps in the environment can affect the environmental fates and toxicity of these enps ouyang et al 2019 ouyang et al 2020 therefore to study the interfacial interaction mechanism and sequential order of changes to secondary structure during the adhesion processes the ftir spectra of ncs onto hm50 and hm400 at ph 7 0 as a function of time 0 0 25 0 5 1 2 6 12 24 48 72 and 96 h are shown in fig s2a and b the striking spectral changes mainly focused on the 600 2000 cm 1 region where the primary vibrational information of the adsorbed ncs molecule could be identified moreover the effect of ncs on the structural variation of hm50 and hm400 was clarified more clearly in the differential ftir absorbance spectra in fig s2c and d ncs adhering to hematite particles exhibited a similar variation trend and a successive change in intensity upon ncs sorption on both hm50 and hm400 was observed with increasing time four distinctive peaks 1635 1384 1045 and 878 cm 1 were observed in the second derivative spectra fig s2 and table s3 for example the peak intensity at 1635 cm 1 attributed to the skeletal stretching of aromatic c c bonds gradually decreased with ncs s contact time from 1 h to 96 h addition fig s2c and d this result implied that the aromatic structures of ncs were the vital interaction sites binding to hematite particles the decrease was probably due to the charge transfer effect liu et al 2017 the above observations suggested that ncs could adhere to hematite particles through multiple mechanisms due to their various functional groups which also implied the difficulty and complexity of the adhesion process analysis however the one dimensional dominant ftir spectra failed to provide detailed information on this adhesion process and binding characteristics with the contact time addition 2dcos is a powerful tool for elucidating the mechanisms of complex compound interactions due to its numerous advantages including an enhanced spectral resolution and the ability to discern the specific order of structural changes under external perturbation chen et al 2019 lee and hur 2016 herein synchronous and asynchronous ftir 2dcos of the interaction between ncs and hm50 and hm400 at various contact times are shown in fig 2 the corresponding sign and assignment of each cross peak are also listed in table s3 for the synchronous 2dcos map fig 2a and b there were four autopeaks centered at 878 1045 1384 and 1635 cm 1 the band centered at 878 cm 1 fe o stretching attributed to hm50 and hm400 changed most significantly suggesting that the associated fe o groups were the main interaction sites for the adsorption of ncs structures the smallest changes were at 1384 and 1635 cm 1 which were assigned to the stretching of phenolic co and aromatic c c groups of ncs respectively furthermore three positive cross peak areas ψ 878 cm 1 1384 cm 1 ψ 878 cm 1 1045 cm 1 and ψ 1384 cm 1 1045 cm 1 and one negative cross peak area ψ 878 cm 1 1635 cm 1 were observed in the asynchronous map fig 2c 2d table s3 following noda s rule the adhesion of such ncs related structures seemed to occur on the order of 1045 cm 1 1630 cm 1 1384 cm 1 or c o stretching ν c c of aromatic ring phenolic ν c o δ o h for both hm50 and hm400 structures 878 cm 1 fe o group as the contact time increased these results indicated an increase in the number of oxygen containing functional groups from the ncs fraction on the surfaces of hm50 and hm400 with the contact time addition the above result showed that the binding of hydrophilic sites was higher than that of hydrophobic sites which implied that hydrophilic effects were involved in the adhesion of ncs to hematite particles ouyang et al 2019 generally hydrophilic effects can affect the surface chemical surface property e g hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and surface charge and the environmental behavior of nanoparticles araújo et al 2016 hu et al 2015b for example the hydrophilic functional group on the surface of the hydrophilic carbon dots interacts with hematite nps during co precipitation inhibiting the aggregation araújo et al 2016 here the accumulation of these hydrophilic oxygen containing ncs components on hm50 and hm400 surfaces can enhance their hydrophilicity and may influence their aggregation behavior which needs further exploration and discussion 3 3 homoaggregation of ncs and hematite particles in bg 11 medium the dispersibility of nanoparticles impacts their fate and biological effects lai et al 2021 prior to the algal toxicity test the time profile of particle sizes in the bg 11 medium was also investigated as shown in fig s3a aggregation kinetics experiments revealed that the dh of the ncs hm50 and hm400 increased to 435 8 292 7 and 689 7 nm respectively at 1500s in bg 11 medium moreover the values of the aggregation rate constant k a were used to normalize the heteroaggregation profile of hematite particles with ncs the k a value of pristine hm50 and hm400 in the bg 11 medium were 0 226 nm s and 0 410 nm s respectively however the aggregation rate k a of hm50 and hm400 with ncs increased to 0 259 nm s and 0 671 nm s respectively indicating that ncs promoted the aggregation of hematite particles this result was supported by variations in dh for ncs and hematite particles from 24 to 96 h fig s3b all particles remained unstable for 96 h particularly for the initial period 24 h indicating that homoaggregates could be immediately formed for all materials similar observations were found in previous reports on heteroaggregation between natural inorganic colloids e g siderite particles and goethite and hematite particles guo et al 2023 li et al 2020 these results were also confirmed by the zeta potential results of ncs and hematite particles as shown in fig s3c the zeta potential of all particles was approximately unchanged around 10 to 20 mv mainly from 24 to 96 h suggesting that all materials in the algal medium were considered to be metastable rasulev et al 2015 meanwhile the zeta potentials of ncs hm50 and hm400 in bg 11 medium at different ph values from 2 to 11 are further shown in fig s3d all particles were negatively charged 4 7 31 3 mv in the ph range from 3 to 11 and the point of zero charges of hm50 and hm400 was approximately 2 3 4 ncs mitigated the phytotoxicity of hm50 and hm400 after exposure for 96 h the inhibitory effects of the ncs 4 mg l and hm50 0 01 1 mg l were 33 6 and 10 5 20 3 respectively fig 3 a in contrast hm400 did not significantly p 0 05 inhibit algal growth at 0 01 1 mg l exposure notably the inhibition ratios of the ncs hematite mixtures were lower than those of hematite particles especially for the hm50 group suggesting the mitigation of hematite toxicity in the presence of ncs after 96 h of exposure there were no significant differences p 0 05 in the chlorophyll a content between the control and exposure groups except for the significant decrease in the 1 mg l hm50 group as shown in fig 3b chlorophyll a is a crucial photosynthetic pigment and plays a key role in the photosynthesis of algal cells wan et al 2021 moreover the chlorophyll a content in the hm50 groups 1 mg l was lower than those in the control and hm400 groups suggesting that hm50 induced more photosynthetic toxicity than the control and hm400 this result was consistent with the algal growth inhibition result fig 3a the retr is a main indicator of photosynthetic performance and a function of photosynthetically active radiation zavafer et al 2021 as shown in fig 3c the ncs and ncs hematite mixture groups exhibited 8 9 and 3 0 16 4 higher retrs through photosystem ii than the control groups respectively moreover ncs played a dominant role in photosystem ii toxicity compared with the hm50 or hm400 groups the generation of oxidative stress can reflect the most common nanotoxicity mechanism and may lead to a decrease in photosynthesis horie and tabei 2021 yuan et al 2018 as shown in fig 3d the relative ros levels in the hm50 1 mg l and ncs 4 mg l groups were 17 1 and 28 7 significantly p 0 05 higher than those in the control group respectively this result was consistent with the photosynthesis related toxicity of hm50 fig 3b and ncs fig 3c importantly the presence of ncs decreased the ros level induced by hm50 by 20 2 implying that ncs could mitigate the generation of ros induced by hm50 mitochondrial toxicity is an important pathway for oxidative stress generation hu et al 2015a as shown in fig 3e the ratios of the red to green fluorescence intensity of ncs and hm50 1 mg l groups were significantly p 0 05 decreased by 15 6 and 12 1 respectively compared with the control group moreover the hm400 and ncs hematite mixture groups did not cause a significant p 0 05 mitochondrial membrane potential loss compared with the control moreover there was a mitigatory effect toward the mitochondrial toxicity of hm50 especially at 1 0 mg l in the presence of ncs this result was consistent with the ros results fig 3d the changes in algal cell permeability are presented in fig 3f all exposures except for the 1 mg l hm50 ncs group induced a significant p 0 05 increase in algal cell permeability the promoting effects of the ncs hematite particles and ncs hematite mixtures were 20 2 21 7 84 1 and 45 6 67 4 respectively moreover both the hm50 1 mg l and ncs 4 mg l groups exhibited more significant p 0 05 cell permeability than the hm50 ncs group based on the above algal toxicity results ncs and hm50 induced stronger biological effects e g cell growth ros levels mitochondrial membrane potential loss than hm400 implying the size dependent toxic effects of particles nanoparticle size plays a major role in algal nanotoxicity lei et al 2016 ouyang et al 2015 moreover ncs mitigated the phytotoxicity of hm50 and hm400 the organic matter e g protein like polysaccharides and humic acid substances or inorganic matter e g na mg ca and fe of ncs may play an important role in this process however it s difficulty to identify the contributing compositions in the ncs due to their complexity and heterogeneity the formation of biological coronas on nanoparticles could affect their toxicity zou et al 2020 herein natural ncs adhered to the surfaces of hematite particles and influenced their structure and surface chemistry fig 2 which might further impact the algal toxicity of hm50 and hm400 this observed mitigation may have been caused by the increased number of oxygen containing functional groups e g c o and oh and aromatic compounds c c aromatic rings on the surfaces of hematite particles from ncs fig 2 in addition the various species of nanomaterials influence the combined biological responses compared with two dimensional nanomaterials ncs could augment the phytotoxicity of graphene oxide or molybdenum disulfide nanosheets ouyang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 these results were contrary to our results 3 5 algal ultrastructure damage to compare cellular ultrastructure damage among the control and particle treated groups at 96 h tem was performed as shown in fig 3g l the tem images of the control groups fig 3g and particle treated groups fig 3h l showed intact and clear algal ultrastructures e g cell wall nucleus and chloroplasts however compared with the control group obvious plasmolysis in all treatment groups was observed as denoted by the green double headed arrow this result could support the cell permeability results fig 3f plasmolysis in algal cells is a common nanotoxicity phenomenon and it has been observed with other nanoparticles e g nano tio2 graphene oxide and molybdenum disulfide exposed to green algae in previous studies martín de lucía et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zou et al 2019 generally ncs and hm50 induced stronger plasmolysis than hm400 meanwhile there was no significant difference in the degree of plasmolysis between ncs and hm50 groups in the ncs exposure group fig 3h some irregularly shaped particles sizes from 39 to 72 nm were observed around chloroplasts and starch grains the size and morphology of these irregularly shaped particles were consistent with the ncs tem results fig 1a b the above result suggested that these irregularly shaped particles should be ncs a previous study confirmed that irregularly shaped ncs sizes from 28 5 to 96 1 nm could enter c vulgaris and mainly accumulated near starch grains ouyang et al 2020 similarly in the hm50 and ncs hm50 exposure groups fig 3i j some regular and spherical particles sizes from 42 to 58 nm were also taken up by algal cells and gathered in chloroplasts or starch grains comparing the morphological and particle size distributions of hm50 as determined by tem fig 1a and b these regular and spherical particles should be hm50 interestingly the number of endocytic vesicles size from 120 to 210 nm n 15 between the cell wall and plasma membrane after ncs group 4 9 1 2 n 15 and hematite particle groups 3 2 0 9 n 15 were approximately 3 5 fold and 2 3 fold larger than that in the control group 1 4 0 5 n 15 respectively compared with those in the ncs and hm50 treatment groups minor ncs and hm50 particles gathered in the endocytic vesicles as denoted by the blue arrow these results implied that ncs and hm50 were internalized via pinocytosis this rsult was consistent with the internalization of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks by phaeodactylum tricornutum being achieved mainly via endocytosis zhang et al 2021 in the hm400 and ncs hm400 exposure groups fig 3k l hm400 regular and spherical particles size from 386 to 431 nm was too large for algal cells and could not be taken up moreover an extracellular polymeric substance as denoted by the black arrow secreted by the algal cells was likely a self defense strategy to protect against pollutants e g hm400 yu 2020 based on the above tem observation results the uptake pathway was related to the physicochemical properties of target particles the cell membrane and extracellular interactions zhang et al 2021 the internalization of ncs or hm50 was achieved via a size dependent endocytosis mechanism several studies have reported that the algal cytotoxicity and intracellular uptake mechanisms of other nanoparticles e g graphene oxide depend on their size ouyang et al 2015 therefore hm50 induced stronger algal toxicity than hm400 which could be explained by differences in the bioaccumulation and internalization of hematite particles furthermore the molecular mechanism by which ncs mitigate the phytotoxicity of hm50 and hm400 needs to be deeply investigated 3 6 integrating metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis explaining biological responses in total we quantified 54 metabolites e g amino acids fatty acids and carbohydrates and more than 10 000 nuclear encoded transcripts in each sample as shown in fig s4 heatmaps were used to present the relative levels of the metabolites and hierarchical clustering hcl analysis revealed that the samples were divided into two clusters control ncs and hm50 ncs hm50 hm400 ncs hm400 moreover the pca score plots fig s5a supported the hcl analysis distinctions in the metabolic profiles they demonstrated that the metabolite profile of the ncs exposed group was similar to that of the control while hm50 and hm400 significantly p 0 05 changed the metabolite profiles of algal cells in a size dependent manner fig s5a using a fold change fc 1 3 or 0 77 and a p value 0 05 as the threshold 16 metabolites were selected for the assessment of metabolic pathway perturbation using overrepresentation and pathway topology analyses fig s5b f and table s4 in the ncs treatment group sulfur metabolism was regulated fig s5b sulfur metabolism is a versatile platform for launching defense operations and the regulation of sulfur metabolism has been found under the conditions of heavy metal and silver nanoparticle exposure liu et al 2021 lu et al 2020 rausch and wachter 2005 as shown in fig s5a f all treatments inhibited arginine and proline metabolism isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis and tyrosine metabolism pathways in algal cells in addition hm50 and hm400 regulated the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways fig s5a e which are crucial for energy metabolites and the synthesis of carbohydrates çatav et al 2018 tong et al 2019 in the transcriptomic analysis the pearson correlation coefficient pcc was used to assess the similarities and correlations between samples as shown in fig s6 the pcc between the ncs and control groups was 0 86 r2 0 74 which implied that the two groups were highly positively correlated in contrast the ncs hm50 and hm400 ncs hm400 groups were not related to the hm50 group as strongly as the control group and the correlation values were low r2 0 48 this result was consistent with the distinctions in the metabolic profiles determined by hcl and pca fig s4 and fig s5a the results of the above analysis suggested that hematite particles exerted a stronger influence on the algal metabolic profile than the control we also used a venn diagram to identify overlap between the set of genes that were subject to transcriptional regulation as shown in fig s7 the degs upregulated and downregulated shared among the groups implied that common toxicological mechanisms were induced by ncs hm50 and hm400 for example two degs asp5 and mdh were involved in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism respectively the above degs were significantly regulated in the ncs hm50 and hm400 treatment groups table s5 these transcriptomics results supported the metabolic pathway perturbation analysis fig s5b f furthermore metabolomics integrated with transcriptomics was used to elucidate the molecular phytotoxicity mechanisms by establishing an association between metabolic and gene kegg pathway enrichment analyses as shown in fig 4 ten kegg pathways were consistently altered at the metabolism and gene levels as nitrogen is one of the most important macronutrient elements in algal cells its availability is directly related to plant physiology e g growth and photosynthesis wang et al 2018 xin et al 2019 the urea cycle plays a vital role in nitrogen transport and storage in algal cells and it serves as an important medium for the metabolism of other amino acids e g ornithine lysine and serine solomon et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 the levels of urea and ornithine were increased by ncs and hematite particles especially hm400 and ncs hm400 which likely played roles in inhibiting cell growth fig 3a as shown in table s4 the glycine content was decreased but the serine levels were increased by the treatment in a size dependent manner generally glycine and serine are essential amino acids formed during photorespiration and the glycine serine ratio is always used as an indicator of photorespiratory activity diaz et al 2005 importantly the glycine serine ratios in the ncs 1 22 hm50 1 22 and hm400 1 38 exposure groups were significantly p 0 05 lower than those in the control 2 03 ncs hm50 1 75 and ncs hm400 1 93 groups this result suggested that hm50 induced more serious photorespiration inhibition than hm400 while ncs could mitigate the photorespiration inhibition of hm50 and hm400 moreover the upregulated degs metb and cysk and downregulated degs tst and cysc in sulfur metabolism might affect serine synthesis and photorespiration in the ncs and hm50 groups fig 4 and table s5 these results were consistent with the photosynthetic toxicity results fig 3b c glutamate acting as a precursor metabolite plays a vital role in proline accumulation which manifests as a striking metabolic response to the formation of ros in plants under abiotic stress qiu et al 2020 moreover energy and carbohydrate metabolism are related to energy status maintenance and oxidative stress treves et al 2020 both metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses indicated the significant p 0 05 downregulation of glutamate synthesis 0 91 and 0 72 fold respectively and the significant inhibition of energy and carbohydrate metabolism xyla gmug gla and rbsk in the ncs and hm500 exposure groups as shown in fig 4 and table s4 s5 which was consistent with the ros levels fig 3d and mitochondrial toxicity results fig 3e in algal cells additionally fatty acid metabolism is crucial for the synthesis of endocytic vesicles and the transportation of exogenous pollutants rahmani et al 2019 sharma et al 2017 in this study two fatty acid metabolites hexadecenoic acid and dodecanoic acid and three regulatory genes e g fab2 involved in fatty acid metabolism were significantly regulated in the treatment group which was consistent with the ultrastructural damage and increase in endocytic vesicles to algal cells observed by tem fig 3g l the above integrative metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses thoroughly revealed the molecular information and mechanisms underlying the phytotoxicity induced by ncs and hematite particles of two different sizes 4 conclusions in summary ftir 2dcos was used to determine the binding characteristics of ncs onto hematite particles with an increase in the ncs contact time the oxygen containing functional e g c o or oh and aromatic groups were involved in the binding process via hydrophilic effects and π π interactions respectively ncs adhesion also promoted the homoaggregation of hematite particles in the bg 11 medium size is a critical factor that affects enms nanotoxicity qu et al 2019 after 96 h of exposure ncs and hm50 induced more serious growth inhibition photosynthesis oxidative stress and plasmolysis in c vulgaris than hm400 fig 3 given the vital roles of ncs and hematite particles it is important to consider their environmental behaviors and systematic effects when assessing the co exposure health risks of ncs and hematite particles notably natural ncs mitigated the phytotoxicity of hm50 and hm400 integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the molecular mechanisms of the above combined toxic effect this work may also have fundamental and practical ramifications for engineering applications e g medicine wastewater treatment and the biocontrol of water blooms of nano and microscale mineral particles in the future more

15039,hematite the most abundant iron oxide polymorph is widely detected in the water environment and has attracted considerable attention natural nanocolloids ncs exist ubiquitously in surface waters and play critical roles in biogeochemical processes however the influences of ncs on the fate and phytotoxicity of hematite remain unknown in this study the infrared absorption spectra coupled with two dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis reveal that the specific binding interactions between ncs and hematite primarily occur via hydrophilic effects and π π interactions with an increase in the ncs contact time moreover binding with ncs slightly promoted the aggregation rates of hematite particles in the bg 11 medium interestingly ncs remarkably mitigate the phytotoxicity e g growth inhibition oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicity of nanosized and submicrosized hematite particles to chlorella vulgaris after a 96 h exposure the integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals that the regulated urea cycle amino acids and fatty acid related metabolites e g urea serine glutamate and hexadecenoic acid and genes e g acy1 cysc and gla contribute to persistent phytotoxicity this study provides new insights into the roles and mechanisms of natural ncs in regulating the environmental risk of iron oxide minerals in aqueous media graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hematite natural nanocolloids chlorella vulgaris environmental risk aquatic environment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction recently hematite the most abundant iron oxide polymorph has received increasing attention due to its excellent properties and has shown many applications in various areas such as energy storage wu et al 2016 catalysis tilley et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 industrial pigments and paints argote et al 2020 hashimoto et al 2020 and environmental protection liu et al 2020 hematite nanoparticles nps have been widely found in natural waters and sediments hassellov et al 2008 kandler et al 2009 zhou et al 2022b so they can be used as a representative oxide nanomaterial to study behavior and fate of nps in natural water systems particle size plays a major role in the biocompatibility of hematite although size dependent behavior and toxicity of hematite has been experimentally and theoretically studied in many previous researches there is still an on going debate about the relationship between behavior toxicity of particles and their primary particle size freyria et al 2012 li et al 2019 zhou et al 2022a natural nanocolloids ncs sizes of approximately 1 100 nm are widely present in aquatic environments ouyang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 currently the separation and characterization of ncs in aquatic systems have been widely investigated hartland et al 2013 lead et al 2006 but the adverse effects e g cytotoxicity oxidative stress and metabolism of ncs are infrequently reported kang et al 2019 ouyang et al 2018 moreover ncs play an important role in the environmental processes and the ecotoxicity of engineered nanoparticles enps in aquatic environments ouyang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 since hematite enters aqueous systems it will likely interact with ncs however the impacts of natural ncs on the environmental fate and risks of hematite particles remain unknown in natural and physiological environments natural ncs are inclined to adhere to the surface of enps which can dramatically impact the aggregation behavior and bioavailability of both ncs and enps ouyang et al 2020 given the complex compositions of ncs the detection of interfacial interactions between ncs and enps is still a challenging issue two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos can remedy this defect and provide an in depth understanding of the interaction mechanisms of complex compounds chen et al 2019 herein fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir coupled with 2dcos analysis was performed to explore the characteristic binding mechanisms of ncs to hematite particles at the molecular level the colloidal behaviors of hematite particles with other enps e g carbon nanotubes graphene oxide and nanosilver have been extensively studied feng et al 2017 huynh et al 2012 huynh et al 2014 however the effects of natural ncs on the aggregation of hematite particles are rarely considered and deserve further investigations substantial research reports have verified that both ncs and hematite particles especially nanoparticles exhibit toxic effects on aquatic organisms e g bacteria algae and fish bin et al 2019 huang et al 2020 ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2019 qu et al 2019 nevertheless until recently the combined toxicity of ncs with hematite particles toward aquatic organisms remained unknown given the wide distribution of natural ncs and the rapid development of hematite related applications studying the combined ecological effects of hematite particles and ncs is more environmentally meaningful than probing the toxic effects of pristine hematite particles in this study the main objectives are to investigate the impact of natural ncs on the molecular structural variations aggregation uptake and ecotoxicity of nanosized and submicrosized hematite particles herein chlorella vulgaris c vulgaris was selected as a model test organism for traditional algal toxicity analysis only a few metabolites or genes are used as biological end points to examine toxicological mechanisms and important biological information may be missed ouyang et al 2020 omics is a powerful tool to provide global insights into biological responses providing a deeper understanding and more comprehensive and definitive evaluations of nanotoxicity than traditional analyses zou et al 2020 we integrate omics techniques metabolomics and transcriptomics to reveal phytotoxicity mechanisms by building the relationships between biological responses and the identified metabolites or differentially expressed genes degs in the key kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg metabolic pathways this study provides the first insights into the environmental health and risks of iron oxide minerals influenced by ncs in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 water collection and isolation of ncs natural surface water samples depth of 0 5 m were collected to study the isolation and characterization of ncs in the haihe river mainstream on october 30 2019 under dry weather conditions based on our previous report the physical and chemical properties e g morphologies size distribution and chemical compositions of ncs are very similar except for the concentration ranging from 3 7 to 7 2 mg l in different locations along the haihe river mainstream ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2020 moreover the ncs concentration at the haihe river bridge located in the middle of the haihe river mainstream was 4 3 0 5 mg l table s1 which was close to the average concentration of ncs in the haihe river mainstream ouyang et al 2018 therefore natural surface water was sampled from the haihe river bridge and the basic characteristics and sampling site locations were shown in table s1 the detailed water sampling and handling processes were provided in supporting information si text s1 ncs were isolated from the surface water by using a three step method including membrane filtration tangential flow ultrafiltration and dialysis as previously described ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2020 and the details were also provided in si text s2 2 2 hematite particle synthesis hematite particles of two different sizes were synthesized by forced hydrolysis of iron chloride fecl3 6h2o according to the method reported by schwertmann and cornell schwertmann and cornell 2008 key parameters that affected both the size and morphology of the hematite particles including the fe3 ion concentration ph aging time and temperature of hydrolysis were carefully controlled during the synthesis more details about the synthesis of the hematite particles were described in si text s3 2 3 characterization of ncs and hematite particles the sizes and crystalline phases of ncs and synthetic hematite particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem and powder x ray diffraction xrd respectively the details about the ncs and synthetic hematite particle characterization were provided in si text s4 2 4 ftir measurements and 2dcos analysis to further study the interactions between ncs and hematite particles 2dcos was performed using ftir with the interaction time 0 0 25 0 5 1 2 6 12 24 48 72 and 96 h serving as the external perturbation the details of the ftir data collection and deconvolution are provided in si text s5 before the analysis the ftir spectra of each sample were baseline corrected and smoothed by opus 5 0 software to obtain the structural variation information and interaction on the ncs bound hematite particles two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos was employed using ftir spectra with the interaction time as the external perturbation the background signal incubation time at 0 h was subtracted from the spectra of each sample for the 2dcos analysis synchronous and asynchronous maps of 2d ftir correlation spectroscopy were plotted using 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan and origin 9 0 software the general interpretation of the event s sequence was based on noda and ozaki s rules chen et al 2015 liu et al 2017 in the synchronous map cross peaks φ v1 v2 refer to the simultaneous changes of the spectral variables observed at two bands v1 v2 positive cross and negative cross peaks indicated the two variables changing in the same direction and opposite trend respectively moreover cross peaks ψ v1 v2 in the asynchronous map represented the sequence of variable shifts by given perturbations if the signs of cross peaks in synchronous φ v1 v2 and asynchronous ψ v1 v2 maps were the same the spectral change of one variable precedes that of the other on the contrary the orders of the changes would be reversed if the signs were different 2 5 aggregation kinetics of hematite particles in the presence of ncs the aggregation experiments on two types of hematite particles were conducted at room temperature and ph 7 0 in the presence of ncs at the environmental concentration 4 mg l in bg 11 media hematite particles at 1 mg l were selected in this assay because they could provide a robust dynamic light scattering dls signal dls and zeta potential measurements of the final mixed suspension with different interaction times 0 24 48 72 and 96 h were performed using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls measurements were used to determine the aggregation kinetics and rates of particles the hydrodynamic diameters dh of each particle suspension were recorded at 0 25 min the initial aggregation could be defined as the period from experiment initiation t0 to the time when the measured dh was 1 5 dh initial zou et al 2021 the initial aggregation rate constant k a of particles was defined by the following equation zhou et al 2019 1 k a d d h t d t t 0 2 6 algal culture and toxicity experiments the freshwater algae c vulgaris production number fachb 8 was purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china the algae were cultured in bg 11 medium in an artificial climate incubator spx 300i c shanghai boxun medical bioinstrument co limited china under a 14 10 h light dark cycle at 25 c with 80 humidity light although the current environmental concentrations of hematite particles are low or unknown in water environments the environmental concentrations of other enps e g nanosilver carbon nanotubes and tio2 nanoparticles can reach the μg l level in surface water gottschalk et al 2009 gottschalk et al 2013 to investigate the phytotoxicity of hematite particles at predicted environmental enms concentrations 0 01 0 1 and 1 0 mg l of hematite particles were tested on c vulgaris given that the isolated environmental concentrations of ncs from the haihe river were 4 3 0 5 mg l table s1 the exposure concentrations of ncs were set at 4 mg l algal cells exposed to bg 11 medium were used as a control then the c vulgaris exposed to bg 11 medium control ncs 4 mg l hematite 0 01 1 mg l and hematite ncs 0 01 1 mg l hematite 4 mg l ncs in 250 ml glass flasks containing 100 ml of bg 11 medium ph 7 0 for 96 h after 96 h of exposure the growth inhibition of algal cell division was calculated by counting the cell numbers nt using an automatic algae counter countstar biomarine ia1000 alit life science co limited china the algal cell numbers in the control group nc were also counted and growth inhibition nc nt nc 100 the chlorophyll a content and relative electron transport rate retr of algae were determined by using a spectrophotometer and a pulse amplitude modulation pam fluorimeter method respectively the details are provided in si text s6 the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros mitochondrial membrane potential loss and the permeability of cell membranes in algal cells were measured with a microplate reader tecan spark 10 m switzerland using the 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da 5 5 6 6 tetrachloro 1 1 3 3 tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide jc 1 and diacetate fda methods respectively ouyang et al 2020 the above details are provided in si text s7 the cellular ultrastructure of algal cells after 96 h was observed by tem and the details were provided in si text s8 2 7 metabolomics and transcriptome analysis after exposure for 96 h the algal cell suspensions were collected intracellular metabolites were extracted from algal cells by liquid liquid extraction and subjected to enrichment lyophilization derivatization treves et al 2020 and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 6890 n 5973 agilent santa clara ca ouyang et al 2020 the details are presented in si text s9 moreover rna isolation and transcriptome analysis of algal cells were performed by novogene co ltd china the details of the above omics measurements were provided in si text s10 2 8 statistical analysis all experiments were performed at least in triplicate and the results are presented as the mean standard deviation significant differences among different treatment groups were determined by one way analysis of variance anova followed by a tukey test using spss 19 0 software at a p value 0 05 level the metabolic data and pathway analysis were performed using metaboanalyst version 5 0 https www metaboanalyst ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ncs and hematite particles the concentration of ncs separated from the haihe river surface water was 4 3 0 5 mg l table s1 the visual inspection fig 1 a of ncs suspension 10 mg l was transparent and the initial ph of ncs suspension was 7 1 0 2 table s2 atomic force microscopy afm fig s1a and tem fig 1a images showed that the ncs exhibited fibrillar irregular particle or flake morphologies the thicknesses of ncs were approximately 8 nm fig s1a most of the ncs particles 80 were less than 40 nm in size and the mean size of the ncs was 26 9 14 3 nm fig 1b the morphology and size distribution of ncs in this study were consistent with our previous report ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2020 integrating energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis revealed that the main chemical compositions of ncs included carbon oxygen nitrogen and heavy metals as shown in fig s1b c the details are presented in the si moreover multiple spectral analyses such as uv vis fig s1d excitation emission matrix spectra fig s1e ftir fig s1f and xrd fig 1c implied that there were abundant organic compounds e g aromatic compounds humic like fluorescence and protein like fractions and hydrophilic functional groups e g carboxyl groups on the surface of the ncs the above details for the optical properties of ncs are presented in the si the compositions of natural ncs were difficult to illustrate clearly mainly due to the variable and complex sources over space and time kang et al 2022 overall the compositions of ncs were a mixture of organic matter e g protein like polysaccharides and humic acid substances and inorganic matter e g na mg ca and fe this result was consistent with our previous reports ouyang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2019 the representative tem images n 15 and the corresponding size distributions of the particles n 500 indicated that the primary particle sizes of the two hematite samples were 46 7 6 7 nm hm50 and 402 0 47 1 nm hm400 respectively fig 1a 1b the dramatic color change between the hm50 and hm400 suspension confirmed that redder more opaque solutions contain smaller particles fig 1a moreover both hm50 and hm400 showed a nearly isotropic shape with similar surface roughness which was consistent with previous studies li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the xrd results fig 1c indicated that only the hematite phase existed in synthetic hm50 and hm400 moreover the average crystallite sizes of the hm50 and hm400 samples were 34 9 2 5 nm and 350 8 33 2 nm respectively as determined using the scherrer and hall equations dorofeev et al 2012 holzwarth and gibson 2011 this calculated value was consistent with the tem statistical analysis results fig 1b 3 2 adhesion of ncs to hematite particles as determined by ftir 2dcos interactions of ncs with enps in the environment can affect the environmental fates and toxicity of these enps ouyang et al 2019 ouyang et al 2020 therefore to study the interfacial interaction mechanism and sequential order of changes to secondary structure during the adhesion processes the ftir spectra of ncs onto hm50 and hm400 at ph 7 0 as a function of time 0 0 25 0 5 1 2 6 12 24 48 72 and 96 h are shown in fig s2a and b the striking spectral changes mainly focused on the 600 2000 cm 1 region where the primary vibrational information of the adsorbed ncs molecule could be identified moreover the effect of ncs on the structural variation of hm50 and hm400 was clarified more clearly in the differential ftir absorbance spectra in fig s2c and d ncs adhering to hematite particles exhibited a similar variation trend and a successive change in intensity upon ncs sorption on both hm50 and hm400 was observed with increasing time four distinctive peaks 1635 1384 1045 and 878 cm 1 were observed in the second derivative spectra fig s2 and table s3 for example the peak intensity at 1635 cm 1 attributed to the skeletal stretching of aromatic c c bonds gradually decreased with ncs s contact time from 1 h to 96 h addition fig s2c and d this result implied that the aromatic structures of ncs were the vital interaction sites binding to hematite particles the decrease was probably due to the charge transfer effect liu et al 2017 the above observations suggested that ncs could adhere to hematite particles through multiple mechanisms due to their various functional groups which also implied the difficulty and complexity of the adhesion process analysis however the one dimensional dominant ftir spectra failed to provide detailed information on this adhesion process and binding characteristics with the contact time addition 2dcos is a powerful tool for elucidating the mechanisms of complex compound interactions due to its numerous advantages including an enhanced spectral resolution and the ability to discern the specific order of structural changes under external perturbation chen et al 2019 lee and hur 2016 herein synchronous and asynchronous ftir 2dcos of the interaction between ncs and hm50 and hm400 at various contact times are shown in fig 2 the corresponding sign and assignment of each cross peak are also listed in table s3 for the synchronous 2dcos map fig 2a and b there were four autopeaks centered at 878 1045 1384 and 1635 cm 1 the band centered at 878 cm 1 fe o stretching attributed to hm50 and hm400 changed most significantly suggesting that the associated fe o groups were the main interaction sites for the adsorption of ncs structures the smallest changes were at 1384 and 1635 cm 1 which were assigned to the stretching of phenolic co and aromatic c c groups of ncs respectively furthermore three positive cross peak areas ψ 878 cm 1 1384 cm 1 ψ 878 cm 1 1045 cm 1 and ψ 1384 cm 1 1045 cm 1 and one negative cross peak area ψ 878 cm 1 1635 cm 1 were observed in the asynchronous map fig 2c 2d table s3 following noda s rule the adhesion of such ncs related structures seemed to occur on the order of 1045 cm 1 1630 cm 1 1384 cm 1 or c o stretching ν c c of aromatic ring phenolic ν c o δ o h for both hm50 and hm400 structures 878 cm 1 fe o group as the contact time increased these results indicated an increase in the number of oxygen containing functional groups from the ncs fraction on the surfaces of hm50 and hm400 with the contact time addition the above result showed that the binding of hydrophilic sites was higher than that of hydrophobic sites which implied that hydrophilic effects were involved in the adhesion of ncs to hematite particles ouyang et al 2019 generally hydrophilic effects can affect the surface chemical surface property e g hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and surface charge and the environmental behavior of nanoparticles araújo et al 2016 hu et al 2015b for example the hydrophilic functional group on the surface of the hydrophilic carbon dots interacts with hematite nps during co precipitation inhibiting the aggregation araújo et al 2016 here the accumulation of these hydrophilic oxygen containing ncs components on hm50 and hm400 surfaces can enhance their hydrophilicity and may influence their aggregation behavior which needs further exploration and discussion 3 3 homoaggregation of ncs and hematite particles in bg 11 medium the dispersibility of nanoparticles impacts their fate and biological effects lai et al 2021 prior to the algal toxicity test the time profile of particle sizes in the bg 11 medium was also investigated as shown in fig s3a aggregation kinetics experiments revealed that the dh of the ncs hm50 and hm400 increased to 435 8 292 7 and 689 7 nm respectively at 1500s in bg 11 medium moreover the values of the aggregation rate constant k a were used to normalize the heteroaggregation profile of hematite particles with ncs the k a value of pristine hm50 and hm400 in the bg 11 medium were 0 226 nm s and 0 410 nm s respectively however the aggregation rate k a of hm50 and hm400 with ncs increased to 0 259 nm s and 0 671 nm s respectively indicating that ncs promoted the aggregation of hematite particles this result was supported by variations in dh for ncs and hematite particles from 24 to 96 h fig s3b all particles remained unstable for 96 h particularly for the initial period 24 h indicating that homoaggregates could be immediately formed for all materials similar observations were found in previous reports on heteroaggregation between natural inorganic colloids e g siderite particles and goethite and hematite particles guo et al 2023 li et al 2020 these results were also confirmed by the zeta potential results of ncs and hematite particles as shown in fig s3c the zeta potential of all particles was approximately unchanged around 10 to 20 mv mainly from 24 to 96 h suggesting that all materials in the algal medium were considered to be metastable rasulev et al 2015 meanwhile the zeta potentials of ncs hm50 and hm400 in bg 11 medium at different ph values from 2 to 11 are further shown in fig s3d all particles were negatively charged 4 7 31 3 mv in the ph range from 3 to 11 and the point of zero charges of hm50 and hm400 was approximately 2 3 4 ncs mitigated the phytotoxicity of hm50 and hm400 after exposure for 96 h the inhibitory effects of the ncs 4 mg l and hm50 0 01 1 mg l were 33 6 and 10 5 20 3 respectively fig 3 a in contrast hm400 did not significantly p 0 05 inhibit algal growth at 0 01 1 mg l exposure notably the inhibition ratios of the ncs hematite mixtures were lower than those of hematite particles especially for the hm50 group suggesting the mitigation of hematite toxicity in the presence of ncs after 96 h of exposure there were no significant differences p 0 05 in the chlorophyll a content between the control and exposure groups except for the significant decrease in the 1 mg l hm50 group as shown in fig 3b chlorophyll a is a crucial photosynthetic pigment and plays a key role in the photosynthesis of algal cells wan et al 2021 moreover the chlorophyll a content in the hm50 groups 1 mg l was lower than those in the control and hm400 groups suggesting that hm50 induced more photosynthetic toxicity than the control and hm400 this result was consistent with the algal growth inhibition result fig 3a the retr is a main indicator of photosynthetic performance and a function of photosynthetically active radiation zavafer et al 2021 as shown in fig 3c the ncs and ncs hematite mixture groups exhibited 8 9 and 3 0 16 4 higher retrs through photosystem ii than the control groups respectively moreover ncs played a dominant role in photosystem ii toxicity compared with the hm50 or hm400 groups the generation of oxidative stress can reflect the most common nanotoxicity mechanism and may lead to a decrease in photosynthesis horie and tabei 2021 yuan et al 2018 as shown in fig 3d the relative ros levels in the hm50 1 mg l and ncs 4 mg l groups were 17 1 and 28 7 significantly p 0 05 higher than those in the control group respectively this result was consistent with the photosynthesis related toxicity of hm50 fig 3b and ncs fig 3c importantly the presence of ncs decreased the ros level induced by hm50 by 20 2 implying that ncs could mitigate the generation of ros induced by hm50 mitochondrial toxicity is an important pathway for oxidative stress generation hu et al 2015a as shown in fig 3e the ratios of the red to green fluorescence intensity of ncs and hm50 1 mg l groups were significantly p 0 05 decreased by 15 6 and 12 1 respectively compared with the control group moreover the hm400 and ncs hematite mixture groups did not cause a significant p 0 05 mitochondrial membrane potential loss compared with the control moreover there was a mitigatory effect toward the mitochondrial toxicity of hm50 especially at 1 0 mg l in the presence of ncs this result was consistent with the ros results fig 3d the changes in algal cell permeability are presented in fig 3f all exposures except for the 1 mg l hm50 ncs group induced a significant p 0 05 increase in algal cell permeability the promoting effects of the ncs hematite particles and ncs hematite mixtures were 20 2 21 7 84 1 and 45 6 67 4 respectively moreover both the hm50 1 mg l and ncs 4 mg l groups exhibited more significant p 0 05 cell permeability than the hm50 ncs group based on the above algal toxicity results ncs and hm50 induced stronger biological effects e g cell growth ros levels mitochondrial membrane potential loss than hm400 implying the size dependent toxic effects of particles nanoparticle size plays a major role in algal nanotoxicity lei et al 2016 ouyang et al 2015 moreover ncs mitigated the phytotoxicity of hm50 and hm400 the organic matter e g protein like polysaccharides and humic acid substances or inorganic matter e g na mg ca and fe of ncs may play an important role in this process however it s difficulty to identify the contributing compositions in the ncs due to their complexity and heterogeneity the formation of biological coronas on nanoparticles could affect their toxicity zou et al 2020 herein natural ncs adhered to the surfaces of hematite particles and influenced their structure and surface chemistry fig 2 which might further impact the algal toxicity of hm50 and hm400 this observed mitigation may have been caused by the increased number of oxygen containing functional groups e g c o and oh and aromatic compounds c c aromatic rings on the surfaces of hematite particles from ncs fig 2 in addition the various species of nanomaterials influence the combined biological responses compared with two dimensional nanomaterials ncs could augment the phytotoxicity of graphene oxide or molybdenum disulfide nanosheets ouyang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 these results were contrary to our results 3 5 algal ultrastructure damage to compare cellular ultrastructure damage among the control and particle treated groups at 96 h tem was performed as shown in fig 3g l the tem images of the control groups fig 3g and particle treated groups fig 3h l showed intact and clear algal ultrastructures e g cell wall nucleus and chloroplasts however compared with the control group obvious plasmolysis in all treatment groups was observed as denoted by the green double headed arrow this result could support the cell permeability results fig 3f plasmolysis in algal cells is a common nanotoxicity phenomenon and it has been observed with other nanoparticles e g nano tio2 graphene oxide and molybdenum disulfide exposed to green algae in previous studies martín de lucía et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zou et al 2019 generally ncs and hm50 induced stronger plasmolysis than hm400 meanwhile there was no significant difference in the degree of plasmolysis between ncs and hm50 groups in the ncs exposure group fig 3h some irregularly shaped particles sizes from 39 to 72 nm were observed around chloroplasts and starch grains the size and morphology of these irregularly shaped particles were consistent with the ncs tem results fig 1a b the above result suggested that these irregularly shaped particles should be ncs a previous study confirmed that irregularly shaped ncs sizes from 28 5 to 96 1 nm could enter c vulgaris and mainly accumulated near starch grains ouyang et al 2020 similarly in the hm50 and ncs hm50 exposure groups fig 3i j some regular and spherical particles sizes from 42 to 58 nm were also taken up by algal cells and gathered in chloroplasts or starch grains comparing the morphological and particle size distributions of hm50 as determined by tem fig 1a and b these regular and spherical particles should be hm50 interestingly the number of endocytic vesicles size from 120 to 210 nm n 15 between the cell wall and plasma membrane after ncs group 4 9 1 2 n 15 and hematite particle groups 3 2 0 9 n 15 were approximately 3 5 fold and 2 3 fold larger than that in the control group 1 4 0 5 n 15 respectively compared with those in the ncs and hm50 treatment groups minor ncs and hm50 particles gathered in the endocytic vesicles as denoted by the blue arrow these results implied that ncs and hm50 were internalized via pinocytosis this rsult was consistent with the internalization of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks by phaeodactylum tricornutum being achieved mainly via endocytosis zhang et al 2021 in the hm400 and ncs hm400 exposure groups fig 3k l hm400 regular and spherical particles size from 386 to 431 nm was too large for algal cells and could not be taken up moreover an extracellular polymeric substance as denoted by the black arrow secreted by the algal cells was likely a self defense strategy to protect against pollutants e g hm400 yu 2020 based on the above tem observation results the uptake pathway was related to the physicochemical properties of target particles the cell membrane and extracellular interactions zhang et al 2021 the internalization of ncs or hm50 was achieved via a size dependent endocytosis mechanism several studies have reported that the algal cytotoxicity and intracellular uptake mechanisms of other nanoparticles e g graphene oxide depend on their size ouyang et al 2015 therefore hm50 induced stronger algal toxicity than hm400 which could be explained by differences in the bioaccumulation and internalization of hematite particles furthermore the molecular mechanism by which ncs mitigate the phytotoxicity of hm50 and hm400 needs to be deeply investigated 3 6 integrating metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis explaining biological responses in total we quantified 54 metabolites e g amino acids fatty acids and carbohydrates and more than 10 000 nuclear encoded transcripts in each sample as shown in fig s4 heatmaps were used to present the relative levels of the metabolites and hierarchical clustering hcl analysis revealed that the samples were divided into two clusters control ncs and hm50 ncs hm50 hm400 ncs hm400 moreover the pca score plots fig s5a supported the hcl analysis distinctions in the metabolic profiles they demonstrated that the metabolite profile of the ncs exposed group was similar to that of the control while hm50 and hm400 significantly p 0 05 changed the metabolite profiles of algal cells in a size dependent manner fig s5a using a fold change fc 1 3 or 0 77 and a p value 0 05 as the threshold 16 metabolites were selected for the assessment of metabolic pathway perturbation using overrepresentation and pathway topology analyses fig s5b f and table s4 in the ncs treatment group sulfur metabolism was regulated fig s5b sulfur metabolism is a versatile platform for launching defense operations and the regulation of sulfur metabolism has been found under the conditions of heavy metal and silver nanoparticle exposure liu et al 2021 lu et al 2020 rausch and wachter 2005 as shown in fig s5a f all treatments inhibited arginine and proline metabolism isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis and tyrosine metabolism pathways in algal cells in addition hm50 and hm400 regulated the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways fig s5a e which are crucial for energy metabolites and the synthesis of carbohydrates çatav et al 2018 tong et al 2019 in the transcriptomic analysis the pearson correlation coefficient pcc was used to assess the similarities and correlations between samples as shown in fig s6 the pcc between the ncs and control groups was 0 86 r2 0 74 which implied that the two groups were highly positively correlated in contrast the ncs hm50 and hm400 ncs hm400 groups were not related to the hm50 group as strongly as the control group and the correlation values were low r2 0 48 this result was consistent with the distinctions in the metabolic profiles determined by hcl and pca fig s4 and fig s5a the results of the above analysis suggested that hematite particles exerted a stronger influence on the algal metabolic profile than the control we also used a venn diagram to identify overlap between the set of genes that were subject to transcriptional regulation as shown in fig s7 the degs upregulated and downregulated shared among the groups implied that common toxicological mechanisms were induced by ncs hm50 and hm400 for example two degs asp5 and mdh were involved in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism respectively the above degs were significantly regulated in the ncs hm50 and hm400 treatment groups table s5 these transcriptomics results supported the metabolic pathway perturbation analysis fig s5b f furthermore metabolomics integrated with transcriptomics was used to elucidate the molecular phytotoxicity mechanisms by establishing an association between metabolic and gene kegg pathway enrichment analyses as shown in fig 4 ten kegg pathways were consistently altered at the metabolism and gene levels as nitrogen is one of the most important macronutrient elements in algal cells its availability is directly related to plant physiology e g growth and photosynthesis wang et al 2018 xin et al 2019 the urea cycle plays a vital role in nitrogen transport and storage in algal cells and it serves as an important medium for the metabolism of other amino acids e g ornithine lysine and serine solomon et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 the levels of urea and ornithine were increased by ncs and hematite particles especially hm400 and ncs hm400 which likely played roles in inhibiting cell growth fig 3a as shown in table s4 the glycine content was decreased but the serine levels were increased by the treatment in a size dependent manner generally glycine and serine are essential amino acids formed during photorespiration and the glycine serine ratio is always used as an indicator of photorespiratory activity diaz et al 2005 importantly the glycine serine ratios in the ncs 1 22 hm50 1 22 and hm400 1 38 exposure groups were significantly p 0 05 lower than those in the control 2 03 ncs hm50 1 75 and ncs hm400 1 93 groups this result suggested that hm50 induced more serious photorespiration inhibition than hm400 while ncs could mitigate the photorespiration inhibition of hm50 and hm400 moreover the upregulated degs metb and cysk and downregulated degs tst and cysc in sulfur metabolism might affect serine synthesis and photorespiration in the ncs and hm50 groups fig 4 and table s5 these results were consistent with the photosynthetic toxicity results fig 3b c glutamate acting as a precursor metabolite plays a vital role in proline accumulation which manifests as a striking metabolic response to the formation of ros in plants under abiotic stress qiu et al 2020 moreover energy and carbohydrate metabolism are related to energy status maintenance and oxidative stress treves et al 2020 both metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses indicated the significant p 0 05 downregulation of glutamate synthesis 0 91 and 0 72 fold respectively and the significant inhibition of energy and carbohydrate metabolism xyla gmug gla and rbsk in the ncs and hm500 exposure groups as shown in fig 4 and table s4 s5 which was consistent with the ros levels fig 3d and mitochondrial toxicity results fig 3e in algal cells additionally fatty acid metabolism is crucial for the synthesis of endocytic vesicles and the transportation of exogenous pollutants rahmani et al 2019 sharma et al 2017 in this study two fatty acid metabolites hexadecenoic acid and dodecanoic acid and three regulatory genes e g fab2 involved in fatty acid metabolism were significantly regulated in the treatment group which was consistent with the ultrastructural damage and increase in endocytic vesicles to algal cells observed by tem fig 3g l the above integrative metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses thoroughly revealed the molecular information and mechanisms underlying the phytotoxicity induced by ncs and hematite particles of two different sizes 4 conclusions in summary ftir 2dcos was used to determine the binding characteristics of ncs onto hematite particles with an increase in the ncs contact time the oxygen containing functional e g c o or oh and aromatic groups were involved in the binding process via hydrophilic effects and π π interactions respectively ncs adhesion also promoted the homoaggregation of hematite particles in the bg 11 medium size is a critical factor that affects enms nanotoxicity qu et al 2019 after 96 h of exposure ncs and hm50 induced more serious growth inhibition photosynthesis oxidative stress and plasmolysis in c vulgaris than hm400 fig 3 given the vital roles of ncs and hematite particles it is important to consider their environmental behaviors and systematic effects when assessing the co exposure health risks of ncs and hematite particles notably natural ncs mitigated the phytotoxicity of hm50 and hm400 integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the molecular mechanisms of the above combined toxic effect this work may also have fundamental and practical ramifications for engineering applications e g medicine wastewater treatment and the biocontrol of water blooms of nano and microscale mineral particles in the future more studies are needed to examine the systematic synergism antagonism and long term effects of ncs on iron oxide particles of various sizes and organisms in real environmental systems declaration of
