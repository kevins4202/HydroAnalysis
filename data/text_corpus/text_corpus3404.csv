17020,river networks are one of the main routes by which the public could be exposed to environmental sources of antibiotic resistance that may be introduced e g via treated wastewater in this study we applied a comprehensive integrated analysis encompassing mass flow concepts chemistry bacterial plate counts resistance gene quantification and shotgun metagenomics to track the fate of the resistome collective antibiotic resistance genes args in a microbial community of treated wastewater in two swiss rivers at the kilometer scale the levels of certain args and the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 commonly associated with anthropogenic sources of args decreased quickly over short distances 2 2 5 km downstream of wastewater discharge points mass flow analysis based on conservative tracers suggested this decrease was attributable mainly to dilution but arg loadings frequently also decreased e g 55 0 98 5 for ermb and tetw over the longest studied distances 6 8 and 13 7 km downstream metagenomic analysis confirmed that arg of wastewater origin did not persist in rivers after 5 6 8 km downstream distance sul1 and inti1 levels and loadings were more variable and even increased sharply at 5 6 8 km downstream distance on one occasion while input from agriculture and in situ positive selection pressure for organisms carrying args cannot be excluded in system growth of biomass is a more probable explanation the potential for direct human exposure to the resistome of wastewater origin thus appeared to typically abate rapidly in the studied rivers however the riverine aquatic resistome was also dynamic as evidenced by the increase of certain gene markers downstream without obvious sources of anthropogenic contamination this study provides new insight into drivers of riverine resistomes and pinpoints key monitoring targets indicative of where human sources and exposures are likely to be most acute graphical abstract image graphical abstract

as a growing global public health threat according to a 2014 report by the wellcome trust and the british government more than 50 000 cases of antibiotic resistant infections occur annually in europe and the united states and many hundreds of thousands of people die due to infections with resistant bacteria in other regions of the globe o neill 2014 in the eu and european economic area the annual attributable deaths by infection with antibiotic resistant pathogens have increased significantly between 2007 and 2015 for instance from 11 000 to 27 000 cassini et al 2019 aquatic environments play a potentially important role as routes of dissemination of resistance environmental niches at the landscape scale are connected to uses including drinking water supply irrigation and recreation research in this area has greatly intensified over the last decade bürgmann et al 2018 rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 and an increasing number of studies have investigated anthropogenic impacts on receiving rivers among the earliest investigations were the studies on the poudre river in colorado united states which proposed quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr based quantification of various antibiotic resistance genes args along with phylogenetic analysis e g tetw as a framework for tracking anthropogenic inputs anthropogenic input of args to the receiving river was well apparent using this approach storteboom et al 2010 more recently the advent of shotgun metagenomic sequencing has greatly advanced the resolution in the ability to characterize large scale impacts of anthropogenic arg inputs as was observed in the han river catchment in korea lee et al 2020 the authors noted a strong association of fecal contamination as evidence of anthropogenic activities shaping the composition of the downstream antibiotic resistome collective args in a microbial community in switzerland a study on rivers and lakes identified the occurrence of extended spectrum β lactamase and carbapenemase producing enterobacteriaceae which presumably originated from anthropogenic activities zurfluh et al 2013 another recent study revealed that stream microbiota are significantly altered by the input of treated wastewater in natural streams mansfeldt et al 2020 args and resistant bacteria arb can persist or proliferate in environmental systems by various mechanisms horizontal gene transfer may occur potentially resulting in new combinations of args or the transfer of resistance to environmentally adapted bacteria that could in turn change the role of the environment as reservoirs of resistance for clinically relevant bacteria furthermore the possibility of resistance selection under sub inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics has been reported andersson and hughes 2012 recently first attempts have been made to estimate predicted no effect concentrations pnecs for resistance selection in environmental settings bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 however current pnecs are an estimate extrapolated from data on isolated bacteria and could vary substantially under in situ environmental conditions and with environmental bacteria the above examples make clear that treated wastewater discharges have a significant impact on the abundance and types of arb and args in receiving rivers thus it is crucial that we gain a better understanding of the downstream fate of the anthropogenic antibiotic resistome in receiving rivers in this sense few previous studies have attempted to investigate the downstream behavior of various indicators of resistance e g arbs args mobile genetic elements commonly associated with args and no clear picture of such behavior has as yet emerged for instance a study performed in two wastewater treatment plants wwtps and their receiving river in china reported that the levels of wastewater origin args tetc sul1 and the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 decreased significantly 1 2 2 5 km downstream of the wastewater discharge point li et al 2016 on the other hand a study performed in a dutch stream showed that the downstream levels of sul1 sul2 ermb tetw and inti1 persisted or even increased for certain genes over a 20 km downstream distance sabri et al 2018 mass flow analyses of arb and arg are missing these contradictory results regarding the downstream behavior of resistance determinants could be in principle attributable to various factors different geo hydrological conditions potential inputs from non point e g agricultural sources and the possible existence of biological drivers i e horizontal and or vertical gene transfer an improved understanding of the fate of the wastewater origin antibiotic resistomes and underlying causes would therefore require an integrated approach across multiple disciplines the purpose of this study was to track wastewater origin antibiotic resistomes and identify the key mechanisms governing their fate in two of the most substantially wastewater impacted rivers in switzerland it was hypothesized that short distance up to 1 2 km from wastewater discharge point behavior of wastewater origin resistance determinant concentrations would be governed mostly by hydrological effects such as mixing and dilution thus we used conservative chemical tracers to determine dilution effects and further investigated the contribution of dilution on downstream dynamics of resistance determinants on the other hand it was expected that over longer distances more than 1 2 km up to 13 7 km to the next downstream wwtp fate of args and arb would depend also on additional source sink mechanisms such as from biological processes e g death or growth of wastewater origin arb in situ resistance co selection by antibiotics or metals and horizontal and or vertical gene transfer and or non point sources e g agricultural runoff which are expected to diffuse into the system continuously from a large catchment area therefore the potential effects of biological drivers over long downstream distances were investigated after accounting for hydrological effects to provide a comprehensive assessment of indicators of antibiotic resistance in the environment we combined various approaches cultivation of heterotrophic bacteria on media containing antibiotics quantification of key indicators of anthropogenic sources of antibiotic resistance by qpcr and broad profiling of the resistome in selected samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing our study contributes to a systematic interdisciplinary understanding of the mechanisms driving the fate of the wastewater antibiotic resistome in anthropogenically impacted rivers 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and field work a list of wwtp effluent receiving swiss rivers without known upstream point source inputs e g other wwtps was obtained from a database provided by eawag the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology retrieved 2018 eawag 2014 two sites were selected according to the following criteria 1 greatest proportion of effluent discharge to river discharge 2 least number of side streams for minimum dilution effect from side streams and 3 longest distance until the receiving river reaches another downstream wwtp the selected sites were the river suze in villeret vil in canton bern and the river murg in münchwilen mue in canton thurgau maps with all sampling points see supplementary fig s1 and s2 at the sampled sections both are shallow generally 30 cm depth under low flow conditions maximum depth 1 m rivers of strahler order number 3 and 6 and a mean annual runoff of 2 03 and 1 61 m3 s respectively the river beds are mostly gravel to avoid elevated flow conditions we sampled only under dry weather conditions at the time of sampling and during at least the previous 36 hours at vil we studied a 23 7 km stretch of the suze that we sampled from 10 km upstream us5 of the effluent ef discharge point of wwtp villeret and at 8 downstream sites located from 0 5 km d1 to 13 7 km flow distance downstream d8 before the suze reaches the discharge point of another wwtp four sampling campaigns were performed in 2018 on july 09 vi l1 july 19 vil2 july 30 vil3 and november 05 vil4 different combinations of locations were sampled in each sampling campaign as described in detail in the si pp 4 5 daily discharge measures from two gauging stations one near us and the other near d8 were obtained and are given in dataset s1 at mue we studied a 7 0 km stretch of the murg that we sampled from 0 2 km upstream us of wwtp münchwilen and at 8 downstream sites located from 0 5 d1 to 6 8 km flow distance downstream d8 before the murg reaches the discharge point of another wwtp three sampling campaigns were performed in 2018 on july 26 mue1 august 03 mue2 and august 06 mue3 discharge data was obtained from a gauging station near d4 dataset s1 samplings were performed according to other projects performed in swiss rivers and wwtps mansfeldt et al 2020 ju et al 2019 at each river sampling location grab samples 5l in sterilized water containers were obtained by combining water from just below the surface at three points along a river transect in the middle and roughly equidistant from the banks to each side of the middle point ef samples were obtained from the final effluent of the wwtps prior to discharge temperature c conductivity μs cm ph and dissolved oxygen do mg l were measured on site in an aliquot of the sample using a portable multi parameter probe multi 3630 ids wtw germany at the time of sampling to make sure ef was fully mixed with receiving water at d1 the conductivity values across the cross section were measured and no significant deviation was observed 0 5 all samples were cooled at 4 c in the dark while transported to our laboratory on the same day samples were processed on the same and next day within 36 hours for organic micropollutant analysis water samples were obtained separately and stored in pre combusted glass bottles on site cooled at 4 c during transportation and frozen at 20 c in the dark upon arrival at the laboratory until analyzed sediment samples were obtained from 5 select locations us d1 d2 d5 and d8 for select campaigns vil1 3 and mue1 3 and frozen at 20 c upon arrival at our laboratory to better constrain flow velocities in the rivers salt tracer experiment using nacl and flow velocity measurement were performed in separate sampling campaigns in august 2019 august 23 2019 for vil and august 27 2019 for mue under comparable flow conditions the results were summarized in dataset s4 e g flow velocity and hydraulic residence time further details on sites field sampling procedures and hydrological experiments are given in the method section of the si pp 4 5 the exact sampling locations gps coordinates are given in table s1 2 2 heterotrophic plate count of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb levels colony forming units cfus per ml of arb cultivable on r2a agar plates were determined in the presence of two combinations of antibiotics 1 clarithromycin 4 0 mg l and tetracycline 16 0 mg l clr tet and 2 sulfamethoxazole 76 0 mg l trimethoprim 4 0 mg l and tetracycline 16 0 mg l smx tmp tet referring to the resistance breakpoints for enterobacteriaceae suggested by clinical and laboratory standards institute cockerill et al 2013 and also one of our previous publications czekalski et al 2012 the detailed protocol is available in the si pp 6 7 2 3 dna extraction and quantitative pcr two aliquots of each water sample were filtered through two 0 2 µm pore size membrane filters using 0 5 l for ef and 1 0 l for river water samples replicate filters were then processed separately dna was extracted from the filters using dneasy powerwater kit qiagen germany following the manufacturer s instructions for sediment samples dna was extracted from about 20 g of wet sediment using the dneasy powermax soil kit qiagen germany extraction blanks confirmed absence of dna contamination see si p 8 the concentration and qualities of extracted dna were measured using a nanodrop one spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa dataset s2 presence and abundance of key indicator genes for anthropogenic arg inputs sul1 tetw ermb blactx and integron integrase class 1 gene inti1 berendonk et al 2015 gillings et al 2015 ju et al 2019 were determined by qpcr as described previously czekalski et al 2012 czekalski et al 2014 the detailed qpcr protocols are reported in the si absence of contamination from filtration and extraction procedures was confirmed using an experimental control by qpcr analysis as shown in the si 2 4 metagenome and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis shotgun metagenomics and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis were performed using illumina platforms for samples from three selected sampling campaigns samples were selected for sequencing according to the following rationale for vil the samples were selected only from campaign vil1 i e 6 samples us ef d1 d2 d5 d8 as the samples from other campaigns vil2 3 showed similar patterns of resistance determinant profiles downstream for mue 6 samples from mue2 and mue3 campaigns i e us ef d1 d3 d5 d8 from each sampling were selected as the far downstream behaviors of certain arg e g sul1 and inti1 were significantly different from each other in those campaigns dna extracts from replicated filters were pooled all library construction and sequencing was performed by novogene hong kong a detailed description of the bioinformatics workflow is given in the si briefly metagenomic data were analyzed as follows 1 after quality controls of metagenome reads de novo assembly was performed using megahit v1 1 3 li et al 2015 2 open reading frames orfs were predicted from the assembled contigs using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 and annotated to args using the structured antibiotic resistance genes sarg v2 0 database yin et al 2018 3 after read mapping to contigs and orfs using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 and samtools li et al 2009 the coverage information for contigs and orfs was calculated according to albertsen et al 2013 4 using the coverage information abundance metrics were calculated as described in table s3 5 further downstream analyses were performed such as contig based taxonomy assignment using kaiju v1 7 2 menzel et al 2016 kraken2 wood et al 2019 and blastn and detailed annotation and visualization of arg containing contigs to analyze 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data we used the dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 and followed the work flow suggested by the developers the detailed protocol is described in the si 2 5 chemical analysis metals ions i e dissolved cations and anions nutrients and dissolved organic carbon were measured as described in ju et al 2019 using high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ion chromatography flow injection analysis and total organic carbon analyzer respectively as described in the si dissolved micropollutants i e pharmaceuticals antibiotics were measured as described in ju et al 2019 using liquid chromatography triple quad mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization in the si total dried solid ts were measured in sediment samples according to standard methods apha awwa wpcf 1981 2 6 estimating the dilution effect on downstream levels of resistance determinants under continuous discharge and after complete horizontal and vertical mixing the discharged load of a conservative tracer e g sodium entering the river through ef is expected to be conserved along the river continuum under this assumption any change in the concentration of the conservative tracer would be due to dilution effects by additional water inflows i e groundwater and or tributary inputs and additional inputs of the tracer with these inflows we used sodium and two micropollutants as conservative tracers i e 4 5 methylbenzotriazole carbamazepine because these substances had high concentrations in ef compared to the us river and are known to not substantially degrade or adsorb in the river system the rationale for selecting the conservative tracers is described in more detail in the si starting with these mass conservation assumptions under steady state conditions the dilution parameter dp the ratio between external water inflow and streamflow at the downstream section between any two points a and b along a river stretch can be estimated from a ratio of tracer concentrations according to eq 1 1 d p a b c b c a c c a where a indicates an upstream location b denotes a downstream location c indicates the concentration of a tracer c denotes the average concentration of the tracer in the external inflow between a and b the derivation of eq 1 is schematized in fig 1 and also described in detail in the si concentrations c a or c b were measured directly for all compounds c was estimated according to the following equation eq 2 for sodium the values shown in dataset s9 3 and assumed to be 0 for 4 5 methylbenzotriazole and carbamazepine in short the difference in sodium loadings mass per time between the point of ef discharged and the downstream point where gauging stations were located d8 for vil d4 for mue was divided by the quantity of additional water inflows 2 na in n a d 8 or d 4 q d 8 or d 4 n a us q us n a ef q ef q d 8 or d 4 q us q ef where n a d 8 o r d 4 denotes the sodium concentration measured at d8 or d4 q u s e f d 8 o r d 4 indicates the river flow quantity or wastewater effluent discharge volume per time at us ef d8 or d4 the value dp should be the same for all conservative tracers to test our hypothesis that the short distance dynamics of resistance determinants is largely governed by dilution effects we calculated dp over short distance i e dpd1 d2 for vil and dpd1 d3 for mue and compared dp values over the same distance for resistance determinants sul1 inti1 ermb tetw and clr tet resistant bacteria with values for the conservative tracers higher dp values for resistance determinants would indicate a lower than expected concentration in the downstream and thus removal the expected downstream concentrations of resistance determinants considering dilution as a main driver can be calculated using the dpa b of conservative tracers according to the following relationship 3 c resist b c resist a c resist a d p a b for x where c r e s i s t a indicates the concentration of a resistance determinant at an upstream location a c r e s i s t b denotes the concentration of a resistance determinant at a downstream location b d p a b for x indicates the dp of a conservative tracer x between a and b eq 3 assumes that resistance determinants behave conservatively over the studied distances and that there are no significant inputs of resistance determinants from the diluting water inflows i e c for resistance determinants 0 in eq 1 therefore deviations from measured to predicted values can indicate violation of these assumptions we calculated the predicted concentration by dilution effects for each resistance determinant under these assumptions for all downstream sections of the rivers 2 7 estimating the river discharge over downstream distance the river discharge q at was estimated for several downstream locations where there were not gauging stations the estimated q values were used when calculating loadings of chemical and resistance indicators over downstream distance the q e f values were obtained from each wwtp and q u s values were either obtained from gauging station for vil or calculated as shown in eq 8 in the si for mue q d 1 q us q ef 4 if n 2 q d n q d n 1 q d n 1 d p d n 1 n 1 d p d n 1 n where q d n indicates the river discharge q at the downstream location d n 2 n 8 d p d n 1 n denotes the dilution parameter between d n 1 and d n 3 results and discussion 3 1 upstream water quality and wwtp effluent in agreement with the criteria for site selection the levels of inti1 and target args upstream of the wwtp were generally low except for the mue2 campaign where we observed elevated upstream levels of ermb and intl1 fig 2 fig s4 and s5 in the si chemical water quality likewise did not suggest significant pollution inputs from either tributaries or upstream locations for either vil or mue as most micropollutants were below the limit of quantification dataset s10 11 certain micropollutants e g 4 5 methylbenzotriazole benzotriazole and diclofenac were sporadically detected in very low quantities for cultivable multi resistant bacteria fig 3 especially clr tet resistance relatively high upstream values were observed in vil2 and mue2 us samples these findings indicate that while there is no indication of significant upstream pollution some pollution probably from periodical urban or agricultural activities may affect the river there was a settlement upstream of the wwtp and livestock farming activities i e pastures and meadows for livestock in the catchments including the upstream sections in both sites bafu 2013 while we assume surface runoff from the agricultural sites to be minimal as our samplings were performed under dry weather conditions it cannot be ruled out that some inputs from agricultural activity occasionally affected the river further investigations into the nature of these transient microbial contaminations were not carried out in this project but future work could employ microbial source tracking or microbial fingerprinting approaches to determine their sources the effluent from both wwtps contained considerable levels of pollutants for instance effluent concentrations were higher than the upstream levels by approximately 1 order of magnitude for sodium 1 2 order of magnitude for args and inti1 and more than 2 orders of magnitude for micropollutants datasets s8 11 these results are in line with previous results from a large scale investigation of micropollutants in swiss streams stamm et al 2016 3 2 short range fate of antibiotic resistance determinants in the downstream river focusing on the immediate impact of the wwtp effluents us versus d1 to d3 sites there were significant impacts of wwtp effluents on the receiving rivers in both vil and mue the estimated proportions of ef in the downstream receiving waters d1 estimated by conductivity were 10 5 35 9 for vil1 4 and 33 0 38 0 for mue1 3 dataset s9 2 accordingly significant increases of sul1 ermb tetw and inti1 as quantified by qpcr were observed at d1 compared to us p 0 01 paired t test fig 2 fig s5 however the measured levels of these antibiotic resistance indicator genes rapidly decreased nearly to upstream levels over 2 5 and 2 km downstream distance d2 or d3 locations in vil and mue respectively the same dynamic was also observed for multi resistant bacteria fig 3 especially clr tet resistance smx tmp tet resistance was often below the limit of detection 5 0 cfu ml but clearly exceeded it in the d1 samples and was thus also higher there than further downstream from d2 on several processes may contribute to the observed decrease of resistance determinants including dilution by additional water inflows via groundwater and or tributary inputs biological deterioration e g cell death or dormancy due to exposure to sunlight lower ambient temperature predation etc and cell sedimentation 3 3 dilution effects strongly affect short distance dynamics of effluent resistance determinants to determine the importance of dilution effects we compared d p calculated over a short distance d1 to d2 for vil d1 to d3 for mue downstream of the wwtp discharge point d p d 1 2 for vil d p d 1 3 for mue from conservative chemical tracer concentrations e g sodium 4 5 methylbenzotriazole carbamazepine as well as arg and inti1 levels fig 4 the average d p d 1 2 o r 3 of the target antibiotic resistance indicator genes levels were always higher than for conservative tracers indicating possible removal mechanisms at play however according to the paired t test under the null hypothesis of no significant differences of dilution parameters between different pairs of bio and conservative indicators only the differences between sul1 and tetw versus sodium were significant at p 0 05 p adjusted using benjamini hochberg method fig 4 confirming non conservative behavior and additional removal mechanisms as d p d 1 2 o r 3 for sodium took up a large portion of the values for sul1 and tetw i e d p n a d 1 2 o r 3 0 72 0 92 d p s u l 1 d 1 2 o r 3 and 0 59 0 96 d p t e t w d 1 2 o r 3 the dilution effects quantified by sodium nonetheless explain the majority of the concentration decrease for these parameters this result implies that the observed rapid decrease in the downstream levels of wastewater origin resistance determinants immediately downstream of the wwtps was mainly governed by dilution in the studied systems dilution effects thus need to be carefully considered in studies of the environmental fate of resistance determinants and loadings instead of concentrations need to be determined to accurately assess environmental fate 3 4 additional source sink effects become apparent over longer downstream distances we hypothesized that additional source sink mechanisms affect the downstream behaviors of antibiotic resistance indicator genes over longer distances to analyze this in more detail the daily loading copies day for the target args and inti1 at the point of discharge as the sum of upstream and ef loadings and for short d2 for vil d3 for mue and far downstream distances d8 were calculated by multiplying resistance levels copies m3 with the discharge m3 day at each location and then compared the discharge was either obtained directly from nearby gauging stations or estimated under consideration of the ef discharge m3 day using sodium as an indicator and according to the equation derived under the mass conservation assumption eq 4 the downstream behaviors of the target antibiotic resistance indicator genes varied by indicator and also by sampling campaign for instance the load decrease from wastewater discharge us ef to the furthest downstream point d8 was pronounced and consistent for ermb and tetw in all the samplings fig 4b c the average load reduction was 81 17 for ermb and 70 15 for tetw over 13 7 km distance in vil1 4 95 5 for ermb and 96 2 for tetw over the 6 8 km distance in mue1 3 dataset s13 in contrast the downstream behavior of the sul1 loadings was inconsistent between sampling campaigns a pronounced decrease over distance 64 94 at d8 was seen in vil1 4 but little reduction over distance in mue1 2 7 and 29 at d8 and a strong increase in mue3 the downstream fate of inti1 was also variable for instance as inti1 loads did not decrease and in some instances even increased to further analyze if there is a break point where sul1 and inti1 start to deviate from conservative behavior we calculated the predicted levels of resistance determinants over the whole study distance considering dilution as a major driver using eq 3 dataset s8 the predictions based on three different conservative tracers are visualized for sul1 and inti1 in fig 2 in vil measured levels are always below predictions except for inti1 in vil2 for mue in contrast we see measured values exceeding predicted values in several instances for inti1 even for most downstream locations in mue3 where the pronounced increase of sul1 loading was observed between d5 and d8 the level of sul1 started to exceed predicted values between 5 6 8 km distance the concentration of inti1 increased also very rapidly between 5 6 8 km downstream distance in mue3 which indicates either a pronounced proliferation or a non point source of sul1 and inti1 in this stretch of the river we will discuss potential mechanisms e g biological drivers on site selection additional anthropogenic source input and surface sediment inputs in section 3 10 a number of mechanisms may contribute to the generally observed removal sedimentation especially of cell aggregates or flocs and cell death by predation uv light or various other environmental conditions unfavorable to wastewater bacteria with the available data we are not able to determine the contribution of various mechanisms future studies could investigate the persistence of resistant bacteria or molecular resistance markers in micro or mesocosm experiments or in a turbulent flow system mimicking natural streams to answer such questions modeling transport and sedimentation of wastewater origin particles using the information on particle size mass and flow characteristics could provide information on the importance of sedimentation 3 5 wwtp effluent affects the downstream riverine resistome to obtain a broader view of the river antibiotic resistome we retrieved the arg content of metagenomes obtained for selected sampling campaigns vil1 mue2 and mue3 overall 65 arg subtypes were identified 49 of them occurred in both upstream and downstream river samples dataset s7 the antibiotic resistome in the receiving water closest to the discharge point d1 was clearly influenced by the input from ef for instance a total 28 out of 36 arg subtypes found in d1 were also detected in ef b c f g in fig 5 a while 16 of these were not observed us b c in fig 5a the 16 ef derived resistance genes confer resistance to the following antibiotic classes 1 x aminoglycoside 4 x beta lactam antibiotics 1 x chloramphenicol 2 x macrolide 1 x quinolone 4 x tetracycline 3 subtypes were multidrug resistance genes of these 16 genes 14 were no longer detected in the far downstream 6 8 13 7 km downstream distance in mue and vil designated as d far in fig 5a this is in agreement with the results for qpcr enumeration of args and inti1 reported above and implies that the majority of args that occurred exclusively in ef do not persist at detectable levels for a long distance in rivers where significant amounts of additional water inflows and additional removal mechanisms are expected 3 6 diversity of the river resistome and microbiome along the river continuum we analyzed the alpha and beta diversity of river resistomes and microbiomes as another way to observe potential effects of the wwtp discharge and to see if the dynamics in the resistome are strongly correlated with the microbial community as noted e g for changes observed during wastewater treatment ju et al 2019 as expected shannon alpha diversity of args was higher in ef compared to us samples by 20 2 225 4 fig 5b accordingly the impact of the ef resistome was observed especially for vil1 and mue3 as an increase in arg diversity in river water at the d1 sites the arg alpha diversity decreased downstream in all sampling campaigns however for the microbial community as represented by amplicon sequence variants asvs alpha diversity was not consistently higher in ef versus us and consequently also did not change significantly from us to d1 and did not consistently decrease downstream fig 5b this indicates that the downstream dynamics of the overall microbial community and the antibiotic resistome were decoupled similar conclusions were obtained from beta diversity analysis procrustes analysis between microbial communities and antibiotic resistome fig 5c revealed a strong structural correlation between microbial communities and antibiotic resistome only when the most strongly effluent affected sites d1 were considered p 0 002 fig 5c when the d1 samples were excluded the correlation was barely significant p 0 04 fig 5d indicating that the structural correlation between microbial communities and resistome largely resulted from the impacts of wwtps on d1 the weak structural correlation in less impacted waters suggests a lack of strong drivers such as selective pressures or the influx of external arb 3 7 resistome analysis confirms effluent effect and abatement to quantitatively investigate the dynamics of the resistome along the river continuum in more detail the seven most prevalent arg subtypes that appeared in more than 9 out of 18 samples were chosen for detailed analysis we calculated the proportion of each gene in this set based on relative abundance gpm gene per million fig 6 a the proportions of each of six genes aph 3 i aph 6 i mext tetq aada and sul1 to the whole seven genes were lower in us than in ef and d1 fig 6a the baca gene in contrast comprised a larger proportion in us i e up to 83 in vil1 us d5 and d8 i e up to 93 in vil1 d8 than in ef and d1 it was therefore excluded from the plots of relative and cumulative abundance of the assembled arg in the metagenome in fig 6b and their individual and cumulative environmental level gene per liter in fig 6c both relative and absolute abundances showed a similar pattern the abundances of the selected arg were higher in ef and d1 compared to us fig 6b the abundances of those six genes decreased along the downstream locations except for sul1 in the far downstream location d8 in the mue3 campaign fig 6b this analysis confirmed a quantitative effect of the effluent on the abundance of prevalent resistance genes in the river resistome and suggests additional candidates for tracking anthropogenic sources of resistance in future studies aph 3 i aph 6 i mext tetq aada and sul1 that may be useful for tracking resistance determinants from wastewater several of these genes have been used as resistance indicators for environmental samples mainly in combination with culture dependent approaches rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 but much less frequently with culture independent approaches rizzo et al 2013 sharma et al 2016 3 8 contig analysis indicates arg co location we hypothesized that the similar dynamics of some args could derive from their co location in the same host or presence on the same genetic elements so we analyzed their loci within the contigs aph 3 i and aph 6 i were indeed found to be located on the same contig in many samples from vil1 ef d1 d2 and d5 fig 7 a which may explain the strongly similar dynamics between aph 3 i and aph 6 i gpm in vil1 with r2 0 98 p 0 001 fig 6b another case of co location between args was observed between sul1 and aada the contigs containing those two genes were found in d1 in vil1 and ef in mue3 fig s13c fig 7b unlike aph 3 i and aph 6 i in vil1 however the dynamics of sul1 was not similar to that of aada especially in d5 and d8 in mue3 where high abundance of sul1 was observed while no aada was assembled fig 6b in agreement with this observation the sul1 containing contigs retrieved from d5 and d8 in mue3 did not contain aada and this was the only type that was identified in those samples fig 7b this indicates a significant shift of the bacterial populations that yielded sul1 containing contigs between d1 and d3 in mue3 with wastewater derived contigs containing sul1 aada pairs not persisting 3 9 baca an arg with high natural prevalence in environmental bacteria unlike the other prevalent genes the proportion of baca also known as uppp undecaprenyl diphosphate or pyrophosphate phosphatase was greatest in us samples and was also abundant in many downstream locations except d5 and d8 in mue3 where sul1 occupied the largest proportion fig 6a in order to further assess whether baca was intrinsic in our river water samples we identified potential hosts by assigning taxonomy to the metagenome assembled contigs using a combination of methods the contigs for which all three methods agreed at the genus level are shown in table 1 the four genera identified as potential hosts of baca contigs derived from less disturbed freshwater samples us d2 d5 d8 were pseudomonas acidovorax limnohabitans and aeromonas among them pseudomonas acidovorax and limnohabitans are typical inhabitants of freshwater and soil environments peix et al 2009 willems 2014 however considering that the proportions of baca in the contigs to the total baca in the sample in terms of reads per kilobase rpk were low for river water samples except for d8 in mue3 we assume that homologues of baca could be present in many other environmental bacteria thus our data suggests that baca is probably unsuited for tracking anthropogenic sources of antibiotic resistance 3 10 exploring the potential reasons for rapid increase of sul1 in far downstream locations in mue3 both qpcr based and metegenomic analysis confirmed that sul1 and inti1 increased in the downstream of mue and especially strongly in one of the sampling campaigns i e mue3 between 5 0 6 8 km downstream distance fig 2b 6 to figure out if there was a biological driver for this unexpected increase of sul1 and inti1 we first characterized the sul1 containing contigs the sul1 gene is known to be highly mobilized and is often associated with inti1 gillings et al 2008 gillings et al 2015 indeed all contigs containing sul1 associated with inti1 retrieved from the river d3 8 were homologs of a single dominant type that appeared to be also plasmid associated as it contained the plasmid associated gene para davis et al 1992 we could unsurprisingly not obtain a meaningful taxonomic assignment for these sequences it could thus not be demonstrated whether the downstream increase in mue3 was due to an increase in an ef derived or an environmental organism or from a local contamination source further information could be obtained in future studies by isolation or construction of metagenome assembled genomes we therefore turned to chemical indicators to further study the potential for local or non point sources of contamination as an explanation to evaluate non point source inputs of pollutants we chose to evaluate a few micropollutants that may serve as indicators of contamination sulfamethazine also known as sulfadimidine is used in pig husbandry stoob et al 2007 and mecoprop is a weed control agent used primarily in urban settings in switzerland wittmer et al 2010 it was assumed that the levels of these pollutants in downstream locations would increase or be persistently high if a pronounced agricultural or urban surface runoff existed which could accompany resistance genes and bacteria potentially existing in agricultural or urban areas in vil sulfamethazine was below detection lod 0 8 ng l in all samples except one us sample while in mue there appeared to be a source in wwtp effluent especially during the mue3 campaign but the compound was not observed to increase in downstream locations the concentrations and downstream dynamics of mecoprop varied between campaigns fig s8 for vil1 3 and mue1 and mue3 mecoprop concentrations were low 60 ng l while there seemed to be a strong effluent associated input for mue2 and concentrations remained high further downstream 200 ng l a slight increase in the downstream range 5km observed in mue2 and between 1 0 2 0 km in mue3 may be due to fluctuating input of mecoprop from the wwtp effluent concentrations did not further increase in the far downstream locations d8 where the sudden increase of sul1 and inti1 was observed fig s8 based on these but also the other analyzed micropopllutants we found no evidence for significant downstream contamination sources however these chemical indicators are not conclusive as the analyzed compounds were not a comprehensive selection to trace non point sources in the downstream river section e g from manure or pesticide applications although these are not very likely under dry weather conditions so while we found no evidence for such contamination we can also not conclusively rule them out as an explanation for the marked sul1 and inti1 increase observed for mue3 finally the potential for in situ resistance selection in the water was assessed using the concentration of antibiotics and metals in downstream locations in mue3 sulfamethoxazole and its derivative n4 acetylsulfamethoxazole were the antibiotics with the highest concentration among all the antibiotics analyzed but downstream concentration sulfamethoxazole in the range of 33 to 95 ng l in mue3 remained far below the published pnec for resistance selection e g 16 000 ng l bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the concentration of trimethoprim which is usually prescribed together with sulfamethoxazole was also much lower than its pnec for resistance selection e g 500 ng l bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 even though the vast majority of metals analyzed in this study remained below the limit of quantification or below their estimated minimum co selective concentrations for dissolved metals in water mccwaterdc the concentrations of two metals i e copper and nickel were higher than their mccwaterdc 1 5 µg l for cu and 0 29 µg l for ni seiler and berendonk 2012 however mccwaterdc is a predictive value and actual selective levels could be higher also their levels in far downstream locations d8 in mue3 were not specifically higher than at other locations within the same sampling campaign nor at the same locations than in other samplings where the increase of sul1 or inti1 was less pronounced dataset s12 furthermore we did not observe co localization between sul1 and any other genes potentially conferring cu ni or any other metal resistance based on contig based co localization search in mue fig 7b overall no convincing evidence for in situ resistance co selection by cu and ni as an explanation for the downstream increase of sul1 and inti1 was found we further note that the estimated river retention time per km was relatively short i e 51 4 and 49 5 mins km for vil and mue respectively dataset s4 which makes the likelihood of in situ resistance selection in the water even less plausible as a final possible explanation we considered the possibility of cell migration from other river compartments to the water according to qpcr enumeration of args and inti1 in surface sediments we did not observe the increase of sul1 and inti1 levels in d5 and d8 in mue3 in terms of either absolute and relative abundance fig s6 furthermore the relative abundance of sul1 and inti1 in sediment was generally similar to or lower than the values for water in mue1 3 fig s7 if sediment resuspension was a major source for aquatic sul1 and inti1 elevation in mue3 d8 relative abundances of sul1 and inti1 in water samples would be expected to remain unchanged or to drop while we could not completely exclude the possibility of contribution of sediment resuspension we assume that there could be other sources e g stream biofilms where sul1 and inti1 were selectively enriched in terms of both absolute and relative abundance considering the downstream levels of both resistance determinants and nutrients remained relatively high in mue due to high ef inputs and low downstream dilution effects especially in the third campaign fig s5 dataset s9 in system growth is also a plausible hypothesis the reason for and the nature of the striking increase of sul1 and inti1 but not of tetw ermb blactx during the mue3 campaign thus remains open and would require further study to resolve what the observation shows unambiguously is that unexpected and perhaps not directly anthropogenic contamination driven increases of args are possible as in particular sul1 and inti1 are commonly applied for tracking anthropogenic sources of arg in the environment berendonk et al 2015 gillings et al 2015 we caution that monitoring strategies should employ a multi target strategy to be robust 4 conclusions downstream levels of antibiotic resistance determinants decreased rapidly over 2 0 2 5 km distance due to dilution effects and decay over longer distance due to other removal mechanisms this would suggest that public exposure to wastewater origin antibiotic resistance might be most acute only over short distances few kilometers from points of discharge especially if a pronounced input of additional water inflows exists we also observed at least one instance where sul1 and inti1 dynamically increased in the river without being able to establish any link to a local anthropogenic contamination other river compartments where in system growth of biomass could take place i e stream biofilms could be included as a monitoring target in future studies metagenomics based resistome analysis yielded consistent conclusions with qpcr analysis of select targets e g sul1 and also identified promising targets for future monitoring of anthropogenic sources of antibiotic resistance e g aph 3 i aph 6 i mext tetq and aada in general metagenomics qpcr and cultivation based assays yielded consistent trends public health advice could be based on quantifying indicator genes or technically simpler cultivation based indicators a weak structural correlation between resistome and microbiome and low levels of co selective agents revealed a lack of driving forces in less disturbed river waters downstream over 3 km distance plus upstream locations we showed that contig based taxonomic assignment and analysis of the genetic neighborhood of assembled arg can reveal important if limited additional information about shifts in arg host identities mobilization and co

17020,river networks are one of the main routes by which the public could be exposed to environmental sources of antibiotic resistance that may be introduced e g via treated wastewater in this study we applied a comprehensive integrated analysis encompassing mass flow concepts chemistry bacterial plate counts resistance gene quantification and shotgun metagenomics to track the fate of the resistome collective antibiotic resistance genes args in a microbial community of treated wastewater in two swiss rivers at the kilometer scale the levels of certain args and the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 commonly associated with anthropogenic sources of args decreased quickly over short distances 2 2 5 km downstream of wastewater discharge points mass flow analysis based on conservative tracers suggested this decrease was attributable mainly to dilution but arg loadings frequently also decreased e g 55 0 98 5 for ermb and tetw over the longest studied distances 6 8 and 13 7 km downstream metagenomic analysis confirmed that arg of wastewater origin did not persist in rivers after 5 6 8 km downstream distance sul1 and inti1 levels and loadings were more variable and even increased sharply at 5 6 8 km downstream distance on one occasion while input from agriculture and in situ positive selection pressure for organisms carrying args cannot be excluded in system growth of biomass is a more probable explanation the potential for direct human exposure to the resistome of wastewater origin thus appeared to typically abate rapidly in the studied rivers however the riverine aquatic resistome was also dynamic as evidenced by the increase of certain gene markers downstream without obvious sources of anthropogenic contamination this study provides new insight into drivers of riverine resistomes and pinpoints key monitoring targets indicative of where human sources and exposures are likely to be most acute graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antimicrobial resistance wastewater river system metagenomics transport degradation 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is increasingly recognized by international and governmental entities as a growing global public health threat according to a 2014 report by the wellcome trust and the british government more than 50 000 cases of antibiotic resistant infections occur annually in europe and the united states and many hundreds of thousands of people die due to infections with resistant bacteria in other regions of the globe o neill 2014 in the eu and european economic area the annual attributable deaths by infection with antibiotic resistant pathogens have increased significantly between 2007 and 2015 for instance from 11 000 to 27 000 cassini et al 2019 aquatic environments play a potentially important role as routes of dissemination of resistance environmental niches at the landscape scale are connected to uses including drinking water supply irrigation and recreation research in this area has greatly intensified over the last decade bürgmann et al 2018 rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 and an increasing number of studies have investigated anthropogenic impacts on receiving rivers among the earliest investigations were the studies on the poudre river in colorado united states which proposed quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr based quantification of various antibiotic resistance genes args along with phylogenetic analysis e g tetw as a framework for tracking anthropogenic inputs anthropogenic input of args to the receiving river was well apparent using this approach storteboom et al 2010 more recently the advent of shotgun metagenomic sequencing has greatly advanced the resolution in the ability to characterize large scale impacts of anthropogenic arg inputs as was observed in the han river catchment in korea lee et al 2020 the authors noted a strong association of fecal contamination as evidence of anthropogenic activities shaping the composition of the downstream antibiotic resistome collective args in a microbial community in switzerland a study on rivers and lakes identified the occurrence of extended spectrum β lactamase and carbapenemase producing enterobacteriaceae which presumably originated from anthropogenic activities zurfluh et al 2013 another recent study revealed that stream microbiota are significantly altered by the input of treated wastewater in natural streams mansfeldt et al 2020 args and resistant bacteria arb can persist or proliferate in environmental systems by various mechanisms horizontal gene transfer may occur potentially resulting in new combinations of args or the transfer of resistance to environmentally adapted bacteria that could in turn change the role of the environment as reservoirs of resistance for clinically relevant bacteria furthermore the possibility of resistance selection under sub inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics has been reported andersson and hughes 2012 recently first attempts have been made to estimate predicted no effect concentrations pnecs for resistance selection in environmental settings bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 however current pnecs are an estimate extrapolated from data on isolated bacteria and could vary substantially under in situ environmental conditions and with environmental bacteria the above examples make clear that treated wastewater discharges have a significant impact on the abundance and types of arb and args in receiving rivers thus it is crucial that we gain a better understanding of the downstream fate of the anthropogenic antibiotic resistome in receiving rivers in this sense few previous studies have attempted to investigate the downstream behavior of various indicators of resistance e g arbs args mobile genetic elements commonly associated with args and no clear picture of such behavior has as yet emerged for instance a study performed in two wastewater treatment plants wwtps and their receiving river in china reported that the levels of wastewater origin args tetc sul1 and the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 decreased significantly 1 2 2 5 km downstream of the wastewater discharge point li et al 2016 on the other hand a study performed in a dutch stream showed that the downstream levels of sul1 sul2 ermb tetw and inti1 persisted or even increased for certain genes over a 20 km downstream distance sabri et al 2018 mass flow analyses of arb and arg are missing these contradictory results regarding the downstream behavior of resistance determinants could be in principle attributable to various factors different geo hydrological conditions potential inputs from non point e g agricultural sources and the possible existence of biological drivers i e horizontal and or vertical gene transfer an improved understanding of the fate of the wastewater origin antibiotic resistomes and underlying causes would therefore require an integrated approach across multiple disciplines the purpose of this study was to track wastewater origin antibiotic resistomes and identify the key mechanisms governing their fate in two of the most substantially wastewater impacted rivers in switzerland it was hypothesized that short distance up to 1 2 km from wastewater discharge point behavior of wastewater origin resistance determinant concentrations would be governed mostly by hydrological effects such as mixing and dilution thus we used conservative chemical tracers to determine dilution effects and further investigated the contribution of dilution on downstream dynamics of resistance determinants on the other hand it was expected that over longer distances more than 1 2 km up to 13 7 km to the next downstream wwtp fate of args and arb would depend also on additional source sink mechanisms such as from biological processes e g death or growth of wastewater origin arb in situ resistance co selection by antibiotics or metals and horizontal and or vertical gene transfer and or non point sources e g agricultural runoff which are expected to diffuse into the system continuously from a large catchment area therefore the potential effects of biological drivers over long downstream distances were investigated after accounting for hydrological effects to provide a comprehensive assessment of indicators of antibiotic resistance in the environment we combined various approaches cultivation of heterotrophic bacteria on media containing antibiotics quantification of key indicators of anthropogenic sources of antibiotic resistance by qpcr and broad profiling of the resistome in selected samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing our study contributes to a systematic interdisciplinary understanding of the mechanisms driving the fate of the wastewater antibiotic resistome in anthropogenically impacted rivers 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and field work a list of wwtp effluent receiving swiss rivers without known upstream point source inputs e g other wwtps was obtained from a database provided by eawag the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology retrieved 2018 eawag 2014 two sites were selected according to the following criteria 1 greatest proportion of effluent discharge to river discharge 2 least number of side streams for minimum dilution effect from side streams and 3 longest distance until the receiving river reaches another downstream wwtp the selected sites were the river suze in villeret vil in canton bern and the river murg in münchwilen mue in canton thurgau maps with all sampling points see supplementary fig s1 and s2 at the sampled sections both are shallow generally 30 cm depth under low flow conditions maximum depth 1 m rivers of strahler order number 3 and 6 and a mean annual runoff of 2 03 and 1 61 m3 s respectively the river beds are mostly gravel to avoid elevated flow conditions we sampled only under dry weather conditions at the time of sampling and during at least the previous 36 hours at vil we studied a 23 7 km stretch of the suze that we sampled from 10 km upstream us5 of the effluent ef discharge point of wwtp villeret and at 8 downstream sites located from 0 5 km d1 to 13 7 km flow distance downstream d8 before the suze reaches the discharge point of another wwtp four sampling campaigns were performed in 2018 on july 09 vi l1 july 19 vil2 july 30 vil3 and november 05 vil4 different combinations of locations were sampled in each sampling campaign as described in detail in the si pp 4 5 daily discharge measures from two gauging stations one near us and the other near d8 were obtained and are given in dataset s1 at mue we studied a 7 0 km stretch of the murg that we sampled from 0 2 km upstream us of wwtp münchwilen and at 8 downstream sites located from 0 5 d1 to 6 8 km flow distance downstream d8 before the murg reaches the discharge point of another wwtp three sampling campaigns were performed in 2018 on july 26 mue1 august 03 mue2 and august 06 mue3 discharge data was obtained from a gauging station near d4 dataset s1 samplings were performed according to other projects performed in swiss rivers and wwtps mansfeldt et al 2020 ju et al 2019 at each river sampling location grab samples 5l in sterilized water containers were obtained by combining water from just below the surface at three points along a river transect in the middle and roughly equidistant from the banks to each side of the middle point ef samples were obtained from the final effluent of the wwtps prior to discharge temperature c conductivity μs cm ph and dissolved oxygen do mg l were measured on site in an aliquot of the sample using a portable multi parameter probe multi 3630 ids wtw germany at the time of sampling to make sure ef was fully mixed with receiving water at d1 the conductivity values across the cross section were measured and no significant deviation was observed 0 5 all samples were cooled at 4 c in the dark while transported to our laboratory on the same day samples were processed on the same and next day within 36 hours for organic micropollutant analysis water samples were obtained separately and stored in pre combusted glass bottles on site cooled at 4 c during transportation and frozen at 20 c in the dark upon arrival at the laboratory until analyzed sediment samples were obtained from 5 select locations us d1 d2 d5 and d8 for select campaigns vil1 3 and mue1 3 and frozen at 20 c upon arrival at our laboratory to better constrain flow velocities in the rivers salt tracer experiment

our previous publications czekalski et al 2012 the detailed protocol is available in the si pp 6 7 2 3 dna extraction and quantitative pcr two aliquots of each water sample were filtered through two 0 2 µm pore size membrane filters using 0 5 l for ef and 1 0 l for river water samples replicate filters were then processed separately dna was extracted from the filters using dneasy powerwater kit qiagen germany following the manufacturer s instructions for sediment samples dna was extracted from about 20 g of wet sediment using the dneasy powermax soil kit qiagen germany extraction blanks confirmed absence of dna contamination see si p 8 the concentration and qualities of extracted dna were measured using a nanodrop one spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa dataset s2 presence

confirmed using an experimental control by qpcr analysis as shown in the si 2 4 metagenome and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis shotgun metagenomics and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis were performed using illumina platforms for samples from three selected sampling campaigns samples were selected for sequencing according to the following rationale for vil the samples were selected only from campaign vil1 i e 6 samples us ef d1 d2 d5 d8 as the samples from other campaigns vil2 3 showed similar patterns of resistance determinant profiles downstream for mue 6 samples from mue2 and mue3 campaigns i e us ef d1 d3 d5 d8 from each sampling were selected as the far downstream behaviors of certain arg e g sul1 and inti1 were significantly different from each other in those campaigns dna extracts from replicated filters were pooled all library construction and sequencing was performed by novogene hong kong a detailed description of the bioinformatics workflow is given in the si briefly metagenomic data were analyzed as follows 1 after quality controls of metagenome reads de novo assembly was performed using megahit v1 1 3 li et al 2015 2 open reading frames orfs were predicted from the assembled contigs using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 and annotated to args using the structured antibiotic resistance genes sarg v2 0 database yin et al 2018 3 after read mapping to contigs and orfs using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 and samtools li et al 2009 the coverage information for contigs and orfs was calculated according to albertsen et al 2013 4 using the coverage information abundance metrics were calculated as described in table s3 5 further downstream analyses were performed such as contig based taxonomy assignment using kaiju v1 7 2 menzel et al 2016 kraken2 wood et al 2019 and blastn and detailed annotation and visualization of arg containing contigs to analyze 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data we used the dada2 pipeline callahan et

organic carbon were measured as described in ju et al 2019 using high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ion chromatography flow injection analysis and total organic carbon analyzer respectively as described in the si dissolved micropollutants i e pharmaceuticals antibiotics were measured as described in ju et al 2019 using liquid chromatography triple quad mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization in the si total dried solid ts were measured in sediment samples according to standard methods apha awwa wpcf 1981 2 6 estimating the dilution effect on downstream levels of resistance determinants under continuous discharge and after complete horizontal and vertical mixing the discharged load of a conservative tracer e g sodium entering the river through ef is expected to be conserved along the river continuum under this assumption any change in the concentration of the conservative tracer would be due to dilution effects by additional water inflows i e groundwater and or tributary inputs and additional inputs of the tracer with these inflows we used sodium and two micropollutants as conservative tracers i e 4 5 methylbenzotriazole carbamazepine because these substances had high concentrations in ef compared to the us river and are known to not substantially degrade or adsorb in the river system the rationale for selecting the conservative tracers is described in more detail in the si starting with these mass conservation assumptions under steady state conditions the dilution parameter dp the ratio between external water inflow and streamflow at the downstream section between any two points a and b along a river stretch can be estimated from a ratio of tracer concentrations according to eq 1 1 d p a b c b c a c c a where a indicates an upstream location b denotes a downstream location c indicates the concentration of a tracer c denotes the average concentration of the tracer in the external inflow between a and b the derivation of eq 1 is schematized in fig 1 and also described in detail in the si concentrations c a or c b were measured directly for all compounds c was estimated according to the following equation eq 2 for sodium the values shown in dataset s9 3 and assumed to be 0 for 4 5 methylbenzotriazole and carbamazepine in short the difference in sodium loadings mass per time between the point of ef discharged and the downstream point where gauging stations were located d8 for vil d4 for mue was divided by the quantity of additional water inflows 2 na in n a d 8 or d 4 q d 8 or d 4 n a us q us n a ef q ef q d 8 or d 4 q us q ef where n a d 8 o r d 4 denotes the sodium concentration measured at d8 or d4 q u s e f d 8 o r d 4 indicates the river flow quantity or wastewater effluent discharge volume per time at us ef d8 or d4 the value dp should be the same for all conservative tracers to test our hypothesis that the short distance dynamics of resistance determinants is largely governed by dilution effects we calculated dp over short distance i e dpd1 d2 for vil and dpd1 d3 for mue and compared dp values over the same distance for resistance determinants sul1 inti1 ermb tetw and clr tet resistant bacteria with values for the conservative tracers higher dp values for resistance determinants would indicate a lower than expected concentration in the downstream and thus removal the expected downstream concentrations of resistance determinants considering dilution as a main driver can be calculated using the dpa b of conservative tracers according to the following relationship 3 c resist b c resist a c resist a d p a b for x where c r e s i s t a indicates the concentration of a resistance determinant at an upstream location a c r e s i s t b denotes the concentration of a resistance determinant at a downstream location b d p a b for x indicates the dp of a conservative tracer x between a and b eq 3 assumes that resistance determinants behave conservatively over the studied distances and that there are no significant inputs of resistance determinants from the diluting water inflows i e c for resistance determinants 0 in eq 1 therefore deviations from measured to predicted values can indicate violation of these assumptions we calculated the predicted concentration by dilution effects for each resistance determinant under these assumptions for all downstream sections of the rivers 2 7 estimating the river discharge over downstream distance the river discharge q at was estimated for several downstream locations where there were not gauging stations the estimated q values were used when calculating loadings of chemical and resistance indicators over downstream distance the q e f values were obtained from each wwtp and q

indicates the river discharge q at the downstream location d n 2 n 8 d p d n 1 n denotes the dilution parameter between d n 1 and d n 3 results and discussion 3 1 upstream water quality and wwtp effluent in agreement with the criteria for site selection the levels of inti1 and target args upstream of the wwtp were generally low except for the mue2 campaign where we observed elevated upstream levels of ermb and intl1 fig 2 fig s4 and s5 in the si chemical water quality likewise did not suggest significant pollution inputs from either tributaries or upstream locations for either vil or mue as most micropollutants were below the limit of quantification dataset s10 11 certain micropollutants e g 4 5 methylbenzotriazole benzotriazole and diclofenac were sporadically detected in very low quantities for cultivable multi resistant bacteria fig 3 especially clr tet resistance relatively high upstream values were observed in vil2 and mue2 us samples these findings indicate that while there is no indication of significant upstream pollution some pollution probably from periodical urban or agricultural activities may affect the river there was a settlement upstream of the wwtp and livestock farming activities i e pastures and meadows for livestock in the catchments including the upstream sections in both sites bafu 2013 while we assume surface runoff from the agricultural sites to be minimal as our samplings were performed under dry weather conditions it cannot be ruled out that some inputs from agricultural activity occasionally affected the river further investigations into the nature of these transient microbial contaminations were not carried out in this project but future work could employ microbial source tracking or microbial fingerprinting approaches to determine their sources the effluent from both wwtps contained considerable levels of pollutants for instance effluent concentrations were higher than the upstream levels by approximately 1 order of magnitude for sodium 1 2 order of magnitude for args and inti1 and more than 2 orders of magnitude for micropollutants datasets s8 11 these results are in line with previous results from a large scale investigation of micropollutants in swiss streams stamm et al 2016 3 2 short range fate of antibiotic resistance determinants in the downstream river focusing on the immediate impact of the wwtp effluents us versus d1 to d3 sites there were significant impacts of wwtp effluents on the receiving rivers in both vil and mue the estimated proportions of ef in the downstream receiving waters d1 estimated by conductivity were 10 5 35 9 for vil1 4 and 33 0 38 0 for mue1 3 dataset s9 2 accordingly significant increases of sul1 ermb tetw and inti1 as quantified by qpcr were observed at d1 compared to us p 0 01 paired t test fig 2 fig s5 however the measured levels of these antibiotic resistance indicator genes rapidly decreased nearly to upstream levels over 2 5 and 2 km downstream distance d2 or d3 locations in vil and mue respectively the same dynamic was also observed for multi resistant bacteria fig 3 especially clr tet resistance smx tmp tet resistance was often below the limit of detection 5 0 cfu ml but clearly exceeded it in the d1 samples and was thus also higher there than further downstream from d2 on several processes may contribute to the observed decrease of resistance determinants including dilution by additional water inflows via groundwater and or tributary inputs biological deterioration e g cell death or dormancy due to exposure to sunlight lower ambient temperature predation etc and cell sedimentation 3 3 dilution effects strongly affect short distance dynamics of effluent resistance determinants to determine the importance of dilution effects we compared d p calculated over a short distance d1 to d2 for vil d1 to d3 for mue downstream of the wwtp discharge point d p d 1 2 for vil d p d 1 3 for mue from conservative chemical tracer concentrations e g sodium 4 5 methylbenzotriazole carbamazepine as well as arg and inti1 levels fig 4 the average d p d 1 2 o r 3 of the target antibiotic resistance indicator genes levels were always higher than for conservative tracers indicating possible removal mechanisms at play however according to the paired t test under the null hypothesis of no significant differences of dilution parameters between different pairs of bio and conservative indicators only the differences between sul1 and tetw versus sodium were significant at p 0 05 p adjusted using benjamini hochberg method fig 4 confirming non conservative behavior and additional removal mechanisms as d p d 1 2 o r 3 for sodium took up a large portion of the values for sul1 and tetw i e d p n a d 1 2 o r 3 0 72 0 92 d p s u l 1 d 1 2 o r 3 and 0 59 0 96 d p t e t w d 1 2 o r 3 the dilution effects quantified by sodium nonetheless explain the majority of the concentration decrease for these parameters this result implies that the observed rapid decrease in the downstream levels of wastewater origin resistance determinants immediately downstream of the wwtps was mainly governed by dilution in the studied systems dilution effects thus need to be carefully considered in studies of the environmental fate of resistance determinants and loadings instead of concentrations need to be determined to accurately assess environmental fate 3 4 additional source sink effects become apparent over longer downstream distances we hypothesized that additional source sink mechanisms affect the downstream behaviors of antibiotic resistance indicator genes over longer distances to analyze this in more detail the daily loading copies day for the target args and inti1 at the point of discharge as the sum of upstream and ef loadings and for short d2 for vil d3 for mue and far downstream distances d8 were calculated by multiplying resistance levels copies m3 with the discharge m3 day at each location and then compared the discharge was either obtained directly from nearby gauging stations or estimated under consideration of the ef discharge m3 day using sodium as an indicator and according to the equation derived under the mass conservation assumption eq 4 the downstream behaviors of the target antibiotic resistance indicator genes varied by indicator and also by sampling campaign for instance the load decrease from wastewater discharge us ef to the furthest downstream point d8 was pronounced and consistent for ermb and tetw in all the samplings fig 4b c the average load reduction was 81 17 for ermb and 70 15 for tetw over 13 7 km distance in vil1 4 95 5 for ermb and 96 2 for tetw over the 6 8 km distance in mue1 3 dataset s13 in contrast the downstream behavior of the sul1 loadings was inconsistent between sampling campaigns a pronounced decrease over distance 64 94 at d8 was seen in vil1 4 but little reduction over distance in mue1 2 7 and 29 at d8 and a strong increase in mue3 the downstream fate of inti1 was also variable for instance as inti1 loads did not decrease and in some instances even increased to further analyze if there is a break point where sul1 and inti1 start to deviate from conservative behavior we calculated the predicted levels of resistance determinants over the whole study distance considering dilution as a major driver using eq 3 dataset s8 the predictions based on three different conservative tracers are visualized for sul1 and inti1 in fig 2 in vil measured levels are always below predictions except for inti1 in vil2 for mue in contrast we see measured values exceeding predicted values in several instances for inti1 even for most downstream locations in mue3 where the pronounced increase of sul1 loading was observed between d5 and d8 the level of sul1 started to exceed predicted values between 5 6 8 km distance the concentration of inti1 increased also very rapidly between 5 6 8 km downstream distance in mue3 which indicates either a pronounced proliferation or a non point source of sul1 and inti1 in this stretch of the river we will discuss potential mechanisms e g biological drivers on site selection additional anthropogenic source input and surface sediment inputs in section 3 10 a number of mechanisms may contribute to the generally observed removal sedimentation especially of cell aggregates or flocs and cell death by predation uv light or various other environmental conditions unfavorable to wastewater bacteria with the available data we are not able to determine the contribution of various mechanisms future studies could investigate the persistence of resistant bacteria or molecular resistance markers in micro or mesocosm experiments or in a turbulent flow system mimicking natural streams to answer such questions modeling transport and sedimentation of wastewater origin particles using the information on particle size mass and flow characteristics could provide information on the importance of sedimentation 3 5 wwtp effluent affects the downstream riverine resistome to obtain a broader view of the river antibiotic resistome we retrieved the arg content of metagenomes obtained for selected sampling campaigns vil1 mue2 and mue3 overall 65 arg subtypes were identified 49 of them occurred in both upstream and downstream river samples dataset s7 the antibiotic resistome in the receiving water closest to the discharge point d1 was clearly influenced by the input from ef for instance a total 28 out of 36 arg subtypes found in d1 were also detected in ef b c f g in fig 5 a while 16 of these were not observed us b c in fig 5a the 16 ef derived resistance genes confer resistance to the following antibiotic classes 1 x aminoglycoside 4 x beta lactam antibiotics 1 x chloramphenicol 2 x macrolide 1 x quinolone 4 x tetracycline 3 subtypes were multidrug resistance genes of these 16 genes 14 were no longer detected in the far downstream 6 8 13 7 km downstream distance in mue and vil designated as d far in fig 5a this is in agreement with the results for qpcr enumeration of args and inti1 reported above and implies that the majority of args that occurred exclusively in ef do not persist at detectable levels for a long distance in rivers where significant amounts of additional water inflows and additional removal mechanisms are expected 3 6 diversity of the river resistome and microbiome along the river continuum we analyzed the alpha and beta diversity of river resistomes and microbiomes as another way to observe potential effects of the wwtp discharge and to see if the dynamics in the resistome are strongly correlated with the microbial community as noted e g for changes observed during wastewater treatment ju et al 2019 as expected shannon alpha diversity of args was higher in ef compared to us samples by 20 2 225 4 fig 5b accordingly the impact of the ef resistome was observed especially for vil1 and mue3 as an increase in arg diversity in river water at the d1 sites the arg alpha diversity decreased downstream in all sampling campaigns however for the microbial community as represented by amplicon sequence variants asvs alpha diversity was not consistently higher in ef versus us and consequently also did not change significantly from us to d1 and did not consistently decrease downstream fig 5b this indicates that the downstream dynamics of the overall microbial community and the antibiotic resistome were decoupled similar conclusions were obtained from beta diversity analysis procrustes analysis between microbial communities and antibiotic resistome fig 5c revealed a strong structural correlation between microbial communities and antibiotic resistome only when the most strongly effluent affected sites d1 were considered p 0 002 fig 5c when the d1 samples were excluded the correlation was barely significant p 0 04 fig 5d indicating that the structural correlation between microbial communities and resistome largely resulted from the impacts of wwtps on d1 the weak structural correlation in less impacted waters suggests a lack of strong drivers such as selective pressures or the influx of external arb 3 7 resistome analysis confirms effluent effect and abatement to quantitatively investigate the dynamics of the resistome along the river continuum in more detail the seven most prevalent arg subtypes that appeared in more than 9 out of 18 samples were chosen for detailed analysis we calculated the proportion of each gene in this set based on relative abundance gpm gene per million fig 6 a the proportions of each of six genes aph 3 i aph 6 i mext tetq aada and sul1 to the whole seven genes were lower in us than in ef and d1 fig 6a the baca gene in contrast comprised a larger proportion in us i e up to 83 in vil1 us d5 and d8 i e up to 93 in vil1 d8 than in ef and d1 it was therefore excluded from the plots of relative and cumulative abundance of the assembled arg in the metagenome in fig 6b and their individual and cumulative environmental level gene per liter in fig 6c both relative and absolute abundances showed a similar pattern the abundances of the selected arg were higher in ef and d1 compared to us fig 6b the abundances of those six genes decreased along the downstream locations except for sul1 in the far downstream location d8 in the mue3 campaign fig 6b this analysis confirmed a quantitative effect of the effluent on the abundance of prevalent resistance genes in the river resistome and suggests additional candidates for tracking anthropogenic sources of resistance in future studies aph 3 i aph 6 i mext tetq aada and sul1 that may be useful for tracking resistance determinants from wastewater several of these genes have been used as resistance indicators for environmental samples mainly in combination with culture dependent approaches rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 but much less frequently with culture independent approaches rizzo et al 2013 sharma et al 2016 3 8 contig analysis indicates arg co location we hypothesized that the similar dynamics of some args could derive from their co location in the same host or presence on the same genetic elements so we analyzed their loci within the contigs aph 3 i and aph 6 i were indeed found to be located on the same contig in many samples from vil1 ef d1 d2 and d5 fig 7 a which may explain the strongly similar dynamics between aph 3 i and aph 6 i gpm in vil1 with r2 0 98 p 0 001 fig 6b another case of co location between args was observed between sul1 and aada the contigs containing those two genes were found in d1 in vil1 and ef in mue3 fig s13c fig 7b unlike aph 3 i and aph 6 i in vil1 however the dynamics of sul1 was not similar to that of aada especially in d5 and d8 in mue3 where high abundance of sul1 was observed while no aada was assembled fig 6b in agreement with this observation the sul1 containing contigs retrieved from d5 and d8 in mue3 did not contain aada and this was the only type that was identified in those samples fig 7b this indicates a significant shift of the bacterial populations that yielded sul1 containing contigs between d1 and d3 in mue3 with wastewater derived contigs containing sul1 aada pairs not persisting 3 9 baca an arg with high natural prevalence in environmental bacteria unlike the other prevalent genes the proportion of baca also known as uppp undecaprenyl diphosphate or pyrophosphate phosphatase was greatest in us samples and was also abundant in many downstream locations except d5 and d8 in mue3 where sul1 occupied the largest proportion fig 6a in order to further assess whether baca was intrinsic in our river water samples we identified potential hosts by assigning taxonomy to the metagenome assembled contigs using a combination of methods the contigs for which all three methods agreed at the genus level are shown in table 1 the four genera identified as potential hosts of baca contigs derived from less disturbed freshwater samples us d2 d5 d8 were pseudomonas acidovorax limnohabitans and aeromonas among them pseudomonas acidovorax and limnohabitans are typical inhabitants of freshwater and soil environments peix et al 2009 willems 2014 however considering that the proportions of baca in the contigs to the total baca in the sample in terms of reads per kilobase rpk were low for river water samples except for d8 in mue3 we assume that homologues of baca could be present in many other environmental bacteria thus our data suggests that baca is probably unsuited for tracking anthropogenic sources of antibiotic resistance 3 10 exploring the potential reasons for rapid increase of sul1 in far downstream locations in mue3 both qpcr based and metegenomic analysis confirmed that sul1 and inti1 increased in the downstream of mue and especially strongly in one of the sampling campaigns i e mue3 between 5 0 6 8 km downstream distance fig 2b 6 to figure out if there was a biological driver for this unexpected increase of sul1 and inti1 we first characterized the sul1 containing contigs the sul1 gene is known to be highly mobilized and is often associated with inti1 gillings et al 2008 gillings et al 2015 indeed all contigs containing sul1 associated with inti1 retrieved from the river d3 8 were homologs of a single dominant type that appeared to be also plasmid associated as it contained the plasmid associated gene para davis et al 1992 we could unsurprisingly not obtain a meaningful taxonomic assignment for these sequences it could thus not be demonstrated whether the downstream increase in mue3 was due to an increase in an ef derived or an environmental organism or from a local contamination source further information could be obtained in future studies by isolation or construction of metagenome assembled genomes we therefore turned to chemical indicators to further study the potential for local or non point sources of contamination as an explanation to evaluate non point source inputs of pollutants we chose to evaluate a few micropollutants that may serve as indicators of contamination sulfamethazine also known as sulfadimidine is used in pig husbandry stoob et al 2007 and mecoprop is a weed control agent used primarily in urban settings in switzerland wittmer et al 2010 it was assumed that the levels of these pollutants in downstream locations would increase or be persistently high if a pronounced agricultural or urban surface runoff existed which could accompany resistance genes and bacteria potentially existing in agricultural or urban areas in vil sulfamethazine was below detection lod 0 8 ng l in all samples except one us sample while in mue there appeared to be a source in wwtp effluent especially during the mue3 campaign but the compound was not observed to increase in downstream locations the concentrations and downstream dynamics of mecoprop varied between campaigns fig s8 for vil1 3 and mue1 and mue3 mecoprop concentrations were low 60 ng l while there seemed to be a strong effluent associated input for mue2 and concentrations remained high further downstream 200 ng l a slight increase in the downstream range 5km observed in mue2 and between 1 0 2 0 km in mue3 may be due to fluctuating input of mecoprop from the wwtp effluent concentrations did not further increase in the far downstream locations d8 where the sudden increase of sul1 and inti1 was observed fig s8 based on these but also the other analyzed micropopllutants we found no evidence for significant downstream contamination sources however these chemical indicators are not conclusive as the analyzed compounds were not a comprehensive selection to trace non point sources in the downstream river section e g from manure or pesticide applications although these are not very likely under dry weather conditions so while we found no evidence for such contamination we can also not conclusively rule them out as an explanation for the marked sul1 and inti1 increase observed for mue3 finally the potential for in situ resistance selection in the water was assessed using the concentration of antibiotics and metals in downstream locations in mue3 sulfamethoxazole and its derivative n4 acetylsulfamethoxazole were the antibiotics with the highest concentration among all the antibiotics analyzed but downstream concentration sulfamethoxazole in the range of 33 to 95 ng l in mue3 remained far below the published pnec for resistance selection e g 16 000 ng l bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the concentration of trimethoprim which is usually prescribed together with sulfamethoxazole was also much lower than its pnec for resistance selection e g 500 ng l bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 even though the vast majority of metals analyzed in this study remained below the limit of quantification or below their estimated minimum co selective concentrations for dissolved metals in water mccwaterdc the concentrations of two metals i e copper and nickel were higher than their mccwaterdc 1 5 µg l for cu and 0 29 µg l for ni seiler and berendonk 2012 however mccwaterdc is a predictive value and actual selective levels could be higher also their levels in far downstream locations d8 in mue3 were not specifically higher than at other locations within the same sampling campaign nor at the same locations than in other samplings where the increase of sul1 or inti1 was less pronounced dataset s12 furthermore we did not observe co localization between sul1 and any other genes potentially conferring cu ni or any other metal resistance based on contig based co localization search in mue fig 7b overall no convincing evidence for in situ resistance co selection by cu and ni as an explanation for the downstream increase of sul1 and inti1 was found we further note that the estimated river retention time per km was relatively short i e 51 4 and 49 5 mins km for vil and mue respectively dataset s4 which makes the likelihood of in situ resistance selection in the water even less plausible as a final possible explanation we considered the possibility of cell migration from other river compartments to the water according to qpcr enumeration of args and inti1 in surface sediments we did not observe the increase of sul1 and inti1 levels in d5 and d8 in mue3 in terms of either absolute and relative abundance fig s6 furthermore the relative abundance of sul1 and inti1 in sediment was generally similar to or lower than the values for water in mue1 3 fig s7 if sediment resuspension was a major source for aquatic sul1 and inti1 elevation in mue3 d8 relative abundances of sul1 and inti1 in water samples would be expected to remain unchanged or to drop while we could not completely exclude the possibility of contribution of sediment resuspension we assume that there could be other sources e g stream biofilms where sul1 and inti1 were selectively enriched in terms of both absolute and relative abundance considering the downstream levels of both resistance determinants and nutrients remained relatively high in mue due to high ef inputs and low downstream dilution effects especially in the third campaign fig s5 dataset s9 in system growth is also a plausible hypothesis the reason for and the nature of the striking increase of sul1 and inti1 but not of tetw ermb blactx during the mue3 campaign thus remains open and would require further study to resolve what the observation shows unambiguously is that unexpected and perhaps not directly anthropogenic contamination driven increases of args are possible as in particular sul1 and inti1 are commonly applied for tracking anthropogenic sources of arg in the environment berendonk et al 2015 gillings et al 2015 we caution that monitoring strategies should employ a multi target strategy to be robust 4 conclusions downstream levels of antibiotic resistance determinants decreased rapidly over 2 0 2 5 km distance due to dilution effects and decay over longer distance due to other removal mechanisms this would suggest that public exposure to wastewater origin antibiotic resistance might be most acute only over short distances few kilometers from points of discharge especially if a pronounced input of additional water inflows exists we also observed at least one instance where sul1 and inti1 dynamically increased in the river without being able to establish any link to a local anthropogenic contamination other river compartments where in system growth of biomass could take place i e stream biofilms could be included as a monitoring target in future studies metagenomics based resistome analysis yielded consistent conclusions with qpcr analysis of select targets e g sul1 and also identified promising targets for future monitoring of anthropogenic sources of antibiotic resistance e g aph 3 i aph 6 i mext tetq and aada in general metagenomics qpcr and cultivation based assays yielded consistent trends public health advice could be based on quantifying indicator genes or technically simpler cultivation based indicators a weak structural correlation between resistome and microbiome and low levels of co selective agents revealed a lack of driving forces in less disturbed river waters downstream over 3 km distance plus upstream locations we showed that contig based taxonomic assignment and analysis of the genetic neighborhood of assembled arg can reveal important if limited additional information about shifts in arg host identities mobilization and co localisation of arg that would otherwise remain hidden data availability the raw sequencing data both for metagenome and 16s rrna amplicon sequencing are available at the european nucleotide archive

17021,chromium contaminated groundwater has drawn extensive attention due to its high toxicity and wide application although bioremediation is considered to be an effective approach for cr vi removal a better method is still urgently needed in this study corncob guided cr vi reduction achieved the highest removal efficiency due to the highest amount of total carbon and available carbon emissions after verifying the sustainability and operational feasibility of this approach the broad spectrum applicability of corncob to guide cr vi bioreduction was further explored under various operating conditions in addition it suggested that the carrier effect nutrient element release and electron shuttle effect were the main mechanisms enhancing the reduction process with approximate contribution rates of 12 5 7 5 and 75 respectively microbiological analysis demonstrated that the addition of solid phase carbon sources increased the abundance of microbes related to carbon metabolism and promoted the expression of glycolytic metabolic pathway furthermore the addition of corncob led to an elevation of expression level of the electron transport pathway which is consistent with the function of the electron shuttle this study provides theoretical and technical support for the practical application of corncob mediated cr vi bioreduction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cr vi reduction solid phase carbon source corncob bioremediation enhancement electron shuttle 1 introduction the extensive use of chromium in industry has caused serious environmental contamination however chromium and its compounds are indispensable raw materials for metallurgy tanning electroplating textile and other industries due to their special chemical properties duan et al 2018 li et al 2018 furthermore as one of the most stable chromium species in nature hexavalent chromium cr vi is highly toxic exhibiting both mutagenic and carcinogenic properties and highly mobile jiang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 therefore cr vi poses a great threat to human health long term exposure to the liver kidney lung and respiratory tract causes great damage and may even lead to cancer pradhan et al 2017 zang et al 2017 cr vi has been listed as a priority pollutant in china and many other countries with a maximum acceptable cr vi concentration in drinking water of 0 05 mg l in china long et al 2013 abbasi and mulligan 2014 as the understanding of chromium hazards deepens and the government puts more emphasis on addressing environmental pollution the treatment of chromium pollution in water has gradually gained more attention as the most stable chromium species trivalent chromium cr iii is an essential micronutrient for biological growth and metabolism furthermore the toxicity of cr iii is 1 100 that of cr vi with low mobility in neutral and alkaline conditions lai et al 2016 luo et al 2019 therefore the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is considered to be a feasible method to control chromium contamination lv et al 2018 bharagava and mishra 2018 due to the complex coupling of biogeochemical processes in groundwater the heterogeneity of groundwater medium operational difficulties and the possibility of slow contaminant release by crystallization it is difficult to completely remove these unwanted chemicals and reduction products using traditional physical or chemical methods he et al 2011 hora and shetty 2015 biological reduction is considered an effective method to remediate chromium contamination in groundwater karthik et al 2017 owing to a wide range of advantages such as its cost effectiveness environmental friendliness and the coupling effect of multiple microorganisms on permineralization desai et al 2009 he et al 2018 luo et al 2020 however there are still some problems facing the practical application of cr vi bioreduction especially within the oligotrophic groundwater environment where the demand for nutrient sources and the risk of secondary contamination remain pressing issues liu et al 2019a kathiravan et al 2010 therefore solid phase nutrient sources have been extensively studied and applied to microbial reduction because of their economic and practical utility ahmad et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 accordingly solid phase carbon sources have been the most studied because they can provide carbon and electron donors for heterotrophic microorganisms both of which are essential components for microbial growth and metabolism tangsir et al 2017 feng et al 2017 rachel et al 2006 in recent decades natural cellulosic materials such as corncob dong et al 2019 woodchips hua et al 2016 straw cameron and schipper 2010 and organic polymeric materials including polycaprolactone pcl chu and wang 2013 and polylactic acid pla xu and chai 2017 have been developed for microbial remediation thereinto natural cellulosic materials mainly agricultural waste are most popular because of their high cost effectiveness extensive availability and waste utilization benefit feng et al 2017 yang et al 2015 however most studies focused on the carbon release ability of solid phase carbon sources and their effects on the reaction performance wang and chu 2016 on the contrary few researches have explored the multiple roles of solid phase carbon sources in the reduction process and their respective contributions to the reaction enhancement meanwhile the application of solid phase carbon sources in bioreduction of highly toxic cr vi was limited in this study the screened solid phase carbon source corncob guiding cr vi reduction was conducted after screening of several solid phase carbon sources subsequent batch experiments were conducted to verify the sustainability and operational feasibility of the selected carbon source corncob and its reaction characteristics were studied under various operating conditions the mechanisms by which corncob enhances cr vi bioreduction were studied from the perspective of the carrier effect nutrient element release and electron shuttle effect with their respective contribution rates calculated via univariate experiments variations in the microbial community dominant species and functional genes were analyzed and cross validated according to the above speculative mechanisms results of this study provide new insights and relevant theoretical support for the mechanism of solid phase carbon source enhanced cr vi contamination remediation of groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 acclimation of bacteria a mixed bacterial consortium was first extracted from cr vi contaminated soil at an electroplating plant in weihai shandong province china and then further acclimated and enriched in this study cultivation was performed in acetate minimal medium amm

during the domestication stage until a stable cr vi removal efficiency was achieved all of the chemicals used in this research were of acs reagent grade 2 2 screening of solid carbon source corncob maize straw wheat straw and peanut shell screened using 100 mesh were used as solid phase carbon sources to guide cr vi reduction a liquid phase carbon source sodium acetate was used as a control during the reaction process the cr vi concentration was measured with a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa and the ph was determined with a ph meter seven multi s40 mettler toledo switzerland three

germany volatile fatty acids vfas gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu japan were used to gage the effects of the four solid phase carbon sources on cr vi reduction subsequently sequential batch experiments were performed with the selected solid phase carbon source to monitor the chromium concentration and three dimensional fluorescence during the reaction and to verify the feasibility of its practical application 2 3 impact of operating conditions the impacts of initial ph 5 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 11 0 and initial cr vi concentrations 2 0 5 0 10 0 20 0 50 0 mg l were evaluated in the solid phase carbon source system sc 0 5 g corncob and the liquid phase carbon source system lc at 30 c and 150 r min the cr vi reduction rate expressed by the first order kinetic constant and the distribution of different carbon forms measured by 3deem under various conditions were calculated and analyzed 2 4 enhancement mechanism of corncob the carrier effect nutrient element release and electron shuttle effect were speculated to be the cr vi bioreduction enhancement mechanisms of corncob firstly corncob 0 5 g was used as the carbon source to participate in the cr vi bioreduction process and corncob extract was used as a control to verify the effect of carrier effect the corncob extract was obtained by first cultivating bacteria with 0 5 g corncob in 100 ml amm medium for 3 d and then collecting the supernatant after centrifugation 6000 g 20 min of the culture four consecutive batch experiments were conducted to deplete the readily available components in the corncob extract for the follow up experiments secondly the nutrient elements released from the corncob were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icap6000 thermo usa then the electrochemical characteristics of the corncob were measured to clarify the function of the electron shuttle accordingly the cyclic voltammetry curves cv and current time i t responses were detected at room temperature using an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua co ltd shanghai china using a conventional three electrode cell with a graphite rod for the working electrode a platinum wire for the counter electrode and ag agcl for the reference electrode cv measurements were performed at a scan rate of 0 1 v s in the potential range from 0 6 to 0 8 v vs ag agcl with 0 1 mol l kcl as the supporting electrolyte the capacity of the electron acceptor eac and donor edc was examined by i t responses in which the corncob was reduced at a potential of 0 49 v and reoxidized at a potential of 0 61 v vs ag agcl moreover fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir vertex 70 v bruker germany and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo usa of the carbon and oxygen elements were conducted for further mechanism analysis finally to calculate the respective contribution rates of the above three effects five groups of experiments were simultaneously performed namely 1 a liquid carbon system lc 2 a corncob system 3 a system with liquid carbon and nutrient elements lc nutrient element formulated with their sulfate compounds according to table s1 4 a corncob extract system and 5 a system containing corncob extract after 4 cycles supplied with liquid carbon lc ha 2 5 microbial analysis for better contrast microbial samples of liquid carbon system corncob system and peanut shell system were collected for the metagenomic analysis the genomic dna of each sample was qualified using a nanodrop2000 thermo fisher scientific and a qubit fluorometer thermo fisher scientific total genomic dna was then used to construct libraries for paired end illumina hiseq 2500 sequencing by bgi raw data were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database under accession numbers of srr12705453 srr12705455 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of solid carbon sources corncob maize straw wheat straw and peanut shell were chosen to screen for the best solid phase carbon source to guide cr vi bioreduction with liquid phase carbon source lc system as the control fig 1 the reduction efficiency of the corncob system was the significantly p 0 05 higher than the other systems fig 1a the first order kinetic constant k of the corncob system was 1 1 d 1 while that of the peanut shell maize straw lc and wheat straw systems was 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 3 d 1 respectively in addition the corncob system exhibited the fastest decrease in ph and achieved the lowest ph fig 1b which may be attributed to the higher fermentation rate and degree of corncob thereby resulting in the highest reduction efficiency the distributions of different types of carbon fig 1c were calculated using the 3deem spectra fig s1 and toc data in the 3deem spectra regions i and ii represent aromatic proteins region iii represents fulvic acid like substances region iv represents soluble microbial products and region v represents humic acid like substances regions i ii and iv are classified as easy to use carbons while regions iii and v are considered difficult to use carbons the results clearly illustrate that the content of toc and easy to use carbon in corncob leachate was the highest followed by peanut shell which is consistent with the reduction efficiency and ph variation the vfas results of the four kinds of solid phase carbon further revealed that the corncob leachate possessed the highest total vfas content which was mainly composed of small molecular acids and can be easily utilized by microorganisms lu et al 2020 which was also corresponding to the above results thus compared with the other solid phase carbon sources corncob released the highest contents of total carbon and easy to use carbon which can provide microorganisms with a greater amount and more available carbon and electron donors thereby facilitating cr vi reduction next the sequential batch experiment with corncob was conducted over 10 cycles to demonstrate the sustainability and feasibility of corncob as a solid phase carbon source fig 2 the reduction efficiency of cr vi did not decrease after the 10 cycle reaction furthermore the first order kinetic constant increased from 1 1 to 1 2 d 1 from the 1st to the 10th cycle fig 2a which may be related to the adaptation of microorganisms to the environment additionally the toc of the reaction decreased within a reasonable range with an approximately uniform reduction of all carbon types fig 2b 3 2 impacts of operation conditions to investigate the broad applicability of corncob the effects of different operation conditions on cr vi bioreduction were investigated cr vi reduction in the corncob system sc exhibited significant enhancement p 0 05 under all experimental ph conditions relative to the liquid phase carbon system lc fig s2a b with the first order kinetic constant k increasing 2 2 3 1 2 6 2 7 and 3 4 times at ph 5 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 and 11 0 respectively fig 3 a the trend in ph was basically the same in the two systems with a lower ph obtained in the sc system which was assumed to be caused by the fermentation of corncob fig s2c d the distribution of different carbon types revealed that ph had little effect on the total amount and kind of carbon sources fig 3b at all experimental initial cr vi concentrations a higher cr vi reduction rate was observed in the sc system when compared to the lc system fig s3a b with the k value 2 2 2 6 3 9 3 7 and 1 2 p 0 05 times higher than lc at initial cr vi concentrations of 2 5 10 20 and 50 mg l respectively fig 3c because of the acids produced during fermentation fig s3c d the ph of the sc system was still slightly lower than that of the lc system additionally the distribution characteristics of different carbon types indicated that the toc decreased with increasing initial cr vi concentrations fig 3d this may be related to the toxicity of cr vi to microorganisms leading to a lower dissolution of corncob when the initial concentration was greater than 10 mg l it was consistent with the strengthening effect of corncob decreased with the increase of the initial concentration of cr vi 3 3 enhancement mechanism by corncob the enhancement mechanism of corncob was deduced via the three main aspects carrier effect nutrient element release and electron shuttle effect humic acid to verify the carrier effect cr vi bioreduction guided by corncob and corncob extract were conducted over 4 cycle sequential batch experiments during the first 2 cycles the corncob system achieved a higher reduction efficiency than that of the corncob extract system with average k values of 1 6 and 1 3 d 1 respectively fig s4a which was attributed to the carrier effect of corncob it has been reported that the corncob surface has a regular honeycomb structure with a large specific surface area dong et al 2019 which is conducive to the attachment of microorganisms up to the 3rd cycle the reduction capacity of the corncob extract system decreased significantly due to the lack of carbon source which is illustrated in fig s4b it has been suggested that humic acid like substances are the main carbon type in the corncob extract system during the 3rd stage therefore when the liquid carbon source is added to the reactor the 4th stage can be regarded as a system of liquid carbon source and humic acid like substances which can achieve a cr vi reduction efficiency of 1 1 d 1 k value due to the effect of humic acid like substances when considering the k value of 0 3 d 1 in the pure liquid carbon source system the results indicate that humic acid like substances play an important role in the corncob enhancement which has been reported to have electron shuttle capability zhou et al 2015 the nutrients in the corncob extract was detected for nutrient element effect verification as shown in table s1 a certain amount of nutrient elements were detected in the corncob extract which was beneficial for improving microbial activity and thus bioreduction of cr vi this has also been observed for other natural cellulosic materials guiding bioreduction systems liang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 next the effectiveness of the electron shuttle was verified through various techniques firstly the redox behavior was determined by electrochemical analysis fig 4 compared with deionized water obvious oxidation and reduction peaks were observed on the cv curves of corncob extract at 0 23 0 05 v and humic acid ha extract at 0 29 0 09 v fig 4a which demonstrates that corncob had redox capacity the peak separation value δep epa epc of corncob was larger than the theoretical value of 59 n mv where n is the number of electrons transferred indicating that redox was a multi electron transfer process a typical i t response of the electron acceptor and donator was observed by successive addition of corncob extract 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 ml while the amount of electron transfer in both the oxidation and reduction reactions was linearly proportional to the mass of corncob fig 4b this demonstrates that the corncob extract was directly involved in electron transfer furthermore variations of corncob composition and structure were investigated by ftir and xps respectively before and after the reaction fig s5 as shown in fig s5a the wide band at 3326 cm 1 was assigned to oh stretching which may be due to residual moisture in the sample the band observed at 2925 cm 1 was ch stretching the band at 1650 cm 1 belonged to aromatic carboxyl carbonyl c o or quinone groups and the band at 1543 cm 1 was assigned to c c stretching zhang et al 2019 the bands at 1043 and 575 cm 1 represented co and cc stretching respectively after the reduction of cr vi the band intensities of c c and c o decreased while the band strengths of co and cc increased which indicates that there was a decrease in humic substances or quinone in the corncob after the reaction the xps results fig s5b e show that the element content of c in corncob decreased while the content of o increased after the reaction resulting in an higher o c ratio that is associated with greater hydrophilia zhang et al 2019 which favors of the dissolution of corncob and cr vi bioreduction it was also observed that the functional groups of c c and c o decreased after the reduction while the functional group of co increased which is consistent with the ftir results thereby suggests that the humic substances or quinones in the corncob participated in the reaction taken together these results indicate that the corncob possessed an electrons transfer capacity making it possible to act as an electron shuttle during the bioreduction process of chromium next the contribution rates of the three investigated mechanisms carrier nutrient element and electron shuttle were approximately calculated using 5 groups of batch experiments fig 5 p 0 05 and their k values are shown in table s2 based on the k value it was calculated that the enhancement effect of nutrient elements accounted for 7 5 the carrier effect made up for 12 5 and the electron shuttle effect represented 75 which is consistent with the above inference that the electron shuttle effect plays an important role in enhancement by corncob furthermore the sum of these three enhancement effects is 95 indicating that these three effects are the main mechanisms of cr vi bioreduction guided by corncob 3 4 microbial analysis in order to further analyze the strengthening mechanism of corncob from microbial and genetic perspectives metagenomic analysis was conducted for cr vi bioreduction mediated by the liquid carbon source corncob and peanut shell the diversity and richness of the microbial community in the corncob and peanut shell systems were significantly higher than those in the lc system fig s6 which indicates that the addition of the solid phase carbon source is beneficial to the microorganisms at the class level betaproteobacteria was dominant in all three systems with proportions of 79 9 55 3 and 45 1 in the lc corncob and peanut shell systems respectively fig 6 a while the corncob system exhibited a higher abundance of sphingobacteriia 13 2 and the peanut shell system showed higher levels of flavobacteriia 27 0 which are both related to the fermentation of natural cellulose carbon sources smith et al 2019 liu et al 2019b at the genus level differences among the three systems were more significant fig 6b the lc system was enriched with alcaligenes 31 9 and kerstersia 14 5 the corncob system was dominated by burkholderiaceae 42 0 and sphingobacterium 12 6 and the peanut shell system was dominated by comamonas 16 9 and chryseobacterium 13 0 which are associated with the requirement for specific microbial degradation of solid phase carbon sources madhaiyan et al 2020 li et al 2019 yu et al 2018 there were more fermentative microorganisms in the peanut shell system which indicates that this carbon source is more difficult to be directly used by microorganisms leading to a lower abundance of cr vi reducing bacteria and a lower cr vi reduction efficiency than the corncob system then specific metabolic pathways for carbon assimilation were examined genes related to glycolysis in the corncob and peanut shell systems exhibited higher relative abundances when compared with the lc system fig s7 this indicates that the carbon released by corncob and peanut shell could be utilized by microorganisms to gain more energy for microbial growth and cr vi reduction in addition the corncob and peanut shell systems exhibited slightly different approaches to promote glycolysis with the promotion ability of the corncob system higher than that of the peanut shell system fig s8 demonstrating that different carbon components may play different roles in the metabolic pathways based on the above experiment it was speculated that the electron shuttle effect is the key to the corncob strengthening mechanism therefore the electron transport chain metabolic pathway was further analyzed as shown in fig 6c the corncob and peanut shell systems exhibited significantly higher abundances of genes associated with the electron transport chain which is conducive to the transfer of electrons this agrees with the results of the above studies on the role of electron shuttles there are five complexes in the electron transport chain of anaerobic microorganisms nolfi donegan et al 2020 the addition of corncob promoted the expression of almost all components of electron transport chain fig s9a while the peanut shell only promoted one part fig s9b this could be because of the increased relative abundance of genes related to quinone production such as menaquinone and phylloquinol by corncob fig s10 and the different components released by the corncob and peanut shell may act as cofactors for oxidoreductase in the electron transport chain therefore the corncob system obtained more energy for cr vi reduction which is consistent with the above conclusions 4 conclusions in this research the efficiency of cr vi bioreduction using corncob was the highest when compared to other tested solid phase carbon sources due to the higher release of total carbon and easy to use carbon the sustainability and operational feasibility of corncob guided cr vi reduction were verified thereby supporting broad applicability the main mechanisms of reduction enhancement by corncob was inferred as the carrier effect nutrient element release and electron shuttle effect which were estimated to account for 12 5 7 5 and 75 respectively enhanced carbon metabolism related microorganisms as well as glycolytic and electron transport chain metabolic pathways were observed

17021,chromium contaminated groundwater has drawn extensive attention due to its high toxicity and wide application although bioremediation is considered to be an effective approach for cr vi removal a better method is still urgently needed in this study corncob guided cr vi reduction achieved the highest removal efficiency due to the highest amount of total carbon and available carbon emissions after verifying the sustainability and operational feasibility of this approach the broad spectrum applicability of corncob to guide cr vi bioreduction was further explored under various operating conditions in addition it suggested that the carrier effect nutrient element release and electron shuttle effect were the main mechanisms enhancing the reduction process with approximate contribution rates of 12 5 7 5 and 75 respectively microbiological analysis demonstrated that the addition of solid phase carbon sources increased the abundance of microbes related to carbon metabolism and promoted the expression of glycolytic metabolic pathway furthermore the addition of corncob led to an elevation of expression level of the electron transport pathway which is consistent with the function of the electron shuttle this study provides theoretical and technical support for the practical application of corncob mediated cr vi bioreduction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cr vi reduction solid phase carbon source corncob bioremediation enhancement electron shuttle 1 introduction the extensive use of chromium in industry has caused serious environmental contamination however chromium and its compounds are indispensable raw materials for metallurgy tanning electroplating textile and other industries due to their special chemical properties duan et al 2018 li et al 2018 furthermore as one of the most stable chromium species in nature hexavalent chromium cr vi is highly toxic exhibiting both mutagenic and carcinogenic properties and highly mobile jiang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 therefore cr vi poses a great threat to human health long term exposure to the liver kidney lung and respiratory tract causes great damage and may even lead to cancer pradhan et al 2017 zang et al 2017 cr vi has been listed as a priority pollutant in china and many other countries with a maximum acceptable cr vi concentration in drinking water of 0 05 mg l in china long et al 2013 abbasi and mulligan 2014 as the understanding of chromium hazards deepens and the government puts more emphasis on addressing environmental pollution the treatment of chromium pollution in water has gradually gained more attention as the most stable chromium species trivalent chromium cr iii is an essential micronutrient for biological growth and metabolism furthermore the toxicity of cr iii is 1 100 that of cr vi with low mobility in neutral and alkaline conditions lai et al 2016 luo et al 2019 therefore the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is considered to be a feasible method to control chromium contamination lv et al 2018 bharagava and mishra 2018 due to the complex coupling of biogeochemical processes in groundwater the heterogeneity of groundwater medium operational difficulties and the possibility of slow contaminant release by crystallization it is difficult to completely remove these unwanted chemicals and reduction products using traditional physical or chemical methods he et al 2011 hora and shetty 2015 biological reduction is considered an effective method to remediate chromium contamination in groundwater karthik et al 2017 owing to a wide range of advantages such as its cost effectiveness environmental friendliness and the coupling effect of multiple microorganisms on permineralization desai et al 2009 he et al 2018 luo et al 2020 however there are still some problems facing the practical application of cr vi bioreduction especially within the oligotrophic groundwater environment where the demand for nutrient sources and the risk of secondary contamination remain pressing issues liu et al 2019a kathiravan et al 2010 therefore solid phase nutrient sources have been extensively studied and applied to microbial reduction because of their economic and practical utility ahmad et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 accordingly solid phase carbon sources have been the most studied because they can provide carbon and electron donors for heterotrophic microorganisms both of which are essential components for microbial growth and metabolism tangsir et al 2017 feng et al 2017 rachel et al 2006 in recent decades natural cellulosic materials such as corncob dong et al 2019 woodchips hua et al 2016 straw cameron and schipper 2010 and organic polymeric materials including polycaprolactone pcl chu and wang 2013 and polylactic acid pla xu and chai 2017 have been developed for microbial remediation thereinto natural cellulosic materials mainly agricultural waste are most popular because of their high cost effectiveness extensive availability and waste utilization benefit feng et al 2017 yang et al 2015 however most studies focused on the carbon release ability of solid phase carbon sources and their effects on the reaction performance wang and chu 2016 on the contrary few researches have explored the multiple roles of solid phase carbon sources in the reduction process and their respective contributions to the reaction enhancement meanwhile the application of solid phase carbon sources in bioreduction of highly toxic cr vi was limited in this study the screened solid phase carbon source corncob guiding cr vi reduction was conducted after screening of several solid phase carbon sources subsequent batch experiments were conducted to verify the sustainability and operational feasibility of the selected carbon source corncob and its reaction characteristics were studied under various operating conditions the mechanisms by which corncob enhances cr vi bioreduction were studied from the perspective of the carrier effect nutrient element release and electron shuttle effect with their respective contribution rates calculated via univariate experiments variations in the microbial community dominant species and functional genes were analyzed and cross validated according to the above speculative mechanisms results of this study provide new insights and relevant theoretical support for the mechanism of solid phase carbon source enhanced cr vi contamination remediation of groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 acclimation of bacteria a mixed bacterial consortium was first extracted from cr vi contaminated soil at an electroplating plant in weihai shandong province china and then further acclimated and enriched in this study cultivation was performed in acetate minimal medium amm

during the domestication stage until a stable cr vi removal efficiency was achieved all of the chemicals used in this research were of acs reagent grade 2 2 screening of solid carbon source corncob maize straw wheat straw and peanut shell screened using 100 mesh were used as solid phase carbon sources to guide cr vi reduction a liquid phase carbon source sodium acetate was used as a control during the reaction process the cr vi concentration was measured with a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa and the ph was determined with a ph meter seven multi s40 mettler toledo switzerland three

experiments were performed with the selected solid phase carbon source to monitor the chromium concentration and three dimensional fluorescence during the reaction and to verify the feasibility of its practical application 2 3 impact of operating conditions the impacts of initial ph 5 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 11 0 and initial cr vi concentrations 2 0 5 0 10 0 20 0 50 0 mg l were evaluated in the solid phase carbon source system sc 0 5 g corncob and the liquid phase carbon source system lc at 30 c and 150 r min the cr vi reduction rate expressed by the first order kinetic constant and the distribution of different carbon forms measured by 3deem under various conditions were calculated and analyzed 2 4 enhancement mechanism of corncob the carrier effect nutrient element release and electron shuttle effect were speculated to be the cr vi bioreduction enhancement mechanisms of corncob firstly corncob 0 5 g was used as the carbon source to participate in the cr vi bioreduction process and corncob extract was used as a control to verify the effect of carrier effect the corncob extract was obtained by first cultivating bacteria with 0 5 g corncob in 100 ml amm medium for 3 d and then collecting the supernatant after centrifugation 6000 g 20 min of the culture four consecutive batch experiments were conducted to deplete the readily available components in the corncob extract for the follow up experiments secondly the nutrient elements released from the corncob were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icap6000 thermo usa then the electrochemical characteristics of the corncob were measured to clarify the function of the electron shuttle accordingly the cyclic voltammetry curves cv and current time i t responses were detected at room temperature using an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua co ltd shanghai china using a conventional three electrode cell with a graphite rod for the working electrode a platinum wire for the counter electrode and ag agcl for the reference electrode cv measurements were performed at a scan rate of 0 1 v s in the potential range from 0 6 to 0 8 v vs ag agcl with 0 1 mol l kcl as the supporting electrolyte the capacity of the electron acceptor eac and donor edc was examined by i t responses in which the corncob was reduced at a potential of 0 49 v and reoxidized at a potential of 0 61 v vs ag agcl moreover fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir vertex 70 v bruker germany and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo usa of the carbon and oxygen elements were conducted for further mechanism analysis finally to calculate the respective contribution rates of the above three effects five groups of experiments were simultaneously performed namely 1 a liquid carbon system lc 2 a corncob system 3 a system with liquid carbon and nutrient elements lc nutrient element formulated with their sulfate compounds according to table s1 4 a corncob extract system and 5 a system containing corncob extract after 4 cycles supplied with liquid carbon lc ha 2 5 microbial analysis for better contrast microbial samples of liquid carbon system corncob system and peanut shell system were collected for the metagenomic analysis the genomic dna of each sample was qualified using a nanodrop2000 thermo fisher scientific and a qubit fluorometer thermo fisher scientific total genomic dna was then used to construct libraries for paired end illumina hiseq 2500 sequencing by bgi raw data were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database under accession numbers of srr12705453 srr12705455 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of solid carbon sources corncob maize straw wheat straw and peanut shell were chosen to screen for the best solid phase carbon source to guide cr vi bioreduction with liquid phase carbon source lc system as the control fig 1 the reduction efficiency of the corncob system was the significantly p 0 05 higher than the other systems fig 1a the first order kinetic constant k of the corncob system was 1 1 d 1 while that of the peanut shell maize straw lc and wheat straw systems was 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 3 d 1 respectively in addition the corncob system exhibited the fastest decrease in ph and achieved the lowest ph fig 1b which may be attributed to the higher fermentation rate and degree of corncob thereby resulting in the highest reduction efficiency the distributions of different types of carbon fig 1c were calculated using the 3deem spectra fig s1 and toc data in the 3deem spectra regions i and ii represent aromatic proteins region iii represents fulvic acid like substances region iv represents soluble microbial products and region v represents humic acid like substances regions i ii and iv are classified as easy to use carbons while regions iii and v are considered difficult to use carbons the results clearly illustrate that the content of toc and easy to use carbon in corncob leachate was the highest followed by peanut shell which is consistent with the reduction efficiency and ph variation the vfas results of the four kinds of solid phase carbon further revealed that the corncob leachate possessed the highest total vfas content which was mainly composed of small molecular acids and can be easily utilized by microorganisms lu et al 2020 which was also corresponding to the above results thus compared with the other solid phase carbon sources corncob released the highest contents of total carbon and easy to use carbon which can provide microorganisms with a greater amount and more available carbon and electron donors thereby facilitating cr vi reduction next the sequential batch experiment with corncob was conducted over 10 cycles to demonstrate the sustainability and feasibility of corncob as a solid phase carbon source fig 2 the reduction efficiency of cr vi did not decrease after the 10 cycle reaction furthermore the first order kinetic constant increased from 1 1 to 1 2 d 1 from the 1st to the 10th cycle fig 2a which may be related to the adaptation of microorganisms to the environment additionally the toc of the reaction decreased within a reasonable range with an approximately uniform reduction of all carbon types fig 2b 3 2 impacts of operation conditions to investigate the broad applicability of corncob the effects of different operation conditions on cr vi bioreduction were investigated cr vi reduction in the corncob system sc exhibited significant enhancement p 0 05 under all experimental ph conditions relative to the liquid phase carbon system lc fig s2a b with the first order kinetic constant k increasing 2 2 3 1 2 6 2 7 and 3 4 times at ph 5 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 and 11 0 respectively fig 3 a the trend in ph was basically the same in the two systems with a lower ph obtained in the sc system which was assumed to be caused by the fermentation of corncob fig s2c d the distribution of different carbon types revealed that ph had little effect on the total amount and kind of carbon sources fig 3b at all experimental initial cr vi concentrations a higher cr vi reduction rate was observed in the sc system when compared to the lc system fig s3a b with the k value 2 2 2 6 3 9 3 7 and 1 2 p 0 05 times higher than lc at initial cr vi concentrations of 2 5 10 20 and 50 mg l respectively fig 3c because of the acids produced during fermentation fig s3c d the ph of the sc system was still slightly lower than that of the lc system additionally the distribution characteristics of different carbon types indicated that the toc decreased with increasing initial cr vi concentrations fig 3d this may be related to the toxicity of cr vi to microorganisms leading to a lower dissolution of corncob when the initial concentration was greater than 10 mg l it was consistent with the strengthening effect of corncob decreased with the increase of the initial concentration of cr vi 3 3 enhancement mechanism by corncob the enhancement mechanism of corncob was deduced via the three main aspects carrier effect nutrient element release and electron shuttle effect humic acid to verify the carrier effect cr vi bioreduction guided by corncob and corncob extract were conducted over 4 cycle sequential batch experiments during the first 2 cycles the corncob system achieved a higher reduction efficiency than

and reduced contaminant removal efficiency among other operational problems while it has been suggested that switching the current direction intermittently i e polarity reversal pr can help mitigate electrode fouling conflicting results about the utility of this approach have been reported in the literature the objective of this study was to systematically investigate the effects of pr frequency

in fe ec decreased with increasing pr frequency ϕ was as low as 10 when a pr frequency of 0 5 minutes was employed unlike fe ec operating al ec under the pr mode resulted in high coagulant production efficiencies reduced energy consumption and diminished electrode fouling in addition to comparing pr ec and dc ec a novel strategy to minimize electrode fouling was investigated this strategy involved

streams emamjomeh sivakumar 2009 pan et al 2016 rincón la motta 2014 van genuchten et al 2012 ec involves the application of electric current to sacrificial fe0 and al0 anodes to produce fe ii and al iii ions reactions 1 and 2 lakshmanan et al 2009 mollah et al 2004 which subsequently interact with contaminants and remove them from the solution contrary to chemical coagulation i e the process in which chemical coagulants such as alum or ferric chloride are added ec requires little to no chemical addition generates less sludge waste occupies less space and can accommodate a wide range of flow rates garcia segura et al 2017 mollah et al 2004 mollah et al 2001 timmes et al 2010 vik et al 1984 as such ec can be used as an intermittent point of use treatment technology to remove arsenic in

fouling formation vary depending on factors such as electrode type solution chemistry and operating parameters e g current density van genuchten et al 2016 van genuchten et al 2017 the primary

have been proposed to deal with electrode fouling including cleaning the electrodes mechanically or chemically bandaru et al 2020 lakshmanan et al 2009 müller et al 2019 adding cl to promote pitting corrosion and prevent passivation arroyo et al 2009 dura breslin 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 yang et al 2015a applying ultrasound to breakdown and dislodge the fouling layers he et al 2016 he et al 2018 kovatcheva parlapanski 1999 raschitor et al 2014 and operating ec with alternating pulsed current apc also often referred to as polarity reversal or pr bao et al 2020 eyvaz et al 2009 gobbi et al 2018 grøterud smoczynski 1986 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 mao et al 2008 timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2017 or sinusoidal alternating current ac alkhatib et al 2020 kamaraj et al 2013 vasudevan lakshmi 2012 such that the fouling layers can be dislodged dissolved by chemical electrochemical reactions which take place when the current direction is switched of these approaches pr ec and ac ec have gained significant interests due to their ability to remove fouling layers in situ that is the removal of fouling layers takes place concurrent with the production of coagulants as the current direction is switched and the cathode becomes the anode and vice versa the corrosion reactions reactions 1 and 2 will take place at the electrode that served as the cathode in the previous current cycle thereby displacing ca and mg containing precipitates the dissolution of ca and mg containing precipitates could also be accelerated by the acidic ph environment developed around the anode as a result of the hydrolysis of fe and al ions reactions 5 and 6 at the cathode which served as the anode in the previous current cycle the evolution of h2 gas bubbles produced from reaction 4 can scour loosely bound fe oh 3 s and al oh 3 s precipitates timmes et al 2010 pr ec and ac ec are particularly attractive because in addition to their ability to remove fouling layers in situ these methods do not require chemical addition special infrastructure other than a current switch or reactor shutdown despite past studies the ability of alternating currents to mitigate electrode fouling remains poorly understood and conflicting results have been reported in the literature studies have shown that pr ec and ac ec consumed less energy yet were more effective at removing contaminants than dc ec asaithambi et al 2016 hasani et al 2019 mansoorian et al 2014 mao et al 2008 secula et al 2013 this enhanced performance was often claimed to be the direct result of the diminished electrode fouling however few studies analyzed the electrode surface to support this claim based on the scanning electron microscopy sem images mao et al mao et al 2008 karamati niaragh et al karamati niaragh et al 2019 and vasudevan et al vasudevan lakshmi 2012 vasudevan et al 2011 reported that fe and al electrodes were dissolved more uniformly in pr ec and ac ec than in dc ec however two recent studies observed the formation of thick fouling layers in pr ec ashraf et al 2019 müller et al 2019 raising significant questions about whether alternating currents can effectively mitigate electrode fouling the removal of electrode fouling layers by pr was also invoked in a few studies to explain the higher faradaic efficiency i e the coagulant production efficiciency per unit of electric charge passed through the system ozyonar karagozoglu 2015 yang et al 2015b contrary to these observations however several studies have reported a lower faradaic efficiency in pr ec and ac ec than the efficiency in dc ec with an efficiency that decreased with increasing current reversal frequency alkhatib et al 2020 ashraf et al 2019 fekete et al 2016 grøterud smoczyński 1986 timmes et al 2010 the reversal frequency optimal for contaminant removal appeared to be dependent on the electrode type e g fe versus al and the contaminant to be removed eyvaz 2016 eyvaz et al 2009 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 pi et al 2014 smoczyński et al 2017 we note that it is difficult to directly compare these past results since the experimental conditions e g solution composition electrode type current reversal frequency current density and reactor design varied greatly among studies for example since cl ions can inhibit electrode passivation by inducing pitting corrosion arroyo et al 2009 dura breslin 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 xu et al 2015 it is not possible to compare the results of the systems that treated concentrated brine and seawater timmes et al 2010 with those that treated groundwater bandaru et al 2020 as another example müller et al müller et al 2019 air dried the fe electrodes between each current cycle as such the build up of thick surface layers observed in this study may be due to the oxidation of the electrode surface by air whether such a build up of surface layers will occur in a continuously operated system is not certain in the same study it was speculated that the caco3 formed on the cathode trapped the dissolved fe and diminished the coagulant production when the current direction was switched müller et al 2019 although the formation and removal of ca and mg containing precipitates in pr ec and ac ec systems have not been investigated the potential detrimental effect of caco3 on coagulant production as seen by müller et al should be considered if pr ec and ac ec were to be used to treat waters containing high concentrations of hardness e g groundwater overall given the complexity of the chemical electrochemical processes which control the fouling of the electrodes in ec and the varying nature of the fouling layer with different operating conditions more research is needed to elucidate the factors that affect fouling mitigation by means of current reversal to address these research needs the ability of pr ec to mitigate electrode fouling was investigated in this study by employing a similar test solution across all experiments coupled with analyzing cell voltage anode potential coagulant production and sem images of the electrode surface new insights have been gained about how current density and reversal frequency influence the performance of fe ec and al ec as will be discussed in detail later in this paper we found that pr ec was not effective at preventing the fouling of fe electrodes by ca and mg containing precipitates under all experimental conditions this observation motivated us to explore new ec configurations one of which consisted of an fe or al anode and a ti iro2 cathode i e fe ti iro2 ec and al ti iro2 ec ti based mixed metal oxide electrodes are frequently used in water treatment applications it has been suggested that the fouling of these electrodes by ca and mg containing precipitates could be mitigated by polarity reversal because the evolution of o2 gas produced due to the electrochemical oxidation of h2o can dislodge these precipitates radjenovic sedlak 2015 therefore we hypothesize that operating fe ti iro2 ec and al ti iro2 ec in the dc mode with a periodic switching of the current direction could be an effective way to mitigate electrode fouling by ca and mg containing precipitates this hypothesis was tested by conducting such an experiment to compare electrode fouling coagulant production and energy consumption in the fe ti iro2 and al ti iro2 systems with those of the conventional fe ec and al ec 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further purification the electrodes were cylindrical rods d 0 4 cm of fe goodfellow 98 purity al metal supermarkets 95 8 purity and ti iro2 magneto special anodes before each experiment fe and al electrodes were sonicated in 1 m hcl and rinsed with deionized water the reaction solution was a synthetic groundwater formulation consisting of 12 6 mg l dissolved silica as si 110 mg l ca2 14 mg l mg2 430 mg l hco3 305 mg l na 68 mg l cl 220 mg l so4 2 5 3 mg l no3 as n and 0 25 mg l phosphate as p pan et al 2016 this formulation was chosen because 1 it contains a high concentration of hardness 333 3 mg l as caco3 allowing us to study the fouling of the electrodes by ca and mg containing precipitates in a practical timescale and 2 the treatment of groundwater by ec is a topic of interest to researchers investigating the removal of arsenic amrose et al 2013 amrose et al 2014 bandaru van genuchten et al 2020 delaire et al 2017 wan et al 2011 the synthetic groundwater was prepared by dissolving na2sio3 9h2o mgcl2 6h2o cacl2 na2so4 nahco3 nano3 and nah2po4 into 18 2 mω cm water millipore system at elevated ph ca2 and mg2 can react with hco3 and oh to form precipitates to minimize such precipitation ph was adjusted to 7 4 7 5 prior to the addition of mgcl2 6h2o and cacl2 and the solution was immediately used within the timeframe of our experiments no precipitation was observed in the feed solution 2 2 experimental setup ec experiments were carried out at 22 1 c in a three electrode flow through reactor v 200 ml the synthetic groundwater was circulated single pass through the reactor at a rate of 10 ml min by a peristaltic pump while the volume within the reactor was stirred continuously by a magnetic stir bar the reactor was covered with a lid with three openings that held the working counter and reference electrodes figure s1 the working and counter electrodes were either fe rods in the fe ec experiments al rods in the al ec experiments or an fe or al rod coupled with a ti iro2 rod these electrodes were placed 2 cm apart and were submerged into the solution so that the surface area exposed to the solution was 7 6 0 1 cm2 in addition a reference electrode 3 m nacl ag agcl 0 209 v versus she was placed 0 25 cm from one of the other two electrodes the electrochemical cell was controlled by a vsp potentiostat bio logic science instruments which monitored current i cell voltage u and anode potential eanode dc ec and pr ec experiments were conducted under galvanostatic mode employing a current value of either i 8 50 or 100 ma i e a current density of i 1 6 5 or 13 ma cm2 in the pr ec experiments the current direction was switched periodically at a frequency f of either 0 5 or 10 minutes a preliminary experiment operated in the dc mode revealed that the cathode regardless of whether fe al or ti iro2 was used was entirely covered with ca and mg containing precipitates within the first few hours as such all experiments were terminated at t 6 hours subsequently the surface morphology of the electrodes was analyzed using an fei quanta feg 250 environmental scanning electron microscope esem coupled with an inca energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx in addition the precipitates formed on the surface of the electrodes were scraped off and subjected to x ray diffraction xrd analysis to determine the amount of coagulant released an aliquot of the reaction solution was digested with a solution of 3 wt hno3 and 3 wt hcl and analyzed for al and fe by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes the faradaic efficiency ϕ was calculated using the following formula ϕ m z f i t m where m is the mass of fe or al released into the solution z is the number of electrons involved in the anodic reaction z 2 for fe 3 for al f is the faraday s constant 96 485 coulombs eq m is the molecular weight 56 for fe 27 for al and t is the retention time 20 mins the ph of the reaction solution throughout each fe ec experiment was 7 5 0 2 in contrast in all al ec experiments the solution ph gradually increased and reached 8 8 2 by the end of each experiment although the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in the reactor was not monitored it is expected that the reaction solution always contained some do because the feed solution which was saturated with do was continuously flown through the reactor also the reactor was opened to the atmosphere all experiments were conducted in duplicate and average values along with the range are presented 3 results 3 1 fe ec in the experiments operated in the dc mode i 13 ma cm2 the anode surface quickly turned brown yellow a color indicative of fe iii hydr oxides meanwhile a coarse layer of white colored precipitates built up on the cathode figure 1 a further inspection of the cathode by sem edx revealed that the white colored precipitates were rhombohedral shaped crystals that contained ca and mg figures 1b and s2a while the xrd spectrum of these crystals figure s3a matches that of pure calcite caco3 their shape and elemental content suggest that they are a magnesian calcite phase ca1 xmgxco3 busenberg plummer 1989 although by the end of the experiment the cathode surface was completely covered with these ca1 xmgxco3 minerals the cell voltage u remained constant at 7 6 v figure 2 a the ohmic drop compensated anode potential eanode 0 4 v also did not vary to any appreciable extent throughout the entire experiment figure s4a the faradaic efficiency ϕ was 1 0 01 table 1 indicating that the predominant anodic reaction was the corrosion of fe reaction 1 and that all fe ions released from the anode migrated into the bulk solution when a current density of i 6 5 ma cm2 was employed ϕ was comparable to that in the i 13 ma cm2 experiment in contrast ϕ in the i 1 ma cm2 experiment was 20 30 lower table 1 müller et al müller et al 2019 also observed a similar trend that is ϕ 0 66 0 85 in a fe ec experiment with i 0 8 ma cm2 was lower than those ϕ 0 9 operated at higher i values they attributed this low ϕ to the accumulation of fe ii on the anode which was the result of the diminished flux of fe ii ions released from the anode at low i it is suspected that for this same reason ϕ in our i 1 ma cm2 experiment was lower than those in the other experiments the evolutions of the electrode fouling layers u eanode and ϕ in pr ec were drastically different from those in dc ec and were dependent on the current reversal frequency f when f 10 min and i 13 ma cm2 u decreased from 7 6 v to 7 4 v within the first 20 minutes and remained at this value until the end of the experiment figure 2a at t 6 h both electrodes were entirely covered with rhombohedral ca1 xmgxco3 crystals figures 1c and 1d when f 0 5 min u steadily increased throughout the experiment from 7 2 v to 8 0 v figure 2a and the electrodes were covered with very small cubic minerals that were sparsely dispersed within fluffy iron hydr oxide flocs figures 1e and 1f the edx spectrum reveals that the fouling layer also contained si while the presence of mg was not detected figure s2c the cubic shape of the ca containing precipitates suggests that they are calcite caco3 in the pr ec experiments i dipped whenever the current direction was switched but subsequently restored to the pre set value within less than 2 s figure s5 in contrast a more complicated change was observed with the anodic potential eanode note that there was no dedicated anode or cathode in pr ec since the current direction was constantly changing therefore eanode herein refers to the potential of electrode a figure s1 measured whenever this electrode served as the anode in the cell in the f 10 min experiment eanode measured at t 5 min increased and peaked at 0 31 v before decreasing to a steady state value of 0 37 v the solid line in figure 2b as the experiment progressed the eanode peak value and the time required for it to reach steady state gradually increased toward the end of the experiment eanode peaked at 0 02 v and decreased to a steady state value of 0 42 v only after 90 s the dotted line in figure 2b in the f 0 5 min experiment eanode increased over time ranging from 0 95 v to 0 57 v early on in the experiment the solid line in figure 2c and from 1 12 v to 0 01 v at the end of the experiment the dotted line in figure 2c ϕ in the pr ec experiments were lower than those of dc ec with ϕ 0 5 0 86 and ϕ 0 06 0 24 in the f 10 min and f 0 5 min experiments respectively table 1 under f 0 5 min ϕ decreased by as much as 3 folds as the experiment progressed compare ϕ at t 3 h versus at t 6 h 3 2 al ec a significant build up of precipitates on both electrodes was observed in the al ec system operated in the dc mode by the end of the experiment the anode was covered with fluffy aluminum hydroxide precipitates figure 3 a meanwhile the cathode was covered with both ca1 xmgxco3 and aluminum hydroxides figures 3b throughout the course of the experiment u steadily increased from 8 1 v to 9 8 v figure 4 a eanode also increased steadily over time from 1 75 v to 0 26 v figure s7a indicating that the fouling layer on the anode was responsible for the increase in the cell voltage the faradaic efficiency was ϕ 1 61 1 74 when i 13 ma cm2 1 83 1 92 when i 6 5 ma cm2 and 1 19 1 69 when i 1 ma cm2 table 2 a super faradaic efficiency i e ϕ 1 is typical of al ec owing to the combined electrochemical and chemical dissolution of al fekete et al 2016 mechelhoff et al 2013 b mechelhoff et al 2013 c mouedhen et al 2008 the fouling of the al electrodes substantially decreased in the pr system operated at f 10 min figure 3c the edx spectrum reveals the presence of ca and mg on the electrode surface figure s2e as such although not seen in the sem image figure 3d ca and mg containing precipitates are speculated to be present and must have been enmeshed within the aluminum hydroxide flocs as seen in figure 4a u initially decreased from 8 3 v to 7 9 v before increasing to 8 5 v by the end of the experiment within each pr cycle eanode rapidly reached a steady state value of 1 5 v early on in the experiment the solid line in figure 4b as the experiment progressed the time required for eanode to reach a steady state value gradually increased at t 6 h eanode peaked at 0 89 v and reached a steady state value of 1 3 v after 300 s the dotted line in figure 4b unlike in the dc and pr f 10 min experiments large holes were seen to have formed on both electrodes in the f 0 5 min experiment figure s7b suggesting that pitting corrosion could be an important mechanism of al dissolution in this case also the surface within each hole was covered with very small spindle and cubic minerals that consisted of ca c and o figures 3f s2f and s7b although the identity of these minerals could not be elucidated by xrd since the xrd diffraction spectrum was dominant by that of the amorphous aluminum hydroxide precipitates present in the sample figure s3d the shape and composition of the minerals suggest that they are different polymorphs of caco3 e g aragonite which are spindle shaped and calcite which are cubic shaped de leeuw parker 1998 in the f 0 5 min experiment u ranged between 8 3 v and 8 7 v figure 4a while eanode increased from 1 70 v to 1 47 v figure 4c as in the fe ec experiments ϕ under f 0 5 min was the lowest among all al ec experiments notably ϕ in the i 1 ma cm2 and 6 5 ma cm2 experiments were 1 table 1 3 3 ec systems with ti iro2 serving as the cathode the observation that pr was not effective at preventing the fouling of fe electrodes by ca and mg containing precipitates motivated us to explore new ec configurations in a preliminary experiment wherein a ti iro2 electrode served as the cathode in the fe ec system it was observed that a thick layer of ca1 xmgxco3 accumulated on this electrode could be completely dislodged within 2 mins upon switching the current direction figures 5 a and 5b vs 5c and 5d figure s8 as such the performance of a combined system of fe al anode and ti iro2 cathode was further investigated in an experiment in which the cell was operated in the dc mode but the current direction was intermittently switched so that the ti iro2 functioned as an anode for 120 s every 30 mins as can be seen from figures 6 a and 6b the ti iro2 electrodes were free of foulants after 6 h of operation the fouling of the fe and al anodes was also drastically diminished notably the original black color of the fe rod was still visible figure 6a the faradaic efficiencies were ϕ 0 87 0 95 and ϕ 0 82 0 90 in the fe ti iro2 and al ti iro2 systems respectively table 3 in both systems u increased by less than 0 1 v throughout the course of the experiment figure 6c 4 discussion a major finding of this study is that operating ec in the pr mode did not always result in a lower energy consumption and or greater coagulant production efficiency in the fe ec system operated under the pr f 10 min mode a slightly lower u compared with that in dc ec and hence lower energy consumption p since p uit came at the expense of a ϕ that decreased by 10 35 in the pr f 0 5 min system not only did the energy consumption increase over time but ϕ also drastically decreased by as much as 90 moreover while it has been suggested that operating ec in the pr mode can reduce electrode fouling hasani et al 2019 mao et al 2008 this was not the case in our fe ec experiments as was mentioned earlier the fe electrodes were fully covered with ca1 xmgxco3 figure 1d caco3 and iron hydr oxides figure 1f although u remained constant in the pr f 10 min system it is speculated that u may ultimately increase if ca1 xmgxco3 continues to accumulate on both electrodes in the pr f 0 5 min the increase in u figure 2a is attributable to the surface accumulation of iron hydr oxides which passivated the surface of fe müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2016 iron hydr oxides are several orders of magnitude less conductive than metallic fe cornell schwertmann 2006 there are several possible explanations for the lower coagulant production in the fe pr ec experiments first following each current switching event the cathode will exert an electrostatic attraction force on the cationic fe species that have just been released from the same electrode this electrode served as the anode in the preceding current cycle this attractive force would retard the migration of the cationic fe species into the bulk solution subsequently upon encountering the oh ions that are now generated via cathodic reactions 3 and 4 these cationic fe species would precipitate on the surface of the electrode resulting in a lower ϕ this hypothesis is speculated to be particularly relevant to the pr f 0 5 min system wherein a rapid current cycling means that there would be less time for cationic fe species to migrate away from the electrodes this hypothesis is also consistent with the formation of fluffy iron hydr oxide flocs on the electrode surface figure 1e and f second the lower ϕ could be due to electrochemical side reactions that if present will divert the current away from the fe corrosion reaction i e reaction 1 in previous studies ϕ 1 was attributable to the electrochemical oxidation of h2o and cl cañizares et al 2005 chen et al 2020 dubrawski et al 2015 heidmann calmano 2008 kobya et al 2016 mamelkina et al 2017 mollah et al 2004 müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 however since e0 h w o2 h2o 0 81 v and e0 h w cl2 cl 1 34 v the presence of these reactions can be ruled out from our system this is because eanode in our experiments were always 0 81 v note that due to the acidic environment in the anodic boundary layer eanode must be greater than e0 h w o2 h2o and e0 h w cl2 cl to trigger the oxidation of h2o and cl under pr f 10 min that ϕ 0 81 0 86 as well as eanode mostly ranged between 0 37 and 0 42 v suggest that the predominant anodic reaction was the oxidation of fe e0 h w fe fe2 0 44 v under pr f 0 5 min eanode ranged between 1 12 v and 0 02 v within this range in addition to the oxidation of fe other reactions that are thermodynamically possible include the oxidation of h2 g e0 h w h2o h2 0 41 v the oxidation of fe oh 2 e0 h green rust fe oh 2 0 5 to 0 6 v when ph 7 10 drissi et al 1995 génin et al 2006 e0 h fe2o3 fe oh 2 0 5 to 1 0v when ph 9 14 beverskog puigdomenech 1996b and the oxidation of fe3o4 e0 h fe2o3 fe3o4 0 2 to 0 5 v when ph 8 14 beverskog puigdomenech 1996a in our experiments we observed the formation of h2 g bubbles whenever each of the two electrodes served as the cathode some bubbles detached from the electrode while some remained on the electrode surface therefore it is hypothesized that the oxidation of these adsorbed h2 g or dissolved h2 present in the vicinity of the electrodes which would take place when the current direction is switched and a cathode becomes an anode is an important side reaction however since eanode in the pr f 0 5 min system varied over a wide range figure 2c it is likely that multiple oxidation side reactions were occurring in addition to the oxidation side reactions the electrochemical reduction on the cathode of fe ii ions keddam 2011 released from the same electrode when it served as the anode in the preceding current cycle could have resulted in a low ϕ in pr ec third the lower ϕ also could be due to the build up of precipitates on the surface of both electrodes which would prevent the migration into the bulk solution of the fe ions that are released from the electrode base beneath the fouling layer lastly the lower coagulant production in pr ec could be due to the current interruption period between each pr cycle however since current was restored to the pre set value within less than 2 s figure s4 the effect of current interruption on ϕ should be minimal if pr is detrimental to fe ec it is appeared to be beneficial to the performance of al ec firstly electrode fouling was significantly reduced in all al pr ec experiments compare figures 3c and 3e with figure 3a a notable difference between the fe ec and al ec systems is that the al hydroxide precipitates were observed to be more loosely bound to the anode and more easily dislodged by the h2 g bubbles that were produced whenever the current direction was switched secondly u in the pr experiments were lower than that of al dc figure 4a which increased substantially as the experiment progressed finally of all the pr conditions tested only under f 0 5 min i 1 ma cm2 and f 0 5 min i 6 5 ma cm2 did the al pr ec system exhibit a significant decrease in ϕ by as much as 75 under the other pr conditions ϕ is either equal to f 10 min i 6 5 ma cm2 slightly higher f 10 min i 13 5 ma cm2 or slightly lower f 0 5 min i 13 ma cm2 and f 10 min i 1 ma cm2 than ϕ in the al dc counterparts another important difference between al ec and fe ec is that the anode and cathode in al ec can undergo chemical corrosion owing to the low and high ph regions developed in the vicinity of each electrode fekete et al 2016 mechelhoff et al 2013a 2013c mouedhen et al 2008 the chemical dissolution of the cathode would dislodge ca and mg containing precipitates as can be seen by comparing figures 1b and 3b the al cathode was not covered by ca1 xmgxco3 to the same extent as was the fe cathode the chemical oxidation of al electrodes also resulted in ϕ 1 with the exception of the f 0 5 min i 6 5 ma cm2 ϕ 0 67 and the f 0 5 min i 1 ma cm2 ϕ 0 54 systems as in the fe pr ec system possible explanations for the lower ϕ in the al pr ec f 0 5 min systems include 1 decreased migration into the bulk solution of cationic al species because of the rapid current cycling and 2 electrochemical side reactions particularly the oxidation of adsorbed h2 g another reason for the lower ϕ could be that the rapid current cycling in the f 0 5 min system resulted in less acidic basic ph environments in the vicinity of each electrode thereby decreasing the chemical dissolution of al fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 compared with the fe ec and al ec systems the fouling of the electrodes in the fe ti iro2 and al ti iro2 systems was diminished the fe and al electrodes or prevented altogether the ti iro2 electrode as was mentioned earlier the fe ti iro2 and al ti iro2 systems were operated under the dc mode fe or al was the anode while ti iro2 was the cathode with an occasional current switching that reversed the role of the two electrodes for a short period 120 s following each current switching event the ca1 xmgxco3 precipitates accumulated on the ti iro2 electrode was rapidly dislodged by the evolution of o2 g bubbles produced from the electrochemical oxidation of h2o on ti iro2 in the fe ti iro2 system ϕ decreased only by 5 13 which is attributable to the interruption of coagulant production whenever the ti iro2 electrode served as an anode 13 3 of the overall operating time from the operational perspective this slightly lower ϕ could be outweighed by the potential benefits that the diminished electrode fouling may provide e g lower ohmic drop sustained coagulant production less frequent replacement of electrodes in contrast ϕ in the al ti iro2 system decreased by 40 60 compared with ϕ in the al dc ec counterpart this significant decrease of ϕ in the al ti iro2 system highlights the importance of the chemical dissolution of the al cathode in the al dc ec system to the overall coagulant production it also suggests that the al ti iro2 system might not be an attractive alternative to conventional al ec systems considering that the amount of energy consumed in the former system is only 10 20 lower compare ucell 7 2 7 6 v of the al ti iro2 system figure 6c versus ucell 8 0 8 5 v of the al pr ec f 10 min figure 4a of all the al ec systems tested in this study the al pr ec f 10 min appeared to provide the greatest balance of high coagulant production efficiency reduced energy consumption and diminished electrode fouling 5 conclusions this study compared the performance of fe and al electrocoagulation systems that operated in the direct current and polarity reversal modes by systematically examining the effects of electrode type current density and polarity reversal frequency on the coagulant production efficiency electrode fouling energy consumption and anodic potential the following insights have been gained under the experimental conditions employed in this study fe ec operated in the polarity reversal mode consumed more energy but generated less coagulant than the fe dc ec counterpart the fouling of the fe electrodes also were not reduced under all conditions which is contrary to what has been suggested in the literature in general polarity reversal was beneficial to the performance of al ec in all but two experiments the coagulant production of al pr ec was comparable to that of al dc ec notably al pr ec systems consumed less energy and did not suffer from electrode fouling to the same extent as al dc ec under a rapid rate of polarity reversal f 0 5 mins the coagulant production efficiency decreased by as much as 90 in fe ec and by 40 75 in al ec this decrease was attributable to electrochemical side reactions e g the oxidation of adsorbed h2 g the retardation of the fe and al ion migration into the bulk solution and the precipitation of these ions on the electrodes it is suspected that because of these same reasons the coagulant production efficiencies in ec systems operated with alternating current ac ec were lower than those of dc ec cerqueira et al 2014 karamati niaragh et al 2019 in ac ec systems the migration of fe and al ions into the bulk solution is expected to be further retarded since the current direction is constantly changing an ec system that employed a fe anode and a ti iro2 cathode and operated under the dc mode with an occasional current switching was shown to result in not only effective coagulant production but also minimal electrode fouling this combined fe ti iro2 electrode system has the potential to be an effective ec configuration as a concluding remark we note that all experiments in this study were conducted under a similar flow dynamics and employed one solution formulation since the nature of the fouling layer and the coagulant production efficiency are dependent on the solution composition e g the corrosion of fe is accelerated by cl but inhibited by oxyanions such as so4 2 and po4 3 lakshmipathiraj et al 2008 refaey 2005 van genuchten et al 2017 xu et al 2015b and cell design dubrawski mohseni 2013 mcbeath et al

17022,one of the biggest issues in electrocoagulation ec water treatment processes is electrode fouling which can cause decreased coagulant production increased ohmic resistance and energy consumption and reduced contaminant removal efficiency among other operational problems while it has been suggested that switching the current direction intermittently i e polarity reversal pr can help mitigate electrode fouling conflicting results about the utility of this approach have been reported in the literature the objective of this study was to systematically investigate the effects of pr frequency and current density on the performance of fe ec and al ec it was found that operating fe ec under the pr mode reduced neither electrode fouling nor energy consumption notably the faradaic efficiency ϕ in fe ec decreased with increasing pr frequency ϕ was as low as 10 when a pr frequency of 0 5 minutes was employed unlike fe ec operating al ec under the pr mode resulted in high coagulant production efficiencies reduced energy consumption and diminished electrode fouling in addition to comparing pr ec and dc ec a novel strategy to minimize electrode fouling was investigated this strategy involved operating fe dc ec and al dc ec with a ti iro2 cathode whose fouling by ca and mg containing minerals could be readily avoided by periodically switching the current direction graphical abstract image

fouling formation vary depending on factors such as electrode type solution chemistry and operating parameters e g current density van genuchten et al 2016 van genuchten et al 2017 the primary

lakshmi 2012 such that the fouling layers can be dislodged dissolved by chemical electrochemical reactions which take place when the current direction is switched of these approaches pr ec and ac ec have gained significant interests due to their ability to remove fouling layers in situ that is the removal of fouling layers takes place concurrent with the production of coagulants as the current direction is switched and the cathode becomes the anode and vice versa the corrosion reactions reactions 1 and 2 will take place at the electrode that served as the cathode in the previous current cycle thereby displacing ca and mg containing precipitates the dissolution of ca and mg containing precipitates could also be accelerated by the acidic ph environment developed around the anode as a result of the hydrolysis of fe and al ions reactions 5 and 6 at the cathode which served as the anode in the previous current cycle the evolution of h2 gas bubbles produced from reaction 4 can scour loosely bound fe oh 3 s and al oh 3 s precipitates timmes et al 2010 pr ec and ac ec are particularly attractive because in addition to their ability to remove fouling layers in situ these methods do not require chemical addition special infrastructure other than a current switch or reactor shutdown despite past studies the ability of alternating currents to mitigate electrode fouling remains poorly understood and conflicting results have been reported in the literature studies have shown that pr ec and ac ec consumed less energy yet were more effective at removing contaminants than dc ec asaithambi et al 2016 hasani et al 2019 mansoorian et al 2014 mao et al 2008 secula et al 2013 this enhanced performance was often claimed to be the direct result of the diminished electrode fouling however few studies analyzed the electrode surface to support this claim based on the scanning electron microscopy sem images mao et al mao et al 2008 karamati niaragh et al karamati niaragh et al 2019 and vasudevan et al vasudevan lakshmi 2012 vasudevan et al 2011 reported that fe and al electrodes were dissolved more uniformly in pr ec and ac ec than in dc ec however two recent studies observed the formation of thick fouling layers in pr ec ashraf et al 2019 müller et al 2019 raising significant questions about whether alternating currents can effectively mitigate electrode fouling the removal of electrode fouling layers by pr was also invoked in a few studies to explain the higher faradaic efficiency i e the coagulant production efficiciency per unit of electric charge passed through the system ozyonar karagozoglu 2015 yang et al 2015b contrary to these observations however several studies have reported a lower faradaic efficiency in pr ec and ac ec than the efficiency in dc ec with an efficiency that decreased with increasing current reversal frequency alkhatib et al 2020 ashraf et al 2019 fekete et al 2016 grøterud smoczyński 1986 timmes et al 2010 the reversal frequency optimal for contaminant removal appeared to be dependent on the electrode type e g fe versus al and the contaminant to be removed eyvaz 2016 eyvaz et al 2009 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 pi et al 2014 smoczyński et al 2017 we note that it is difficult to directly compare these past results since the experimental conditions e g solution composition electrode type current reversal frequency current density and reactor design varied greatly among studies for example since cl ions can inhibit electrode passivation by inducing pitting corrosion arroyo et al 2009 dura breslin 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 xu et al 2015 it is not possible to compare the results of the systems that treated concentrated brine and seawater timmes et al 2010 with those that treated groundwater bandaru et al 2020 as another example müller et al müller et al 2019 air dried the fe electrodes between each current cycle as such the build up of thick surface layers observed in this study may be due to the oxidation of the electrode surface by air whether such a build up of surface layers will occur in a continuously operated system is not certain in the same study it was speculated that the caco3 formed on the cathode trapped the dissolved fe and diminished the coagulant production when the current direction was switched müller et al 2019 although the formation and removal of ca and mg containing precipitates in pr ec and ac ec systems have not been investigated the potential detrimental effect of caco3 on coagulant production as seen by müller et al should be considered if pr ec and ac ec were to be used to treat waters containing high concentrations of hardness e g groundwater overall given the complexity of the chemical electrochemical processes which control the fouling of the electrodes in ec and the varying nature of the fouling layer with different operating conditions more research is needed to elucidate the factors that affect fouling mitigation by means of current reversal to address these research needs the ability of pr ec to mitigate electrode fouling was investigated in this study by employing a similar test solution across all experiments coupled with analyzing cell voltage anode potential coagulant production and sem images of the electrode surface new insights have been gained about how current density and reversal frequency influence the performance of fe ec and al ec as will be discussed in detail later in this paper we found that pr ec was not effective at preventing the fouling of fe electrodes by ca and mg containing precipitates under all experimental conditions this observation motivated us to explore new ec configurations one of which consisted of an fe or al anode and a ti iro2 cathode i e fe ti iro2 ec and al ti iro2 ec ti based mixed metal oxide electrodes are frequently used in water treatment applications it has been suggested that the fouling of these electrodes by ca and mg containing precipitates could be mitigated by polarity reversal because the evolution of o2 gas produced due to the electrochemical oxidation of h2o can dislodge these precipitates radjenovic sedlak 2015 therefore we hypothesize that operating fe ti iro2 ec and al ti iro2 ec in the dc mode with a periodic switching of the current direction could be an effective way to mitigate electrode fouling by ca and mg containing precipitates this hypothesis was tested by conducting such an experiment to compare electrode fouling coagulant production and energy consumption in the fe ti iro2 and al ti iro2 systems with those of the conventional fe ec and al ec 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further purification the electrodes were cylindrical rods d 0 4 cm of fe goodfellow 98 purity al metal supermarkets 95 8 purity and ti iro2 magneto special anodes before each experiment fe and al electrodes were sonicated in 1 m hcl and rinsed with deionized water the reaction solution was a synthetic groundwater formulation consisting of 12 6 mg l dissolved silica as si 110 mg l ca2 14 mg l mg2 430 mg l hco3 305 mg l na 68 mg l cl 220 mg l so4 2 5 3 mg l no3 as n and 0 25 mg l phosphate as p pan et al 2016 this formulation was chosen because 1 it contains a high concentration of hardness 333 3 mg l as caco3 allowing us to study the fouling of the electrodes by ca and mg containing precipitates in a practical timescale and 2 the treatment of groundwater by ec is a topic of interest to researchers investigating the removal of arsenic amrose et al 2013 amrose et al 2014 bandaru van genuchten et al 2020 delaire et al 2017 wan et al 2011 the synthetic groundwater was prepared by dissolving na2sio3 9h2o mgcl2 6h2o cacl2 na2so4 nahco3 nano3 and nah2po4 into 18 2 mω cm water millipore system at elevated ph ca2 and mg2 can react with hco3 and oh to form precipitates to minimize such precipitation ph was adjusted to 7 4 7 5 prior to the addition of mgcl2 6h2o and cacl2 and the solution was immediately used within the timeframe of our experiments no precipitation was observed in the feed solution 2 2 experimental setup ec experiments were carried out at 22 1 c in a three electrode flow through reactor v 200 ml the synthetic groundwater was circulated single pass through the reactor at a rate of 10 ml min by a peristaltic pump while the volume within the reactor was stirred continuously by a magnetic stir bar the reactor was covered with a lid with three openings that held the working counter and reference electrodes figure s1 the working and counter electrodes were either fe rods in the fe ec experiments al rods in the al ec experiments or an fe or al rod coupled with a ti iro2 rod these electrodes were placed 2 cm apart and were submerged into the solution so that the surface area exposed to the solution was 7 6 0 1 cm2 in addition a reference electrode 3 m nacl ag agcl 0 209 v versus she was placed 0 25 cm from one of the other two electrodes the electrochemical cell was controlled by a vsp potentiostat bio logic science instruments which monitored current i cell voltage u and anode potential eanode dc ec and pr ec experiments were conducted under galvanostatic mode employing a current value of either i 8 50 or 100 ma i e a current density of i 1 6 5 or 13 ma cm2 in the pr ec experiments the current direction was switched periodically at a frequency f of either 0 5 or 10 minutes a preliminary experiment operated in the dc mode revealed that the cathode regardless of whether fe al or ti iro2 was used was entirely covered with ca and mg containing precipitates within the first few hours as such all experiments were terminated at t 6 hours subsequently the surface morphology of the electrodes was analyzed using an fei quanta feg 250 environmental scanning electron microscope esem coupled with an inca energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx in addition the precipitates formed on the surface of the electrodes were scraped off and subjected to x ray diffraction xrd analysis to determine the amount of coagulant released an aliquot of the reaction solution was digested with a solution of 3 wt hno3 and 3 wt hcl and analyzed for al and fe by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes the faradaic efficiency ϕ was calculated using the following formula ϕ m z f i t m where m is the mass of fe or al released into the solution z is the number of electrons involved in the anodic reaction z 2 for fe 3 for al f is the faraday s constant 96 485 coulombs eq m is the molecular weight 56 for fe 27 for al and t is the retention time 20 mins the ph of the reaction solution throughout each fe ec experiment was 7 5 0 2 in contrast in all al ec experiments the solution ph gradually increased and reached 8 8 2 by the end of each experiment although the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in the reactor was not monitored it is expected that the reaction solution always contained some do because the feed solution which was saturated with do was continuously flown through the reactor also the reactor was opened to the atmosphere all experiments were conducted in duplicate and average values along with the range are presented 3 results 3 1 fe ec in the experiments operated in the dc mode i 13 ma cm2 the anode surface quickly turned brown yellow a color indicative of fe iii hydr oxides meanwhile a coarse layer of white colored precipitates built up on the cathode figure 1 a further inspection of the cathode by sem edx revealed that the white colored precipitates were rhombohedral shaped crystals that contained ca and mg figures 1b and s2a while the xrd spectrum of these crystals figure s3a matches that of pure calcite caco3 their shape and elemental content suggest that they are a magnesian calcite phase ca1 xmgxco3 busenberg plummer 1989 although by the end of the experiment the cathode surface was completely covered with these ca1 xmgxco3 minerals the cell voltage u remained constant at 7 6 v figure 2 a the ohmic drop compensated anode potential eanode 0 4 v also did not vary to any appreciable extent throughout the entire experiment figure s4a the faradaic efficiency ϕ was 1 0 01 table 1 indicating that the predominant anodic reaction was the corrosion of fe reaction 1 and that all fe ions released from the anode migrated into the bulk solution when a current density of i 6 5 ma cm2 was employed ϕ was comparable to that in the i 13 ma cm2 experiment in contrast ϕ in the i 1 ma cm2 experiment was 20 30 lower table 1 müller et al müller et al 2019 also observed a similar trend that is ϕ 0 66 0 85 in a fe ec experiment with i 0 8 ma cm2 was lower than those ϕ 0 9 operated at higher i values they attributed this low ϕ to the accumulation of fe ii on the anode which was the result of the diminished flux of fe ii ions released from the anode at low i it is suspected that for this same reason ϕ in our i 1 ma cm2 experiment was lower than those in the other experiments the evolutions of the electrode fouling layers u eanode and ϕ in pr ec were drastically different from those in dc ec and were dependent on the current reversal frequency f when f 10 min and i 13 ma cm2 u decreased from 7 6 v to 7 4 v within the first 20 minutes and remained at this value until the end of the experiment figure 2a at t 6 h both electrodes were entirely covered with rhombohedral ca1 xmgxco3 crystals figures 1c and 1d when f 0 5 min u steadily increased throughout the experiment from 7 2 v to 8 0 v figure 2a and the electrodes were covered with very small cubic minerals that were sparsely dispersed within fluffy iron hydr oxide flocs figures 1e and 1f the edx spectrum reveals that the fouling layer also contained si while the presence of mg was not detected figure s2c the cubic shape of the ca containing precipitates suggests that they are calcite caco3 in the pr ec experiments i dipped whenever the current direction was switched but subsequently restored to the pre set value within less than 2 s figure s5 in contrast a more complicated change was observed with the anodic potential eanode note that there was no dedicated anode or cathode in pr ec since the current direction was constantly changing therefore eanode herein refers to the potential of electrode a figure s1 measured whenever this electrode served as the anode in the cell in the f 10 min experiment eanode measured at t 5 min increased and peaked at 0 31 v before decreasing to a steady state value of 0 37 v the solid line in figure 2b as the experiment progressed the eanode peak value and the time required for it to reach steady state gradually increased toward the end of the experiment eanode peaked at 0 02 v and decreased to a steady state value of 0 42 v only after 90 s the dotted line in figure 2b in the f 0 5 min experiment eanode increased over time ranging from 0 95 v to 0 57 v early on in the experiment the solid line in figure 2c and from 1 12 v to 0 01 v at the end of the experiment the dotted line in figure 2c ϕ in the pr ec experiments were lower than those of dc ec with ϕ 0 5 0 86 and ϕ 0 06 0 24 in the f 10 min and f 0 5 min experiments respectively table 1 under f 0 5 min ϕ decreased by as much as 3 folds as the experiment progressed compare ϕ at t 3 h versus at t 6 h 3 2 al ec a significant build up of precipitates on both electrodes was observed in the al ec system operated in the dc mode by the end of the experiment the anode was covered with fluffy aluminum hydroxide precipitates figure 3 a meanwhile the cathode was covered with both ca1 xmgxco3 and aluminum hydroxides figures 3b throughout the course of the experiment u steadily increased from 8 1 v to 9 8 v figure 4 a eanode also increased steadily over time from 1 75 v to 0 26 v figure s7a indicating that the fouling layer on the anode was responsible for the increase in the cell voltage the faradaic efficiency was ϕ 1 61 1 74 when i 13 ma cm2 1 83 1 92 when i 6 5 ma cm2 and 1 19 1 69 when i 1 ma cm2 table 2 a super faradaic efficiency i e ϕ 1 is typical of al ec owing to the combined electrochemical and chemical dissolution of al fekete et al 2016 mechelhoff et al 2013 b mechelhoff et al 2013 c mouedhen et al 2008 the fouling of the al electrodes substantially decreased in the pr system operated at f 10 min figure 3c the edx spectrum reveals the presence of ca and mg on the electrode surface figure s2e as such although not seen in the sem image figure 3d ca and mg containing precipitates are speculated to be present and must have been enmeshed within the aluminum hydroxide flocs as seen in figure 4a u initially decreased from 8 3 v to 7 9 v before increasing to 8 5 v by the end of the experiment within each pr cycle eanode rapidly reached a steady state value of 1 5 v early on in the experiment the solid line in figure 4b as the experiment progressed the time required for eanode to reach a steady state value gradually increased at t 6 h eanode peaked at 0 89 v and reached a steady state value of 1 3 v after 300 s the dotted line in figure 4b unlike in the dc and pr f 10 min experiments large holes were seen to have formed on both electrodes in the f 0 5 min experiment figure s7b suggesting that pitting corrosion could be an important mechanism of al dissolution in this case also the surface within each hole was covered with very small spindle and cubic minerals that consisted of ca c and o figures 3f s2f and s7b although the identity of these minerals could not be elucidated by xrd since the xrd diffraction spectrum was dominant by that of the amorphous aluminum hydroxide precipitates present in the sample figure s3d the shape and composition of the minerals suggest that they are different polymorphs of caco3 e g aragonite which are spindle shaped and calcite which are cubic shaped de leeuw parker 1998 in the f 0 5 min experiment u ranged between 8 3 v and 8 7 v figure 4a while eanode increased from 1 70 v to 1 47 v figure 4c as in the fe ec experiments ϕ under f 0 5 min was the lowest among all al ec experiments notably ϕ in the i 1 ma cm2 and 6 5 ma cm2 experiments were 1 table 1 3 3 ec systems with ti iro2 serving as the cathode the observation that pr was not effective at preventing the fouling of fe electrodes by ca and mg containing precipitates motivated us to explore new ec configurations in a preliminary experiment wherein a ti iro2 electrode served as the cathode in the fe ec system it was observed that a thick layer of ca1 xmgxco3 accumulated on this electrode could be completely dislodged within 2 mins upon switching the current direction figures 5 a and 5b vs 5c and 5d figure s8 as such the performance of a combined system of fe al anode and ti iro2 cathode was further investigated in an experiment in which the cell was operated in the dc mode but the current direction was intermittently switched so that the ti iro2 functioned as an anode for 120 s every 30 mins as can be seen from figures 6 a and 6b the ti iro2 electrodes were free of foulants after 6 h of operation the fouling of the fe and al anodes was also drastically diminished notably the original black color of the fe rod was still visible figure 6a the faradaic efficiencies were ϕ 0 87 0 95 and ϕ 0 82 0 90 in the fe ti iro2 and al ti iro2 systems respectively table 3 in both systems u increased by less than 0 1 v throughout the course of the experiment figure 6c 4 discussion a major finding of this study is that operating ec in the pr mode did not always result in a lower energy consumption and or greater coagulant production efficiency in the fe ec system operated under the pr f 10 min mode a slightly lower u compared with that in dc ec and hence lower energy consumption p since p uit came at the expense of a ϕ that decreased by 10 35 in the pr f 0 5 min system not only did the energy consumption increase over time but ϕ also drastically decreased by as much as 90 moreover while it has been suggested that operating ec in the pr mode can reduce electrode fouling hasani et al 2019 mao et al 2008 this was not the case in our fe ec experiments as was mentioned earlier the fe electrodes were fully covered with ca1 xmgxco3 figure 1d caco3 and iron hydr oxides figure 1f although u remained constant in the pr f 10 min system it is speculated that u may ultimately increase if ca1 xmgxco3 continues to accumulate on both electrodes in the pr f 0 5 min the increase in u figure 2a is attributable to the surface accumulation of iron hydr oxides which passivated the surface of fe müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2016 iron hydr oxides are several orders of magnitude less conductive than metallic fe cornell schwertmann 2006 there are several possible explanations for the lower coagulant production in the fe pr ec experiments first following each current switching event the cathode will exert an electrostatic attraction force on the cationic fe species that have just been released from the same electrode this electrode served as the anode in the preceding current cycle this attractive force would retard the migration of the cationic fe species into the bulk solution subsequently upon encountering the oh ions that are now generated via cathodic reactions 3 and 4 these cationic fe species would precipitate on the surface of the electrode resulting in a lower ϕ this hypothesis is speculated to be particularly relevant to the pr f 0 5 min system wherein a rapid current cycling means that there would be less time for cationic fe species to migrate away from the electrodes this hypothesis is also consistent with the formation of fluffy iron hydr oxide flocs on the electrode surface figure 1e and f second the lower ϕ could be due to electrochemical side reactions that if present will divert the current away from the fe corrosion reaction i e reaction 1 in previous studies ϕ 1 was attributable to the electrochemical oxidation of h2o and cl cañizares et al 2005 chen et al 2020 dubrawski et al 2015 heidmann calmano 2008 kobya et al 2016 mamelkina et al 2017 mollah et al 2004 müller et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2017 however since e0 h w o2 h2o 0 81 v and e0 h w cl2 cl 1 34 v the presence of these reactions can be ruled out from our system this is because eanode in our experiments were always 0 81 v note that due to the acidic environment in the anodic boundary layer eanode must be greater than e0 h w o2 h2o and e0 h w cl2 cl to trigger the oxidation of h2o and cl under pr f 10 min that ϕ 0 81 0 86 as well as eanode mostly ranged between 0 37 and 0 42 v suggest that the predominant anodic reaction was the oxidation of fe e0 h w fe fe2 0 44 v under pr f 0 5 min eanode ranged between 1 12 v and 0 02 v within this range in addition to the oxidation of fe other reactions that are thermodynamically possible include the oxidation of h2 g e0 h w h2o h2 0 41 v the oxidation of fe oh 2 e0 h green rust fe oh 2 0 5 to 0 6 v when ph 7 10 drissi et al 1995 génin et al 2006 e0 h fe2o3 fe oh 2 0 5 to 1 0v when ph 9 14 beverskog puigdomenech 1996b and the oxidation of fe3o4 e0 h fe2o3 fe3o4 0 2 to 0 5 v when ph 8 14 beverskog puigdomenech 1996a in our experiments we observed the formation of h2 g bubbles whenever each of the two electrodes served as the cathode some bubbles detached from the electrode while some remained on the electrode surface therefore it is hypothesized that the oxidation of these adsorbed h2 g or dissolved h2 present in the vicinity of the electrodes which would take place when the current direction is switched and a cathode becomes an anode is an important side reaction however since eanode in the pr f 0 5 min system varied over a wide range figure 2c it is likely that multiple oxidation side reactions were occurring in addition to the oxidation side reactions the electrochemical reduction on the cathode of fe ii ions keddam 2011 released from the same electrode when it served as the anode in the preceding current cycle could have resulted in a low ϕ in pr ec third the lower ϕ also could be due to the build up of precipitates on the surface of both electrodes which would prevent the migration into the bulk solution of the fe ions that are released from the electrode base beneath the fouling layer lastly the lower coagulant production in pr ec could be due to the current interruption period between each pr cycle however since current was restored to the pre set value within less than 2 s figure s4 the effect of current interruption on ϕ should be minimal if pr is detrimental to fe ec it is appeared to be beneficial to the performance of al ec firstly electrode fouling was significantly reduced in all al pr ec experiments compare figures 3c and 3e with figure 3a a notable difference between the fe ec and al ec systems is that the al hydroxide precipitates were observed to be more loosely bound to the anode and more easily dislodged by the h2 g bubbles that were produced whenever the current direction was switched secondly u in the pr experiments were lower than that of al dc figure 4a which increased substantially as the experiment progressed finally of all the pr conditions tested only under f 0 5 min i 1 ma cm2 and f 0 5 min i 6 5 ma cm2 did the al pr ec system exhibit a significant decrease in ϕ by as much as 75 under the other pr conditions ϕ is either equal to f 10 min i 6 5 ma cm2 slightly higher f 10 min i 13 5 ma cm2 or slightly lower f 0 5 min i 13 ma cm2 and f 10 min i 1 ma cm2 than ϕ in the al dc counterparts another important difference between al ec and fe ec is that the anode and cathode in al ec can undergo chemical corrosion owing to the low and high ph regions developed in the vicinity of each electrode fekete et al 2016 mechelhoff et al 2013a 2013c mouedhen et al 2008 the chemical dissolution of the cathode would dislodge ca and mg containing precipitates as can be seen by comparing figures 1b and 3b the al cathode was not covered by ca1 xmgxco3 to the same extent as was the fe cathode the chemical oxidation of al electrodes also resulted in ϕ 1 with the exception of the f 0 5 min i 6 5 ma cm2 ϕ 0 67 and the f 0 5 min i 1 ma cm2 ϕ 0 54 systems as in the fe pr ec system possible explanations for the lower ϕ in the al pr ec f 0 5 min systems include 1 decreased migration into the bulk solution of cationic al species because of the rapid current cycling and 2 electrochemical side reactions particularly the oxidation of adsorbed h2 g another reason for the lower ϕ could be that the rapid current cycling in the f 0 5 min system resulted in less acidic basic ph environments in the vicinity of each electrode thereby decreasing the chemical dissolution of al fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 compared with the fe ec and al ec systems the fouling of the electrodes in the fe ti iro2 and al ti iro2 systems was diminished the fe and al electrodes or prevented altogether the ti iro2 electrode as was mentioned earlier the fe ti iro2 and al ti iro2 systems were operated under the dc mode fe or al was the anode while ti iro2 was the cathode with an occasional current switching that reversed the role of the two electrodes for a short period 120 s following each current switching event the ca1 xmgxco3 precipitates accumulated on the ti iro2 electrode was rapidly dislodged by the evolution of o2 g bubbles produced from the electrochemical oxidation of h2o on ti iro2 in the fe ti iro2 system ϕ decreased only by 5 13 which is attributable to the interruption of coagulant production whenever the ti iro2 electrode served as an anode 13 3 of the overall operating time from the operational perspective this slightly lower ϕ could be outweighed by the potential benefits that the diminished electrode fouling may provide e g lower ohmic drop sustained coagulant production less frequent replacement of electrodes in contrast ϕ in the al ti iro2 system decreased by 40 60 compared with ϕ in the al dc ec counterpart this significant decrease of ϕ in the al ti iro2 system highlights the importance of the chemical dissolution of the al cathode in the al dc ec system to the overall coagulant production it also suggests that the al ti iro2 system might not be an attractive alternative to conventional al ec systems considering that the amount of energy consumed in the former system is only 10 20 lower compare ucell 7 2 7 6 v of the al ti iro2 system figure 6c versus ucell 8 0 8 5 v of the al pr ec f 10 min figure 4a of all the al ec systems tested in this study the al pr ec f 10 min appeared to provide the greatest balance of high coagulant production efficiency reduced energy consumption and diminished electrode fouling 5 conclusions this study compared the performance of fe and al electrocoagulation systems that operated in the direct current and polarity reversal modes by systematically examining the effects of electrode type current density and polarity reversal frequency on the coagulant production efficiency electrode fouling energy consumption and anodic potential the following insights have been gained under the experimental conditions employed in this study fe ec operated in the polarity reversal mode consumed more energy but generated less coagulant than the fe dc ec counterpart the fouling of the fe electrodes also were not reduced under all conditions which is contrary to what has been suggested in the literature in general polarity reversal was beneficial to the performance of al ec in all but two experiments the coagulant production of al pr ec was comparable to that of al dc ec notably al pr ec systems consumed less energy and did not suffer from electrode fouling to the same extent as al dc ec under a rapid rate of polarity reversal f 0 5 mins the coagulant production efficiency decreased by as much as 90 in fe ec and by 40 75 in al ec this decrease was attributable to electrochemical side reactions e g the oxidation of adsorbed h2 g the retardation of the fe and al ion migration into the bulk solution and the precipitation of these ions on the electrodes it is suspected that because of these same reasons the coagulant production efficiencies in ec systems operated with alternating current ac ec were lower than those of dc ec cerqueira et al 2014 karamati niaragh et al 2019 in ac ec systems the migration of fe and al ions into the bulk solution is expected to be further retarded since the current direction is constantly changing an ec system that employed a fe anode and a ti iro2 cathode and operated under the dc mode with an occasional current switching was shown to result in not only effective coagulant production but also minimal electrode fouling this combined fe ti iro2 electrode system has the potential to be an effective ec configuration as a concluding remark we note that all experiments in this study were conducted under a similar flow dynamics and employed one solution formulation since the nature of the fouling layer and the coagulant production efficiency are dependent on the solution composition e g the corrosion of fe is accelerated by cl but inhibited by oxyanions such as so4 2 and po4 3 lakshmipathiraj et al 2008 refaey 2005 van genuchten et al 2017 xu et al 2015b and cell design dubrawski mohseni 2013 mcbeath et al

17023,cyanobacterial blooms are increasingly reported worldwide presenting a challenge to water treatment plants and concerning risks to human health and aquatic ecosystems advanced oxidative processes comprise efficient and safe methods for water treatment hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been proposed as a sustainable solution to mitigate bloom forming cyanobacteria since this group presents a higher sensitivity compared to other phytoplankton with no major risks to the environment at low concentrations here we evaluated the effects of a single h2o2 addition 10 mg l 1 over 120 h in mesocosms introduced in a reservoir located in a semi arid region presenting a planktothrix dominated cyanobacterial bloom we followed changes in physical and chemical parameters and in the bacterioplankton composition h2o2 efficiently suppressed cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms over 72 h leading to an increase in transparency and dissolved organic carbon and a decrease in dissolved oxygen and ph while nutrient concentrations were not affected after 120 h cyanobacterial abundance remained low and green algae became dominant 16s rrna sequencing revealed that the original cyanobacterial bloom was composed by planktothrix cyanobium and microcystis only cyanobium increased in relative abundance at 120 h suggesting regrowth a prominent change in the composition of heterotrophic bacteria was observed with exiguobacterium paracoccus and deinococcus becoming the most abundant genera after the h2o2 treatment our results indicate that this approach is efficient in suppressing cyanobacterial blooms and improving water quality in tropical environments monitoring changes in abiotic parameters and the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa could be used to anticipate the regrowth of cyanobacteria after h2o2 degradation and to indicate where in the reservoir h2o2 should be applied so the effects are still felt in the water treatment plant intake graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality cyanobacteria advanced oxidative process remediation metagenomics exiguobacterium 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater are directly related to anthropogenic eutrophication and represent a major concern for drinking water supply pearl and otten 2013 codd et al 2016 huisman et al 2018 the ideal solution to this situation is an effective control of nutrient inputs from watersheds paerl 2017 however this is a challenging and long term measure as a short term alternative advanced oxidative processes aops have been proposed to control cyanobacterial blooms due to the speed efficiency and harmless by products generated matthijs et al 2012 pestana et al 2015 weenink et al 2015 menezes et al 2020 studies in temperate regions have demonstrated the effect of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 on phytoplankton community promoting eukaryotic organisms over cyanobacteria matthijs et al 2012 lurling et al 2014 weenink et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the use of h2o2 either in laboratory scale experiments weenink et al 2015 or in situ application in a eutrophic lake matthijs et al 2012 resulted in the selective control of cyanobacteria in planktothrix dominated phytoplankton communities with no major effects on eukaryotic phytoplankton or zooplankton the higher sensitivity of cyanobacteria to h2o2 compared to eukaryotic phototrophs can be explained by the absence of compartmentalized organelles protected by membranes as well as the lack of mehler reaction as found in higher plants and algae latifi et al 2009 allahverdiyeva et al 2013 passardi et al 2007 this reaction consists of o2 reduction to superoxide anion o2 by electrons from photosystem i psi superoxide is then converted to h2o2 by superoxide dismutase and finally to water by peroxidase in cyanobacteria flavoproteins suppress o2 generation and the electrons from psi are donated to o2 producing h2o without the formation of reactive oxygen species ros latifi et al 2009 allahverdiyeva et al 2013 thus cyanobacteria do not possess an anti ros system as efficient as that of green algae and higher plants passardi et al 2007 in tropical regions the composition and biomass of cyanobacterial blooms can differ from those in temperate regions and tend to last longer due to extended warm periods and higher light intensity kosten et al 2011 pearl and paul 2012 paerl et al 2017 huisman et al 2018 vanderley et al 2021 the efficiency of h2o2 is influenced by light intensity and nutrient availability piel et al 2019 sandrini et al 2020 it is also dependent on h2o2 decomposition and its residence time in water matthijs et al 2012 weenink et al 2015 which can be affected either by biotic factors such as phytoplankton and bacterioplankton composition or abiotic factors as water reductive power affected by dissolved solutes or organic matter arvin and pedersen 2015 weenink et al 2015 in general all these factors might be considerably different comparing temperate to tropical zones sobek et al 2007 kosten et al 2011 carrasco navas parejo et al 2020 toming et al 2020 vanderley et al 2021 but investigations on the efficiency of h2o2 in suppressing cyanobacteria in tropical aquatic environments are scarce although the effect of h2o2 against phytoplankton is well established the treatment outcome for the bacterioplankton is less investigated but this community can contribute to h2o2 decomposition and affect cyanobacterial control recently lusty and gobler 2020 evaluated the effect of h2o2 4 mg l 1 on cyanobacteria and the overall microbial community in laboratory scale experiments using environmental samples from four eutrophic lakes in the united states they observed a variable reduction in the relative abundance of cyanobacteria 29 85 accompanied by a decrease on actinobacteria and an increase in bacteroidetes and proteobacteria bacteria vary in their susceptibility to ros depending on both enzymatic and non defense mechanisms daly 2009 thus changes in bacterioplankton composition according to their antioxidant defenses are expected as a result of h2o2 application which can influence its residence time and its efficiency in mitigating cyanobacteria due to eutrophication water quality in artificial reservoirs in the semi arid region is deteriorating to a point where conventional water treatment plants wtp are not technically or economically able to process raw water into the brazilian drinking standards barros et al 2020 high amounts of particulate or dissolved organic matter produced mostly by phytoplankton pestana et al 2019 overload the treatment steps increasing the amount of chemicals needed frequency of settling tank discharge and filter wash and ultimately decreasing wtp efficiency and finished water quality barros et al 2020 thus h2o2 could be used as a cheap and easy pre treatment method for cyanobacteria control before water treatment despite the widespread occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in tropical regions the effectiveness of h2o2 to suppress that in natural phytoplankton communities has still not been accessed the effect of h2o2 on co occurring heterotrophic bacteria must also be considered besides their role on h2o2 degradation changes in the composition of microbial communities can potentially affect biogeochemical cycles nutrient availability water quality and the aquatic ecosystem balance in a previous study using h2o2 10 mg l 1 we observed the suppression of a planktothrix dominated cyanobacterial community in laboratory scale experiments with no effects on eukaryotic phototrophs using raw water from a reservoir in the brazilian semi arid region rocha 2020 to further characterize the effects of h2o2 over phytoplankton communities and to simulate the treatment in a natural environment we tested 10 mg l 1 h2o2 in a mesocosm system installed into a reservoir used for drinking water supply in the brazilian semi arid region we assessed physical and chemical parameters for freshwater quality and also the effect of h2o2 on the bacterioplankton community composition over time we hypothesized that the treatment would be effective in suppressing cyanobacteria but would also affect the associated heterotrophic bacterioplankton altering the proportion of susceptible resistant bacterial species 2 methodology 2 1 study area this study was performed in gavião reservoir 3 59 03 s 38 37 13 w altitude of 65 m relative to the sea level this is a semi arid region with high solar radiation reaching

mesocosms experimental set up and water sampling mesocosm experiments were carried out from 15 february to 20 february 2019 in the gavião reservoir six impermeable and semi transparent plastic bags were built in a cylindrical shape with 2 m length and 1 5 m diameter 3 5 m³ mesocosms were filled with about 3000 l of water the whole structure was located in the lacustrine zone of the gavião reservoir with an average depth of 10 m near to the water treatment plant intake point mesocosms and full scale structures in the water can be seen in supplementary figure 1 the water column depth 1 5 m in the mesocosms was previously established to ensure that the experiment took place in the euphotic zone the extent of the euphotic zone was calculated by multiplying the value of secchi s disk depth by the k factor of 3 frequently used for tropical waters in brazil esteves 2011 mesocosms were set as control with no h2o2 n 3 and as treatment condition n 3 consisting of a single addition of h2o2 10 mg l 1 the experiment was maintained for 120 h 5 days and water samples were taken immediately before the application of h2o2 t0 and at times 24 72 and 120 h for each sampling time biotic

and wills 1948 the degradation of h2o2 was estimated at each sampling time using a semi quantitative method with colorimetric strips mquant peroxide test merck as a pragmatic approach focusing on the impact on all tested parameters before and after h2o2 consumed rather than on its kinetics of degradation all samples were collected around 9 00 am the same time of h2o2 application at the beginning of the experiment we used a van dorn bottle to collect water from the center of the mesocosm in a depth of 75 cm each sample was placed in a 1 l amber glass flask refrigerated and transported to the laboratory 2 3 biological parameters 2 3 1 chlorophyll a concentration the chlorophyll a concentration was estimated using a phyto pam ii phytoplankton analyzer walz germany with different wavelengths

manufacturer dna purification amplification of the v4 region of the bacterial 16s rdna gene 16s rrna and the preparation of dna libraries were performed as described in santos et al 2020 2 3 2 2 sequencing and bioinformatics analysis sequencing procedures illumina and initial bioinformatics steps such as quality trimming and alignment of resulting sequences were performed according to santos et al 2020 chimeras were detected using vsearch and then excluded rognes et al 2016 taxonomic classification was carried out using the silva database quast et al 2013 with a confidence threshold of 80 sequences not assigned as bacteria or classified as chloroplast mitochondria archaea or unknown were discharged taxa with only one or two sequences were removed the total number of sequences in each sample was randomly normalized to equal that of the sample with the lower number of sequences then the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using a sequence similarity cut off of 97 the taxonomic assignment of otus was performed according to silva database v138 release date december 16 2019 the composition of microbial communities was evaluated according to the relative abundance of taxa phylum and order levels considering only those otus that contributed more than 1 to total sequences a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and clustering dendrogram were applied to ordinate the 22 samples based on otu composition using a dissimilarity matrix based on bray curtis distance rarefaction curves as well as shannon diversity index sobs richness and evenness were calculated for each sample using mothur v1 43 software schloss et al 2009 sequence information for this project is available at the ncbi database bioproject accession number prjna659532 2 4

to the differentiation between treatment and control over time from this the statistical analysis consisted of a two tailed nonparametric kruskal wallis test and an unpaired wilcoxon test to reveal significant differences in most abundant otus comparing treatment and control considering all replicates over time we also used a similarity percentage analysis simper clarke 1993 to select the main

changed over time after h2o2 treatment fig 3 supplementary table 3 the original community was mainly composed of actinobacteria 21 cyanobacteria 20 plantomycetes 15 and proteobacteria 11 followed by verrucomicrobia 9 chloroflexi 8 and bacteroidetes 7 very few changes were observed in the control over time an increase of cyanobacteria relative abundance occurred at 24 h 25 and 72 h 27 and then returning at 120 h to a value similar to the initial abundance actinobacteria relative abundance continuously decreased reaching 11 at 120 h while verrucomicrobia increased to 21 at the final time conversely the composition of bacterioplankton in the treatment was completely modified samples collected at 24 and 72 h were more similar showing a notable expansion of firmicutes from 0 2 at time 0 to 40 50 other phyla that increased in abundance in these samples were deinococcus from 0 01 at time 0 to 7 11 and proteobacteria from 11 at time 0 to 17 23 in parallel actinobacteria verrucomicrobia planctomycetes and chloroflexi decreased in abundance at 120 h bacterioplankton profile in h2o2 samples was dissimilar from time 0 and from the control at this time including dominant phyla such as bacteroidetes 19 verrucomicrobia 24 as well as proteobacteria 26 fig 3 3 3 3 effect of h2o2 on cyanobacteria the h2o2 treatment decreased the relative abundance of cyanobacteria from 20 at t0 to about 1 at 24 and 72h and 7 at 120 h the otu composition within the cyanobacterial community was also affected by the treatment fig 4 cyanobium planktothrix and microcystis were the dominant genera in the original cyanobacterial community accounting for 30 27 and 16 respectively fig 4 in the control they remained as the main genera until the end of the experiment in the treated water in which a drastic decline in cyanobacterial abundance was observed microcystis was dominant accounting for 60 of all cyanobacterial otus at 24 h while cyanobium corresponded to 20 from 72 h to 120 h microcystis abundance decreased 10 and 5 respectively while cyanobium abundance increased 53 and 64 respectively planktothrix abundance remained low after the treatment 4 8 thus at the end of the experiment when cyanobacterial abundance tended to increase the community composition differed from the original one fig 4 3 3 4 bacterial taxa distinguishing control and h2o2 treatment to highlight the main bacterioplankton taxa associated with the differentiation between control and treatment regardless of time we performed lda and lefse analysis using the relative abundances of otus as input considering the lda score log10 with a cut off of 3 0 we selected 67 otus that contributed to the discrimination of treatment and control supplementary figure 6 among them the most representative taxa in the control condition were an unclassified genus from chthoniobacteraceae 4 and terrimicrobium sp 3 and the cyanobacterial genera planktothrix 6 10 microcystis 3 cyanobium 3 and raphidiopsis cylindrospermopsis 1 fig 5 a f the dominant genera in the treatment condition were exiguobacterium deinococcus paracoccus and rhizobium fig 5g i at 24 and 72 h the relative abundance of exiguobacterium reached 40 50 paracoccus corresponded to 4 9 and deinococcus had an abundance of 10 while their abundance was close to zero in the control condition or at time 0 t0 fig 5g i other taxa predominant in the control condition were mycobacterium and unclassified genera of solirubrobacterales caldilineaceae chloroflexaceae and pirellulaceae supplementary figure 6 we also selected the main otus represented in the h2o2 treatment condition after 120 h to characterize the bacterioplankton composition after h2o2 degradation according to the lefse analysis the five most relevant were luteolibacter sp 15 exiguobacterium sp 5 comamonadaceae unclassified 3 spirosomaceae sp 3 and prosthecobacter sp 3 supplementary figure 7 3 3 5 correlation between bacterial groups and physical chemical parameters we selected the main otus that contributed to the difference between control and treatment at each sampling time according to simper analysis supplementary table 4 and tested their correlation with limnological parameters chlorophyll groups and abiotic factors affected by the h2o2 treatment table 2 cca ordination fig 6 showed that all sampling times in the control condition

planktothrix agardhii and raphidiopsis raciborskii barros et al 2019 in this study h2o2 was applied in mesocosm scale to mitigate a cyanobacterial bloom and to improve water quality parameters simultaneously we investigated the effect of this treatment on the composition of the bacterioplankton community a single concentration of 10 mg l 1 h2o2 was added and biotic and abiotic parameters were monitored over 120 h five days studies reported that 5 mg l 1 of h2o2 would be enough to control cyanobacteria in a freshwater environment matthijs et al 2012 weenink et al 2015 the concentration used here 10 mg l 1 was based on a previous experiment performed in microcosm scale using water from gavião reservoir considering its hypereutrophic state and high organic carbon content this concentration suppressed cyanobacteria with less effect on eukaryotic phytoplankton rocha 2020 although cyanobacteria is selectively affected by h2o2 compared to other phytoplankton attention must be paid not to harm other organisms such as zooplankton reichwaldt et al 2012 spoof et al 2020 spoof et al showed the vulnerability of different classes of zooplankton from lake köyliönjärvi finland after exposure to 10 and 20 mg l 1 h2o2 zooplankton sensitivity can vary depending on the species and this issue should be evaluated in case of in situ application of h2o2 for cyanobacterial control the efficiency of h2o2 for cyanobacterial suppression in situ depends on its degradation time which is affected by organic carbon concentration and bacterioplankton density and composition weenink et al 2015 fan et al 2019 using water samples from lake taihu found that 10 mg l 1 effectively inhibited the growth of cyanobacteria over 15 days leading to the dominance of eukaryotic green algae but with no information regarding h2o2 degradation time curiously in lake taihu doc concentrations vary from 2 to 8 mg l 1 according to site or season two or three times less than doc in gavião reservoir ye et al 2011 2015 huang et al 2017 even so in gavião reservoir 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 suppressed cyanobacteria over 120 h a reduced time compared with those studies that applied 10 mg l 1 or less in lower organic carbon concentration environments matthijs et al 2012 weenink et al 2015 fan et al 2019 in our experiment h2o2 was not detected from 72 h on after that cyanobacteria remained less abundant in the treatment than the control but a slight increase was observed at 120 h according to chlorophyll and 16s rrna sequencing analysis doc concentration decreased at 72 h in the treatment condition compared to the control which could be associated to photodegradation or microbial activity ye et al 2015 huang et al 2017 although no bacterial otu was correlated to this decrease apart from cyanobacteria eukaryotic phytoplankton was also initially suppressed by h2o2 treatment but green algae dominated after h2o2 degradation this evidence a higher sensitivity of cyanobacteria to the treatment or a higher recovery adaptability of green algae barrington et al 2013 yang et al 2018 lusty and gobler 2020 sinhá et al 2018 observed that a decrease of cyanobacteria biomass was followed by an increase in the abundance of eukaryotic diatom synedra sp and green algae cladophora sp suggesting that these species benefited from the collapse of cyanobacteria and utilized the available nutrients in another study where a microcystis aeruginosa bloom was suppressed with h2o2 application growth of chlorophyte chlamydomonas spp was promoted wang et al 2019 although the composition of the eukaryotic phytoplankton was not evaluated in our experiment aulacoseira sp and fragilaria sp were identified as the main diatom species in the raw water and the cyanobacteria planktothrix and raphidiopsis were present at the time of the study cagece internal reports february 2019 along with phytoplankton suppression transparency increased after h2o2 application and was correlated to cyanobacterial chlorophyll over time differently from other studies matthijs et al 2012 sinhá et al 2018 thus in our case the use of high h2o2 concentrations improved water quality parameters do concentrations decreased at 72 h which could be related to the collapse of cyanobacteria and reduced photosynthetic activity leading to lower oxygen production crafton et al 2019 other studies in freshwater environments suggested that increases in ph and do can be attributed to cyanobacterial growth in massive blooms and high nutrient levels paerl et al 2001 gao et al 2012 h2o2 based treatment has been described to trigger re oligotrophication leading to an alternative equilibrium in the environment matthijs et al 2012 but in our case no changes were observed in nutrient concentration as a result of h2o2 addition many studies have observed an increase in nutrient availability after h2o2 treatment with an increase in phosphate and ammonia that could be related to microbial cell lysis matthijs et al 2012 bauzá et al 2014 sinhá et al 2018 the maintenance or increase in nutrient availability would favor cyanobacterial regrowth over time paerl and otten 2013 huisman et al 2018 furthermore changes in nutrient concentrations could be associated with the species composition of the cyanobacterial bloom the redox potential of the water body and the growth of the associated microbial community after h2o2 degradation an increase in cyanobacterial biomass and in the relative abundance of sequences was observed at 120 h suggesting regrowth with a different community composition from the original one cyanobium was the main genus dominating the cyanobacterial community in the treated mesocosms but sequences from planktothrix and microcystis were also detected picoplankton cyanobacteria like cyanobium 0 2 2 µm are abundant but underestimated in freshwater systems either in oligo mesotrophic or hypereutrophic conditions callieri 2008 gaysina et al 2019 cabello yeves et al 2017 guedes et al 2018 representative species of picocyanobacteria can reach a growth rate of 0 5 d 1 in oligotrophic marine environments cruz and neuer 2019 in our experiment as the cyanobacterial bloom was suppressed by h2o2 cyanobium with its relatively faster growth rate may have benefited from the alleviation of competition and the availability of nutrients callieri 2010 leblanc et al 2018 thus long term microscopy analysis chlorophyll measurements and molecular tools would be important to monitor the development of the remaining cyanobacterial community and optimize mitigation strategies besides cyanobacteria the abundance of other phyla decreased after the h2o2 treatment this was the case of actinobacteria verrucomicrobia planctomycetes and chloroflexi indicating that members of these phyla were also sensitive to the oxidative process conversely some bacterial taxa were resistant to the h2o2 treatment including firmicutes proteobacteria and deinoccoci members paracoccus and deinococcus contributed in similar proportions to the bacterial communities of treated samples 24 and 72 h members from both genera are known to produce enzymes involved in bacterial defense against the deleterious effects of oxidative stress wang and schellhorn 1995 baker et al 1998 deinococcus is known for its capacity to survive in diverse extreme environmental conditions such as ionization uv radiation and desiccation daly 2009 ionization and uv radiation can mediate and intensify the production of ros deinococcus radiodurans cells have high catalase activity and increase it when exposed to h2o2 when pre treated with sub lethal doses of h2o2 cells became resistant to higher concentrations of h2o2 and also more resistant to uv light and γ rays showing the potential to enhance survival to diverse stress factors wang and schellhorn 1995 slade and radman 2011 the main genus in the treatment condition was exiguobacterium and its cosmopolitan distribution may be related to an adaptability to extreme environmental conditions including high uv intensity strahsburger et al 2018 an inherent characteristic of this genus is the intense activity of catalase yumoto et al 2004 takebe et al 2007 strains from this genus present the complete pathway for carotenoid c30 synthesis white et al 2019 which might contribute to ros quenching as well as protect against photo damage exiguobacterium showed a positive correlation with transparency a consequence of the collapse of cyanobacteria tian et al 2012 showed that an extract of exiguobacterium sp had an intense algicidal activity against cyanobacteria inhibiting the growth of planktothrix synechococcus and chroococcus in 2 days without activity against green algae after h2o2 degradation exiguobacterium abundance decreased and cyanobium dominated the cyanobacterial community a major contributor at this later time was luteolibacter that increased in abundance compared to the control condition a correlation between this genus and picocyanobacteria has been previously reported during a synechococcus dominated cyanobacterial bloom guedes et al 2018 additionally cardman et al 2014 suggested that members of verrucomicrobia including luteolibacter sp could be involved in algal polysaccharide degradation in marine environments these results indicate that further investigation using metagenomics approaches can confirm the prevalence of specific bacterial taxa after the oxidizing process and subsequent compositional changes that precede cyanobacterial regrowth in this scenario it is important to know resistant bacteria that dominate the bacterioplankton after an oxidizing treatment for water treatment purposes since they could imply risks for water consumption additionally understanding the dynamics of microbial communities after h2o2 treatment could reveal bacterial taxa potentially useful in biomonitoring conditions before the return of cyanobacterial blooms we did not evaluate the potential effects of h2o2 on cyanobacterial toxins since none of the routinely monitored cyanotoxins microcystin saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin were detected before and throughout the experimental procedure cagece internal reports 2019 document no 5 annex 20 health ministry brazil brazil 2017 although the efficiency of h2o2 to eliminate microcystin has been observed both in situ matthijs et al 2012 and in cyanobacterial cultures huo et al 2015 menezes et al 2020 other studies reported toxin remaining lürling et al 2014 spoof et al 2020 in case the toxins released over h2o2 process and not chemically or biologically degraded are still present at the wtp intake then other steps could be adopted at wtp for complete removal such as activated carbon adsorption or chemical oxidation the advantage of the h2o2 treatment is that it does not need new infrastructure added to the wtp and can be applied to a small part of the reservoir close to the intake only when raw water quality worsens to a certain threshold 5 conclusion we evaluated the effects of h2o2 on phytoplankton bacterioplankton and abiotic parameters using a mesocosm system into a hypereutrophic reservoir located in a semi arid region subjected to high irradiance high temperature and presenting a high carbon content along with improving water quality a single application of 10 mg l 1 h2o2 suppressed the phytoplankton community over 72h with a subsequent dominance of green algae after h2o2 degradation the original planktothrix dominated cyanobacterial bloom was suppressed and an increase of cyanobium sp was apparent this suggests regrowth of cyanobacteria linked to the availability of nutrients the heterotrophic bacterial community composition changed over time and was dominated by taxa that presented resistance to h2o2 particularly exiguobacterium thus h2o2 imposes a stress condition upon the bacterioplankton with strong compositional changes in the relative abundances of diverse phyla longer observation periods are needed to determine the time of the return of a cyanobacterial bloom after h2o2 degradation our results suggest that monitoring abiotic parameters and the relative abundance of specific taxa could be used to anticipate the regrowth of cyanobacteria an important aspect to observe for the success of this process is where to apply h2o2 so that its effects are still felt in the wtp intake for that in addition to the knowledge of for how long the water quality improvement lasts a study of the reservoir hydrodynamics residence time preferential pathways is needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17023,cyanobacterial blooms are increasingly reported worldwide presenting a challenge to water treatment plants and concerning risks to human health and aquatic ecosystems advanced oxidative processes comprise efficient and safe methods for water treatment hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been proposed as a sustainable solution to mitigate bloom forming cyanobacteria since this group presents a higher sensitivity compared to other phytoplankton with no major risks to the environment at low concentrations here we evaluated the effects of a single h2o2 addition 10 mg l 1 over 120 h in mesocosms introduced in a reservoir located in a semi arid region presenting a planktothrix dominated cyanobacterial bloom we followed changes in physical and chemical parameters and in the bacterioplankton composition h2o2 efficiently suppressed cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms over 72 h leading to an increase in transparency and dissolved organic carbon and a decrease in dissolved oxygen and ph while nutrient concentrations were not affected after 120 h cyanobacterial abundance remained low and green algae became dominant 16s rrna sequencing revealed that the original cyanobacterial bloom was composed by planktothrix cyanobium and microcystis only cyanobium increased in relative abundance at 120 h suggesting regrowth a prominent change in the composition of heterotrophic bacteria was observed with exiguobacterium paracoccus and deinococcus becoming the most abundant genera after the h2o2 treatment our results indicate that this approach is efficient in suppressing cyanobacterial blooms and improving water quality in tropical environments monitoring changes in abiotic parameters and the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa could be used to anticipate the regrowth of cyanobacteria after h2o2 degradation and to indicate where in the reservoir h2o2 should be applied so the effects are still felt in the water treatment plant intake graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality cyanobacteria advanced oxidative process remediation metagenomics exiguobacterium 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater are directly related to anthropogenic eutrophication and represent a major concern for drinking water supply pearl and otten 2013 codd et al 2016 huisman et al 2018 the ideal solution to this situation is an effective control of nutrient inputs from watersheds paerl 2017 however this is a challenging and long term measure as a short term alternative advanced oxidative processes aops have been proposed to control cyanobacterial blooms due to the speed efficiency and harmless by products generated matthijs et al 2012 pestana et al 2015 weenink et al 2015 menezes et al 2020 studies in temperate regions have demonstrated the effect of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 on phytoplankton community promoting eukaryotic organisms over cyanobacteria matthijs et al 2012 lurling et al 2014 weenink et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the use of h2o2 either in laboratory scale experiments weenink et al 2015 or in situ application in a eutrophic lake matthijs et al 2012 resulted in the selective control of cyanobacteria in planktothrix dominated phytoplankton communities with no major effects on eukaryotic phytoplankton or zooplankton the higher sensitivity of cyanobacteria to h2o2 compared to eukaryotic phototrophs can be explained by the absence of compartmentalized organelles protected by membranes as well as the lack of mehler reaction as found in higher plants and algae latifi et al 2009 allahverdiyeva et al 2013 passardi et al 2007 this reaction consists of o2 reduction to superoxide anion o2 by electrons from photosystem i psi superoxide is then converted to h2o2 by superoxide dismutase and finally to water by peroxidase in cyanobacteria flavoproteins suppress o2 generation and the electrons from psi are donated to o2 producing h2o without the formation of reactive oxygen species ros latifi et al 2009 allahverdiyeva et al 2013 thus cyanobacteria do not possess an anti ros system as efficient as that of green algae and higher plants passardi et al 2007 in tropical regions the composition and biomass of cyanobacterial blooms can differ from those in temperate regions and tend to last longer due to extended warm periods and higher light intensity kosten et al 2011 pearl and paul 2012 paerl et al 2017 huisman et al 2018 vanderley et al 2021 the efficiency of h2o2 is influenced by light intensity and nutrient availability piel et al 2019 sandrini et al 2020 it is also dependent on h2o2 decomposition and its residence time in water matthijs et al 2012 weenink et al 2015 which can be affected either by biotic factors such as phytoplankton and bacterioplankton composition or abiotic factors as water reductive power affected by dissolved solutes or organic matter arvin and pedersen 2015 weenink et al 2015 in general all these factors might be considerably different comparing temperate to tropical zones sobek et al 2007 kosten et al 2011 carrasco navas parejo et al 2020 toming et al 2020 vanderley et al 2021 but investigations on the efficiency of h2o2 in suppressing cyanobacteria in tropical aquatic environments are scarce although the effect of h2o2 against phytoplankton is well established the treatment outcome for the bacterioplankton is less investigated but this community can contribute to h2o2 decomposition and affect cyanobacterial control recently lusty and gobler 2020 evaluated the effect of h2o2 4 mg l 1 on cyanobacteria and the overall microbial community in laboratory scale experiments using environmental samples from four eutrophic lakes in the united states they observed a variable reduction in the relative abundance of cyanobacteria 29 85 accompanied by a decrease on actinobacteria and an increase in bacteroidetes and proteobacteria bacteria vary in their susceptibility to ros depending on both enzymatic and non defense mechanisms daly 2009 thus changes in bacterioplankton composition according to their antioxidant defenses are expected as a result of h2o2 application which can influence its residence time and its efficiency in mitigating cyanobacteria due to eutrophication water quality in artificial reservoirs in the semi arid region is deteriorating to a point where conventional water treatment plants wtp are not technically or economically able to process raw water into the brazilian drinking standards barros et al 2020 high amounts of particulate or dissolved organic matter produced mostly by phytoplankton pestana et al 2019 overload the treatment steps increasing the amount of chemicals needed frequency of settling tank discharge and filter wash and ultimately decreasing wtp efficiency and finished water quality barros et al 2020 thus h2o2 could be used as a cheap and easy pre treatment method for cyanobacteria control before water treatment despite the widespread occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in tropical regions the effectiveness of h2o2 to suppress that in natural phytoplankton communities has still not been accessed the effect of h2o2 on co occurring heterotrophic bacteria must also be considered besides their role on h2o2 degradation changes in the composition of microbial communities can potentially affect biogeochemical cycles nutrient availability water quality and the aquatic ecosystem balance in a previous study using h2o2 10 mg l 1 we observed the suppression of a planktothrix dominated cyanobacterial community in laboratory scale experiments with no effects on eukaryotic phototrophs using raw water from a reservoir in the brazilian semi arid region rocha 2020 to further characterize the effects of h2o2 over phytoplankton communities and to simulate the treatment in a natural environment we tested 10 mg l 1 h2o2 in a mesocosm system installed into a reservoir used for drinking water supply in the brazilian semi arid region we assessed physical and chemical parameters for freshwater quality and also the effect of h2o2 on the bacterioplankton community composition over time we hypothesized that the treatment would be effective in suppressing cyanobacteria but would also affect the associated heterotrophic bacterioplankton altering the proportion of susceptible resistant bacterial species 2 methodology 2 1 study area this study was performed in gavião reservoir 3 59 03 s 38 37 13 w altitude of 65 m relative to the sea level this is a semi arid region with high solar radiation reaching

mesocosms experimental set up and water sampling mesocosm experiments were carried out from 15 february to 20 february 2019 in the gavião reservoir six impermeable and semi transparent plastic bags were built in a cylindrical shape with 2 m length and 1 5 m diameter 3 5 m³ mesocosms were filled with about 3000 l of water the whole structure was located in the lacustrine zone of the gavião reservoir with an average depth of 10 m near to the water treatment plant intake point mesocosms and full scale structures in the water can be seen in supplementary figure 1 the water column depth 1 5 m in the mesocosms was previously established to ensure that the experiment took place in the euphotic zone the extent of the euphotic zone was calculated by multiplying the value of secchi s disk depth by the k factor of 3 frequently used for tropical waters in brazil esteves 2011 mesocosms were set as control with no h2o2 n 3 and as treatment condition n 3 consisting of a single addition of

and wills 1948 the degradation of h2o2 was estimated at each sampling time using a semi quantitative method with colorimetric strips mquant peroxide test merck as a pragmatic approach focusing on the impact on all tested parameters before and after h2o2 consumed rather than on its kinetics of degradation all samples were collected around 9 00 am the same time of h2o2 application at the beginning of the experiment we used a van dorn bottle to collect water from the center of the mesocosm in a depth of 75 cm each sample was placed in a 1 l amber glass flask refrigerated and transported to the

off of 97 the taxonomic assignment of otus was performed according to silva database v138 release date december 16 2019 the composition of microbial communities was evaluated according to the relative abundance of taxa phylum and order levels considering only those otus that contributed more than 1 to total sequences a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and clustering dendrogram were applied

canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to associate limnological parameters with the major otus corresponding to those selected by simper analysis and presenting a relative contribution higher than 1 or cumulative contribution of 50 or more at each sampling time 24 72 or 120 h all three phytoplankton groups cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms and abiotic parameters that presented statistical differences comparing treatment and control were used the cca chart was represented using the past3 software hammer et al 2001 a correlation matrix using spearman p 0 01 and a threshold for r value 0 6 was constructed to calculate significant associations among abiotic and biotic parameters included in the cca 3 results 3 1 abiotic parameters in a multivariate analysis including all parameters tested here the h2o2 treatment influenced abiotic parameters and chlorophyll from phytoplankton commonly known as limnological parameters used as water quality indicators as supported by permanova analysis p 0 02 f 25 20 with a great interaction between time and condition p 0 024 f 4 0793 h2o2 was no longer detected in the mesocosms after 72 h data not shown both transparency p 0 0001

cyanobacteria p 0 0001 f 21 45 green algae p 0 0001 f 58 38 and diatoms p 0 0001 f 24 97 cyanobacteria showed the highest chlorophyll value at t0 35 µg l 1 and decreased consistently over time compared to the control condition at 72 h cyanobacteria could not be detected fig 2 a green algae chlorophyll also decreased significantly at 72 h p 0 0003 for both reduced by 50 however at 120 h a substantial increase in green algal biomass by chlorophyll estimation was observed p 0 03 reaching about 25 µg l 1 while in the control it remained at 13 µg l 1 fig 2b the initial chlorophyll concentration of diatoms was 1 µg l 1 and this group could not be detected at 24 h in the treatment condition p 0 04 but subsequently increased at 120 h reaching a biomass three times higher than the control fig 2c in the treated water green algae biomass was higher than in the control at 120 h while the inverse was observed for cyanobacteria suggesting a substitution in dominance 3 3 effect of h2o2 on bacterioplankton 3 3 1 bacterial diversity and ordination after normalization 32221 sequences were considered in each sample to describe the bacterial communities supplementary table 1 the sample t3m5 no h2o2 at 72 h was lost during dna processing and could not be analyzed rarefaction curves approached saturation with coverage of bacterial diversity reaching 97 98 for all samples supplementary table 1 and supplementary figure 2 clustering of samples revealed an average similarity of 60 within the control and treatment groups and a dissimilarity of 70 80 between them supplementary figure 3 considering shannon diversity index and sobs richness estimation h2o2 did not affect richness at any time p 0 07 f 5 58 supplementary figure 4a but decreased community diversity p 0 001 f 63 51 at 24 and 72 h compared to the control condition supplementary figure 4b thus compositional changes occurred in bacterial communities after h2o2 addition without a decrease in the number of species ordination of samples corresponding to treatment and control conditions over time was represented in non metric multidimensional scaling nmds samples corresponding to the two conditions distributed distantly and those corresponding to the treatment at different sampling times were also separated with each replicate grouped within its respective time supplementary figure 5 samples collected at 24 and 72 h after h2o2 addition were more similar than that recovered at 120 h these differences were confirmed by two way permanova for treatment vs control p 0 0001 f 26 562 and treatment over the time 24 72 120 h p 0 0001 f 4 516 with the interaction between these factors p 0 03 supplementary table 2 3 3 2 bacterioplankton composition the composition of bacterial communities changed over time after h2o2 treatment fig 3 supplementary table 3 the original community was mainly composed of actinobacteria 21 cyanobacteria 20 plantomycetes 15 and proteobacteria 11 followed by verrucomicrobia 9 chloroflexi 8 and bacteroidetes 7 very few changes were observed in the control over time an increase of cyanobacteria relative abundance occurred at 24 h 25 and 72 h 27 and then returning at 120 h to a value similar to the initial abundance actinobacteria relative abundance continuously decreased reaching 11 at 120 h while verrucomicrobia increased to 21 at the final time conversely the composition of bacterioplankton in the treatment was completely modified samples collected at 24 and 72 h were more similar showing a notable expansion of firmicutes from 0 2 at time 0 to 40 50 other phyla that increased in abundance in these samples were deinococcus from 0 01 at time 0 to 7 11 and proteobacteria from 11 at time 0 to 17 23 in parallel actinobacteria verrucomicrobia planctomycetes and chloroflexi decreased in abundance at 120 h bacterioplankton profile in h2o2 samples was dissimilar from time 0 and from the control at this time including dominant phyla such as bacteroidetes 19 verrucomicrobia 24 as well as proteobacteria 26 fig 3 3 3 3 effect of h2o2 on cyanobacteria the h2o2 treatment decreased the relative abundance of cyanobacteria from 20 at t0 to about 1 at 24 and 72h and 7 at 120 h the otu composition within the cyanobacterial community was also affected by the treatment fig 4 cyanobium planktothrix and microcystis were the dominant genera in the original cyanobacterial community accounting for 30 27 and 16 respectively fig 4 in the control they remained as the main genera until the end of the experiment in the treated water in which a drastic decline in cyanobacterial abundance was observed microcystis was dominant accounting for 60 of all cyanobacterial otus at 24 h while cyanobium corresponded to 20 from 72 h to 120 h microcystis abundance decreased 10 and 5 respectively while cyanobium abundance increased 53 and 64 respectively planktothrix abundance remained low after the treatment 4 8 thus at the end of the experiment when cyanobacterial abundance tended to increase the community composition differed from the original one fig 4 3 3 4 bacterial taxa distinguishing control and h2o2 treatment to highlight the main bacterioplankton taxa associated with the differentiation between control and treatment regardless of time we performed lda and lefse analysis using the relative abundances of otus as input considering the lda score log10 with a cut off of 3 0 we selected 67 otus that contributed to the discrimination of treatment and control supplementary figure 6 among them the most representative taxa in the control condition were an unclassified genus from chthoniobacteraceae 4 and terrimicrobium sp 3 and the cyanobacterial genera planktothrix 6 10 microcystis 3 cyanobium 3 and raphidiopsis cylindrospermopsis 1 fig 5 a f the dominant genera in the treatment condition were exiguobacterium deinococcus paracoccus and rhizobium fig 5g i at 24 and 72 h the relative abundance of exiguobacterium reached 40 50 paracoccus corresponded to 4 9 and deinococcus had an abundance of 10 while their abundance was close to zero in the control condition or at time 0 t0 fig 5g i other taxa predominant in the control condition were mycobacterium and unclassified genera of solirubrobacterales caldilineaceae chloroflexaceae and pirellulaceae supplementary figure 6 we also selected the main otus represented in the h2o2 treatment condition after 120 h to characterize the bacterioplankton composition after h2o2 degradation according to the lefse analysis the five most relevant were luteolibacter sp 15 exiguobacterium sp 5 comamonadaceae unclassified 3 spirosomaceae sp 3 and prosthecobacter sp 3 supplementary figure 7 3 3 5 correlation between bacterial groups and physical chemical parameters we selected the main otus that contributed to the difference between control and treatment at each sampling time according to simper analysis supplementary table 4 and tested their correlation with limnological parameters chlorophyll groups and abiotic factors affected by the h2o2 treatment table 2 cca ordination fig 6 showed that all sampling times in the control condition

caldilineaceae member otu28 and a negative correlation with transparency supplementary table 5 as an early effect of h2o2 at 24 h transparency increased and cyanobacterial chlorophyll decreased and there was a significant positive correlation between transparency and exiguobacterium otu01 r 0 77 paracoccus otu05 r 0 8 and deinococcus otu08 r 0 79 fig 6 a significant negative correlation was estimated between these three otus and chlorophyll of cyanobacteria r 0 71 0 74 and 0 75 respectively fig 6 and supplementary table 5 at 72 h transparency and turbidity were still significantly different between experimental conditions and ph doc and do decreased in h2o2 samples compared to control table 2 in the treatment exiguobacterium otu01 paracoccus otu05 and deinococcus otu08 were still positively correlated with transparency r 0 77 0 80 and 0 79 respectively and also an unclassified sphingobacteriaceae otu25 r 0 66 fig 6 rhizobium otu39 and flavobacterium otu42 were positively correlated with transparency r 0 66 0 73 and 0 6 respectively and negatively correlated to the turbidity r 0 65 and 0 74 respectively and ph r 0 62 and 0 80 respectively flavobacterium otu42 p 0 0001 also showed a negative correlation with do r 0 75 no significant correlation was observed between any otu and doc fig 6 supplementary table 5 at 120 h transparency turbidity ph conductivity and

planktothrix agardhii and raphidiopsis raciborskii barros et al 2019 in this study h2o2 was applied in mesocosm scale to mitigate a cyanobacterial bloom and to improve water quality parameters simultaneously we investigated the effect of this treatment on the composition of the bacterioplankton community a single concentration of 10 mg l 1 h2o2 was added and biotic and abiotic parameters were monitored over 120 h five days studies reported that 5 mg l 1 of h2o2 would be enough to control cyanobacteria in a freshwater environment matthijs et al 2012 weenink et al 2015 the concentration used here 10 mg l 1 was based on a previous experiment performed in microcosm scale using water from gavião reservoir considering its hypereutrophic state and high organic carbon content this concentration suppressed cyanobacteria with less effect on eukaryotic phytoplankton rocha 2020 although cyanobacteria is selectively affected by h2o2 compared to other phytoplankton attention must be paid not to harm other organisms such as zooplankton reichwaldt et al 2012 spoof et al 2020 spoof et al showed the vulnerability of different classes of zooplankton from lake köyliönjärvi finland after exposure to 10 and 20 mg l 1 h2o2 zooplankton sensitivity can vary depending on the species and this issue should be evaluated in case of in situ application of h2o2 for cyanobacterial control the efficiency of h2o2 for cyanobacterial suppression in situ depends on its degradation time which is affected by organic carbon concentration and bacterioplankton density and composition weenink et al 2015 fan et al 2019 using water samples from lake taihu found that 10 mg l 1 effectively inhibited the growth of cyanobacteria over 15 days leading to the dominance of eukaryotic green algae but with no information regarding h2o2 degradation time curiously in lake taihu doc concentrations vary from 2 to 8 mg l 1 according to site or season two or three times less than doc in gavião reservoir ye et al 2011 2015 huang et al 2017 even so in gavião reservoir 10 mg l 1 of h2o2 suppressed cyanobacteria over 120 h a reduced time compared with those studies that applied 10 mg l 1 or less in lower organic carbon concentration environments matthijs et al 2012 weenink et al 2015 fan et al 2019 in our experiment h2o2 was not detected from 72 h on after that cyanobacteria remained less abundant in the treatment than the control but a slight increase was observed at 120 h according to chlorophyll and 16s rrna sequencing analysis doc concentration decreased at 72 h in the treatment condition compared to the control which could be associated to photodegradation or microbial activity ye et al 2015 huang et al 2017 although no bacterial otu was correlated to this decrease apart from cyanobacteria eukaryotic phytoplankton was also initially suppressed by h2o2 treatment but green algae dominated after h2o2 degradation this evidence a higher sensitivity of cyanobacteria to the treatment or a higher recovery adaptability of green algae barrington et al 2013 yang et al 2018 lusty and gobler 2020 sinhá et al 2018 observed that a decrease of cyanobacteria biomass was followed by an increase in the abundance of eukaryotic diatom synedra sp and green algae cladophora sp suggesting that these species benefited from the collapse of cyanobacteria and utilized the available nutrients in another study where a microcystis aeruginosa bloom was suppressed with h2o2 application growth of chlorophyte chlamydomonas spp was promoted wang et al 2019 although the composition of the eukaryotic phytoplankton was not evaluated in our experiment aulacoseira sp and fragilaria sp were identified as the main diatom species in the raw water and the cyanobacteria planktothrix and raphidiopsis were present at the time of the study cagece internal reports february 2019 along with phytoplankton suppression transparency increased after h2o2 application and was correlated to cyanobacterial chlorophyll over time differently from other studies matthijs et al 2012 sinhá et al 2018 thus in our case the use of high h2o2 concentrations improved water quality parameters do concentrations decreased at 72 h which could be related to the collapse of cyanobacteria and reduced photosynthetic activity leading to lower oxygen production crafton et al 2019 other studies in freshwater environments suggested that increases in ph and do can be attributed to cyanobacterial growth in massive blooms and high nutrient levels paerl et al 2001 gao et al 2012 h2o2 based treatment has been described to trigger re oligotrophication leading to an alternative equilibrium in the environment matthijs et al 2012 but in our case no changes were observed in nutrient concentration as a result of h2o2 addition many studies have observed an increase in nutrient availability after h2o2 treatment with an increase in phosphate and ammonia that could be related to microbial cell lysis matthijs et al 2012 bauzá et al 2014 sinhá et al 2018 the maintenance or increase in nutrient availability would favor cyanobacterial regrowth over time paerl and otten 2013 huisman et al 2018 furthermore changes in nutrient concentrations could be associated with the species composition of the cyanobacterial bloom the redox potential of the water body and the growth of the associated microbial community after h2o2 degradation an increase in cyanobacterial biomass and in the relative abundance of sequences was observed at 120 h suggesting regrowth with a different community composition from the original one cyanobium was the main genus dominating the cyanobacterial community in the treated mesocosms but sequences from planktothrix and microcystis were also detected picoplankton cyanobacteria like cyanobium 0 2 2 µm are abundant but underestimated in freshwater systems either in oligo mesotrophic or hypereutrophic conditions callieri 2008 gaysina et al 2019 cabello yeves et al 2017 guedes et al 2018 representative species of picocyanobacteria can reach a growth rate of 0 5 d 1 in oligotrophic marine environments cruz and neuer 2019 in our experiment as the cyanobacterial bloom was suppressed by h2o2 cyanobium with its relatively faster growth rate may have benefited from the alleviation of competition and the availability of nutrients callieri 2010 leblanc et al 2018 thus long term microscopy analysis chlorophyll measurements and molecular tools would be important to monitor the development of the remaining cyanobacterial community and optimize mitigation strategies besides cyanobacteria the abundance of other phyla decreased after the h2o2 treatment this was the case of actinobacteria verrucomicrobia planctomycetes and chloroflexi indicating that members of these phyla were also sensitive to the oxidative process conversely some bacterial taxa were resistant to the h2o2 treatment including firmicutes proteobacteria and deinoccoci members paracoccus and deinococcus contributed in similar proportions to the bacterial communities of treated samples 24 and 72 h members from both genera are known to produce enzymes involved in bacterial defense against the deleterious effects of oxidative stress wang and schellhorn 1995 baker et al 1998 deinococcus is known for its capacity to survive in diverse extreme environmental conditions such as ionization uv radiation and desiccation daly 2009 ionization and uv radiation can mediate and intensify the production of ros deinococcus radiodurans cells have high catalase activity and increase it when exposed to h2o2 when pre treated with sub lethal doses of h2o2 cells became resistant to higher concentrations of h2o2 and also more resistant to uv light and γ rays showing the potential to enhance survival to diverse stress factors wang and schellhorn 1995 slade and radman 2011 the main genus in the treatment condition was exiguobacterium and its cosmopolitan distribution may be related to an adaptability to extreme environmental conditions including high uv intensity strahsburger et al 2018 an inherent characteristic of this genus is the intense activity of catalase yumoto et al 2004 takebe et al 2007 strains from this genus present the complete pathway for carotenoid c30 synthesis white et al 2019 which might contribute to ros quenching as well as protect against photo damage exiguobacterium showed a positive correlation with transparency a consequence of the collapse of cyanobacteria tian et al 2012 showed that an extract of exiguobacterium sp had an intense algicidal activity against cyanobacteria inhibiting the growth of planktothrix synechococcus and chroococcus in 2 days without activity against green algae after h2o2 degradation exiguobacterium abundance decreased and cyanobium dominated the cyanobacterial community a major contributor at this later time was luteolibacter that increased in abundance compared to the control condition a correlation between this genus and picocyanobacteria has been previously reported during a synechococcus dominated cyanobacterial bloom guedes et al 2018 additionally cardman et al 2014 suggested that members of verrucomicrobia including luteolibacter sp could be involved in algal polysaccharide degradation in marine environments these results indicate that further investigation using metagenomics approaches can confirm the prevalence of specific bacterial taxa after the oxidizing process and subsequent compositional changes that precede cyanobacterial regrowth in this scenario it is important to know resistant bacteria that dominate the bacterioplankton after an oxidizing treatment for water treatment purposes since they could imply risks for water consumption additionally understanding the dynamics of microbial communities after h2o2 treatment could reveal bacterial taxa potentially useful in biomonitoring conditions before the return of cyanobacterial blooms we did not evaluate the potential effects of h2o2 on cyanobacterial toxins since none of the routinely monitored cyanotoxins microcystin saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin were detected before and throughout the experimental procedure cagece internal reports 2019 document no 5 annex 20 health ministry brazil brazil 2017 although the efficiency of h2o2 to eliminate microcystin has been observed both in situ matthijs et al 2012 and in cyanobacterial cultures huo et al 2015 menezes et al 2020 other studies reported toxin remaining lürling et al 2014 spoof et al 2020 in case the toxins released over h2o2 process and not chemically or biologically degraded are still present at the wtp intake then other steps could be adopted at wtp for complete removal such as activated carbon adsorption or chemical oxidation the advantage of the h2o2 treatment is that it does not need new infrastructure added to the wtp and can be applied to a small part of the reservoir close to the intake only when raw water quality worsens to a certain threshold 5 conclusion we evaluated the effects of h2o2 on phytoplankton bacterioplankton and abiotic parameters using a mesocosm system into a hypereutrophic reservoir located in a semi arid region subjected to high irradiance high temperature and presenting a high carbon content along with improving water quality a single application of 10 mg l 1 h2o2 suppressed the phytoplankton community over 72h with a subsequent dominance of green algae after h2o2 degradation the original planktothrix dominated cyanobacterial bloom was suppressed and an increase of cyanobium sp was apparent this suggests regrowth of cyanobacteria linked to the availability of nutrients the heterotrophic bacterial community composition changed over time and was dominated by taxa that presented resistance to h2o2 particularly exiguobacterium thus h2o2 imposes a stress condition upon the bacterioplankton with strong compositional changes in the relative abundances of diverse phyla longer observation periods are needed to determine the time of the return of a cyanobacterial bloom after h2o2 degradation our results suggest that monitoring abiotic parameters and the relative abundance of specific taxa could be used to anticipate the regrowth of cyanobacteria an important aspect to observe for the success of this process is where to apply h2o2 so that its effects are still felt in the wtp intake for that in addition to the knowledge of for how long the water quality improvement lasts a study of the reservoir hydrodynamics residence time preferential pathways is needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17024,the usefulness of waste activated sludge was as an energy source is limited by the poor generation efficiency of methane from was which is mainly due to the complex nature of sludge and low abundance of functional microbes in this study the interfacial thermodynamics electron transfer and microbial community of sludge were investigated to reveal the enhancing effects of isoelectric point pi pretreatment on the efficiency of methane generation from was experimentally after pi pretreatment the methane production potential maximum methane production rate and maximum methane proportion in the biogas increased by 122 2 154 4 and 17 4 respectively indicating that pi pretreatment enhanced the generation efficiency of methane analyses of changes in the solid liquid interfacial non covalent interaction energy electron transfer capacity etc and reductive peak potential values of sludge samples with and without pi pretreatment during a 170 day methanogenic fermentation period revealed that pi pretreatment enhanced the self driven solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic attractions of sludge increased the abiotic driving forces of interfacial enzymatic reactions promoted the electron transfer efficiency and lowered the barrier of the reduction reaction it was thus hypothesised that these changes would be responsible for increasing methane production which was confirmed by the correlation analyses between the interfacial free energy ife and etc versus daily methane production moreover statistical analyses of the differences between the microbial communities of sludge samples with and without pi pretreatment during fermentation demonstrated that pi pretreatment significantly p 0 05 improved the relative abundances of the main functional microbes with respect to hydrolysis acidification and methanation a further investigation of the relationships of ife and etc with the relative abundances of the main genera of methanogens indicated that the hydrophobic attraction of sludge surface and a high etc are conducive to the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens 29 9 these findings are expected to provide a conceptual framework for developing second

wide application of the activated sludge process to wastewater treatment yields a large amount of was for example the mass of sludge calculated with an 80 moisture content produced in china exceeds 50 0 million tons year geng et al 2020 xu et al 2020a and the global mass is predicted to increase to 103 0 million tons year by 2025 yao et al 2018 was is known to contain large amounts of perishable organic matter appels et al 2008 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2020a which will cause serious secondary pollution if not treated properly moreover the recovery of energy from was is attracting increasing attention in response to the gradual depletion of traditional energy sources and the signing of the paris climate agreement the ad of was which can simultaneously reduce sludge pollution decrease carbon emissions and recover bio energy ch4 has been considered as a promising technology for sustainable development however the low methanogenic fermentation efficiency i e low ch4 production and ch4 proportion in biogas of was has restricted the development of this technology xu et al 2020a as a consequence several pretreatment methods including biological enzymatic and aerobic digestion pretreatment physical thermal ultrasound electric pulse and microwave pretreatment and chemical alkaline ozonation acid and fenton pretreatment approaches and integrated protocols microwave alkaline thermo chemical ultrasound alkaline and high pressure o3 neumann et al 2016 gonzalez et al 2018 xu et al 2020a have been proposed to improve the ad efficiency and studied accordingly although such pretreatment methods can improve methanogenic fermentation in most cases they are so broad acting and non specific that differences in their effects depending on the type of sludge are difficult to explain the achievement of substantial improvements to the methanogenic fermentation efficiency has proved even more challenging for example tanaka et al 1997 found that the thermal pretreatment 180 c 60 min can increase the organic solubilisation of sludge and enhance the biogas production whereas xue et al 2015 reported that although the thermal pretreatment 180 c 60 min significantly increased the organic solubilisation of sludge it did not improve the production of biogas one reasonable explanation for these contradictory phenomena is that thermal pretreatment does not specifically remove the intrinsic inhibitory substances e g heavy metals and inert metal organic complexes in sludge and these substances can strengthen the complex structure of sludge and inhibit the activity of microbes at different concentrations although thermal pretreatment improves the organic solubilisation of sludge it does not remove the inhibitory substances at low concentrations these inhibitory substances have no obvious negative effect on the production of biogas which is likely to increase after thermal pretreatment due to the increased organic solubilisation of sludge however at high concentrations these inhibitory substances significantly inhibit biogas production which does not necessarily increase after thermal pretreatment worse still new inhibitors could be formed via the maillard reaction after thermal pretreatment wilson and novak 2009 li et al 2020 xu et al 2020 these issues can also be encountered when using other conventional pretreatment methods for example both appels et al 2012 and kim et al 2013 found that the increased organic solubilisation of sludge via various conventional pretreatment methods e g ultrasonic and alkaline did not always improve the production of methane based on these findings we defined these conventional methods as first generation pretreatment methods which mainly aim to improve the initial organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge but ignore the targeted removal of the intrinsic inhibitory substances in sludge in our previous study we found that the intrinsic obm in sludge can significantly restrict methane production from was xu et al 2017 based on a mechanistic understanding of the obm limited ad of was we proposed a novel strategy for maximising the retention of organic substances in sludge while simultaneously removing the obm and the related inhibitory effects via pi pretreatment xu et al 2018 in that paper we provided a framework for improving the ad of was via pi pretreatment based on the structural characteristics of sludge however the detailed mechanisms by which this pretreatment enhances ad remain unclear in an attempt to comprehensively reveal the mechanism by which pi pretreatment enhances the ad of was and provide a useful reference for the development of second generation pretreatment methods we recently revealed that pi pretreatment enhances acidogenic fermentation during the ad of was and explained this from the perspectives of the physical structure and interfacial thermodynamics xu et al 2020 however the positive effects of pi pretreatment on the methanogenic fermentation of ad remain unclear in this study the main objective was to reveal the underlying mechanisms by which pi pretreatment enhances the methanogenic fermentation of was using insights from interfacial thermodynamics electron transfer and microbial community specifically the enhancement of methane production efficiency methane production potential and rate and proportion of methane in biogas after pi pretreatment was first confirmed then the variations in the interfacial thermodynamics and electrochemical characteristics of sludge samples with and without pi pretreatment during methanogenic fermentation were investigated and the relationships of the ife and etc of sludge with daily methane production were revealed finally statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the differences between the microbial communities of sludge samples with and without pi pretreatment during methanogenic fermentation and the underlying relationships of the ife and etc with the relative abundances of the main genera of methanogens were revealed to our knowledge this is the first time to shift the focus of the pretreatment from the initial organic solubilisation of sludge to the removal of intrinsic inhibitory substances in sludge and the enhancement of self driven interfacial biochemical reaction which can provide an important reference for the development of second generation pretreatment methods based on conventional methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics and isoelectric point pi pretreatment of sludge was was collected from a municipal wastewater

was explored through 170 day mesophilic batch experiments conducted in an air bath shaker 37 c 120 rpm thirty two identical serum bottles working volume 250 ml were used for each sludge sample and each sample was divided between two groups studied in parallel each bottle was fed with inoculum and substrate at a vs ratio of 1 2 for the eg 156 8 g of substrate and 72 4 g of inoculum were mixed for the cg 176 9 g of substrate and 72 4 g of inoculum were mixed in addition bottles containing only 72 4 g of inoculum were included as blanks before the experiment started the ph values of all bottles were adjusted to approximately 7 0 using 3 m naoh or 3 m hcl after which each bottle was filled to 250 ml with ultrapure water and sealed with a rubber stopper after purging with n2 for 1 min during the first 25 days the volume and methane content of the biogas from the sludge samples were measured daily and the corresponding ncmp was calculated according to previous publications oh et al 2003 dai et al 2017 the proportion of methane in biogas from the sludge samples was again measured on days 30 110 and 170 throughout the fermentation process two bottles per sample were taken out at 0

and cg were determined by a gas chromatography shimadzu gc 1020 plus japan and the corresponding values during methanogenic fermentation are summarised in figure s2 sm all experiments were performed in triplicate and the corresponding measurement data are shown as means standard deviations 3 results and discussion 3 1 the production of methane the corresponding kinetics and the proportion in biogas the ncmp values from different sludge samples eg and cg collected during the first 25 days of methanogenic fermentation are shown in fig 1 the ncmp increased from days 0 to 20 whereas no significant change was observed after 20 days p 0 05 accordingly it is reasonable to investigate methane production during the first 25 days of fermentation in addition the maximum ncmp value in the eg was 274 4 3 0 ml ch4 g vs which was more than twice that in the cg 123 5 2 5 ml ch4 g vs indicating that pi pretreatment significantly enhanced methane production from the was as shown in fig 1 although there was no significant difference in the ncmp between the eg and cg from days to 0 to 4 after 4 days the ncmp from the eg was always higher than that from the cg to understand this difference between the two groups the pseudo first order and the modified gompertz models were used to fit the ncmp data from the eg and cg the former is conventionally used to describe ncmp data under the assumption that hydrolysis is the rate limiting step kafle and chen 2016 and the latter is conventionally used when the growth rate of methanogens is restricted by an inhibitory behaviour lay et al 1998 fig 1 a and b show the fitting curves for the ncmp data based on the pseudo first order model and the modified gompertz model respectively the corresponding kinetic parameters are summarised in tables s3 and s4 sm as shown in fig 1 a and b no significant difference was observed in the coefficient of determination r2 of the fits of the ncmp data from the cg between the pseudo first order model r2 0 9849 p 0 001 and the modified gompertz model r2 0 9976 p 0 001 indicating that both models can accurately describe the ncmp data from the cg one reasonable explanation for the acceptability of both models is that the hydrolysis of sludge is the rate limiting step gonzalez et al 2018 whereas the growth rate of methanogens is also restricted by the poor hydrolysis of sludge an inhibitory behaviour during the methanogenic fermentation of cg therefore both kinetic models can accurately describe the ncmp data from the cg this result is also consistent with the findings of previous studies neumann et al 2016 xu et al 2018 ariunbaatar et al 2014 he et al 2014 however for the eg fig 1 a and b demonstrate that the modified gompertz model r2 0 9972 p 0 001 is more suitable than the pseudo first order model for fitting the ncmp data r2 0 9376 p 0 001 suggesting that the growth rate of methanogens rather than the hydrolysis of sludge is the rate limiting step in the methanogenic fermentation of the eg this observation is also supported by our previous study xu et al 2018 in a previous report pi pretreatment significantly enhanced organic solubilisation hydrolysis and acidification of sludge xu et al 2020 on this basis it is reasonable to suppose that during the methanogenic fermentation of the eg the metabolic rate of vfa was lower than the production rate for a short period of time i e lag time resulting in an accumulation of vfa this accumulation in turn could inhibit the growth of methanogens during this short period however as fermentation continued the accumulated vfa were gradually transformed resulting in a significant increase of ncmp fig 1 this proposition is also consistent with differences in the vfa concentrations between the eg and cg during fermentation figure s2 sm in addition because the modified gompertz model is suitable for describing the ncmp data from both the eg and cg the kinetic parameters of that model such as methane production potential b0 and maximum methane production rate rm can be used to comparatively analyse the methane production potentials and rates of the eg and cg as detailed in table s4 sm the rm and b0 values in the eg were 31 8 0 9 and 279 3 2 0 ml ch4 g vs respectively which are more than twice the corresponding values in the cg 12 5 0 3 and 124 0 1 2 ml ch4 g vs respectively indicating that pi pretreatment not only significantly improved the methane production potential during methanogenic fermentation but also the methane production rate from was fig 2 shows the changes in the proportions of methane in biogas from the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation the proportion of methane in biogas from the eg was always higher than that in biogas from the cg which indicates that more carbon was biologically converted into methane in the eg during methanogenic fermentation this result suggests that the structure of the microbial community could be altered by pi pretreatment during the methanogenic fermentation as shown in fig 2 although the proportions of methane in biogas from both the eg and cg initially increased and then stabilised the corresponding values increased at different rates and degrees for example the proportion of methane in biogas from the eg increased rapidly from 0 to 73 1 2 5 within 8 days whereas this proportion increased more slowly in the cg from 0 to 62 4 3 0 after 16 days in other words pi pretreatment reduced the time required for the methane content in biogas to stabilise during the methanogenic fermentation of was likely by significantly improving the methane production rate fig 1 and table s4 sm more importantly once stabilised the proportion of methane in biogas from the cg varied from 61 8 2 0 to 65 4 2 0 with an average of 63 4 1 3 which was consistent with previously reported results appels et al 2008 however the proportion of methane in biogas from the eg was much higher ranging from 69 3 2 5 to 76 8 2 0 with an average of 74 1 2 3 indicating that pi pretreatment increased the proportion of methane in biogas from the methanogenic fermentation of was one reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that pi pretreatment improves the activities of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and enhances the metabolic reduction of co2 to ch4 thereby increasing the proportion of methane in biogas methane production from sludge organic matter during methanogenic fermentation usually depends on two key elements 1 the sludge organic matter and 2 the functional microbes xu et al 2020a in a methanogenic fermentation system these two key elements do not vary independently but are usually interrelated at the solid liquid interface of sludge via electron transfer based on the above finding that pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the methane production potential methane production rate and methane proportion in biogas from was during methanogenic fermentation we hypothesised that pi pretreatment would enhance the self driven solid liquid interfacial non covalent interactions in sludge via partly removing multivalent metals thereby promoting electron transfer in the sludge and increasing the relative abundance of methanogens resulting in an enhancement of the ncmp from was 3 2 interfacial non covalent interaction energy and electron transfer of sludge to prove the above mentioned hypothesis the effects of pi pretreatment on the solid liquid interfacial non covalent interaction energy and electron transfer of sludge during methanogenic fermentation were explored non covalent interactions e g van der waals electrostatic hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are particularly important in enzymatic reactions e g methanogenic fermentation especially the formation of enzyme substrate binary complexes robert 2000 based on the extended dlvo theory grasso et al 2002 meinders et al 1995 the typical solid liquid interfacial non covalent interaction energy of sludge is mainly composed of the lw interaction energy δ g s l l w the ab interaction energy δ g s l a b and the el interaction energy δ g s l s e l van oss c j 2006 xu et al 2020 amongst these the apolar lw interaction is usually used to describe the attractive interaction via fluctuating dipole induced dipole the polar ab interaction is closely linked to the hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure including the hydrogen bond driven hydrophobic attraction δ g s l a b 0 and the hydration driven hydrophilic repulsion δ g s l a b 0 and the el interaction is directly related to the particle dispersion or adhesion in a polar liquid van oss 2006 xu et al 2020 moreover the ife which is the sum of δ g s l l w and δ g s l a b is typically used to characterise the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the interface fig 3 uses boxplots to depict the results of statistical analyses of the changes in the δ g s l s e l δ g s l l w and δ g s l a b values of the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation the changes in the interfacial lw ab and el interaction energies of the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation are shown in figures s3 s4 and s5 respectively sm the changes in ife and the estimated ionic strength values of the eg and cg during the same process are shown in figure s6 and figure s7 respectively sm and the statistical analysis of the changes in the corresponding df values is summarised via boxplots in figure s8 sm as shown in fig 3 of the three interfacial interaction energies in sludge δ g s l a b received the largest absolute value and exhibited the largest variation in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation indicating that the hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure dominated the solid liquid interfacial non covalent interaction of sludge notably the degrees of fluctuation of δ g s l a b and δ g s l l w in the eg were greater than those of δ g s l a b and δ g s l l w in the cg indicating that both the hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure and the van der waals attractive interaction were stronger in the eg than in the cg this finding demonstrates that pi pretreatment enhanced the self driven solid liquid interfacial non covalent interactions of sludge by causing fluctuations in hydrogen bonding and the dipole induced dipole forces during fermentation one reasonable explanation for the above observations is that a large amount of multivalent metals especially obm were removed by pi pretreatment table s1 sm without the effects of multivalent metals the density of the electron clouds around atoms of organic molecules increases mccleverty and meyer 2003 jeremy et al 2012 and the distribution of electrons more easily fluctuates therefore dipole moments are readily established and constantly shift due to fluctuations in the electron density resulting in considerable fluctuation of the dipole induced dipole interaction strength between the atoms of different organic molecules and leading to the large variations in the δ g s l l w values at the solid liquid interface of the sludge in the eg meanwhile because the electron distribution of organic molecules more easily fluctuates in the absence of multivalent metals water molecules must switch frequently between acting as proton donors and acceptors to interact with the organic molecules which would cause rapid fluctuations in the hydrogen bonding interaction strength and further result in large variations of the δ g s l a b values at the solid liquid interface of the sludge in the eg it has been reported that the dipole induced dipole interaction is conducive to establishing the specificity of interactions between enzyme active sites and substrate and the hydrogen bonding interaction can provide the binding energy of enzyme substrate binary complex robert a c 2000 it is thus plausible that pi pretreatment enhanced the interfacial enzymatic reactions of sludge via promoting the dipole induced dipole and hydrogen bonding interactions during methanogenic fermentation this would also likely explain why the methane production potentials and rates of was were enhanced by pi pretreatment during methanogenic fermentation fig 1 a careful examination of the changes in the δ g s l a b values in fig 3 reveals that most values of sludge samples in the eg were negative and the average value was approximately 4 08 mj m2 during fermentation in contrast most values of the sludge samples in the cg were positive with an average value of 2 67 mj m2 these results indicate that during methanogenic fermentation the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the sludge surface were changing in both the eg and cg and it was usually hydrophobic in the eg and hydrophilic in the cg indicating that pi pretreatment changed the main form of the solid liquid interfacial non covalent interaction of sludge from hydrophilic repulsion to hydrophobic attraction it can be concluded that pi pretreatment enhanced the solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interaction of sludge by inducing hydrogen bond driven during methanogenic fermentation which is also consistent with the measured ife values figure s6 sm the interfacial hydrophobic interaction usually can provide driving force of enzymatic reactions robert 2000 this result thus suggests that the methanogenic fermentation potential of sludge organic matter at the solid liquid interface can be enhanced by pi pretreatment a hydrophobic interaction is an indispensable organising force in many biomolecular systems and is responsible for the assembly of cell membranes and intracellular compartments tanford 1978 therefore it can be inferred that pi pretreatment can also alter microbial metabolic pathways by enhancing hydrophobic interactions at the solid liquid interface of sludge during methanogenic fermentation which is supported by the observed increase in the methane proportion of biogas from the eg fig 2 another interesting phenomenon shown in fig 3 reveals that during methanogenic fermentation most of the δ g s l s e l values in the eg were much higher than those in the cg at the minimum equilibrium distance 0 157 nm for example the average δ g s l s e l value in the eg was 6 64 1 41 mj m2 which is more than twice that 3 10 1 84 mj m2 in the cg this result indicates that pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the el interactions between sludge particles at the minimum equilibrium distance leading to increase in mass transfer and sludge dispersion figure s8 sm that were conducive to the mobility of biologically important solutes such as enzymes i e proteins and increased contact between those solutes and sludge particles the etc and σ of sludge are two very important parameters used to evaluate the electron transfer potential and etr during methanogenic fermentation in general the higher the etc value of sludge the greater the electron transfer potential and a higher σ value of sludge usually indicates a greater etr rabaey et al 2010 the reductive peak potential ep red of the cv curve can be used to characterise the energy barrier of the accepting electrons here a smaller absolute ep red value of sludge facilitates the reduction reaction which depends on accepting electrons fig 4 depicts the statistical analyses of changes in the electron transfer etc eac edc and σ and ep red values of the eg and cg via boxplots during methanogenic fermentation the raw data on the changes in those parameters are shown in figures s9 s10 and s11 respectively sm the relationship between the etc values and ife values is shown in figure s12 sm as shown in fig 4 the average etc eac and edc values were higher in the eg than in the cg for example the average etc value in the eg was 11 10 1 65 mmol e g vs which was higher than that in the cg 9 14 1 55 mmol e g vs indicating pi pretreatment enhanced the electron transfer potential of sludge during methanogenic fermentation two possible explanations can be considered for this observation first pi pretreatment can partly remove multivalent metals from organic metal complexes consequently the number of free electron pairs around the organic molecules increased and thereby promoted the electron transfer potential this explanation is consistent with the increased lw interaction energy fig 3 which corresponds to the dipole induced dipole interactions caused by the fluctuations of electron clouds second the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface was enhanced by pi pretreatment resulting in a relatively low density water region with an open hydrogen bonded network near the hydrophobic surface vogler 1998 thus the movement of free electron pairs through hydrogen bonds was less restricted by the unavailability of water molecules resulting in an increased electron transfer potential this explanation is consistent with the significant negative correlation between the etc and ife values r 0 6114 p 0 01 in figure s12 sm which indicates that the etc increases with the increasing hydrophobicity of the solid liquid interface of sludge this result also can be supported by the previous findings that water molecules can impose large barriers to the electron transfer wenger et al 2005 lin et al 2005 ponce et al 2000 gray and winkler 2003 as shown in the inserted graph a in fig 4 the average σ value of the eg was higher than that of the cg 3 9 0 6 ms cm vs 3 4 0 5 ms cm indicating that pi pretreatment enhanced the etr of sludge throughout methanogenic fermentation which can be explained by marcus theory gray and winkler 2003 it demonstrates that multivalent metals can increase the reorganization energy of a biological electron transfer in protein leading to a decrease of etr when the multivalent metals were partly removed by pi pretreatment the reorganization energy decreased and thereby the etr increased based on the above findings we concluded that pi pretreatment promoted the electron transfer efficiency including the electron transfer potential and etr of sludge during methanogenic fermentation an interesting observation from fig 4 is that although the average etc and eac values of the eg were higher than those of the cg the fluctuations of these values were smaller in the eg therefore after pi pretreatment the electron transfer potential of sludge not only was increased but was more stable and sustainable throughout methanogenic fermentation another interesting phenomenon from the inserted graph b in fig 4 is that the average absolute ep red value of sludge in the eg was lower than that in the cg demonstrating that the reduction reaction i e accepting electrons of sludge was more facile in the eg this further supports the greater ability of the pi pretreated sludge organic matter to accept electrons during methanogenic fermentation eac in fig 4 which also indicates that after pi pretreatment sludge organic matter is easier to accept electrons during the methanogenic fermentation process based on this it is plausible that the utilisation efficiency of electrons by microbial metabolism could be enhanced via pi pretreatment 3 3 relationships between ife and etc versus daily methane production to further understand how pi pretreatment improves the ncmp of was by enhancing the self driven solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions of sludge and promoting the electron transfer of sludge the relationships of the ife and etc values with daily methane production were studied fig 5 a and fig 5 b depict the correlations of the ife and etc values with the daily methane production data respectively the corresponding main parameters are summarised in tables s5 and s6 respectively sm as shown in fig 5 a as the ife changes from 6 5 1 5 mj m2 to 28 6 1 0 mj m2 the daily methane production exhibits an increasing trend indicating that the daily methane production increased as the sludge surface changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic during methanogenic fermentation subsequently a potential correlation between the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the sludge surface and the daily methane production during methanogenic fermentation of sludge was confirmed by a correlation analysis fig 5 a displays a significant negative correlation between the ife values and daily methane production data r 0 86 p 0 01 indicating that a highly hydrophobic sludge surface would improve daily methane production during the methanogenic fermentation of sludge one logical explanation for this observation is that a more hydrophobic sludge surface usually has a stronger hydrophobic attraction due to attractive structural forces i e hydrogen bond driven force and van der waals attractive force van oss 2006 grasso et al 2002 xu et al 2020 which drive enzyme molecules to contact the substrate and form enzyme substrate binary complexes a more hydrophobic sludge surface enables a stronger hydrophobic attraction and a stronger driving force of enzyme substrate complexation leading to increased daily methane production fig 5 b shows a significant positive correlation between the etc values and daily methane production data r 0 77 p 0 01 indicating that a high electron transfer potential is beneficial to daily methane production during the methanogenic fermentation of sludge presumably a higher electron transfer potential of sludge facilitates the utilisation of electrons and may be especially conducive to the reduction of co2 to ch4 thereby facilitating increased daily methane production during the methanogenic fermentation of sludge in addition we determined that the improved etc was mainly attributable to increased hydrophobicity at the sludge surface figure s12 sm therefore it can be concluded that pi pretreatment enhanced the solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions of sludge and improved the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface thereby promoting the electron transfer potential of sludge and increasing the daily methane production because methane generation is inseparable from the role of microbes in methanogenic fermentation it can be inferred that pi pretreatment also altered the microbial community structure by enhancing the solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions and promoting the electron transfer potential of sludge 3 4 microbial community structure analyses to reveal the effects of pi pretreatment on the microbial community structure the microbial diversity and microbial community compositions of the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation were investigated the shannon and simpson indexes are important measures of microbial alpha diversity i e species evenness and species richness a greater shannon index value indicates greater species evenness whereas a smaller simpson index value indicates higher species richness and lower species evenness in general the level of species evenness is directly proportional to the microbial diversity lande 1996 veech et al 2002 jost 2006 the statistical analyses of the changes in the shannon and simpson index values at the otu levels of bacteria and archaea in the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation are shown in fig 6 the results of a statistical analysis of the differences between the bacterial and archaeal community compositions at different levels i e phylum class and genus between the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation are summarised in figs 7 and 8 respectively the raw data on the changes in the main bacterial and archaeal communities at the phylum class and genus levels between the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation are shown in figures s13 and s14 respectively sm the statistical analyses of changes in the relative abundances of the main hydrogenotrophic methanogens i e the genus methanobacterium and the main methylotrophic methanogens i e the genera methanomassiliicoccales and methanofastidiosum are summarised in figure s15 sm as shown in fig 6 a the average values of both the shannon index and simpson index at the otu levels of bacteria were slightly lower in the eg than in the cg indicating that pi pretreatment led to a slight decrease in bacterial species evenness and a slight increase in species richness during the methanogenic fermentation of sludge in other words pi pretreatment slightly decreased the bacterial diversity which was also indicated by the analysis of relative abundance in the bacterial communities figure s13 sm fig 6 b shows the average shannon index value at the archaeal otu level was higher in the eg than in the cg indicating that pi pretreatment improved the archaeal species evenness the average simpson index value was lower in the eg than in the cg indicating an increase in the archaeal species evenness and decrease in species richness after pi pretreatment during the methanogenic fermentation of sludge i e an increase in archaeal diversity based on these findings it is concluded that the bacterial diversity decreased and the archaeal diversity increased after pi pretreatment during the methanogenic fermentation of was the effects of pi pretreatment on the bacterial community compositions were revealed by the identification of the bacterial community compositions figures s13 sm and the analysis of statistically significant differences in the identified bacterial community compositions between the eg and cg fig 7 as shown in fig 7 a and s13 a sm the bacterial phyla proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and actinobacteriota which are mainly associated with the decomposition of complex organic matter via hydrolysis and acidification amaresan et al 2020 jang et al 2014 gagliano et al 2015 wu et al 2020 were dominant in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation interestingly however fig 7 a reveals that the average relative abundances as percentages of these bacterial phyla differed between the eg and cg the average proportion of phylum firmicutes in the eg 16 9 2 9 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in the cg 11 7 5 9 during methanogenic fermentation indicating that pi pretreatment significantly increased the relative abundance of that phylum the firmicutes has been reported to be functionally important in the hydrolysis and acidification of organic mater peces et al 2018 wu et al 2020 it is thus plausible that pi pretreatment can eradicate the rate limiting step of sludge organic matter hydrolysis by increasing the relative abundance of firmicutes during methanogenic fermentation this phenomenon may also explain the kinetics of methane production with pi pretreatment fig 1 according to the figs 7 b and s13 b sm the bacterial communities at the class level in both the eg and cg were mainly composed of the anaerolineae phylum chloroflexi the clostridia phylum firmicutes the synergistia phylum firmicutes the gammaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria the alphaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria and the bacteroidia phylum bacteroidetes one notable result from fig 7 b is that the average proportions of the classes clostridia p 0 05 thermoleophilia p 0 01 and chloroflexia p 0 05 were significantly higher in the eg than in the cg indicating that pi pretreatment significantly increased the relative abundances of these classes amongst these three classes the clostridia accounted for the largest average proportion in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation the clostridia has been reported to be important in the anaerobic hydrolysis of cellulose during the ad of was syutsubo and nagaya 2005 which further indicates that pi pretreatment significantly improved the hydrolysis of sludge organic matter during methanogenic fermentation in addition fig 7 c and figure s13 c sm demonstrate that except for the bacteria of unknown genera i e others the bacterial genus with the highest relative abundance in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation was thermovirga followed by the genera norank f norank o aminicenantales and romboutsia notably as shown in fig 7 c the average proportions of the genera romboutsia p 0 01 nonrank f jg30 kf cm45 p 0 01 clostridium sensus stricto 1 p 0 05 and rhodoplanes p 0 0001 were significantly higher in the eg than in the cg indicating a significant beneficial effect of pi pretreatment on the abundances of these genera here the romboutsia accounted for the largest average proportion during methanogenic fermentation romboutsia was reported to utilise glucose and fructose as sole carbon sources for the production of acetic acid isobutanoic acid and isovaleric acid etc wang et al 2015 thus it is plausible that pi pretreatment promoted the acidification of the sludge organic matter during methanogenic fermentation by significantly improving the relative abundance of romboutsia p 0 01 interestingly fig 7 c demonstrates that although the average proportion of the genus rhodoplanes was low 2 its abundance differed most significantly between the eg and cg p 0 0001 rhodoplanes is a genus of phototrophic bacteria with the function of denitrification in anaerobic environments hiraishi and ueda 1994 accordingly pi pretreatment may be support the use of phototrophic bacteria for denitrification in such an environment overall pi pretreatment appears to improve the community of functional bacteria that support hydrolysis and acidification during the methanogenic fermentation of was the effects of pi pretreatment on the archaeal community compositions of the eg and cg are shown in figures s14 sm and the statistical evaluation of differences between the groups is shown in fig 8 accordingly the halobacterota euryarchaeota and thermoplasmatota were identified as the dominant archaeal phyla in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation fig 8 a shows that the average proportions of euryarchaeota and thermoplasmatota were higher in the eg than in the cg 43 2 12 0 vs 37 1 12 6 and 3 1 2 1 vs 2 2 1 4 respectively indicating that pi pretreatment improved the relative abundances of those phyla during methanogenic fermentation in general except for the species methanosphaera stadtmaniae a h2 dependant methylotroph most of the identified methanogens of the phylum euryarchaeota methanogens were hydrogenotrophs lyu et al 2018 lyu and whitman 2019 additionally all the identified phylum thermoplasmatota methanogens are the h2 dependant methylotrophs lyu et al 2018 therefore it is plausible that pi pretreatment improved the relative abundances of hydrogenotrophic and h2 dependant methylotrophic methanogens and enhanced the metabolic reaction 4h2 co2 ch4 2h2o leading to a high proportion of methane in the biogas fig 2 produced during the methanogenic fermentation of was at the class level as shown in figs 8 b and s14 b sm methanosarcinia methanobacteria and thermococci were identified as the dominant archaeal classes in both the eg and cg and the average relative abundances differed between the groups for example the average relative abundance of methanobacteria in the eg was 32 7 6 9 which was 24 8 higher than that in the cg as shown in figs 8 c and s14 c sm which present the genus level data the archaeal communities in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation were mainly composed of the genera methanosaeta methanobacterium candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanosarcina however the relative abundances of these archaeal communities differed between the eg and cg 38 7 13 5 30 0 6 3 10 6 8 0 and 9 3 4 1 respectively vs 42 5 11 7 23 1 6 8 10 9 8 7 and 10 9 5 0 respectively methanosaeta and methanosarcina species are typical acetotrophic methanogens demirel and scherer 2008 lyu et al 2018 methanobacterium species are typical hydrogenotrophic methanogens lyu et al 2018 lyu and whitman 2019 christou et al 2021 and candidatus methanofastidiosum species are h2 dependant methylotrophic methanogens shamurad et al 2020 nobu et al 2015 therefore the average relative abundances of the main acetotrophic methanogens at the genus level i e methanosaeta and methanosarcina were approximately 48 in the eg and 53 4 in the cg and this difference suggests that pi pretreatment suppressed the metabolic pathway by which acetate is split to ch4 likely pi pretreatment increased the archaeal diversity fig 6 b and improved the relative abundances of other methanogens figure s14 and figure s15 sm this is also consistent with the differences in the average relative abundances of the main hydrogenotrophic methanogens at the genus level i e methanobacterium between the eg and cg after pi pretreatment the relative abundances of the main hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased by 29 9 indicating the increased reduction of co2 to ch4 in the methanogenic fermentation of sludge moreover the statistical results in fig 8 b and c demonstrate that the average proportions of the class methanobacteria phylum euryarchaeota p 0 05 and the genus methanobacterium class methanobacteria p 0 05 were significantly higher in the eg than in the cg indicating the significant beneficial effects of pi pretreatment on these taxonomic groups during methanogenic fermentation which further confirmed that pi pretreatment significantly improved the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens during the methanogenic fermentation of was 3 5 relationships between ife and etc versus the relative abundances of the main genera of methanogens to further understand how pi pretreatment alters the methanogenic community structure by enhancing self driven solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions and promoting electron transfer in sludge the relationships of the ife and etc values with the relative abundances of main genera of methanogens were explored the analyses of correlations between the ife and etc values versus the relative abundances of the main genera of acetotrophic methanogens methanosaeta and methanosarcina and hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the corresponding main parameters are summarised in tables s7 s10 sm as shown in fig 9 as the ife changes from a positive to a negative value the relative abundances of both acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens exhibit increasing trends indicating that the hydrophobisation of the sludge surface increases the relative abundances of both types of organisms accordingly a hydrophobic sludge surface may be favourable for the enrichment of the main methanogenic genera this possibility was confirmed by the correlation analyses which revealed that significant negative correlations r 0 74 p 0 01 and r 0 64 p 0 01 respectively between the ife values and the relative abundances of the main acetotrophic methanogens in fig 9 a and the main hydrogenotrophic methanogens in fig 9 b respectively it thus can be concluded that main acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens tend to aggregate preferentially on hydrophobic sludge surfaces during methanogenic fermentation which may also explain why a highly hydrophobic sludge surface promotes daily methane production during methanogenic fermentation fig 5 one logical explanation for this observation is that a hydrophobic surface usually has a strong hydrophobic attraction to microbes i e the attractive structural forces fig 3 which is conducive to microbial adhesion zobell 1943 in contrast a hydrophilic surface usually has a strong hydrophilic repulsion fig 3 which is conducive to microbial dispersion zobell 1943 in an aquatic environment with a low nutrient concentration such as sludge during methanogenic fermentation surface attached microbes are typically more chemically active than free cells loosdrecht et al 1990 marshall 1984 therefore a hydrophobic sludge surface would contain relatively larger populations of the main active acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens than a hydrophilic surface during the methanogenic fermentation of was fig 10 demonstrates that as the etc value increased the relative abundances of the main acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens decreased and increased respectively suggesting that the electron transfer potential of sludge may be correlated with the populations of both types of methanogens this possibility was confirmed by a correlation analysis as shown in fig 10 a a significant negative correlation was observed between the etc value and the relative abundance of the main acetotrophic methanogens r 0 69 p 0 01 whereas a significant positive correlation was observed between the etc value and the relative abundance of the main hydrogenotrophic methanogens r 0 77 p 0 01 fig 10 b an improvement in the electron transfer potential appears to be conducive to the enrichment of main hydrogenotrophic methanogens but not of the main acetotrophic methanogens in the metabolic pathway used by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens the reduction of co2 to ch4 may be heavily dependant on electrons barker and buswell 1957 and therefore a high electron transfer potential would be beneficial to the reduction of co2 in contrast in the metabolic pathway used by the acetotrophic methanogens a methyl group is transferred from acetate to ch4 as a unit and one atom of h per molecule of ch4 is derived from the solvent i e h2o accordingly acetotrophic methanogens may be less reliant on a supply of electrons to split acetate to into ch4 and co2 therefore throughout methanogenic fermentation a higher electron transfer potential helps to enrich the hydrogenotrophic methanogens by giving them an advantage over the main acetotrophic methanogens this result also demonstrates that pi pretreatment can improve the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens by promoting the electron transfer potential of sludge we note however that microbial surface thermodynamics typically bridges the micro scale biological structure and the macro scale biological function strevett and chen 2003 as was is mainly composed of microbes the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of was would bridge the micro scale sludge structure and the macro scale biological functions such as methanogenic fermentation by dismantling of the sludge structure via partly removing multivalent metals pi pretreatment significantly alters the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge and thus affects the macro scale biological function leading to changes in the microbial diversity specifically pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the self driven solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions fig 3 and electron transfer efficiency of sludge fig 4 and thus increased the relative abundances of the main acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens fig 5 the electron transfer potential had a stronger promoting effect on hydrogenotrophic methanogens than on acetotrophic methanogens which led to a greater enhancement of the relative abundance of the former group and a change in the methanogenic community structure figs 6 and 8 4 conclusions in this study we confirmed the hypothesis that pi pretreatment can enhance the self driven solid liquid interfacial non covalent interactions and promoted the electron transfer efficiency of sludge thereby strengthening the abiotic forces driving interfacial enzymatic reactions and improving the relative abundances of functional microbes for hydrolysis acidification and methanation these changes result in enhanced generation efficiency of methane from was the main conclusions are as follows 1 pi pretreatment enhanced the methane production potential methane production rate and methane proportion in biogas from was during methanogenic fermentation for example after pi pretreatment the maximum methane production potential and rate increased by 122 2 and 154 4 respectively and the maximum methane proportion in biogas reached 76 8 2 pi pretreatment enhanced the self driven solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions of sludge and increased the forces driving interfacial enzymatic reactions via enhancing hydrophobic attraction during methanogenic fermentation 3 pi pretreatment promoted the electron transfer efficiency of sludge and decreased the barrier of the reduction reaction by positively shifting the reductive peak potential during methanogenic fermentation 4 pi pretreatment improved the relative abundances of the main functional microbes for hydrolysis acidification and methanation especially hydrogenotrophic methanogens 29 9 5 a close internal relationship exists between the solid liquid interfacial non covalent interactions and the etc of sludge with respect to the methanogenic fermentation ability a strong hydrophobic attractive force on the sludge surface and a high etc can enhance the generation efficiency of methane these findings will provide a reference for the development of second generation pretreatment methods with the aim of improving the biodegradability of sludge by removing the intrinsic inhibitory substances and increasing the abiotic forces driving interfacial enzymatic reactions in sludge rather than focusing solely on the initial organic solubilisation of sludge furthermore these findings also provide a methodological reference for revealing the details of the black box ad process by monitoring changes in the

17024,the usefulness of waste activated sludge was as an energy source is limited by the poor generation efficiency of methane from was which is mainly due to the complex nature of sludge and low abundance of functional microbes in this study the interfacial thermodynamics electron transfer and microbial community of sludge were investigated to reveal the enhancing effects of isoelectric point pi pretreatment on the efficiency of methane generation from was experimentally after pi pretreatment the methane production potential maximum methane production rate and maximum methane proportion in the biogas increased by 122 2 154 4 and 17 4 respectively indicating that pi pretreatment enhanced the generation efficiency of methane analyses of changes in the solid liquid interfacial non covalent interaction energy electron transfer capacity etc and reductive peak potential values of sludge samples with and without pi pretreatment during a 170 day methanogenic fermentation period revealed that pi pretreatment enhanced the self driven solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic attractions of sludge increased the abiotic driving forces of interfacial enzymatic reactions promoted the electron transfer efficiency and lowered the barrier of the reduction reaction it was thus hypothesised that these changes would be responsible for increasing methane production which was confirmed by the correlation analyses between the interfacial free energy ife and etc versus daily methane production moreover statistical analyses of the differences between the microbial communities of sludge samples with and without pi pretreatment during fermentation demonstrated that pi pretreatment significantly p 0 05 improved the relative abundances of the main functional microbes with respect to hydrolysis acidification and methanation a further investigation of the relationships of ife and etc with the relative abundances of the main genera of methanogens indicated that the hydrophobic attraction of sludge surface and a high etc are conducive to the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens 29 9 these findings are expected to provide a conceptual framework for developing second

wide application of the activated sludge process to wastewater treatment yields a large amount of was for example the mass of sludge calculated with an 80 moisture content produced in china exceeds 50 0 million tons year geng et al 2020 xu et al 2020a and the global mass is predicted to increase to 103 0 million tons year by 2025 yao et al 2018 was is known to contain large amounts of perishable organic matter appels et al 2008 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2020a which will cause serious secondary pollution if not treated properly moreover the recovery of energy from was is attracting increasing attention in response to the gradual depletion of traditional energy sources and the signing of the paris climate agreement the ad of was which can simultaneously reduce sludge pollution decrease carbon emissions and recover bio energy ch4 has been considered as a promising technology for sustainable development however the low methanogenic fermentation efficiency i e low ch4 production and ch4 proportion in biogas of was has restricted the development of this technology xu et al 2020a as a consequence several pretreatment methods including biological enzymatic and aerobic digestion pretreatment physical thermal ultrasound electric pulse and microwave pretreatment and chemical alkaline ozonation acid and fenton pretreatment approaches and integrated protocols microwave alkaline thermo chemical ultrasound alkaline and high pressure o3 neumann et al 2016 gonzalez et al 2018 xu et al 2020a have been proposed to improve the ad efficiency and studied accordingly although such pretreatment methods can improve methanogenic fermentation in most cases they are so broad acting and non specific that differences in their effects depending on the type of sludge are difficult to explain the achievement of substantial improvements to the methanogenic fermentation efficiency has proved even more challenging for example tanaka et al 1997 found that the thermal pretreatment 180 c 60 min can increase the organic solubilisation of sludge and enhance the biogas production whereas xue et al 2015 reported that although the thermal pretreatment 180 c 60 min significantly increased the organic solubilisation of sludge it did not improve the production of biogas one reasonable explanation for these contradictory phenomena is that thermal pretreatment does not specifically remove the intrinsic inhibitory substances e g heavy metals and inert metal organic complexes in sludge and these substances can strengthen the complex structure of sludge and inhibit the activity of microbes at different concentrations although thermal pretreatment improves the organic solubilisation of sludge it does not remove the inhibitory substances at low concentrations these inhibitory substances have no obvious negative effect on the production of biogas which is likely to increase after thermal pretreatment due to the increased organic solubilisation of sludge however at high concentrations these inhibitory substances significantly inhibit biogas production which does not necessarily increase after thermal pretreatment worse still new inhibitors could be formed via the maillard reaction after thermal pretreatment wilson and novak 2009 li et al 2020 xu et al 2020 these issues can also be encountered when using other conventional pretreatment methods for example both appels et al 2012 and kim et al 2013 found that the increased organic solubilisation of sludge via various conventional pretreatment methods e g ultrasonic and alkaline did not always improve the production of methane based on these findings we defined these conventional methods as first generation pretreatment methods which mainly aim to improve the initial organic solubilisation and hydrolysis of sludge but ignore the targeted removal of the intrinsic inhibitory substances in sludge in our previous study we found that the intrinsic obm in sludge can significantly restrict methane production from was xu et al 2017 based on a mechanistic understanding of the obm limited ad of was we proposed a novel strategy for maximising the retention of organic substances in sludge while simultaneously removing the obm and the related inhibitory effects via pi pretreatment xu et al 2018 in that paper we provided a framework for improving the ad of was via pi pretreatment based on the structural characteristics of sludge however the detailed mechanisms by which this pretreatment enhances ad remain unclear in an attempt to comprehensively reveal the mechanism by which pi pretreatment enhances the ad of was and provide a useful reference for the development of second generation pretreatment methods we recently revealed that pi pretreatment enhances acidogenic fermentation during the ad of was and explained this from the perspectives of the physical structure and interfacial thermodynamics xu et al 2020 however the positive effects of pi pretreatment on the methanogenic fermentation of ad remain unclear in this study the main objective was to reveal the underlying mechanisms by which pi pretreatment enhances the methanogenic fermentation of was using insights from interfacial thermodynamics electron transfer and microbial community specifically the enhancement of methane production efficiency methane production potential and rate and proportion of methane in biogas after pi pretreatment was first confirmed then the variations in the interfacial thermodynamics and electrochemical characteristics of sludge samples with and without pi pretreatment during methanogenic fermentation were investigated and the relationships of the ife and etc of sludge with daily methane production were revealed finally statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the differences between the microbial communities of sludge samples with and without pi pretreatment during methanogenic fermentation and the underlying relationships of the ife and etc with the relative abundances of the main genera of methanogens were revealed to our knowledge this is the first time to shift the focus of the pretreatment from the initial organic solubilisation of sludge to the removal of intrinsic inhibitory substances in sludge and the enhancement of self driven interfacial biochemical reaction which can provide an important reference for the development of second generation pretreatment methods based on conventional methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics and isoelectric point pi pretreatment of sludge was was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in suzhou jiangsu province china the inoculum for the methanogenic fermentation test was obtained at a lab scale from a 30 day mesophilic semi continuous anaerobic sludge digester the

pretreatment is named the eg and the sludge sample without pi pretreatment is named the cg 2 2 methanogenic fermentation of sludge the methanogenic fermentation of sludge samples eg cg and inoculum was explored through 170 day mesophilic batch experiments conducted in an air bath shaker 37 c 120 rpm thirty two identical serum bottles working volume 250 ml were used for each sludge sample and each sample was divided between two groups studied in parallel each bottle was fed with inoculum and substrate at a vs ratio of 1 2 for the eg 156 8 g of substrate and 72 4 g of inoculum were mixed for the cg 176 9 g of substrate and 72 4 g of inoculum were mixed in addition bottles containing only 72 4 g of inoculum were included as blanks before the experiment started the ph values of all bottles were adjusted to approximately 7 0 using 3 m naoh or 3 m hcl after which each bottle was filled to 250 ml with ultrapure water and sealed with a rubber stopper after purging with n2 for 1 min during the first 25 days the volume and methane content of the biogas from the sludge samples were measured daily and the corresponding ncmp was calculated according to previous publications oh et al 2003 dai et al 2017 the proportion of methane in biogas from the sludge samples was again measured on days 30 110 and 170 throughout the fermentation process two bottles per sample were taken out at 0

in triplicate and the corresponding measurement data are shown as means standard deviations 3 results and discussion 3 1 the production of methane the corresponding kinetics and the proportion in biogas the ncmp values from different sludge samples eg and cg collected during the first 25 days of methanogenic fermentation are shown in fig 1 the ncmp increased from days 0 to 20 whereas no significant change was observed after 20 days p 0 05 accordingly it is reasonable to investigate methane production during the first 25 days of fermentation in addition the maximum ncmp value in the eg was 274 4 3 0 ml ch4 g vs which was more than twice that in the cg 123 5 2 5 ml ch4 g vs indicating that pi pretreatment significantly enhanced methane production from the was as shown in fig 1 although there was no significant difference in the ncmp between the eg and cg from days to 0 to 4 after 4 days the ncmp from the eg was always higher than that from the cg to understand this difference between the two groups the pseudo first order and the modified gompertz models were used to fit the ncmp data from the eg and cg the former is conventionally used to describe ncmp data under the assumption that hydrolysis is the rate limiting step kafle and chen 2016 and the latter is conventionally used when the growth rate of methanogens is restricted by an inhibitory behaviour lay et al 1998 fig 1 a and b show the fitting curves for the ncmp data based on the pseudo first order model and the modified gompertz model respectively the corresponding kinetic parameters are summarised in tables s3 and s4 sm as shown in fig 1 a and b no significant difference was observed in the coefficient of determination r2 of the fits of the ncmp data from the cg between the pseudo first order model r2 0 9849 p 0 001 and the modified gompertz model r2 0 9976 p 0 001 indicating that both models can accurately describe the ncmp data from the cg one reasonable explanation for the acceptability of both models is that the hydrolysis of sludge is the rate limiting step gonzalez et al 2018 whereas the growth rate of methanogens is also restricted by the poor hydrolysis of sludge an inhibitory behaviour during the methanogenic fermentation of cg therefore both kinetic models can accurately describe the ncmp data from the cg this result is also consistent with the findings of previous studies neumann et al 2016 xu et al 2018 ariunbaatar et al 2014 he et al 2014 however for the eg fig 1 a and b demonstrate that the modified gompertz model r2 0 9972 p 0 001 is more suitable than the pseudo first order model for fitting the ncmp data r2 0 9376 p 0 001 suggesting that the growth rate of methanogens rather than the hydrolysis of sludge is the rate limiting step in the methanogenic fermentation of the eg this observation is also supported by our previous study xu et al 2018 in a previous report pi pretreatment significantly enhanced organic solubilisation hydrolysis and acidification of sludge xu et al 2020 on this basis it is reasonable to suppose that during the methanogenic fermentation of the eg the metabolic rate of vfa was lower than the production rate for a short period of time i e lag time resulting in an accumulation of vfa this accumulation in turn could inhibit the growth of methanogens during this short period however as fermentation continued the accumulated vfa were gradually transformed resulting in a significant increase of ncmp fig 1 this proposition is also consistent with differences in the vfa concentrations between the eg and cg during fermentation figure s2 sm in addition because the modified gompertz model is suitable for describing the ncmp data from both the eg and cg the kinetic parameters of that model such as methane production potential b0 and maximum methane production rate rm can be used to comparatively analyse the methane production potentials and rates of the eg and cg as detailed in table s4 sm the rm and b0 values in the eg were 31 8 0 9 and 279 3 2 0 ml ch4 g vs respectively which are more than twice the corresponding values in the cg 12 5 0 3 and 124 0 1 2 ml ch4 g vs respectively indicating that pi pretreatment not only significantly improved the methane production potential during methanogenic fermentation but also the methane production rate from was fig 2 shows the changes in the proportions of methane in biogas from the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation the proportion of methane in biogas from the eg was always higher than that in biogas from the cg which indicates that more carbon was biologically converted into methane in the eg during methanogenic fermentation this result suggests that the structure of the microbial community could be altered by pi pretreatment during the methanogenic fermentation as shown in fig 2 although the proportions of methane in biogas from both the eg and cg initially increased and then stabilised the corresponding values increased at different rates and degrees for example the proportion of methane in biogas from the eg increased rapidly from 0 to 73 1 2 5 within 8 days whereas this proportion increased more slowly in the cg from 0 to 62 4 3 0 after 16 days in other words pi pretreatment reduced the time required for the methane content in biogas to stabilise during the methanogenic fermentation of was likely by significantly improving the methane production rate fig 1 and table s4 sm more importantly once stabilised the proportion of methane in biogas from the cg varied from 61 8 2 0 to 65 4 2 0 with an average of 63 4 1 3 which was consistent with previously reported results appels et al 2008 however the proportion of methane in biogas from the eg was much higher ranging from 69 3 2 5 to 76 8 2 0 with an average of 74 1 2 3 indicating that pi pretreatment increased the proportion of methane in biogas from the methanogenic fermentation of was one reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that pi pretreatment improves the activities of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and enhances the metabolic reduction of co2 to ch4 thereby increasing the proportion of methane in biogas methane production from sludge organic matter during methanogenic fermentation usually depends on two key elements 1 the sludge organic matter and 2 the functional microbes xu et al 2020a in a methanogenic fermentation system these two key elements do not vary independently but are usually interrelated at the solid liquid interface of sludge via electron transfer based on the above finding that pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the methane production potential methane production rate and methane proportion in biogas from was during methanogenic fermentation we hypothesised that pi pretreatment would enhance the self driven solid liquid interfacial non covalent interactions in sludge via partly removing multivalent metals thereby promoting electron transfer in the sludge and increasing the relative abundance of methanogens resulting in an enhancement of the ncmp from was 3 2 interfacial non covalent interaction energy and electron transfer of sludge to prove the above mentioned hypothesis the effects of pi pretreatment on the solid liquid interfacial non covalent interaction energy and electron transfer of sludge during methanogenic fermentation were explored non covalent interactions e g van der waals electrostatic hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are particularly important in enzymatic reactions e g methanogenic fermentation especially the formation of enzyme substrate binary complexes robert 2000 based on the extended dlvo theory grasso et al 2002 meinders et al 1995 the typical solid liquid interfacial non covalent interaction energy of sludge is mainly composed of the lw interaction energy δ g s l l w the ab interaction energy δ g s l a b and the el interaction energy δ g s l s e l van oss c j 2006 xu et al 2020 amongst these the apolar lw interaction is usually used to describe the attractive interaction via fluctuating dipole induced dipole the polar ab interaction is closely linked to the hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure including the hydrogen bond driven hydrophobic attraction δ g s l a b 0 and the hydration driven hydrophilic repulsion δ g s l a b 0 and the el interaction is directly related to the particle dispersion or adhesion in a polar liquid van oss 2006 xu et al 2020 moreover the ife which is the sum of δ g s l l w and δ g s l a b is typically used to characterise the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the interface fig 3 uses boxplots to depict the results of statistical analyses of the changes in the δ g s l s e l δ g s l l w and δ g s l a b values of the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation the changes in the interfacial lw ab and el interaction energies of the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation are shown in figures s3 s4 and s5 respectively sm the changes in ife and the estimated ionic strength values of the eg and cg during the same process are shown in figure s6 and figure s7 respectively sm and the statistical analysis of the changes in the corresponding df values is summarised via boxplots in figure s8 sm as shown in fig 3 of the three interfacial interaction energies in sludge δ g s l a b received the largest absolute value and exhibited the largest variation in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation indicating that the hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure dominated the solid liquid interfacial non covalent interaction of sludge notably the degrees of fluctuation of δ g s l a b and δ g s l l w in the eg were greater than those of δ g s l a b and δ g s l l w in the cg indicating that both the hydrophobic interaction and hydration pressure and the van der waals attractive interaction were stronger in the eg than in the cg this finding demonstrates that pi pretreatment enhanced the self driven solid liquid interfacial non covalent interactions of sludge by causing fluctuations in hydrogen bonding and the dipole induced dipole forces during fermentation one reasonable explanation for the above observations is that a large amount of multivalent metals especially obm were removed by pi pretreatment table s1 sm without the effects of multivalent metals the density of the electron clouds around atoms of organic molecules increases mccleverty and meyer 2003 jeremy et al 2012 and the distribution of electrons more easily fluctuates therefore dipole moments are readily established and constantly shift due to fluctuations in the electron density resulting in considerable fluctuation of the dipole induced dipole interaction strength between the atoms of different organic molecules and leading to the large variations in the δ g s l l w values at the solid liquid interface of the sludge in the eg meanwhile because the electron distribution of organic molecules more easily fluctuates in the absence of multivalent metals water molecules must switch frequently between acting as proton donors and acceptors to interact with the organic molecules which would cause rapid fluctuations in the hydrogen bonding interaction strength and further result in large variations of the δ g s l a b values at the solid liquid interface of the sludge in the eg it has been reported that the dipole induced dipole interaction is conducive to establishing the specificity of interactions between enzyme active sites and substrate and the hydrogen bonding interaction can provide the binding energy of enzyme substrate binary complex robert a c 2000 it is thus plausible that pi pretreatment enhanced the interfacial enzymatic reactions of sludge via promoting the dipole induced dipole and hydrogen bonding interactions during methanogenic fermentation this would also likely explain why the methane production potentials and rates of was were enhanced by pi pretreatment during methanogenic fermentation fig 1 a careful examination of the changes in the δ g s l a b values in fig 3 reveals that most values of sludge samples in the eg were negative and the average value was approximately 4 08 mj m2 during fermentation in contrast most values of the sludge samples in the cg were positive with an average value of 2 67 mj m2 these results indicate that during methanogenic fermentation the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the sludge surface were changing in both the eg and cg and it was usually hydrophobic in the eg and hydrophilic in the cg indicating that pi pretreatment changed the main form of the solid liquid interfacial non covalent interaction of sludge from hydrophilic repulsion to hydrophobic attraction it can be concluded that pi pretreatment enhanced the solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interaction of sludge by inducing hydrogen bond driven during methanogenic fermentation which is also consistent with the measured ife values figure s6 sm the interfacial hydrophobic interaction usually can provide driving force of enzymatic reactions robert 2000 this result thus suggests that the methanogenic fermentation potential of sludge organic matter at the solid liquid interface can be enhanced by pi pretreatment a hydrophobic interaction is an indispensable organising force in many biomolecular systems and is responsible for the assembly of cell membranes and intracellular compartments tanford 1978 therefore it can be inferred that pi pretreatment can also alter microbial metabolic pathways by enhancing hydrophobic interactions at the solid liquid interface of sludge during methanogenic fermentation which is supported by the observed increase in the methane proportion of biogas from the eg fig 2 another interesting phenomenon shown in fig 3 reveals that during methanogenic fermentation most of the δ g s l s e l values in the eg were much higher than those in the cg at the minimum equilibrium distance 0 157 nm for example the average δ g s l s e l value in the eg was 6 64 1 41 mj m2 which is more than twice that 3 10 1 84 mj m2 in the cg this result indicates that pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the el interactions between sludge particles at the minimum equilibrium distance leading to increase in mass transfer and sludge dispersion figure s8 sm that were conducive to the mobility of biologically important solutes such as enzymes i e proteins and increased contact between those solutes and sludge particles the etc and σ of sludge are two very important parameters used to evaluate the electron transfer potential and etr during methanogenic fermentation in general the higher the etc value of sludge the greater the electron transfer potential and a higher σ value of sludge usually indicates a greater etr rabaey et al 2010 the reductive peak potential ep red of the cv curve can be used to characterise the energy barrier of the accepting electrons here a smaller absolute ep red value of sludge facilitates the reduction reaction which depends on accepting electrons fig 4 depicts the statistical analyses of changes in the electron transfer etc eac edc and σ and ep red values of the eg and cg via boxplots during methanogenic fermentation the raw data on the changes in those parameters are shown in figures s9 s10 and s11 respectively sm the relationship between the etc values and ife values is shown in figure s12 sm as shown in fig 4 the average etc eac and edc values were higher in the eg than in the cg for example the average etc value in the eg was 11 10 1 65 mmol e g vs which was higher than that in the cg 9 14 1 55 mmol e g vs indicating pi pretreatment enhanced the electron transfer potential of sludge during methanogenic fermentation two possible explanations can be considered for this observation first pi pretreatment can partly remove multivalent metals from organic metal complexes consequently the number of free electron pairs around the organic molecules increased and thereby promoted the electron transfer potential this explanation is consistent with the increased lw interaction energy fig 3 which corresponds to the dipole induced dipole interactions caused by the fluctuations of electron clouds second the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface was enhanced by pi pretreatment resulting in a relatively low density water region with an open hydrogen bonded network near the hydrophobic surface vogler 1998 thus the movement of free electron pairs through hydrogen bonds was less restricted by the unavailability of water molecules resulting in an increased electron transfer potential this explanation is consistent with the significant negative correlation between the etc and ife values r 0 6114 p 0 01 in figure s12 sm which indicates that the etc increases with the increasing hydrophobicity of the solid liquid interface of sludge this result also can be supported by the previous findings that water molecules can impose large barriers to the electron transfer wenger et al 2005 lin et al 2005 ponce et al 2000 gray and winkler 2003 as shown in the inserted graph a in fig 4 the average σ value of the eg was higher than that of the cg 3 9 0 6 ms cm vs 3 4 0 5 ms cm indicating that pi pretreatment enhanced the etr of sludge throughout methanogenic fermentation which can be explained by marcus theory gray and winkler 2003 it demonstrates that multivalent metals can increase the reorganization energy of a biological electron transfer in protein leading to a decrease of etr when the multivalent metals were partly removed by pi pretreatment the reorganization energy decreased and thereby the etr increased based on the above findings we concluded that pi pretreatment promoted the electron transfer efficiency including the electron transfer potential and etr of sludge during methanogenic fermentation an interesting observation from fig 4 is that although the average etc and eac values of the eg were higher than those of the cg the fluctuations of these values were smaller in the eg therefore after pi pretreatment the electron transfer potential of sludge not only was increased but was more stable and sustainable throughout methanogenic fermentation another interesting phenomenon from the inserted graph b in fig 4 is that the average absolute ep red value of sludge in the eg was lower than that in the cg demonstrating that the reduction reaction i e accepting electrons of sludge was more facile in the eg this further supports the greater ability of the pi pretreated sludge organic matter to accept electrons during methanogenic fermentation eac in fig 4 which also indicates that after pi pretreatment sludge organic matter is easier to accept electrons during the methanogenic fermentation process based on this it is plausible that the utilisation efficiency of electrons by microbial metabolism could be enhanced via pi pretreatment 3 3 relationships between ife and etc versus daily methane production to further understand how pi pretreatment improves the ncmp of was by enhancing the self driven solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions of sludge and promoting the electron transfer of sludge the relationships of the ife and etc values with daily methane production were studied fig 5 a and fig 5 b depict the correlations of the ife and etc values with the daily methane production data respectively the corresponding main parameters are summarised in tables s5 and s6 respectively sm as shown in fig 5 a as the ife changes from 6 5 1 5 mj m2 to 28 6 1 0 mj m2 the daily methane production exhibits an increasing trend indicating that the daily methane production increased as the sludge surface changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic during methanogenic fermentation subsequently a potential correlation between the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the sludge surface and the daily methane production during methanogenic fermentation of sludge was confirmed by a correlation analysis fig 5 a displays a significant negative correlation between the ife values and daily methane production data r 0 86 p 0 01 indicating that a highly hydrophobic sludge surface would improve daily methane production during the methanogenic fermentation of sludge one logical explanation for this observation is that a more hydrophobic sludge surface usually has a stronger hydrophobic attraction due to attractive structural forces i e hydrogen bond driven force and van der waals attractive force van oss 2006 grasso et al 2002 xu et al 2020 which drive enzyme molecules to contact the substrate and form enzyme substrate binary complexes a more hydrophobic sludge surface enables a stronger hydrophobic attraction and a stronger driving force of enzyme substrate complexation leading to increased daily methane production fig 5 b shows a significant positive correlation between the etc values and daily methane production data r 0 77 p 0 01 indicating that a high electron transfer potential is beneficial to daily methane production during the methanogenic fermentation of sludge presumably a higher electron transfer potential of sludge facilitates the utilisation of electrons and may be especially conducive to the reduction of co2 to ch4 thereby facilitating increased daily methane production during the methanogenic fermentation of sludge in addition we determined that the improved etc was mainly attributable to increased hydrophobicity at the sludge surface figure s12 sm therefore it can be concluded that pi pretreatment enhanced the solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions of sludge and improved the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface thereby promoting the electron transfer potential of sludge and increasing the daily methane production because methane generation is inseparable from the role of microbes in methanogenic fermentation it can be inferred that pi pretreatment also altered the microbial community structure by enhancing the solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions and promoting the electron transfer potential of sludge 3 4 microbial community structure analyses to reveal the effects of pi pretreatment on the microbial community structure the microbial diversity and microbial community compositions of the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation were investigated the shannon and simpson indexes are important measures of microbial alpha diversity i e species evenness and species richness a greater shannon index value indicates greater species evenness whereas a smaller simpson index value indicates higher species richness and lower species evenness in general the level of species evenness is directly proportional to the microbial diversity lande 1996 veech et al 2002 jost 2006 the statistical analyses of the changes in the shannon and simpson index values at the otu levels of bacteria and archaea in the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation are shown in fig 6 the results of a statistical analysis of the differences between the bacterial and archaeal community compositions at different levels i e phylum class and genus between the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation are summarised in figs 7 and 8 respectively the raw data on the changes in the main bacterial and archaeal communities at the phylum class and genus levels between the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation are shown in figures s13 and s14 respectively sm the statistical analyses of changes in the relative abundances of the main hydrogenotrophic methanogens i e the genus methanobacterium and the main methylotrophic methanogens i e the genera methanomassiliicoccales and methanofastidiosum are summarised in figure s15 sm as shown in fig 6 a the average values of both the shannon index and simpson index at the otu levels of bacteria were slightly lower in the eg than in the cg indicating that pi pretreatment led to a slight decrease in bacterial species evenness and a slight increase in species richness during the methanogenic fermentation of sludge in other words pi pretreatment slightly decreased the bacterial diversity which was also indicated by the analysis of relative abundance in the bacterial communities figure s13 sm fig 6 b shows the average shannon index value at the archaeal otu level was higher in the eg than in the cg indicating that pi pretreatment improved the archaeal species evenness the average simpson index value was lower in the eg than in the cg indicating an increase in the archaeal species evenness and decrease in species richness after pi pretreatment during the methanogenic fermentation of sludge i e an increase in archaeal diversity based on these findings it is concluded that the bacterial diversity decreased and the archaeal diversity increased after pi pretreatment during the methanogenic fermentation of was the effects of pi pretreatment on the bacterial community compositions were revealed by the identification of the bacterial community compositions figures s13 sm and the analysis of statistically significant differences in the identified bacterial community compositions between the eg and cg fig 7 as shown in fig 7 a and s13 a sm the bacterial phyla proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and actinobacteriota which are mainly associated with the decomposition of complex organic matter via hydrolysis and acidification amaresan et al 2020 jang et al 2014 gagliano et al 2015 wu et al 2020 were dominant in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation interestingly however fig 7 a reveals that the average relative abundances as percentages of these bacterial phyla differed between the eg and cg the average proportion of phylum firmicutes in the eg 16 9 2 9 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in the cg 11 7 5 9 during methanogenic fermentation indicating that pi pretreatment significantly increased the relative abundance of that phylum the firmicutes has been reported to be functionally important in the hydrolysis and acidification of organic mater peces et al 2018 wu et al 2020 it is thus plausible that pi pretreatment can eradicate the rate limiting step of sludge organic matter hydrolysis by increasing the relative abundance of firmicutes during methanogenic fermentation this phenomenon may also explain the kinetics of methane production with pi pretreatment fig 1 according to the figs 7 b and s13 b sm the bacterial communities at the class level in both the eg and cg were mainly composed of the anaerolineae phylum chloroflexi the clostridia phylum firmicutes the synergistia phylum firmicutes the gammaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria the alphaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria and the bacteroidia phylum bacteroidetes one notable result from fig 7 b is that the average proportions of the classes clostridia p 0 05 thermoleophilia p 0 01 and chloroflexia p 0 05 were significantly higher in the eg than in the cg indicating that pi pretreatment significantly increased the relative abundances of these classes amongst these three classes the clostridia accounted for the largest average proportion in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation the clostridia has been reported to be important in the anaerobic hydrolysis of cellulose during the ad of was syutsubo and nagaya 2005 which further indicates that pi pretreatment significantly improved the hydrolysis of sludge organic matter during methanogenic fermentation in addition fig 7 c and figure s13 c sm demonstrate that except for the bacteria of unknown genera i e others the bacterial genus with the highest relative abundance in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation was thermovirga followed by the genera norank f norank o aminicenantales and romboutsia notably as shown in fig 7 c the average proportions of the genera romboutsia p 0 01 nonrank f jg30 kf cm45 p 0 01 clostridium sensus stricto 1 p 0 05 and rhodoplanes p 0 0001 were significantly higher in the eg than in the cg indicating a significant beneficial effect of pi pretreatment on the abundances of these genera here the romboutsia accounted for the largest average proportion during methanogenic fermentation romboutsia was reported to utilise glucose and fructose as sole carbon sources for the production of acetic acid isobutanoic acid and isovaleric acid etc wang et al 2015 thus it is plausible that pi pretreatment promoted the acidification of the sludge organic matter during methanogenic fermentation by significantly improving the relative abundance of romboutsia p 0 01 interestingly fig 7 c demonstrates that although the average proportion of the genus rhodoplanes was low 2 its abundance differed most significantly between the eg and cg p 0 0001 rhodoplanes is a genus of phototrophic bacteria with the function of denitrification in anaerobic environments hiraishi and ueda 1994 accordingly pi pretreatment may be support the use of phototrophic bacteria for denitrification in such an environment overall pi pretreatment appears to improve the community of functional bacteria that support hydrolysis and acidification during the methanogenic fermentation of was the effects of pi pretreatment on the archaeal community compositions of the eg and cg are shown in figures s14 sm and the statistical evaluation of differences between the groups is shown in fig 8 accordingly the halobacterota euryarchaeota and thermoplasmatota were identified as the dominant archaeal phyla in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation fig 8 a shows that the average proportions of euryarchaeota and thermoplasmatota were higher in the eg than in the cg 43 2 12 0 vs 37 1 12 6 and 3 1 2 1 vs 2 2 1 4 respectively indicating that pi pretreatment improved the relative abundances of those phyla during methanogenic fermentation in general except for the species methanosphaera stadtmaniae a h2 dependant methylotroph most of the identified methanogens of the phylum euryarchaeota methanogens were hydrogenotrophs lyu et al 2018 lyu and whitman 2019 additionally all the identified phylum thermoplasmatota methanogens are the h2 dependant methylotrophs lyu et al 2018 therefore it is plausible that pi pretreatment improved the relative abundances of hydrogenotrophic and h2 dependant methylotrophic methanogens and enhanced the metabolic reaction 4h2 co2 ch4 2h2o leading to a high proportion of methane in the biogas fig 2 produced during the methanogenic fermentation of was at the class level as shown in figs 8 b and s14 b sm methanosarcinia methanobacteria and thermococci were identified as the dominant archaeal classes in both the eg and cg and the average relative abundances differed between the groups for example the average relative abundance of methanobacteria in the eg was 32 7 6 9 which was 24 8 higher than that in the cg as shown in figs 8 c and s14 c sm which present the genus level data the archaeal communities in both the eg and cg during methanogenic fermentation were mainly composed of the genera methanosaeta methanobacterium candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanosarcina however the relative abundances of these archaeal communities differed between the eg and cg 38 7 13 5 30 0 6 3 10 6 8 0 and 9 3 4 1 respectively vs 42 5 11 7 23 1 6 8 10 9 8 7 and 10 9 5 0 respectively methanosaeta and methanosarcina species are typical acetotrophic methanogens demirel and scherer 2008 lyu et al 2018 methanobacterium species are typical hydrogenotrophic methanogens lyu et al 2018 lyu and whitman 2019 christou et al 2021 and candidatus methanofastidiosum species are h2 dependant methylotrophic methanogens shamurad et al 2020 nobu et al 2015 therefore the average relative abundances of the main acetotrophic methanogens at the genus level i e methanosaeta and methanosarcina were approximately 48 in the eg and 53 4 in the cg and this difference suggests that pi pretreatment suppressed the metabolic pathway by which acetate is split to ch4 likely pi pretreatment increased the archaeal diversity fig 6 b and improved the relative abundances of other methanogens figure s14 and figure s15 sm this is also consistent with the differences in the average relative abundances of the main hydrogenotrophic methanogens at the genus level i e methanobacterium between the eg and cg after pi pretreatment the relative abundances of the main hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased by 29 9 indicating the increased reduction of co2 to ch4 in the methanogenic fermentation of sludge moreover the statistical results in fig 8 b and c demonstrate that the average proportions of the class methanobacteria phylum euryarchaeota p 0 05 and the genus methanobacterium class methanobacteria p 0 05 were significantly higher in the eg than in the cg indicating the significant beneficial effects of pi pretreatment on these taxonomic groups during methanogenic fermentation which further confirmed that pi pretreatment significantly improved the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens during the methanogenic fermentation of was 3 5 relationships between ife and etc versus the relative abundances of the main genera of methanogens to further understand how pi pretreatment alters the methanogenic community structure by enhancing self driven solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions and promoting electron transfer in sludge the relationships of the ife and etc values with the relative abundances of main genera of methanogens were explored the analyses of correlations between the ife and etc values versus the relative abundances of the main genera of acetotrophic methanogens methanosaeta and methanosarcina and hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the corresponding main parameters are summarised in tables s7 s10 sm as shown in fig 9 as the ife changes from a positive to a negative value the relative abundances of both acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens exhibit increasing trends indicating that the hydrophobisation of the sludge surface increases the relative abundances of both types of organisms accordingly a hydrophobic sludge surface may be favourable for the enrichment of the main methanogenic genera this possibility was confirmed by the correlation analyses which revealed that significant negative correlations r 0 74 p 0 01 and r 0 64 p 0 01 respectively between the ife values and the relative abundances of the main acetotrophic methanogens in fig 9 a and the main hydrogenotrophic methanogens in fig 9 b respectively it thus can be concluded that main acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens tend to aggregate preferentially on hydrophobic sludge surfaces during methanogenic fermentation which may also explain why a highly hydrophobic sludge surface promotes daily methane production during methanogenic fermentation fig 5 one logical explanation for this observation is that a hydrophobic surface usually has a strong hydrophobic attraction to microbes i e the attractive structural forces fig 3 which is conducive to microbial adhesion zobell 1943 in contrast a hydrophilic surface usually has a strong hydrophilic repulsion fig 3 which is conducive to microbial dispersion zobell 1943 in an aquatic environment with a low nutrient concentration such as sludge during methanogenic fermentation surface attached microbes are typically more chemically active than free cells loosdrecht et al 1990 marshall 1984 therefore a hydrophobic sludge surface would contain relatively larger populations of the main active acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens than a hydrophilic surface during the methanogenic fermentation of was fig 10 demonstrates that as the etc value increased the relative abundances of the main acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens decreased and increased respectively suggesting that the electron transfer potential of sludge may be correlated with the populations of both types of methanogens this possibility was confirmed by a correlation analysis as shown in fig 10 a a significant negative correlation was observed between the etc value and the relative abundance of the main acetotrophic methanogens r 0 69 p 0 01 whereas a significant positive correlation was observed between the etc value and the relative abundance of the main hydrogenotrophic methanogens r 0 77 p 0 01 fig 10 b an improvement in the electron transfer potential appears to be conducive to the enrichment of main hydrogenotrophic methanogens but not of the main acetotrophic methanogens in the metabolic pathway used by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens the reduction of co2 to ch4 may be heavily dependant on electrons barker and buswell 1957 and therefore a high electron transfer potential would be beneficial to the reduction of co2 in contrast in the metabolic pathway used by the acetotrophic methanogens a methyl group is transferred from acetate to ch4 as a unit and one atom of h per molecule of ch4 is derived from the solvent i e h2o accordingly acetotrophic methanogens may be less reliant on a supply of electrons to split acetate to into ch4 and co2 therefore throughout methanogenic fermentation a higher electron transfer potential helps to enrich the hydrogenotrophic methanogens by giving them an advantage over the main acetotrophic methanogens this result also demonstrates that pi pretreatment can improve the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens by promoting the electron transfer potential of sludge we note however that microbial surface thermodynamics typically bridges the micro scale biological structure and the macro scale biological function strevett and chen 2003 as was is mainly composed of microbes the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of was would bridge the micro scale sludge structure and the macro scale biological functions such as methanogenic fermentation by dismantling of the sludge structure via partly removing multivalent metals pi pretreatment significantly alters the solid liquid interfacial thermodynamics of sludge and thus affects the macro scale biological function leading to changes in the microbial diversity specifically pi pretreatment significantly enhanced the self driven solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions fig 3 and electron transfer efficiency of sludge fig 4 and thus increased the relative abundances of the main acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens fig 5 the electron transfer potential had a stronger promoting effect on hydrogenotrophic methanogens than on acetotrophic methanogens which led to a greater enhancement of the relative abundance of the former group and a change in the methanogenic community structure figs 6 and 8 4 conclusions in this study we confirmed the hypothesis that pi pretreatment can enhance the self driven solid liquid interfacial non covalent interactions and promoted the electron transfer efficiency of sludge thereby strengthening the abiotic forces driving interfacial enzymatic reactions and improving the relative abundances of functional microbes for hydrolysis acidification and methanation these changes result in enhanced generation efficiency of methane from was the main conclusions are as follows 1 pi pretreatment enhanced the methane production potential methane production rate and methane proportion in biogas from was during methanogenic fermentation for example after pi pretreatment the maximum methane production potential and rate increased by 122 2 and 154 4 respectively and the maximum methane proportion in biogas reached 76 8 2 pi pretreatment enhanced the self driven solid liquid interfacial hydrophobic interactions of sludge and increased the forces driving interfacial enzymatic reactions via enhancing hydrophobic attraction during methanogenic fermentation 3 pi pretreatment promoted the electron transfer efficiency of sludge and decreased the barrier of the reduction reaction by positively shifting the reductive peak potential during methanogenic fermentation 4 pi pretreatment improved the relative abundances of the main functional microbes for hydrolysis acidification and methanation especially hydrogenotrophic methanogens 29 9 5 a close internal relationship exists between the solid liquid interfacial non covalent interactions and the etc of sludge with respect to the methanogenic fermentation ability a strong hydrophobic attractive force on the sludge surface and a high etc can enhance the generation efficiency of methane these findings will provide a reference for the development of second generation pretreatment methods with the aim of improving the biodegradability of sludge by removing the intrinsic inhibitory substances and increasing the abiotic forces driving interfacial enzymatic reactions in sludge rather than focusing solely on the initial organic solubilisation of sludge furthermore these findings also provide a methodological reference for revealing the details of the black box ad process by monitoring changes in the
