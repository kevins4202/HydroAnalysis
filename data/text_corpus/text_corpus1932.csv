their wide impacts on crop yields hao et al 2018 manning et al 2018 lesk and anderson 2021 for example lesk and anderson 2021 used monthly soil moisture to define droughts and assessed changes in

summers in many regions worldwide in the future is largely related to the enhanced precipitation temperature dependence these evaluations of the impacts of droughts hot extremes or their dependence on changes in compound dry hot events highlight the complicated driving factors manning et al 2019 for the increase of the cadhes there is also an increasing interest in understanding the contribution of

still unclear as to the relative importance of different driving factors i e agricultural droughts high temperature extremes and their dependence in explaining changes in cadhes the main objective of this study is to quantify the relative contribution of different driving factors to recent changes in cadhes during summers from 1949 to 2014 in eastern china we defined cadhes based on summer soil moisture and temperature and then evaluated the changes in different regions across eastern china the relative contribution of individual variables and their dependence on the changes in cadhes is then quantified followed by a discussion on the implications and limitations this study will aid the development of strategies for agricultural water management to cope with potentially high risks of concurrent agricultural droughts and hot extremes under global warming in eastern china 2 study area and data we focus on eastern china from 105 e to the eastern coastlines with a dense population and widespread cropland the cadhes occurring in this region may pose risks to food production in china following li et al 2015 eastern china is further divided into four sub regions including northeast china ne north china nc central china cc and south china sc as shown in fig s1 these sub regions are used to explore the regional differences of changes and drivers of cadhes the monthly air temperature and soil moisture data at a 0 25 degree resolution for the period 1949 2014 were obtained from global land data assimilation system version 2 0 gldas 2 0 the meteorological data from gldas 2 0 are entirely based on the princeton global meteorological forcing version 2 pgf v2 sheffield et al 2006 which merges reanalysis products with observation based datasets this forcing dataset has been evaluated and shows relatively good performance in china lai et al 2016 wang et al 2016 gldas 2 0 provides the simulated soil moisture from the noah land surface model which uses the modis based land surface parameters e g static land cover from modified igbp modis 20 category vegetation this simulated soil moisture dataset has been validated in china wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a and widely employed in previous studies for drought assessments han et al 2019 li et al 2020 soil moisture at four layers i e 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm can be obtained from this dataset here we selected the soil moisture between 0 and 100 cm to define agriculture droughts which has been commonly used due to effective representation of the root zone of vegetation and crops martínez fernández and ceballos 2005 han et al 2021 lesk and anderson 2021 mckinnon et al 2021 3 method 3 1 definition of cadhes due to the higher risk of co occurrence of dry and hot events in the warm season zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 we focus on the cadhes during summer june july august in this study the standardized soil moisture index ssi and standardized temperature index sti are used to characterize the agricultural droughts and hot events respectively zscheischler et al 2014 hao et al 2018 these indicators are computed by ssi n 1 p s and sti n 1 p t where n 1 is the inverse of the standard normal distribution function and p s and p t are the marginal probabilities of soil moisture and temperature respectively the marginal probability can be calculated by empirical gringorten plotting position to avoid assumptions of parametric distributions hao et al 2018 we use the 3 month ssi and sti in august to represent the summer droughts and hot conditions respectively the agricultural droughts are defined as ssi 0 5 approximately 30th percentile and the hot events are defined as sti 0 5 approximately 70th percentile the cadhes are defined as the concurrence of agricultural droughts and hot events i e ssi 0 5 and sti 0 5 during the summer seasons the frequency of cadhes in a certain period is defined as the number of occurrences divided by the total number of the period the study period is separated into two 33 year periods 1949 1981 and 1982 2014 to analyze the changes in cadhes 3 2 return period the return period rp of compound events is employed to represent the risk for the contribution analysis in the following sections a low return period implies a high probability of cadhes occurrences the return period of cadhes is expressed as the inverse of the bivariate probability based on the copula which is given by 1 rp 1 p ssi s 0 sti t 0 1 u s 0 c u s 0 u t 0 where c is the copula fitted to u s u t u s and u t are marginal probability distributions of ssi and sti s 0 and t 0 are the value of ssi and sti at which the joint probability is evaluated respectively commonly used copula families including gaussian student s t frank gumbel and clayton and their rotated versions are selected according to akaike information criterion aic and fitted by the inversion of kendall s tau in each grid genest and favre 2007 manning et al 2019 tavakol et al 2020 the vinecopula r package is employed for the copula selection and parameter estimation in this study 3 3 contribution analysis to unravel the relative contribution from changes in individual events and their dependence on the variation in cadhes we disentangle these factors using the method provided by bevacqua et al 2019 the key concept of this method is the three experiments to quantify how the return period or joint probability of cahdes would change in the latter period 1982 2014 relative to the former period 1949 1981 when only one factor i e soil moisture temperature and their dependence changes the relative change of return period for each experiment i can be expressed as 2 rp exp i 100 rp exp i rp 1 rp 1 where rp 1 is the return period for the former period and rp exp i is the return period computed by the following three experiments experiment a contribution from soil moisture s given the variable s 1 i e s in the former period we compute the associated empirical cumulative distribution cdf u s 1 given the variable s 2 i e s in the latter period we define the empirical cdf f s 2 which is used to calculate s a f s 2 1 u s 1 then we use bivariate variables s a t 1 to compute rp exp a via eq 1 the s a t 1 use the marginal distribution of s in the latter period to reflect the influence of changes in soil moisture on return period variation experiment b contribution from temperature t similar to experiment a but exchanging s and t experiment c contribution from s t dependence given bivariate variables s 1 t 1 and s 2 t 2 we compute the empirical cdf s c f s 1 1 u s 2 and t c f t 1 1 u t 2 the variables s c t c have the same spearman correlation as s 2 t 2 while keeping the marginal distributions in the former period then the rp exp c is computed based on s c t c the return period changes rp computed by the three experiments can represent the relative contribution of different factors note that the negative changes of rp i e reduced return period or increased probability indicate contributions to the increase in cadhes 4 results 4 1 climatological frequency of cadhes the kendall s rank correlation coefficient is employed to measure the dependence between summer temperature and soil moisture during 1949 2014 as shown in fig 1 a negative correlations are statistically significant at the 0 05 significance level in most areas across eastern china the negative soil moisture temperature dependence can be explained by two pathways including land atmosphere feedback and synoptic scale correspondence between cloud cover and incoming shortwave radiations trenberth and shea 2005 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 specifically the soil moisture deficit induced by low precipitation can lead to reduced evaporative cooling accompanied by increased sensible heat and increase surface air temperature high temperature anomalies can accelerate evapotranspiration which further depletes the soil moisture miralles et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in addition the low cloud cover associated with low precipitation and subsequent soil moisture deficit tends to enhance the incoming shortwave radiation resulting in the surface air temperature increases berg et al 2015 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 the combination of these processes results in strong negative soil moisture temperature dependence the climatological frequency of cadhes during summer for the period 1949 2014 in eastern china is shown in fig 1 b the pattern of frequency of cadhes shows high consistency with the dependence between summer temperature and soil moisture for example north china where strong land atmosphere interaction has been shown zhang and wu 2011 wu and zhang 2015 is among the regions with a high frequency of cadhes in most parts of central and south china middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river valley cadhes occur more frequently fig 1 b which can be explained by stronger soil moisture temperature dependence fig 1 a 4 2 changes in the frequency of cadhes and associated driving factors the changes in the frequency of cadhes in eastern china and four sub regions for two equal periods 1949 1981 and 1982 2014 are shown in fig 2 significant increases in the frequency of cadhes are found in ne nc and sc fig 2 b shows the larger increase in the frequency of cadhes in nc we also compute the relative changes of the average frequency between two periods in each region for ne nc and sc the regional average frequency increases by 125 160 and 83 respectively meanwhile cadhes in cc show a decrease in regional average frequency 39 this pattern increased cadhes in most areas except for the cc is consistent with the changes in compound meteorological droughts and hot events in previous studies wu et al 2019 2020 changes in the compound events are related to changes in each variable and the dependence between them zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 the scatterplots of regional average summer sti and ssi for two equal periods are shown in fig 3 changes in summer ssi sti and dependence for each grid are shown in fig s2 the marginal distributions in each period are shown to represent the individual changes in soil moisture or temperature the 95 confidence ellipses of the ssi sti pairs in each period are constructed to characterize the joint changes of soil moisture and temperature the marginal distribution of sti indicates that hot events have become more frequent in ne nc and sc in 1982 2014 relative to 1949 2014 the marginal distribution of ssi implies that agricultural droughts have become more frequent in nc and less frequent in cc with heterogeneous changes in other regions there are distinct displacements of the ellipses towards a warm and dry condition in ne nc and sc the findings of this changing pattern of soil moisture and temperature agree with previous research wang et al 2011 lai et al 2016 hu et al 2017 ye et al 2019 for example the variation of ssi and sti over north china is consistent with previous studies showing that the co variability of summer temperature and soil moisture has changed from cool wet to warm dry su and wang 2007 previous studies have shown that enhanced dry hot dependence could lead to more frequent compound dry and hot events zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 hao and singh 2020 the dependence i e kendall s rank correlation between ssi and sti has strengthened in ne and sc from 0 15 to 0 35 and from 0 30 to 0 42 while weakened in nc and cc from 0 33 to 0 30 and from 0 50 to 0 42 in particular in ne the correlation between soil moisture and temperature has shifted from insignificant correlations to significant correlations at the 0 05 significance level which indicates the interaction between temperature and soil moisture has strengthened remarkably this implies that the increase of cadhes in ne partly results from the enhanced ssi sti dependence as for the regions with increased cadhes and weakened dependence such as parts of nc the individual trends of soil moisture and temperature may compensate for the effect of dependence changes considering the heterogeneous changes in the soil moisture and dependence fig s2 the increase of temperature may be the main driver of increased cadhes meanwhile these results also imply that the changed dependence may play a role in changes in the frequency of cadhes in certain regions 4 3 disentanglement of driving factors previous sections mainly explain the variability of cadhes based on changes in soil moisture ssi temperature sti and their dependence from a qualitative manner following bevacqua et al 2019 and manning et al 2019 we further quantitatively disentangle the impact of these factors on changes in the return period or probability of cadhes as shown in fig 4 the spatial distribution of the relative contribution illustrates that these factors have different degrees of contributions in different regions changes in sti tend to increase the cadhes in ne nc and sc and decrease the cadhes in cc as shown in fig 4 b this is consistent with significant temperature increases in ne nc and sc and the slight cooling trend in parts of cc as shown in fig s2 b the decrease in ssi contributes to cadhes increases in large parts of nc and sc fig 4 a where soil moisture has a drying trend fig s2 a meanwhile the wetting trend reduces the cadhes in cc significantly strengthened dependence between ssi and sti contributes to the cadhes increases in ne fig 4 c where negative ssi sti correlations become stronger in the later period fig s2 c to compare the relative contributions of each factor in different sub regions the boxplots of the contributions from three components are shown in fig 5 in ne changes in sti have the main contribution followed by ssi sti dependence while the influence of ssi is negligible median rp sti 57 8 rp ssi 1 0 rp dep 18 8 the results highlight the important contribution of the dependence changes on the variability of cadhes though the temperature increase still plays the dominant role in nc changes in sti and ssi contribute the most to cadhes increase with the dependence change playing a minor role median rp sti 53 9 rp ssi 15 8 rp dep 4 9 in sc both the influences of ssi and dependence are slight with temperature increase playing the dominant role median rp sti 50 4 rp ssi 1 9 rp dep 0 5 in cc the negative effects of all three factors lead to decrease in cadhes median rp sti 3 9 rp ssi 26 0 rp dep 13 3 the wetting trend in summer is the main cause of the decreased cadhes in cc which is more important than the changes in temperature and dependence in general the increased temperature has a dominant influence on increased cadhes in most regions while the contribution of soil moisture and dependence variation also play important roles in certain regions note that changes in dependence do not have a widespread spatial pattern with consistent symbols except for ne and may compensate each other at the regional scale median t dep close to 0 such as in nc and sc 5 discussion 5 1 implications concurrences of agricultural droughts and hot extremes have a wide range of impacts on agriculture these events can reduce crop yields through decreasing water supply i e low soil moisture and increasing water demand in response to heat stress we find increased risk of cadhes in most regions of eastern china where a variety of crops are widely planted the increase of cadhes is shown to be induced by trends in soil moisture temperature as well as changes in their dependence though temperature increase or regional warming has usually been shown to be a dominant driving factor the dry hot dependence change may also be at play in changes of compound events zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 hao and singh 2020 for example the increased dependence between summer soil moisture and temperature plays a relatively significant impact on changes in cadhes in ne these results highlight the importance of dry hot dependence in studying the variability of compound droughts and hot events this further heightens the importance of accurately simulating the interaction between soil moisture and temperature or soil moisture temperature feedback in land surface models miralles et al 2019 which can improve our understanding of the variability of cadhes in historical periods and future projections disentangling the impacts of different factors on changes in cadhes contributes to adaptation measures of the agriculture sector under global warming although our study focuses on the historical assessments of cadhes these methods can also be employed to guide the future projection and adaptation of such compound events for example heat resistant cultivars of the crop could be considered in the regions with cadhes increases driven by warming coordinated water resources management i e increased irrigation could be used to mitigate impacts of cadhes in the regions with cadhes increases driven by drying meanwhile in the regions where cadhes increase is also induced by strengthened soil moisture temperature dependence more complex adaptation strategies need to be designed 5 2 limitations several limitations exist in this study that may induce uncertainties to obtain large samples of compound events gldas 2 0 with a relatively long term record is employed in this study however errors in the simulated soil moisture from land surface modeling can affect the soil moisture temperature dependences and associated co variabilities specifically the land surface model simulation used in this study is unable to reflect the land use change e g urbanization as a result of the static vegetation and soil parameters meanwhile the human water use e g irrigation and exploitation of groundwater is not considered in the model simulations leading to biases in regions with intense human interference to improve this representation of land surface conditions at regional or local scales soil moisture from gauge measurements e g china meteorological administration cma and satellite remote sensing e g european space agency climate change initiative esa cci can be used as candidates for future studies liu et al 2019 chen and yuan 2020 we select the same depths of soil moisture and same season in this study without consideration of the root zone depth and growing periods for different crops the consideration of crop specific conditions is beneficial for reflecting the influence of cadhes which is worth being explored further in addition we define cadhes on the seasonal scale while events on sub seasonal scales e g daily and weekly may have different change patterns and drivers brunner et al 2021 li et al 2021 mukherjee and mishra 2021 the statistical attribution method used in this study can reflect the relative role of different driving factors to cadhes however the physical processes of these factors in affecting the variability of cadhes are not clear as such dynamical models can be used for further attribution analysis to disentangle the relative roles of different factors wehrli et al 2019 for example separating the influence of dependence by decoupling the soil moisture and temperature in the land surface model can quantify the contributions of dependence on cadhes furthermore the underlying physical drivers for changes in individual events and dependence e g global warming and large scale atmospheric circulations need to be understood hao and singh 2020 sarhadi et al 2018 vogel et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b overall it is worth exploring other datasets specific crops attribution methods and models to improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms of cadhes and the cause of their changes 6 conclusion in this study we investigated changes in compound agricultural droughts and hot events cadhes and contributing factors for the period 1949 2014 in eastern china results showed that cadhes occurred more frequently in cc and sc relative to other regions cadhes exhibited significant increases in ne 125 nc 160 and sc 83 whereas decreases in cc 39 for the period 1982 2014 relative to 1949 1981 the changes can be attributed to changes in soil moisture temperature and their dependence increased hot events and agricultural droughts were observed in nc and sc meanwhile the dependence between ssi and sti has strengthened in ne and sc we employed a statistical method to quantify the relative contributions of these factors results indicated that the increased temperature dominated the increased cadhes in most regions of eastern china except for cc and the strengthening dependence also had a significant influence in ne the wetting trend had a major weakening effect on the changes in cadhes in cc the results highlighted the importance of modeling the soil moisture temperature dependence in understanding the variability of cadhes overall our study showed an overall enhanced risk of cadhes towards agricultural production or crop yields seasonal prediction and future projection of these compound events are useful measures to mitigate their potentially negative impacts in eastern china

tavakol et al 2020 the vinecopula r package is employed for the copula selection and parameter estimation in this study 3 3 contribution analysis to unravel the relative contribution from changes in individual events and their dependence on the variation in cadhes we disentangle these factors using the method provided by bevacqua et al 2019 the key concept of this method is the three experiments to quantify how the return period or joint probability of cahdes would change in the latter period 1982 2014 relative to the former period 1949 1981 when only one factor i e soil moisture temperature and their dependence changes the relative change of return period for each experiment i can be expressed as 2 rp exp i 100 rp exp i rp 1 rp 1 where rp 1 is the return period for the former period and rp exp i is the return period computed by the following three experiments experiment a contribution from soil moisture s given the variable s 1 i e s in the former period we compute the associated empirical cumulative distribution cdf u s 1 given the variable s 2 i e s in the latter period we define the empirical cdf f s 2 which is used to calculate s a f s 2 1 u s 1 then we use bivariate variables s a t 1 to compute rp exp a via eq 1 the s a t 1 use the marginal distribution of s in the latter period to reflect the influence of changes in soil moisture on return period variation experiment b contribution from temperature t similar to experiment a but exchanging s and t experiment c contribution from s t dependence given bivariate variables s 1 t 1 and s 2 t 2 we compute the empirical cdf s c f s 1 1 u s 2 and t c f t 1 1 u t 2 the variables s c t c have the same spearman correlation as s 2 t 2 while keeping the marginal distributions in the former period then the rp exp c is computed based on s c t c the return period changes rp computed by the three experiments can represent the relative contribution of different factors note that the negative changes of rp i e reduced return period or increased probability indicate contributions to the increase in cadhes 4 results 4 1 climatological frequency of cadhes the kendall s rank correlation coefficient is employed to measure the dependence between summer temperature and soil moisture during 1949 2014 as shown in fig 1 a negative correlations are statistically significant at the 0 05 significance level in most areas across eastern china the negative soil moisture temperature dependence can be explained by two pathways including land atmosphere feedback and synoptic scale correspondence between cloud cover and incoming shortwave radiations trenberth and shea 2005 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 specifically the soil moisture deficit induced by low precipitation can lead to reduced evaporative cooling accompanied by increased sensible heat and increase surface air temperature high temperature anomalies can accelerate evapotranspiration which further depletes the soil moisture miralles et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in addition the low cloud cover associated with low precipitation and subsequent soil moisture deficit tends to enhance the incoming shortwave radiation resulting in the surface air temperature increases berg et al 2015 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 the combination of these processes results in strong negative soil moisture temperature dependence the climatological frequency of cadhes during summer for the period 1949 2014 in eastern china is shown in fig 1 b the pattern of frequency of cadhes shows high consistency with the dependence between summer temperature and soil moisture for example north china where strong land atmosphere interaction has been shown zhang and wu 2011 wu and zhang 2015 is among the regions with a high frequency of cadhes in most parts of central and south china middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river valley cadhes occur more frequently fig 1 b which can be explained by stronger soil moisture temperature dependence fig 1 a 4 2 changes in the frequency of cadhes and associated driving factors the changes in the frequency of cadhes in eastern china and four sub regions for two equal periods 1949 1981 and 1982 2014 are shown in fig 2 significant increases in the frequency of cadhes are found in ne nc and sc fig 2 b shows the larger increase in the frequency of cadhes in nc we also compute the relative changes of the average frequency between two periods in each region for ne nc and sc the regional average frequency increases by 125 160 and 83 respectively meanwhile cadhes in cc show a decrease in regional average frequency 39 this pattern increased cadhes in most areas except for the cc is consistent with the changes in compound meteorological droughts and hot events in previous studies wu et al 2019 2020 changes in the compound events are related to changes in each variable and the dependence between them zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 the scatterplots of regional average summer sti and ssi for two equal periods are shown in fig 3 changes in summer ssi sti and dependence for each grid are shown in fig s2 the marginal distributions in each period are shown to represent the individual changes in soil moisture or temperature the 95 confidence ellipses of the ssi sti pairs in each period are constructed to characterize the joint changes of soil moisture and temperature the marginal distribution of sti indicates that hot events have become more frequent in ne nc and sc in 1982 2014 relative to 1949 2014 the marginal distribution of ssi implies that agricultural droughts have become more frequent in nc and less frequent in cc with heterogeneous changes in other regions there are distinct displacements of the ellipses towards a warm and dry condition in ne nc and sc the findings of this changing pattern of soil moisture and temperature agree with previous research wang et al 2011 lai et al 2016 hu et al 2017 ye et al 2019 for example the variation of ssi and sti over north china is consistent with previous studies showing that the co variability of summer temperature and soil moisture has changed from cool wet to warm dry su and wang 2007 previous studies have shown that enhanced dry hot dependence could lead to more frequent compound dry and hot events zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 hao and singh 2020 the dependence i e kendall s rank correlation between ssi and sti has strengthened in ne and sc from 0 15 to 0 35 and from 0 30 to 0 42 while weakened in nc and cc from 0 33 to 0 30 and from 0 50 to 0 42 in particular in ne the correlation between soil moisture and temperature has shifted from insignificant correlations to significant correlations at the 0 05 significance level which indicates the interaction between temperature and soil moisture has strengthened remarkably this implies that the increase of cadhes in ne partly results from the enhanced ssi sti dependence as for the regions with increased cadhes and weakened dependence such as parts of nc the individual trends of soil moisture and temperature may compensate for the effect of dependence changes considering the heterogeneous changes in the soil moisture and dependence fig s2 the increase of temperature may be the main driver of increased cadhes meanwhile these results also imply that the changed dependence may play a role in changes in the frequency of cadhes in certain regions 4 3 disentanglement of driving factors previous sections mainly explain the variability of cadhes based on changes in soil moisture ssi temperature sti and their dependence from a qualitative manner following bevacqua et al 2019 and manning et al 2019 we further quantitatively disentangle the impact of these factors on changes in the return period or probability of cadhes as shown in fig 4 the spatial distribution of the relative contribution illustrates that these factors have different degrees of contributions in different regions changes in sti tend to increase the cadhes in ne nc and sc and decrease the cadhes in cc as shown in fig 4 b this is consistent with significant temperature increases in ne nc and sc and the slight cooling trend in parts of cc as shown in fig s2 b the decrease in ssi contributes to cadhes increases in large parts of nc and sc fig 4 a where soil moisture has a drying trend fig s2 a meanwhile the wetting trend reduces the cadhes in cc significantly strengthened dependence between ssi and sti contributes to the cadhes increases in ne fig 4 c where negative ssi sti correlations become stronger in the later period fig s2 c to compare the relative contributions of each factor in different sub regions the boxplots of the contributions from three components are shown in fig 5 in ne changes in sti have the main contribution followed by ssi sti dependence while the influence of ssi is negligible median rp sti 57 8 rp ssi 1 0 rp dep 18 8 the results highlight the important contribution of the dependence changes on the variability of cadhes though the temperature increase still plays the dominant role in nc changes in sti and ssi contribute the most to cadhes increase with the dependence change playing a minor role median rp sti 53 9 rp ssi 15 8 rp dep 4 9 in sc both the influences of ssi and dependence are slight with temperature increase playing the dominant role median rp sti 50 4 rp ssi 1 9 rp dep 0 5 in cc the negative effects of all three factors lead to decrease in cadhes median rp sti 3 9 rp ssi 26 0 rp dep 13 3 the wetting trend in summer is the main cause of the decreased cadhes in cc which is more important than the changes in temperature and dependence in general the increased temperature has a dominant influence on increased cadhes in most regions while the contribution of soil moisture and dependence variation also play important roles in certain regions note that changes in dependence do not have a widespread spatial pattern with consistent symbols except for ne and may compensate each other at the regional scale median t dep close to 0 such as in nc and sc 5 discussion 5 1 implications concurrences of agricultural droughts and hot extremes have a wide range of impacts on agriculture these events can reduce crop yields through decreasing water supply i e low soil moisture and increasing water demand in response to heat stress we find increased risk of cadhes in most regions of eastern china where a variety of crops are widely planted the increase of cadhes is shown to be induced by trends in soil moisture temperature as well as changes in their dependence though temperature increase or regional warming has usually been shown to be a dominant driving factor the dry hot dependence change may also be at play in changes of compound events zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 hao and singh 2020 for example the increased dependence between summer soil moisture and temperature plays a relatively significant impact on changes in cadhes in ne these results highlight the importance of dry hot dependence in studying the variability of compound droughts and hot events this further heightens the importance of accurately simulating the interaction between soil moisture and temperature or soil moisture temperature feedback in land surface models miralles et al 2019 which can improve our understanding of the variability of cadhes in historical periods and future projections disentangling the impacts of different factors on changes in cadhes contributes to adaptation measures of the agriculture sector under global warming although our study focuses on the historical assessments of cadhes these methods can also be employed to guide the future projection and adaptation of such compound events for example heat resistant cultivars of the crop could be considered in the regions with cadhes increases driven by warming coordinated water resources management i e increased irrigation could be used to mitigate impacts of cadhes in the regions with cadhes increases driven by drying meanwhile in the regions where cadhes increase is also induced by strengthened soil moisture temperature dependence more complex adaptation strategies need to be designed 5 2 limitations several limitations exist in this study that may induce uncertainties to obtain large samples of compound events gldas 2 0 with a relatively long term record is employed in this study however errors in the simulated soil moisture from land surface modeling can affect the soil moisture temperature dependences and associated co variabilities specifically the land surface model simulation used in this study is unable to reflect the land use change e g urbanization as a result of the static vegetation and soil parameters meanwhile the human water use e g irrigation and exploitation of groundwater is not considered in the model simulations leading to biases in regions with intense human interference to improve this representation of land surface conditions at regional or local scales soil moisture from gauge measurements e g china meteorological administration cma and satellite remote sensing e g european space agency climate change initiative esa cci can be used as candidates for future studies liu et al 2019 chen and yuan 2020 we select the same depths of soil moisture and same season in this study without consideration of the root zone depth and growing periods for different crops the consideration of crop specific conditions is beneficial for reflecting the influence of cadhes which is worth being explored further in addition we define cadhes on the seasonal scale while events on sub seasonal scales e g daily and weekly may have different change patterns and drivers brunner et al 2021 li et al 2021 mukherjee and mishra 2021 the statistical attribution method used in this study can reflect the relative role of different driving factors to cadhes however the physical processes of these factors in affecting the variability of cadhes are not clear as such dynamical models can be used for further attribution analysis to disentangle the relative roles of different factors wehrli et al 2019 for example separating the influence of dependence by decoupling the soil moisture and temperature in the land surface model can quantify the contributions of dependence on cadhes furthermore the underlying physical drivers for changes in individual events and dependence e g global warming and large scale atmospheric circulations need to be understood hao and singh 2020 sarhadi et al 2018 vogel et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b overall it is worth exploring other datasets specific crops attribution methods and models to improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms of cadhes and the cause of their changes 6 conclusion in this study we investigated changes in compound agricultural droughts and hot events cadhes and contributing factors for the period 1949 2014 in eastern china results showed that cadhes occurred more frequently in cc and sc relative to other regions cadhes exhibited significant increases in ne 125 nc 160 and sc 83 whereas decreases in cc 39 for the period 1982 2014 relative to 1949 1981 the changes can be attributed to changes in soil moisture temperature and their dependence increased hot events and agricultural droughts were observed in nc and sc meanwhile the dependence between ssi and sti has strengthened in ne and sc we employed a statistical method to quantify the relative contributions of these factors results indicated that the increased temperature dominated the increased cadhes in most regions of eastern china except for cc and the strengthening dependence also had a significant influence in ne the wetting trend had a major weakening effect on the changes in cadhes in cc the results highlighted the importance of modeling the soil moisture temperature dependence in understanding the variability of cadhes overall our study showed an overall enhanced risk of cadhes towards agricultural production or crop yields seasonal prediction and future projection of these compound events are useful measures to mitigate their potentially negative impacts in eastern china

quality of water used for irrigation when combined with drip irrigation and mulching this strategy can be valuable for agricultural production in arid and semi arid areas to evaluate the effects of magnetically treated brackish water on soil water salt distribution and cotton growth in xinjiang field experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 with magnetically treated brackish water of five magnetization intensities 0 gs ck 1000 gs g1 2000 gs g2 4000 gs g4 and 5000 gs g5 the results showed that magnetically treated brackish water 2 7 g l 1 ec 0 6 ds m 1 could enhance soil water retention promote root water absorption and improve water productivity wp magnetically treated brackish water with 4000 gs intensity showed the greatest improvement in water retention in the 0 100 cm soil layer the average salt content in the soil irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water of different intensities was in the order g4 g2 g5 g1 ck indicating that magnetically treated brackish water can effectively reduce the salt content and promote salt leaching the desalinization rate cotton yield and wp were highest when the magnetization intensity was 4000 gs followed by 2000 gs which helped to alleviate the shortage of freshwater resources and reduce the risk of soil salinization this study could provide a method for using brackish water safely and serve as a theoretical guide for water saving and cotton yield increase in xinjiang china keywords salt accumulation water consumption cotton growth index water productivity 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of water in china accounting for more than 60 of the total human water consumption zhou et al 2021 reducing agricultural water consumption is an effective way to alleviate the shortage of water resources however there is an unprecedented demand for agricultural food production especially in developing countries cao et al 2018 jones and ejeta 2016 this poses a serious challenge to produce more food to feed a growing population pressure continues to grow on the finite resources of fresh water and land moreover improper cultivation and irrigation may aggravate soil salinization and secondary salinization thereby degrading the quality of farmland xinjiang located in northwest china is one of the main production areas for grain cotton and fruit wang et al 2018 due to high evaporation and low precipitation severe shortages of water resources restrict local agricultural development as soil salinization is widespread in this area plant growth and yield are seriously impeded due to the poor physical and chemical properties of the soil liu et al 2012 since the 1990 s various agricultural technologies have been applied to solve these problems and drip irrigation under mulch has been widely used wang et al 2000 2002 based on field experiments wang et al 2014 and xu et al 2003 reported that drip irrigation under mulch reduces salt leaching and prevents secondary salinization in soil extensive research has been carried out on soil water salt transport water and fertilizer regulation and crop growth with drip irrigation under mulch chen et al 2015 ning et al 2015 wang et al 2018 2013 2011 zhang et al 2014 zheng et al 2009 as well as irrigation water quality irrigation scheduling and drip tape arrangement guan et al 2013 liu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 the main effects and mechanisms of drip irrigation under mulch on soil salinity leaching and crop yields have been thoroughly investigated in previous studies which provide a reference for the application of drip irrigation under mulch technology in arid areas the use of brackish water which became popular in the early 1970 s is another solution for alleviating water resource shortages patel et al 1999 wang et al 2007 with the use of brackish water for irrigation mineral elements infiltrate the soil and cause a series of physical and chemical reactions which can alter the basic characteristics of the soil wang and shan 2015 during the early stage brackish water flushes the salt in the root zone thus removing salt without causing a significant yield loss however with an increase in brackish water application the soil becomes prone to secondary salinization chen et al 2010 wang et al 2015 therefore a series of studies have been conducted on the relationship between brackish water irrigation and irrigation systems dripper discharge salt migration crop growth and root distribution under mulch in xinjiang chen et al 2010 2018 ma et al 2005 liu et al 2012 showed that the drip irrigation water quality and layout of the drip irrigation tube influence soil salt and water distribution they also demonstrated that brackish water with salt content less than 4 0 g l 1 electrical conductivity ec 0 9 ds m 1 is suitable for crop growth at the initial stage but continuous use of brackish water can cause salt accumulation in the field to reduce salt stress research on magnetically treated irrigation water began in the 1960 s which showed that magnetically treated brackish water may improve water quality in agricultural irrigation da silva and dobránszki 2014 da silva and dobranszki 2016 selim and el nady 2011 magnetically treated water can reduce the surface tension coefficient and viscosity coefficient which helps improve the physical and chemical properties of water such as wettability conductivity ph osmotic pressure and dissolved oxygen content amiri and dadkhah 2006 ding et al 2011 esmaeilnezhad et al 2017 toledo et al 2008 various studies have reported beneficial effects on crop growth and yield when irrigated with magnetically treated water liu et al 2020 maheshwari and grewal 2009 surendran et al 2016 yet it is still unknown whether it is suitable for xinjiang to irrigate farmland with magnetically treated brackish water thus the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of magnetically treated brackish water under mulch drip irrigation on soil water and salt distribution 2 analyze the relationship between different intensities of magnetically treated brackish water and cotton growth indicators and 3 determine the optimal magnetization intensity in magnetically treated brackish water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experimental site was located at the bazhou irrigation experimental station

brackish irrigation water was pumped from an underground well and the average salinity of irrigation water was 2 7 g l 1 ec 0 6 ds m 1 the magnetically treated brackish water was generated via the transition of brackish water using a robust permanent magnet with different magnetic field intensities baotou xinda magnetic material factory china connected to a feed pipeline fig 1 the south and north poles were located at the top and bottom of the pipe respectively the procedure and path of the formed magnet fled are shown on the right side of fig 1 the magnetizers were installed on the outer wall of the effluent pipeline and the magnetic field intensity was calibrated using a gaussmeter tm801 kanetec japan the brackish irrigation water was then passed through a magnetization processor at a flow rate of 1 5 l s 1 providing water exposure of approximately 3 s to a magnetic field cotton gossypium hirsutum l variety no 55 xinzhong road was sown on april 26 2017 and may 3 2018

application design following local irrigation practices the field was flood irrigated in mid april each year two weeks before sowing to provide sufficient water for salt leaching from soil and cotton emergence the total amount of flood irrigation was approximately 300 mm each year irrigation was mainly concentrated in the bud flowering and early boll stages the experiment ended in late august

listed in table 2 tan et al 2018 the fertilizer comprising nitrogen fertilizer 300 kg ha 1 urea with 46 4 n phosphorus fertilizer 100 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate with 20 0 p and 18 0 n and potassium fertilizer 100 kg ha 1 potassium sulfate with 36 6 k was applied before sowing as shown in table 2 2 4 sampling 2 4 1 soil moisture content and salinity soil samples were collected using a 5 cm diameter auger to determine the soil water content and salinity at 10 cm intervals from 0 to 40 cm depth and at 20 cm intervals from 40 to 100 cm soil samples with three replicates were taken in the im nr and wr adjacent to the vertical drip irrigation belt direction at the pre sowing stage and the main stages of cotton growth seedling bud flower full boll and boll opening stages all auger holes were reﬁlled with the soil to minimize experimental errors after sampling the soil samples were weighed dried in a fan assisted oven at 105 2 c for 8 h and reweighed to determine the gravimetric soil

deactivation at 105 c for 30 min and dried to constant weight at 80 c the roots stems leaves buds and bells were weighed separately during the harvest period three strips of cotton with uniform growth and a 6 67 m2 area were selected from the plots and then the yield of seed cotton in this area was measured ten cotton plants were randomly selected from each plot to determine the available cotton boll number and cotton boll weight 2 5 statistical analysis 2 5 1 water consumption calculations using the soil water volume balance equation the water consumption during each growth period of cotton under each magnetic treatment for each soil layer was calculated via the following equation pereira et al 2021 1 e t c a ct p i g δ w f r 0 where et c act is actual crop evapotranspiration water consumption mm p is the precipitation during the growing period mm i is the amount of irrigation water mm g is the amount of groundwater recharge during the crop growth period mm δw is the change in soil water storage in the 0 100 cm soil layer from sowing to maturity mm f is the amount of deep percolation mm and r 0 is the surface runoff mm 2 5 2 salt accumulation calculation to study the effect of magnetically treated brackish water on soil salt accumulation during cotton growth the amount of soil salt accumulation from the later seedling stage to harvest during both seasons was obtained according to the salt balance formula wei et al 2022 which is as follows 2 δ s s 2 s 1 s i s p s g s f s d s c where δs is the change in soil salt content before and after irrigation during the growth period g s 1 is the soil salt storage at the beginning of period g s 2 is the soil salt storage at end of the period s i is the increase in irrigation salt g s f is the increase in fertilization salt g s r is the increase of rainfall salt g s g is the increase of groundwater supply salt g s c is the salt absorption consumption of crops g s p is the salt precipitation and s d is the salt loss of drainage leakage g to analyze the desalination effect of different treatments for the whole growth period the desalination rate was calculated using the method of zhou et al 2021 as follows 3 p s 1 s 2 s 1 100 where p is the desalination rate p 0 indicates soil desalination p 0 indicates soil salt accumulation and p 0 indicates that the salt was balanced 2 5 3 water productivity wp calculation wp

harvest kg ha 1 and et c act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm microsoft excel 2016 and spss 20 spss inc chicago il usa was used for data analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of magnetically treated brackish water on soil water and salt distribution 3 1 1 soil volumetric water content the water content first decreased then increased and then decreased again fig 3 to promote salt leaching flood irrigation was conducted before sowing which increased soil moisture content however cotton plants were small at the seedling stage and high rates of evaporation reduced the soil water content as a result soil water content decreased in 2018 the volumetric water content in the 0 60 cm soil profile in each treatment decreased by 45 8 41 8 30 7 29 4 and 33 0 compared with that in the pre sowing stage fig 3a with the increase in vegetation growth and irrigation frequency the soil water content increased continuously after the seedling stage and reached the maximum value at the flowering and full boll stages however in the boll opening stage the water demand decreased the irrigation amount was reduced to 30 mm and the soil water content decreased upon further analysis and comparisons we found that with an increase in magnetization intensity the average soil volume water content during the entire growth period was significantly higher than that in ck based on a laboratory experiment otsuka and ozeki 2006 found that magnetically treated water could promote soil water infiltration into a solid surface by changing various properties and functions of water significantly cai et al 2009 reported that the physicochemical properties of brackish water changed after magnetization at a constant flow rate in a magnetic field resulting in a decrease in surface tension and an increase in viscosity moreover they also found that new hydrogen bonds were formed during the magnetic treatment processes which led to a higher latent heat of vaporization furthermore guo et al 2011 found that with the application of magnetic fields in pure water and aqueous nacl solutions at low concentrations the mobility of ions and the hydrogen bonding was enhanced with a decrease in surface tension and an increase in viscosity the magnetically treated brackish water could permeate into the soil profile more slowly thereby reducing deep seepage the evaporation process was also impeded and thus more water was retained in the soil profile under different magnetization intensity treatments the average volumetric water contents of cotton in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the whole 2018 growth period were 0 10 11 06 14 43 16 38 and 12 99 cm3 cm 3 in ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively fig 3b in 2017 the average volumetric water contents of cotton in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the whole growth period were 10 47 11 25 15 02 16 98 and 13 22 cm3 cm 3 in ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively fig 3c the average soil volumetric water content in 2017 was similar to that in 2018 showing the same trend of g4 g2 g5 g1 ck in the g4 treatment the highest soil water content was obtained this could be attributed to the effect of greater magnetization intensity on the structure and physical characteristics of brackish water with an increase in magnetic density dissolved calcium and carbonate ions in brackish water tend to collide as they change directions when these collisions occur the ions stick together to form a solid form of calcium carbonate called aragonite which further inhibits infiltration amiri and dadkhah 2006 toledo et al 2008 zhou et al 2021 3 1 2 cotton water consumption the water consumption of the ck treatment during the entire growth period was less than that when irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water table 3 due to little precipitation high evaporation and a 5 m groundwater level the initial soil water content in the field was quite low before sowing therefore most of the water consumed by cotton was the irrigation water and the remaining water consumption came from the soil profile with an increase in the magnetization intensity the total water consumption by cotton first increased and then decreased water consumption was highest during the boll stage water consumption in the seedling and boll opening stages was significantly lower than that in the boll stage in 2018 the total water consumption of ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 was 550 554 571 580 and 563 mm which increased by 1 0 1 7 4 8 6 6 and 3 3 respectively compared with the total irrigation water amount in 2017 the total water consumption of ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 was 502 519 521 531 and 519 mm which increased by 0 5 3 7 4 2 6 2 and 3 8 respectively compared to the total irrigation water amount water uptake by cotton was significantly higher when water was magnetically treated than with no treated in ck which was the highest in the g4 treatment after being magnetically treated with different intensities the surface tension of brackish water decreased but the soil matrix potential increased accordingly the water suction decreased and capillary action increased which promoted water absorption by the root system ding et al 2011 surendran et al 2016 3 1 3 soil salt content the average soil salt contents in the im nr and wr were analyzed to determine the effects of magnetically treated brackish water with different magnetization intensities on soil salt content in all growth periods fig 4 the salt content in im irrigated with water treated with different magnetization intensities was lower at 0 10 cm increased between 10 and 40 cm and decreased between 40 and 100 cm fig 4a and b the salt content was the highest at 40 cm and the salt contents in the g2 and g4 treatments were lower than those in the other treatments for nr and wr the salt content in the soil profile was lowest in the g4 treatment of which the salt content in the soil surface was the highest and then decreased with increasing depth below 40 cm fig 4c and f the salt content of soil profile in ck treatment was the highest compared with that in the other treatments at the same depth of the profile soil salt content varied greatly in nr wr and im which showed an obvious trend as nr wr im and the salt content in all treatments decreased in the order of g4 g2 g5 g1 ck the results above indicate that soil salt content tended to accumulate in im and salt desalination could be improved with g4 treatment in nr compared with that in the ck the soil salt content in all treatments irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water decreased similar results were reported by zlotopolski 2017 and hachicha et al 2018 after magnetically treated brackish water the microscopic molecular structure of brackish irrigation water was changed which increased the water viscosity and cation crystallization as a result the water flow slowed down and extended the cation absorption time for plants which enhanced salt leaching and alleviated salt stress during cotton growth the decrease in soil salt content was attributed to the improved cation absorption capacity of plants irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water hachicha et al 2018 mostafazadeh fard et al 2012 also reported that magnetized irrigation water under trickle irrigation has a good potential to reduce soil cations due to greater salt leaching the absorption and leaching processes mentioned above will all result in lower salt concentrations in the soil profile and better soil conditions for plant growth 3 1 4 soil salt distribution and accumulation as cotton grew the average salt content first increased and then decreased fig 5 with an increase in magnetization intensity the salt content in the 0 60 cm root layer first decreased and then increased which showed the following trend g4 g2 g5 g1 ck in the g4 treatment the greatest amount of desalination was obtained to evaluate the effect of magnetically treated brackish water with different magnetization intensities on salt leaching the salt content in the root layer of 0 60 cm was all calculated and is shown in table 4 salt accumulation was lowest in the g4 treatment while the highest value was found in the ck treatment magnetically treated brackish water alters the physical and chemical properties of water such as the surface tension contact angle and viscosity coefficient thus brackish water molecules can enter smaller soil pores and easily remove salt from these pores as a result the salinity leaching efficiency is significantly improved zhou et al 2021 however if the magnetization intensity is too high the ions in the water and soluble salt ions in the soil gather to form large grain precipitates which reduces the solubility of salt in soil and reduces the degree of water association and viscosity which impedes salt leaching pietruszewski and kania 2010 the magnetically treated brackish water in the second year had a more obvious impact on soil desalination 3 2 effect of magnetically treated brackish water on growth characteristics of cotton 3 2 1 plant height plant height ph is one of the most important cotton growth indices in this study the ph values of five cotton plants were measured throughout the growth period the ph values in treatments irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water with different intensities first increased and then stabilized fig 6a and b during the middle growth stage 45 90 d after sowing ph values have a linear relationship with the time during which high water is required during the peak flowering stage the topping was carried out to prevent excessive growth of cotton vegetative organs leading to a reduction in yield according to local practices the upper 1 cm was topped at this stage the growth rate tended to be stable fig 6a and b also shows that the maximum ph value of cotton differed significantly under different magnetic treatments the maximum ph value of cotton decreased in the following order ck g1 g5 g2 g4 which indicates that irrigating with magnetically treated brackish water may increase cotton height and an appropriate magnetization treatment could be used to regulate the vegetative growth of cotton 3 2 2 stem diameter stem diameter sd is another important index that reflects cotton growth a larger sd value can support greater absorption and transport of nutrients and water the sd value of cotton was measured approximately 40 days after sowing fig 6c and d under different treatments the cotton sd value first increased 40 100 d after sowing then stabilized after 100 d during the 40 100 d period sd values grew at rates of 0 073 0 106 0 110 0 114 and 0 087 mm d 1 for ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively fig 6c at the end of the growth period the sd values were 9 1 10 2 10 9 11 7 and 10 5 mm for ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively in 2017 and 2018 sd values increased in the following order ck g1 g5 g2 g4 sd values were larger in the magnetic treatment than in the ck treatment and were the largest in the g4 treatments the size of the cotton sd mainly depends on the nutrient accumulation and water uptake of cotton magnetically treated brackish water improved the soil water holding capacity and reduced salt stress at the root depth thus promoting root absorption of water and nutrients as well as stem growth sayed 2014 3 2 3 leaf area index and chlorophyll leaves are one of the most important organs for photosynthesis and the number of leaves and leaf area index influence the transformation efficiency of light energy this affects the synthesis of organic matter in cotton which is also an important index for cotton growth as cotton grew the number of leaves increased reaching a maximum value at the flowering and initial boll opening stages and then decreasing at the full boll opening stage tan et al 2018 to evaluate the effect of magnetically treated brackish water on cotton leaves the maximum number of leaves and the daily growth of leaves under different intensities of magnetically treated brackish water are shown in table 5 there were significant differences in the number of cotton leaves between the treatments table 5 in 2018 the maximum number of cotton leaves under magnetically treated brackish water treatments increased by 13 6 54 5 68 2 and 40 9 in the g1 g2 g4 and g5 treatments respectively compared with that in ck in 2017 the maximum number of cotton leaves increased by 13 2 23 7 50 01 and 15 8 in g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively compared with that in ck the total number of cotton leaves was ck g1 g5 g2 g4 and the maximum number of cotton leaves was obtained in the g4 treatment 37 in 2018 and 28 5 in 2017 the leaf area index lai is an essential parameter for monitoring crop growth dynamics and has a positive correlation with cotton yield and biomass lai increased slowly in the seedling and bud stages fig 6e and f at the flowering and boll opening stages lai increased rapidly and was greatly affected by magnetically treated brackish water during the boll opening stage cotton is mainly in the reproductive stage when many leaves fall off thus the number of leaves and lai gradually decreased in cotton irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water lai was 31 1 116 4 higher than that in ck in 2017 and 23 0 higher than that in ck in 2018 fig 6f the maximum value of lai increased in the following order ck g1 g5 g2 g4 these results further support that magnetically treated brackish water can increase lai which is similar to the results of sadeghipour and aghaei 2013 chlorophyll content in leaves is another direct index that reflects the photosynthetic rate crop growth and yield which could be reflected by the spad value measured with the spad chlorophyll meter from the flowering stage to the boll opening stage of cotton the spad value of leaves tended to decrease with growth the spad value was highest at the flowering stage and the spad value of ck treatment was 37 2 2017 and 38 1 2018 respectively fig 7 from the flowering stage to the boll opening stage the estimated cumulative leaf chlorophyll content varied under different treatments containing magnetically treated brackish water in 2018 the spad value under magnetically treated brackish water treatments increased by 11 9 16 6 24 9 and 15 2 in the g1 g2 g4 and g5 treatments respectively compared with that in ck in 2017 the spad value increased by 12 9 14 9 24 4 and 13 9 in g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively compared with that in ck the spad value of each treatment increased in the following order ck g1 g5 g2 g4 it is possible that magnetically treated brackish water with high intensity promotes the activity of chlorophyllase but inhibits the synthesis of chlorophyll 3 3 effect of magnetically treated brackish water on cotton biomass and yield 3 3 1 dry matter accumulation dry matter accumulation in reproductive and vegetative organs increased at higher rates when irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water than when irrigated with regular water fig 8 however with the increase in magnetization intensities in brackish water the accumulation of dry matter in each growth period first increased and then decreased in 2018 compared with that in ck the total maximum dry matter of each treatment increased by 22 2 47 6 64 8 and 31 6 whereas the dry matter of reproductive organs increased by 27 2 51 04 73 4 and 32 6 and the dry matter of the vegetative organs increased by 17 0 44 1 55 9 and 30 5 for g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively fig 8a in 2017 a similar trend was observed fig 8b the total dry matter of cotton dry matter of reproductive organs and vegetative organs under each magnetization intensity treatment followed the same order with ck g1 g5 g2 g4 the above results showed that magnetically treated brackish water can improve cotton yield and the g4 treatment had the greatest effect 3 3 2 cotton yield and water productivity the main components of cotton yield include the available cotton boll number per plant and weight per cotton boll magnetically treated brackish water had significant positive effects on the boll number per plant and weight per cotton boll as well as cotton yield table 6 cotton yields were highest in the g4 treatment reaching 6000 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 5867 kg ha 1 in 2017 significant decreases in yield were observed when the magnetization intensity increased to 5000 gs therefore irrigation water treated with an appropriate magnetization intensity can promote the growth of cotton and increase the yield the brackish water treated with 4000 gs magnetization intensity resulted in the largest cotton yield similar results were also obtained in the research of wheat flax lentil chickpea and sugar beet of which magnetically treated water can increase the yield significantly hozayn and abd el qdos 2010 hozayn et al 2013 2016 hozayn and qados 2010 water productivity wp is an important parameter for the utilization of water by cotton and cotton yield during the growth period the analysis found that cotton yield increased with an increase in wp fig 9 further analysis showed that with an increase in magnetization intensity wp increased in the order ck g1 g5 g2 g4 for example in 2018 the wp of g1 g2 g4 and g5 increased by 10 5 21 0 22 7 and 20 5 respectively compared with that of ck magnetically treated brackish water alleviated the adverse effects of cotton irrigation with brackish water selim and el nady 2011 pointed out that this enhancement of cotton growth and yield by irrigating magnetically treated brackish water could be attributed to changes in the physicochemical properties of soil transport of soil and salt enzyme activity growth regulators and ions and water uptake 4 conclusions the effects of magnetically treated brackish water of different magnetic intensities with drip irrigation under film on cotton growth and soil water salt distribution were studied using field experiments in the southern part of xinjiang the main conclusions were as follows 1 magnetically treated brackish water can promote soil water retention capacity and reduce the soil salt content when the intensity of magnetically treated brackish water was 4000 gs soil salt accumulation was maximum and the salt accumulation rate was lowest which was 14 6 2018 and 23 1 2017 2 irrigation with magnetically treated brackish water can also promote the growth of cotton and the growth indices plant height stem diameter leaf area index and chlorophyll content were better than in ck treatment 3 the same trend was found with cotton yield and water productivity cotton yield increased by 31 3 2017 under irrigation with magnetically treated brackish water when magnetization intensity was 4000 gs magnetization treatment of irrigation water can alleviate the salt stress on crops in arid areas the optimal magnetic intensity presented in this study can be used to further explore the potentials of this technique for the enabling the use of

quality of water used for irrigation when combined with drip irrigation and mulching this strategy can be valuable for agricultural production in arid and semi arid areas to evaluate the effects of magnetically treated brackish water on soil water salt distribution and cotton growth in xinjiang field experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 with magnetically treated brackish water of five magnetization intensities 0 gs ck 1000 gs g1 2000 gs g2 4000 gs g4 and 5000 gs g5 the results showed that magnetically treated brackish water 2 7 g l 1 ec 0 6 ds m 1 could enhance soil water retention promote root water absorption and improve water productivity wp magnetically treated brackish water with 4000 gs intensity showed the greatest improvement in water retention in the 0 100 cm soil layer the average salt content in the soil irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water of different intensities was in the order g4 g2 g5 g1 ck indicating that magnetically treated brackish water can effectively reduce the salt content and promote salt leaching the desalinization rate cotton yield and wp were highest when the magnetization intensity was 4000 gs followed by 2000 gs which helped to alleviate the shortage of freshwater resources and reduce the risk of soil salinization this study could provide a method for using brackish water safely and serve as a theoretical guide for water saving and cotton yield increase in xinjiang china keywords salt accumulation water consumption cotton growth index water productivity 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of water in china accounting for more than 60 of the total human water consumption zhou et al 2021 reducing agricultural water consumption is an effective way to alleviate the shortage of water resources however there is an unprecedented demand for agricultural food production especially in developing countries cao et al 2018 jones and ejeta 2016 this poses a serious challenge to produce more food to feed a growing population pressure continues to grow on the finite resources of fresh water and land moreover improper cultivation and irrigation may aggravate soil salinization and secondary salinization thereby degrading the quality of farmland xinjiang located in northwest china is one of the main production areas for grain cotton and fruit wang et al 2018 due to high evaporation and low precipitation severe shortages of water resources restrict local agricultural development as soil salinization is widespread in this area plant growth and yield are seriously impeded due to the poor physical and chemical properties of the soil liu et al 2012 since the 1990 s various agricultural technologies have been applied to solve these problems and drip irrigation under mulch has been widely used wang et al 2000 2002 based on field experiments wang et al 2014 and xu et al 2003 reported that drip irrigation under mulch reduces salt leaching and prevents secondary salinization in soil extensive research has been carried out on soil water salt transport water and fertilizer regulation and crop growth with drip irrigation under mulch chen et al 2015 ning et al 2015 wang et al 2018 2013 2011 zhang et al 2014 zheng et al 2009 as well as irrigation water quality irrigation scheduling and drip tape arrangement guan et al 2013 liu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 the main effects and mechanisms of drip irrigation under mulch on soil salinity leaching and crop yields have been thoroughly investigated in previous studies which provide a reference for the application of drip irrigation under mulch technology in arid areas the use of brackish water which became popular in the early 1970 s is another solution for alleviating water resource shortages patel et al 1999 wang et al 2007 with the use of brackish water for irrigation mineral elements infiltrate the soil and cause a series of physical and chemical reactions which can alter the basic characteristics of the soil wang and shan 2015 during the early stage brackish water flushes the salt in the root zone thus removing salt without causing a significant yield loss however with an increase in brackish water application the soil becomes prone to secondary salinization chen et al 2010 wang et al 2015 therefore a series of studies have been conducted on the relationship between brackish water irrigation and irrigation systems dripper discharge salt migration crop growth and root distribution under mulch in xinjiang chen et al 2010 2018 ma et al 2005 liu et al 2012 showed that the drip irrigation water quality and layout of the drip irrigation tube influence soil salt and water distribution they also demonstrated that brackish water with salt content less than 4 0 g l 1 electrical conductivity ec 0 9 ds m 1 is suitable for crop growth at the initial stage but continuous use of brackish water can cause salt accumulation in the field to reduce salt stress research on magnetically treated irrigation water began in the 1960 s which showed that magnetically treated brackish water may improve water quality in agricultural irrigation da silva and dobránszki 2014 da silva and dobranszki 2016 selim and el nady 2011 magnetically treated water can reduce the surface tension coefficient and viscosity coefficient which helps improve the physical and chemical properties of water such as wettability conductivity ph osmotic pressure and dissolved oxygen content amiri and dadkhah 2006 ding et al 2011 esmaeilnezhad et al 2017 toledo et al 2008 various studies have reported beneficial effects on crop growth and yield when irrigated with magnetically treated water liu et al 2020 maheshwari and grewal 2009 surendran et al 2016 yet it is still unknown whether it is suitable for xinjiang to irrigate farmland with magnetically treated brackish water thus the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of magnetically treated brackish water under mulch drip irrigation on soil water and salt distribution 2 analyze the relationship between different intensities of magnetically treated brackish water and cotton growth indicators and 3 determine the optimal magnetization intensity in magnetically treated brackish water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experimental site was located at the bazhou irrigation experimental station

brackish water 0 gs ck 1000 gs g1 2000 gs g2 4000 gs g4 and 5000 gs g5 were applied in randomized plots with three replicates the total number of plots was set at 15 each plot was 7 m 5 m and adjacent plots were separated by a partition buried depth of 1 7 m to eliminate the effects of lateral movement of soil water the experimental area was irrigated by drip irrigation using a plastic film the brackish irrigation water was pumped from an underground well and the average salinity of irrigation water was 2 7 g l 1 ec 0 6 ds m 1 the magnetically treated brackish water was generated via the

diameter auger to determine the soil water content and salinity at 10 cm intervals from 0 to 40 cm depth and at 20 cm intervals from 40 to 100 cm soil samples with three replicates were taken in the im nr and wr adjacent to the vertical drip irrigation belt direction at the pre sowing stage and the main stages of cotton growth seedling bud flower full boll and boll opening stages all auger holes were reﬁlled with the soil to minimize experimental errors after sampling the soil samples were weighed dried in a fan assisted oven at 105 2 c for 8 h and reweighed to determine the gravimetric soil

deactivation at 105 c for 30 min and dried to constant weight at 80 c the roots stems leaves buds and bells were weighed separately during the harvest period three strips of cotton with uniform growth and a 6 67 m2 area were selected from the plots and then the yield of seed cotton in this area was measured ten cotton plants were randomly selected from each plot to determine the available cotton boll number and cotton boll weight 2 5 statistical analysis 2 5 1 water consumption calculations using the soil water volume balance equation the water consumption during each growth period of cotton under each magnetic treatment for each soil layer was calculated via the following equation pereira et al 2021 1 e t c a ct p i g δ w f r 0 where et c act is actual crop evapotranspiration water consumption mm p is the precipitation during the growing period mm i is the amount of irrigation water mm g is the amount of groundwater recharge during the crop growth period mm δw is the change in soil water storage in the 0 100 cm soil layer from sowing to maturity mm f is the amount of deep percolation mm and r 0 is the surface runoff mm 2 5 2 salt accumulation calculation to study the effect of magnetically treated brackish water on soil salt accumulation during cotton growth the amount of soil salt accumulation from the later seedling stage to harvest during both seasons was obtained according to the salt balance formula wei et al 2022 which is as follows 2 δ s s 2 s 1 s i s p s g s f s d s c where δs is the change in soil salt content before and after irrigation during the growth period g s 1 is the soil salt storage at the beginning of period g s 2 is the soil salt storage at end of the period s i is the increase in irrigation salt g s f is the increase in fertilization salt g s r is the increase of rainfall salt g s g is the increase of groundwater supply salt g s c is the salt absorption consumption of crops g s p is the salt precipitation and s d is the salt loss of drainage leakage g to analyze the desalination effect of different treatments for the whole growth period the desalination rate was calculated using the method of zhou et al 2021 as follows 3 p s 1 s 2 s 1 100 where p is the desalination rate p 0 indicates soil desalination p 0 indicates soil salt accumulation and p 0 indicates that the salt was balanced 2 5 3 water productivity wp calculation wp

harvest kg ha 1 and et c act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm microsoft excel 2016 and spss 20 spss inc chicago il usa was used for data analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of magnetically treated brackish water on soil water and salt distribution 3 1 1 soil volumetric water content the water content first decreased then increased and then decreased again fig 3 to promote salt leaching flood irrigation was conducted before sowing which increased soil moisture content however cotton plants were small at the seedling stage and high rates of evaporation reduced the soil water content as a result soil water content decreased in 2018 the volumetric water content in the 0 60 cm soil profile in each treatment decreased by 45 8 41 8 30 7 29 4 and 33 0 compared with that in the pre sowing stage fig 3a with the increase in vegetation growth and irrigation frequency the soil water content increased continuously after the seedling stage and reached the maximum value at the flowering and full boll stages however in the boll opening stage the water demand decreased the irrigation amount was reduced to 30 mm and the soil water content decreased upon further analysis and comparisons we found that with an increase in magnetization intensity the average soil volume water content during the entire growth period was significantly higher than that in ck based on a laboratory experiment otsuka and ozeki 2006 found that magnetically treated water could promote soil water infiltration into a solid surface by changing various properties and functions of water significantly cai et al 2009 reported that the physicochemical properties of brackish water changed after magnetization at a constant flow rate in a magnetic field resulting in a decrease in surface tension and an increase in viscosity moreover they also found that new hydrogen bonds were formed during the magnetic treatment processes which led to a higher latent heat of vaporization furthermore guo et al 2011 found that with the application of magnetic fields in pure water and aqueous nacl solutions at low concentrations the mobility of ions and the hydrogen bonding was enhanced with a decrease in surface tension and an increase in viscosity the magnetically treated brackish water could permeate into the soil profile more slowly thereby reducing deep seepage the evaporation process was also impeded and thus more water was retained in the soil profile under different magnetization intensity treatments the average volumetric water contents of cotton in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the whole 2018 growth period were 0 10 11 06 14 43 16 38 and 12 99 cm3 cm 3 in ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively fig 3b in 2017 the average volumetric water contents of cotton in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the whole growth period were 10 47 11 25 15 02 16 98 and 13 22 cm3 cm 3 in ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively fig 3c the average soil volumetric water content in 2017 was similar to that in 2018 showing the same trend of g4 g2 g5 g1 ck in the g4 treatment the highest soil water content was obtained this could be attributed to the effect of greater magnetization intensity on the structure and physical characteristics of brackish water with an increase in magnetic density dissolved calcium and carbonate ions in brackish water tend to collide as they change directions when these collisions occur the ions stick together to form a solid form of calcium carbonate called aragonite which further inhibits infiltration amiri and dadkhah 2006 toledo et al 2008 zhou et al 2021 3 1 2 cotton water consumption the water consumption of the ck treatment during the entire growth period was less than that when irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water table 3 due to little precipitation high evaporation and a 5 m groundwater level the initial soil water content in the field was quite low before sowing therefore most of the water consumed by cotton was the irrigation water and the remaining water consumption came from the soil profile with an increase in the magnetization intensity the total water consumption by cotton first increased and then decreased water consumption was highest during the boll stage water consumption in the seedling and boll opening stages was significantly lower than that in the boll stage in 2018 the total water consumption of ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 was 550 554 571 580 and 563 mm which increased by 1 0 1 7 4 8 6 6 and 3 3 respectively compared with the total irrigation water amount in 2017 the total water consumption of ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 was 502 519 521 531 and 519 mm which increased by 0 5 3 7 4 2 6 2 and 3 8 respectively compared to the total irrigation water amount water uptake by cotton was significantly higher when water was magnetically treated than with no treated in ck which was the highest in the g4 treatment after being magnetically treated with different intensities the surface tension of brackish water decreased but the soil matrix potential increased accordingly the water suction decreased and capillary action increased which promoted water absorption by the root system ding et al 2011 surendran et al 2016 3 1 3 soil salt content the average soil salt contents in the im nr and wr were analyzed to determine the effects of magnetically treated brackish water with different magnetization intensities on soil salt content in all growth periods fig 4 the salt content in im irrigated with water treated with different magnetization intensities was lower at 0 10 cm increased between 10 and 40 cm and decreased between 40 and 100 cm fig 4a and b the salt content was the highest at 40 cm and the salt contents in the g2 and g4 treatments were lower than those in the other treatments for nr and wr the salt content in the soil profile was lowest in the g4 treatment of which the salt content in the soil surface was the highest and then decreased with increasing depth below 40 cm fig 4c and f the salt content of soil profile in ck treatment was the highest compared with that in the other treatments at the same depth of the profile soil salt content varied greatly in nr wr and im which showed an obvious trend as nr wr im and the salt content in all treatments decreased in the order of g4 g2 g5 g1 ck the results above indicate that soil salt content tended to accumulate in im and salt desalination could be improved with g4 treatment in nr compared with that in the ck the soil salt content in all treatments irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water decreased similar results were reported by zlotopolski 2017 and hachicha et al 2018 after magnetically treated brackish water the microscopic molecular structure of brackish irrigation water was changed which increased the water viscosity and cation crystallization as a result the water flow slowed down and extended the cation absorption time for plants which enhanced salt leaching and alleviated salt stress during cotton growth the decrease in soil salt content was attributed to the improved cation absorption capacity of plants irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water hachicha et al 2018 mostafazadeh fard et al 2012 also reported that magnetized irrigation water under trickle irrigation has a good potential to reduce soil cations due to greater salt leaching the absorption and leaching processes mentioned above will all result in lower salt concentrations in the soil profile and better soil conditions for plant growth 3 1 4 soil salt distribution and accumulation as cotton grew the average salt content first increased and then decreased fig 5 with an increase in magnetization intensity the salt content in the 0 60 cm root layer first decreased and then increased which showed the following trend g4 g2 g5 g1 ck in the g4 treatment the greatest amount of desalination was obtained to evaluate the effect of magnetically treated brackish water with different magnetization intensities on salt leaching the salt content in the root layer of 0 60 cm was all calculated and is shown in table 4 salt accumulation was lowest in the g4 treatment while the highest value was found in the ck treatment magnetically treated brackish water alters the physical and chemical properties of water such as the surface tension contact angle and viscosity coefficient thus brackish water molecules can enter smaller soil pores and easily remove salt from these pores as a result the salinity leaching efficiency is significantly improved zhou et al 2021 however if the magnetization intensity is too high the ions in the water and soluble salt ions in the soil gather to form large grain precipitates which reduces the solubility of salt in soil and reduces the degree of water association and viscosity which impedes salt leaching pietruszewski and kania 2010 the magnetically treated brackish water in the second year had a more obvious impact on soil desalination 3 2 effect of magnetically treated brackish water on growth characteristics of cotton 3 2 1 plant height plant height ph is one of the most important cotton growth indices in this study the ph values of five cotton plants were measured throughout the growth period the ph values in treatments irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water with different intensities first increased and then stabilized fig 6a and b during the middle growth stage 45 90 d after sowing ph values have a linear relationship with the time during which high water is required during the peak flowering stage the topping was carried out to prevent excessive growth of cotton vegetative organs leading to a reduction in yield according to local practices the upper 1 cm was topped at this stage the growth rate tended to be stable fig 6a and b also shows that the maximum ph value of cotton differed significantly under different magnetic treatments the maximum ph value of cotton decreased in the following order ck g1 g5 g2 g4 which indicates that irrigating with magnetically treated brackish water may increase cotton height and an appropriate magnetization treatment could be used to regulate the vegetative growth of cotton 3 2 2 stem diameter stem diameter sd is another important index that reflects cotton growth a larger sd value can support greater absorption and transport of nutrients and water the sd value of cotton was measured approximately 40 days after sowing fig 6c and d under different treatments the cotton sd value first increased 40 100 d after sowing then stabilized after 100 d during the 40 100 d period sd values grew at rates of 0 073 0 106 0 110 0 114 and 0 087 mm d 1 for ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively fig 6c at the end of the growth period the sd values were 9 1 10 2 10 9 11 7 and 10 5 mm for ck g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively in 2017 and 2018 sd values increased in the following order ck g1 g5 g2 g4 sd values were larger in the magnetic treatment than in the ck treatment and were the largest in the g4 treatments the size of the cotton sd mainly depends on the nutrient accumulation and water uptake of cotton magnetically treated brackish water improved the soil water holding capacity and reduced salt stress at the root depth thus promoting root absorption of water and nutrients as well as stem growth sayed 2014 3 2 3 leaf area index and chlorophyll leaves are one of the most important organs for photosynthesis and the number of leaves and leaf area index influence the transformation efficiency of light energy this affects the synthesis of organic matter in cotton which is also an important index for cotton growth as cotton grew the number of leaves increased reaching a maximum value at the flowering and initial boll opening stages and then decreasing at the full boll opening stage tan et al 2018 to evaluate the effect of magnetically treated brackish water on cotton leaves the maximum number of leaves and the daily growth of leaves under different intensities of magnetically treated brackish water are shown in table 5 there were significant differences in the number of cotton leaves between the treatments table 5 in 2018 the maximum number of cotton leaves under magnetically treated brackish water treatments increased by 13 6 54 5 68 2 and 40 9 in the g1 g2 g4 and g5 treatments respectively compared with that in ck in 2017 the maximum number of cotton leaves increased by 13 2 23 7 50 01 and 15 8 in g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively compared with that in ck the total number of cotton leaves was ck g1 g5 g2 g4 and the maximum number of cotton leaves was obtained in the g4 treatment 37 in 2018 and 28 5 in 2017 the leaf area index lai is an essential parameter for monitoring crop growth dynamics and has a positive correlation with cotton yield and biomass lai increased slowly in the seedling and bud stages fig 6e and f at the flowering and boll opening stages lai increased rapidly and was greatly affected by magnetically treated brackish water during the boll opening stage cotton is mainly in the reproductive stage when many leaves fall off thus the number of leaves and lai gradually decreased in cotton irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water lai was 31 1 116 4 higher than that in ck in 2017 and 23 0 higher than that in ck in 2018 fig 6f the maximum value of lai increased in the following order ck g1 g5 g2 g4 these results further support that magnetically treated brackish water can increase lai which is similar to the results of sadeghipour and aghaei 2013 chlorophyll content in leaves is another direct index that reflects the photosynthetic rate crop growth and yield which could be reflected by the spad value measured with the spad chlorophyll meter from the flowering stage to the boll opening stage of cotton the spad value of leaves tended to decrease with growth the spad value was highest at the flowering stage and the spad value of ck treatment was 37 2 2017 and 38 1 2018 respectively fig 7 from the flowering stage to the boll opening stage the estimated cumulative leaf chlorophyll content varied under different treatments containing magnetically treated brackish water in 2018 the spad value under magnetically treated brackish water treatments increased by 11 9 16 6 24 9 and 15 2 in the g1 g2 g4 and g5 treatments respectively compared with that in ck in 2017 the spad value increased by 12 9 14 9 24 4 and 13 9 in g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively compared with that in ck the spad value of each treatment increased in the following order ck g1 g5 g2 g4 it is possible that magnetically treated brackish water with high intensity promotes the activity of chlorophyllase but inhibits the synthesis of chlorophyll 3 3 effect of magnetically treated brackish water on cotton biomass and yield 3 3 1 dry matter accumulation dry matter accumulation in reproductive and vegetative organs increased at higher rates when irrigated with magnetically treated brackish water than when irrigated with regular water fig 8 however with the increase in magnetization intensities in brackish water the accumulation of dry matter in each growth period first increased and then decreased in 2018 compared with that in ck the total maximum dry matter of each treatment increased by 22 2 47 6 64 8 and 31 6 whereas the dry matter of reproductive organs increased by 27 2 51 04 73 4 and 32 6 and the dry matter of the vegetative organs increased by 17 0 44 1 55 9 and 30 5 for g1 g2 g4 and g5 respectively fig 8a in 2017 a similar trend was observed fig 8b the total dry matter of cotton dry matter of reproductive organs and vegetative organs under each magnetization intensity treatment followed the same order with ck g1 g5 g2 g4 the above results showed that magnetically treated brackish water can improve cotton yield and the g4 treatment had the greatest effect 3 3 2 cotton yield and water productivity the main components of cotton yield include the available cotton boll number per plant and weight per cotton boll magnetically treated brackish water had significant positive effects on the boll number per plant and weight per cotton boll as well as cotton yield table 6 cotton yields were highest in the g4 treatment reaching 6000 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 5867 kg ha 1 in 2017 significant decreases in yield were observed when the magnetization intensity increased to 5000 gs therefore irrigation water treated with an appropriate magnetization intensity can promote the growth of cotton and increase the yield the brackish water treated with 4000 gs magnetization intensity resulted in the largest cotton yield similar results were also obtained in the research of wheat flax lentil chickpea and sugar beet of which magnetically treated water can increase the yield significantly hozayn and abd el qdos 2010 hozayn et al 2013 2016 hozayn and qados 2010 water productivity wp is an important parameter for the utilization of water by cotton and cotton yield during the growth period the analysis found that cotton yield increased with an increase in wp fig 9 further analysis showed that with an increase in magnetization intensity wp increased in the order ck g1 g5 g2 g4 for example in 2018 the wp of g1 g2 g4 and g5 increased by 10 5 21 0 22 7 and 20 5 respectively compared with that of ck magnetically treated brackish water alleviated the adverse effects of cotton irrigation with brackish water selim and el nady 2011 pointed out that this enhancement of cotton growth and yield by irrigating magnetically treated brackish water could be attributed to changes in the physicochemical properties of soil transport of soil and salt enzyme activity growth regulators and ions and water uptake 4 conclusions the effects of magnetically treated brackish water of different magnetic intensities with drip irrigation under film on cotton growth and soil water salt distribution were studied using field experiments in the southern part of xinjiang the main conclusions were as follows 1 magnetically treated brackish water can promote soil water retention capacity and reduce the soil salt content when the intensity of magnetically treated brackish water was 4000 gs soil salt accumulation was maximum and the salt accumulation rate was lowest which was 14 6 2018 and 23 1 2017 2 irrigation with magnetically treated brackish water can also promote the growth of cotton and the growth indices plant height stem diameter leaf area index and chlorophyll content were better than in ck treatment 3 the same trend was found with cotton yield and water productivity cotton yield increased by 31 3 2017 under irrigation with magnetically treated brackish water when magnetization intensity was 4000 gs magnetization treatment of irrigation water can alleviate the salt stress on crops in arid areas the optimal magnetic intensity presented in this study can be used to further explore the potentials of this technique for the enabling the use of

9662,water scarcity and food security are major challenges facing the world in the 21st century the water footprint provides a new and comprehensive approach for understanding the relationship between crop production and water utilization and it has been used to estimate the water consumption of most crops at global and regional scales however the water footprint of soybean production wfp in china has not been extensively studied here this study investigated firstly the components spatial temporal variation as well as the driving factors of the county scale wfp during the period of 1985 2015 in china annual wfp first increased and then decreased from 26 86 g m3 109 m3 in 1985 24 62 g m3 in 2015 the wfp exhibited a clustered spatial distribution across the entire study area and high value areas for wfp were mainly distributed in the northeast north central and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river regions the spatial distribution of wfp at the county level tends to be dispersed in studied period the proportion of green water footprint wfp green reached as high as 70 of the wfp whereas it decreased in the northern areas accompanied by the increased wfp blue proportion soybean yield was the major factor affecting wfp and the increase in soybean yield contributed to the 32 80 decrease in the water footprint per ton soybean over the entire study period further saved the 50 75 g m3 water resource for national soybean production in 2015 the results of this study provide new insights that could be used to improve agricultural water management optimize regional water resource allocation and alleviate water shortages in china keywords factor decomposition mainland china spatial temporal variation spatial autocorrelation analysis water consumption 1 introduction water scarcity and food security have become major challenges in the 21st century because of socio economic development and population growth maja and ayano 2021 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 pastor et al 2019 agricultural production consumes approximately 70 of global available freshwater haddeland et al 2014 and water used in crop production accounts for the largest proportion of this total kang et al 2017 more water resources will be needed to be used in agricultural production to meet future increases in food demand chu et al 2017 and this will pose great challenges for agricultural water resource management studies of water utilization in crop production are critically important for alleviating water shortages hoekstra et al 2011 the water footprint was introduced by hoekstra 2003 to enhance our understanding of the relationship between water utilization and human activity which provides a new and comprehensive approach for estimating direct and indirect water consumption during agricultural production the consumptive water footprint of crop production is defined as the volume of fresh water appropriated during the crop growing period and comprises two components blue and green water hoekstra et al 2011 yang et al 2021a zhuo et al 2016 blue water refers to the consumption of surface and ground water whereas green water refers to the consumption of precipitation insofar as it does not become run off falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 since then the water footprint has been widely examined by researchers several studies have focused on quantifying the water footprint of specific crops and these studies have mainly focused on two aspects the total water footprint in a given geographic area and the water footprint of per unit crop product cao et al 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 estimated the total water footprint of wheat on a global scale in the period 1995 2005 and showed that global wheat production consumed 108 billion m3 of water per year in recent years assessments of the crop water footprint have been conducted at the national cao et al 2014 muratoglu 2020 catchment zhuo et al 2014 plain chu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 and field scales ahmadi et al 2021 the water footprint of various crops including maize ahmadi et al 2021 rice li et al 2020 soybean santos and naval 2020 peanut chu et al 2017 and cotton xu et al 2015 has been quantified some studies have focused on analyzing spatial temporal variation in the crop water footprint and the factors driving this variation cao et al 2020 chu et al 2017 li et al 2020 muratoglu and avanoz 2021 santos and naval 2020 xu et al 2015 2019 yang et al 2021a the logarithmic mean divisia index decomposition approach xu et al 2015 partial least squares regression cao et al 2020 the path analysis method li et al 2020 and virtual scenarios analysis chu et al 2017 have been used to conduct these analyses in previous studies the results of this work indicate that the water footprint of crop

applications the results of these studies also provide new insights that could be used to improve water use efficiency optimize regional water resource allocation and alleviate water shortages china one of the most populous and agricultural countries of the world has experienced severe water scarcity mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 as the per capita water volume only accounts for 28 of the world s average kang et al 2017 thus maximizing the production of food with limited water resources has been a major focus of research quantifying the water footprint of crop production can help characterize patterns of crop water consumption enhance agricultural water management and achieve water and food security most previous studies in china that have focused on evaluating the water footprint have been conducted at the provincial cao et al 2018 2020 2014 huang et al 2019 li et al 2020 xu et al 2015 yang et al 2021a and municipal scale li et al 2021 by contrast few studies have been conducted at the county scale studies at the county scale are needed given that the county is the basic unit at which grain production and water management measures are implemented in china xu et al 2012 2019 water footprint theory has been used to explore spatial temporal changes in the water consumption of several crops in china such as wheat cao et al 2014 huang et al 2019 maize xu et al 2019 and rice li et al 2020 most researchers have described spatial temporal variation in the water footprint by comparing estimated values cao et al 2018 li et al 2020 xu et al 2015 however this approach fails to capture the actual spatial characteristics underlying the data this might be contributed to the absence of the water footprint data at finer spatial scales and systematic methods in addition few water footprint studies in china have been conducted on soybean soybean glycine max l merr is the major raw material crop of plant based protein and vegetable oil and it plays a key role in agricultural production and economic development ainsworth et al 2012 soybean is cultivated widely in china 19 7 53 5 n 77 3 134 3 e song et al 2016 soybean in china can be divided into four categories according to sowing date spring soybean summer soybean autumn soybean and winter soybean and the former two are the main planting types zhao et al 2021b soybean yields vary regionally in china due to variation in climatic conditions crop management and cropping systems and the provincial average yield ranged from 1 03 t ha 1 to 2 98 t ha 1 in 2015 2019 national bureau of statistics 2020 actual production has experienced significant spatial shifts across china in recent decades due to increases in domestic soybean demand and changes in policies and the international market sun et al 2020 yang and zhu 2020 the extensive area of soybean cultivation in china and variation in climate yield and planting scale contribute to the spatial complexity in the water footprint of soybean production wfp in different geographic regions this urges us to choose an appropriate method to carefully assess the spatial temporal characteristics of the wfp in addition quantifying the contributions of various factors to determining the wfp is critically important as such information can provide insights that could be used to optimize the allocation of regional water resources for soybean production study of spatial temporal variation in the soybean water footprint and the factors driving this variation is essential for establishing priority areas for water footprint regulation formulating water management strategies enhancing soybean production and ensuring china s food security although water footprint theory has been applied to many countries and crops information on the soybean water footprint in china is scarce soybean production in china has undergone significant spatial shifts in recent years sun et al 2020 yang and zhu 2020 which has resulted in changes to the water footprint however few studies have examined the spatial and temporal changes in the soybean water footprint and the factors affecting variation in the soybean water footprint in china here the components spatial temporal variation as well as the driving factors of the county scale wfp during the period of 1985 2015 in china were firstly studied to provide information that could be used to promote increases in soybean production while minimizing the consumption of excessive water resources the specific objectives of our study were to 1 quantify the water footprint for soybean production and its components at the county scale 2 characterize spatial temporal variation in and patterns of the soybean water footprint in 1985 2015 and 3 explore the impact of various factors on the soybean water footprint in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in 31 provinces municipal cities and autonomous regions of mainland china due to limitations in available data hong kong macao and taiwan were not considered in our study china was divided into six soybean cultivation areas based on geographical location and agricultural production status northeast region north central region northwest region middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river region southwest region and southeast region fig 1 the administrative divisions climatic conditions and basic information relating to soybean production for the six cultivation areas are shown in table 1 2 2 water footprint calculation the total water footprint is the sum of the blue water footprint and green water footprint which are calculated according to the water footprint network hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 as follows 1 wfp wfp blue wfp g reen where wfp is the total water footprint m3 wfp blue is the blue water footprint m3 and wfp green is the green water footprint m3 the wfp y is calculated by dividing wfp by crop yield 2 wfp y wfp y where wfp y is the water footprint of per unit soybean product m3 t 1 and y is the soybean yield t wfp blue and wfp green are calculated by the following equations 3 wfp blue 10 et blue a 4 wfp green 10 et green a 5 et blue max 0 et c p e 6 et green min 0 et c p e where the constant 10 is used to convert water depth mm to water volume per acreage m3 ha 1 et blue is the blue water evapotranspiration during the growth period of soybean mm et green is the green water evapotranspiration mm a is the soybean planting area ha et c is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm and p e is the effective precipitation mm which is calculated by the following equations 7 p ej 0 p j 5 mm 0 9 p j 5 mm p j 50 mm 0 75 p j p j 50 mm 8 p e j 1 n p ej i where p ej is the effective precipitation at the j th time mm p j is the total precipitation amount at the j th time mm p ej i is the effective precipitation at the j th time in the i th phase mm n is the precipitation time from 1 to n in the i th phase the variable i represents the soybean growth period in the current study the method used to measure effective precipitation was based on that of kang and cai 1996 and has been extensively used in previous studies guo et al 2022 yang et al 2021b et c can be calculated based on the reference evapotranspiration et0 which is estimated according to the penman monteith equation recommended by fao56 allen et al 1998 the equation is developed based on co2 condition in 1998 which might result in a slight bias in estimating long term crop evapotranspiration under elevated co2 emissions morison 1998 despite the limitation the penman monteith equation is still widely used to calculate crop evapotranspiration li et al 2020 cao et al 2018 chu et al 2017 the specific equations are as follow 9 et c k c et 0 10 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t em 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t em is the daily average air temperature at a height of 2 m u2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa 1 k c is the crop coefficient and the standard k c values are provided by fao56 and adjusted by eqs 10 12 allen et al 1998 11 k c k c tap 0 04 u 2 2 0 04 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 12 rh min 100 e 0 t min e 0 t max 13 e 0 t 0 611 exp 17 27 t t 237 3 where k c tap are the standard k c values h is the plant height of soybean during the growth stage and rh min is the daily minimum relative humidity during the growth stage which is dependent on daily maximum temperature t max and minimum temperature t min the single crop coefficient approach was used to calculate the soybean coefficient allen et al 1998 to accurately reflect the evapotranspiration of soybean the k c values were calculated for the initial growth stage rapid development stage mid season stage and late season stage the generalized crop coefficient curve is shown in fig s1 the standard k c values were 0 40 for the initial growth stage 1 15 for the mid season stage and 0 50 for the end of the late season stage for non stressed well managed crops in subhumid climate conditions allen et al 1998 at the same time the k c values for the mid season stage were adjusted by the above equations and local meteorological data in our study of which h was 0 4 m during the mid season stage the actual evapotranspiration and effective precipitation of soybean at the station scale were calculated in r 3 6 1 and interpolated into raster maps at a spatial resolution of 1 km using inverse distance weighted interpolation in arcgis 10 6 these layers were then averaged at the county scale using the zonal statistics tool according with actual data of soybean production to quantify the water footprint 2 3 spatial autocorrelation analysis spatial autocorrelation analysis reflects the degree of spatial dependence among variables within a geographic area and has been extensively used in water footprint research to explore spatial patterns in different variables santos and naval 2020 yang et al 2021a the two main types of spatial autocorrelation analyses that can be conducted are global analyses and local analyses global moran s i was used to determine the degree of spatial clustering or dispersion of variables for the entire study area the statistic was calculated using eq 14 moran 1948 14 global moran s i n i j w ij x i x x j x i j w ij i i x i x 2 where w ij is the matrix of the spatial weight n is the number of samples x i and x j are the values of variable x at the location i and location j respectively and x is the average value of variable x the value of global moran s i is between 1 and 1 moran s i 0 indicates positive spatial correlation and larger values correspond to stronger spatial correlation conversely moran s i 0 indicates negative spatial correlation if moran s i equals 0 the spatial distribution of the variable is random furthermore the statistical significance of the spatial autocorrelation was examined using permutation tests absolute values of the standardized z score that exceed 1 96 or 2 58 indicate that the degree of spatial autocorrelation is greater or less than 95 or 99 of the observations in a standard normal distribution respectively and thus that the degree of spatial autocorrelation is significant global moran s i can reflect the overall trend in spatial autocorrelation across the entire study area however it fails to identify the presence of local clustering of attributes therefore local autocorrelation analysis lisa was employed to calculate the local moran s i of all counties which are commonly divided into four categories high high cluster low low cluster low high outlier and high low outlier anselin 1995 the first two categories indicate that the level high or low of the variable in this county is consistent with adjacent counties whereas the last two categories indicate that the level high or low of the variable in this county is different from adjacent counties global autocorrelation analysis and local autocorrelation analysis were conducted to characterize the degree of spatial clustering in wfp which was performed using arcgis 10 6 2 4 driving factors analysis our study focused on four major drivers of the wfp relating to agricultural production climate yield crop distribution and total production the virtual scenarios analysis was used to separate the responses of wfp into different factors for every virtual scenario only one factor was held fixed at its initial value in 1985 while all other factors were free to change from 1985 to 2015 wfp at the county scale was then recalculated and compared with the actual wfp the relative change in wfp was then determined by the single factor in turn four virtual scenarios were formulated in this study table 2 the detailed parameters for the virtual scenarios were as follows s1 keep climatic conditions constant with 1985 s2 keep yield constant with 1985 s3 keep crop distribution constant with 1985 and s4 keep total production constant with 1985 ultimately s1 s2 s3 and s4 were developed to reveal the impacts of climate yield crop distribution and total production on wfp respectively 2 5 data collection the climate data 1985 2015 from 718 meteorological observation stations fig 1 including daily maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature precipitation relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed were derived from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn given the difficulty of collecting long term sequence data at the county level data on county scale soybean production were only collected in seven representative years 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 and were provided by the institute of agricultural information chinese academy of agricultural sciences soybean phenological data were collected and collated from china s major crop growing period atlas and the crop phenology dataset provided by the china meteorological data website china meteorological administration 2019 cui et al 1984 mei et al 2016 chinese terrestrial ecosystem spatial distribution data were downloaded from the resource environmental science and data center institute of geographical sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn 3 results 3 1 wfp and wfp y in china as shown in fig 2 the national wfp first increased and then decreased from 26 86 g m3 109 m3 in 1985 24 62 g m3 in 2015 a similar trend was observed in the national total production and planting area for soybean fig 3 in 2005 china produced 18 63 m t soybean and consumed 34 32 g m3 of water resources ranking the first in annual wfp in the studied period by contrast china produced 13 39 m t soybean and consumed the lowest amount of water resources annual wfp of 24 62 g m3 in 2015 the wfp was dominated by the wfp green component which was responsible for more than 70 of the wfp wfp blue was the highest in 2000 9 78 g m3 and the lowest in 1985 2 36 g m3 wfp y exhibited a significant downward trend from 2734 51 m3 t 1 in 1985 1838 60 m3 t 1 in 2015 and the average was 2194 59 m3 t 1 3 2 spatial temporal variation in the water footprint the wfp at the county scale was estimated and shown in fig 4 the high value areas for wfp were primarily distributed in the northeast and north central regions in 1985 and 2000 in addition the distribution of high value counties in the northwest and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river regions was dispersed in 2015 the high value counties for wfp were distributed in the northern portion of the northeast region the southern portion of the north central region the southeastern portion of the northwest region the northeastern portion of the southwest region and the northern portion of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river region there was a significant decreasing trend in wfp in the north central region and the southern portion of the northeast region from 1985 to 2015 fig 4d by contrast an increasing trend was observed in the northwest region southwest region and the northern portion of the northeast region this was consistent with the observed changes in the soybean planting area and total production in the same period fig s2 fig 5 shows the temporal variation in wfp for the six soybean cultivation areas from 1985 2015 compared with other regions the northeast region consumed the most water resources for soybean production during the study period which reached a peak of 8 74 17 19 g m3 a total of 2 15 4 27 m ha soybeans were planted in the northeast region an important agricultural production area which comprised approximately 41 4 of national production fig 3 the wfp proportion was slightly higher in the north central region than in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river region before 2000 and ranked second among all regions however the latter has consumed more water resources for soybean production in the past 15 years than the former the two regions were responsible for 37 4 of national soybean production the wfp in the northwest and southwest regions increased to 4 27 g m3 and 3 56 g m3 in 2015 respectively the wfp in the southeast region remained stable at a low level over the entire study period approximately 2 57 of national wfp which stemmed from the fact that the soybean planting area and production in this region were the lowest among the six regions fig 3 wfp was decomposed into wfp green and wfp blue the spatial distribution of wfp green wfp blue and their relative changes are shown in fig s3 and s4 the high value areas for wfp green were mainly concentrated in the northeast and north central regions where wfp green also had a significant downward trend about 3 29 g m3 and 3 32 g m3 in 1985 2015 respectively fig s5 a decreasing trend in wfp blue was observed in the southern areas including the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river southwest and southeast regions 0 32 g m3 for the entire study period notably the counties with a decrease greater than 3 0 106 m3 in wfp blue were concentrated in the southern portion of the north central region where soybean planting area and production are greatly reduced fig s2 in the northeast and northwest regions wfp blue increased by 1 36 g m3 and 1 02 g m3 over the study period respectively the proportion of wfp green was stable over time in the southeast and southwest regions fig 6 in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river region the wfp green proportion increased from 92 6 in 1985 to 99 0 in 2015 however the wfp green proportion showed a volatile decreasing trend over time in the northern areas including the northeast northwest and north central regions in other words the proportion of wfp blue increased in northern areas 3 3 spatial temporal pattern characteristics of the water footprint table s1 shows the global moran s i standardized z score and p value for wfp in 1985 2015 the global moran s i was 0 in all years meaning that wfp across the entire country was positively spatially correlated meanwhile the standardized z value was higher than the critical value 2 58 which indicates that spatial autocorrelation was significant p 0 01 global moran s i exhibited a volatile decreasing trend fig 7 and table s1 indicating that the degree of spatial autocorrelation gradually weakened with time the specific spatial characteristics of the local areas are shown in fig 7 the high high clustered counties were mainly distributed in the northeast region and shrunk northward during the period 1985 2015 at the same time the high high clustered areas in henan and anhui provinces exhibited a contracting trend high high clustered counties appeared in sichuan province in 2015 low low clustered areas were mainly located in the northwest and southwest regions and shrunk northward and westward the wfp exhibited a clustered spatial distribution over the entire study area but the spatial distribution at the county level tends to be dispersed in studied period 3 4 driving factors of water footprint the contributions of climate yield crop distribution and total production to changes in regional and national wfp are shown in fig 8 across the entire study area the effects of climate and total production accounted for 88 71 106 m3 and 6942 01 106 m3 of the increase in wfp in 2015 respectively whereas yield and crop distribution affected 50748 28 106 m3 and 936 30 106 m3 decrease in the national wfp respectively overall yield was the dominant factor affecting changes in wfp whereas climate was the least important variable as can be seen in fig 8 there were spatial differences in the effects of the different factors on wfp climate caused the wfp to increase by 368 60 106 m3 218 72 106 m3 and 43 22 106 m3 in the northeast northwest and north central regions respectively but decrease by 464 86 106 m3 1 75 106 m3 and 75 23 106 m3 in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river southeast and southwest regions respectively the effect of yield contributed to water resources saving for soybean production in all cultivation regions by 565 11 106 m3 to 20993 36 106 m3 the effect of the crop distribution caused the wfp to decrease by 2031 83 106 m3 and 2983 77 106 m3 in the northeast and north central regions respectively while increase by 103 26 1819 38 106 m3 in the other four cultivation regions total production had positive effects on the wfp in the other five regions except for the north central region in the north central region the total soybean production decreased from 2 42 m t in 1985 1 69 m t in 2015 fig 3b which reduced the wfp by 1128 23 106 m3 by contrast the soybean output of the other five regions increased by 9 7 239 5 fig 3b which jointly increased the wfp by 8070 24 106 m3 4 discussion assessment of the crop water footprint is essential for regulating regional water resources and alleviating water shortages in china a major agricultural country the national wfp first increased and then decreased throughout the study period and wfp y decreased by 32 80 from 2734 51 m3 t 1 in 1985 1838 60 m3 t 1 in 2015 given the lack of relevant studies that have quantified the total water consumption for soybean production in china we compared the wfp y with previously published studies yang et al 2021b demonstrated that wfp y for rained soybean in 2001 and 2016 was 3120 m3 t 1 and 2780 m3 t 1 whereas wfp y for irrigated soybean was 2840 m3 t 1 and 2800 m3 t 1 respectively in addition wfp y for soybean production in 2008 was estimated to be 2134 m3 t 1 zhuo et al 2016 these results slightly differed from those of the current study which might be explained by the following considerations in this study the soybean yields were derived from national statistical data which represent actual production however soybean yields were simulated using the aquacrop model in previous studies yang et al 2021a zhuo et al 2016 these simulated yields represent the attainable yield under certain agricultural management schemes the aquacrop model a water driven daily crop simulation model simulates crop growth and development and only considers limitations in water raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 hence the simulated yields usually exhibit some bias compared with actual production battisti et al 2017 exploration of the spatial temporal characteristics of the crop water footprint aids the identification of priority areas for water footprint regulation and the development of appropriate water management strategies the current study found that the high value counties were mainly distributed in the northeast north central and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river regions the above three regions are major soybean producing areas average of 1 37 2 99 m ha and were jointly responsible for 78 8 of national production in the observed period which was far higher than the other three regions fig 3 national bureau of statistics 2020 larger planting scales result in the greater consumption of water resources for soybean production in these regions xu et al 2015 additionally new high value areas appeared in the southwest region in 2015 specifically in sichuan chongqing and yunnan provinces which might reflect the fact that they have become major emerging soybean producing regions since 2013 yang and zhu 2020 the wfp decreased in the north central region and the southern part of the northeast region which stems from the decreasing trend in soybean planting acreage in the above regions over time yang and zhu 2020 the above changes were the reason why the distribution of wfp at the county scale gradually tended to become more dispersed during the study period fig 7 our results demonstrate that spatial temporal variation in the wfp was closely related to the soybean planting area and total production fig 4 and s2 this stems from the fact that the water consumed for crop production is mainly affected by the planting scale and output in a given geographic area cao et al 2018 xu et al 2015 the uneven distribution of water resources and arable land is the major factor restricting agricultural production in china sun et al 2013a the proportion of arable land in northern regions is approximately 60 but the water resources in northern regions make up only 19 of the total amount of water resources in china zhang et al 2009 the arable land in southern regions has gradually decreased due to socio economic development and urbanization garnaut et al 2018 and this has shifted grain production westward and northward to the water scarce northern regions wang et al 2014 the crop related virtual water embedded by grain trade flows from northern to southern china which aggravates the conflict between water resources and grain production zhuo et al 2016 the wfp for soybean production was determined by wfp green which is consistent with studies of other crops such as wheat maize rice and potatoes cao et al 2014 li et al 2020 zhuo et al 2016 meanwhile we found that the proportion of wfp green decreased in northern areas while the wfp blue proportion increased in northern areas among six cultivation areas the northeast region showed the largest change in the wfp green proportion a 16 2 decrease fig 6 dai et al 2018 suggested that soybean water consumption gradually increased in the area whereas precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend especially during the soybean growth period according to long term data piao et al 2010 hence more irrigation water blue water was consumed for soybean production during 1985 2015 the blue water footprint in the northeast and northwest regions increased by 1 36 g m3 and 1 02 g m3 respectively fig s5 because of the increasing domestic demand for soybean and policies encouraged by the government the soybean cultivated area increased by 2 83 106 ha in 2015 2019 the soybean cultivated area in the northwest and northeast regions increased by 80 5 and 76 4 respectively national bureau of statistics 2020 this suggests that more water resources need to be appropriated for soybean production yet this intensifies water scarcity in the above regions reducing the crop water footprint is considered an effective approach for alleviating regional water shortages especially in water scarce regions such as northern china in these regions reducing irrigation water consumption blue water during the crop growing period is particularly important in light of the complementary characteristics among blue and green water and the low opportunity cost of green water liu et al 2009 precipitation green water should be consumed for crop production as much as possible adaptive strategies including drought tolerant varieties straw mulch rational planting date cropping systems and tillage management should be implemented to increase precipitation use efficiency anda et al 2020 casa and lo cascio 2008 ren et al 2016 assessing the components of and variation in the crop water footprint is essential for regulating the use of regional water resources many researchers have examined these topics in previous studies and this work has made valuable contributions however how to reduce crop water footprint still is a confusing issue which is because the crop water footprint is affected by many factors including climatic conditions agricultural water and fertilizer management and the planting scale cao et al 2018 chu et al 2017 sun et al 2013b analysis of the factors driving variation in the water footprint can provide more practical insights that could be used to reduce the water footprint of crop production fig 8 shows that the yield is the dominant factor driving change in wfp whereas climatic conditions had the weakest effect on wfp the water footprint of per unit crop product is determined by actual crop evapotranspiration and crop yield crop evapotranspiration is mainly affected by climatic conditions and its change li et al 2020 climatic conditions have complicated impacts on crop water consumption and development because of their high variability piao et al 2010 even within the same region or province climatic change can have different effects increasing and decreasing on soybean water consumption dai et al 2018 in sum climatic change had a negative effect on wfp reductions in the northern regions but the opposite was observed in southern regions fig 8 this might be increasing soybean water consumption caused by climatic change which was observed in the northeast region dai et al 2018 climatic conditions are one of the factors affecting the wfp but its relative importance is smaller compared with crop yield or production scale dai et al 2018 sun et al 2013b crop yields have increased because of the development of alternative cultivars and improvements in agricultural management especially fertilizer input which is the main reason why the water footprint of per unit crop product has been observed to decrease in most crops mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 sun et al 2013b the water footprint of per ton soybean coupled with regional soybean production affected the total water footprint in a given area the positive effect of yield increase on reducing wfp was observed in all cultivation regions fig 8 hence improving crop yield is an important strategy for decreasing the water footprint of per unit crop product and reducing the water consumption of crop production in major agricultural countries dai et al 2018 li et al 2020 xu et al 2015 showed that production scale increases the total water consumption of crops in certain geographic areas and our results are consistent with this finding fig 8 an appropriate crop planting structure based on the crop water consumption characteristics local climatic conditions water resource distribution and food demand plays an important role in optimizing agricultural water allocation and reducing the water footprint of crop production chu et al 2017 xu et al 2015 additionally some socio economic factors can have indirect effects on the total water footprint of crop production li et al 2021 in this study we focused on the major factors affecting the wfp therefore other factors that might affect the water footprint of crops should be explored in future studies as such work could provide more insights into how the water footprint of crop production could be reduced and regional water scarcity could be alleviated last but not least we would like to mention that the gray water footprint was not assessed in our study by definition gray water refers to the volume of freshwater required to dilute the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 the gray water footprint is often used to assess the environmental load of agricultural ecosystem induced by crop production which is not the actual water consumption xu et al 2015 zhao et al 2021a in this study we mainly paid attention to the consumptive water footprint of soybean production consequently the gray water footprint was not considered spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to explore the degree of spatial clustering or dispersion of wfp as this analysis has a rigorous mathematical basis this method provides more objective results that are superior to superficial descriptions of estimated values additionally the virtual scenarios were employed to distinguish the effects of various factors our results confirm the availability and practicability of these methods and provide valuable new insights into regional water management and the layout of soybean plantations the water footprint theory and our methods could be applied to other crops and major agricultural countries especially in water scarce regions our results coupled with regional water resources farmland distribution the production of other crops and food demand indicate that systematic and comprehensive studies are needed to formulate more detailed crop planting plans to achieve both water and food security in china 5 conclusions the annual water consumption for soybean production was between 24 62 g m3 and 34 32 g m3 in china and it first increased and then decreased over the period 1985 2015 wfp exhibited a clustered spatial distribution over the entire study area but the distribution of wfp at the county level tended to be more dispersed over the study period the high value areas for the wfp were primarily distributed in the northeast north central and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river regions which was similar to the distribution of wfp green the wfp green proportion decreased in northern areas whereas the wfp blue proportion increased in northern areas soybean yield was the most important factor affecting wfp as increases in soybean yield contributed to the decrease in wfp y from 2734 51 m3 t 1 to 1838 60 m3 t 1 with time further influenced the national wfp decreased by 50 75 g m3 in 2015 the above results provide new insights that could be used to optimize regional water management and achieve water security in china credit

9662,water scarcity and food security are major challenges facing the world in the 21st century the water footprint provides a new and comprehensive approach for understanding the relationship between crop production and water utilization and it has been used to estimate the water consumption of most crops at global and regional scales however the water footprint of soybean production wfp in china has not been extensively studied here this study investigated firstly the components spatial temporal variation as well as the driving factors of the county scale wfp during the period of 1985 2015 in china annual wfp first increased and then decreased from 26 86 g m3 109 m3 in 1985 24 62 g m3 in 2015 the wfp exhibited a clustered spatial distribution across the entire study area and high value areas for wfp were mainly distributed in the northeast north central and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river regions the spatial distribution of wfp at the county level tends to be dispersed in studied period the proportion of green water footprint wfp green reached as high as 70 of the wfp whereas it decreased in the northern areas accompanied by the increased wfp blue proportion soybean yield was the major factor affecting wfp and the increase in soybean yield contributed to the 32 80 decrease in the water footprint per ton soybean over the entire study period further saved the 50 75 g m3 water resource for national soybean production in 2015 the results of this study provide new insights that could be used to improve agricultural water management optimize regional water resource allocation and alleviate water shortages in china keywords factor decomposition mainland china spatial temporal variation spatial autocorrelation analysis water consumption 1 introduction water scarcity and food security have become major challenges in the 21st century because of socio economic development and population growth maja and ayano 2021 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 pastor et al 2019 agricultural production consumes approximately 70 of global available freshwater haddeland et al 2014 and water used in crop production accounts for the largest proportion of this total kang et al 2017 more water resources will be needed to be used in agricultural production to meet future increases in food demand chu et al 2017 and this will pose great challenges for agricultural water resource management studies of water utilization in crop production are critically important for alleviating water shortages hoekstra et al 2011 the water footprint was introduced by hoekstra 2003 to enhance our understanding of the relationship between water utilization and human activity which provides a new and comprehensive approach for estimating direct and indirect water consumption during agricultural production the consumptive water footprint of crop production is defined as the volume of fresh water appropriated during the crop growing period and comprises two components blue and green water hoekstra et al 2011 yang et al 2021a zhuo et al 2016 blue water refers to the consumption of surface and ground water whereas green water refers to the consumption of precipitation insofar as it does not become run off falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 since then the water footprint has been widely examined by researchers several studies have focused on quantifying the water footprint of specific crops and these studies have mainly focused on two aspects the total water footprint in a given geographic area and the water footprint of per unit crop product cao et al 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 estimated the total water footprint of wheat on a global scale in the period 1995 2005 and showed that global wheat production consumed 108 billion m3 of water per year in recent years assessments of the crop water footprint have been conducted at the national cao et al 2014 muratoglu 2020 catchment zhuo et al 2014 plain chu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 and field scales ahmadi et al

applications the results of these studies also provide new insights that could be used to improve water use efficiency optimize regional water resource allocation and alleviate water shortages china one of the most populous and agricultural countries of the world has experienced severe water scarcity mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 as the per capita water volume only accounts for 28 of the world s average kang et al 2017 thus maximizing the production of food with limited water resources has been a major focus of research quantifying the water footprint of crop production can help characterize patterns of crop water consumption enhance agricultural water management and achieve water and food security most previous studies in china that have focused on evaluating the water footprint have been conducted at the provincial cao et al 2018 2020 2014 huang et al 2019 li et al 2020 xu et al 2015 yang et al 2021a and municipal scale li et al 2021 by contrast few studies have been conducted at the county scale studies at the county scale are needed given that the county is the basic unit at which grain production and water management measures are implemented in china xu et al 2012 2019 water footprint theory has been used to explore spatial temporal changes in the water consumption of several crops in china such as wheat cao et al 2014 huang et al 2019 maize xu et al 2019 and rice li et al 2020 most researchers have described spatial temporal variation in the water footprint by comparing estimated values cao et al 2018 li et al 2020 xu et al 2015 however this approach fails to capture the actual spatial characteristics underlying the data this might be contributed to the absence of the water footprint data at finer spatial scales and systematic methods in addition few water footprint studies in china have been conducted on soybean soybean glycine max l merr is the major raw material crop of plant based protein and vegetable oil and it plays a key role in agricultural production and economic development ainsworth et al 2012 soybean is cultivated widely in china 19 7 53 5 n 77 3 134 3 e song et al 2016 soybean in china can be divided into four categories according to sowing date spring soybean summer soybean autumn soybean and winter soybean and the former two are the main planting types zhao et al 2021b soybean yields vary regionally in china due to variation in climatic conditions crop management and cropping systems and the provincial average yield ranged from 1 03 t ha 1 to 2 98 t ha 1 in 2015 2019 national bureau of statistics 2020 actual production has experienced significant spatial shifts across china in recent decades due to increases in domestic soybean demand and changes in policies and the international market sun et al 2020 yang and zhu 2020 the extensive area of soybean cultivation in china and variation in climate yield and planting scale contribute to the spatial complexity in the water footprint of soybean production wfp in different geographic regions this urges us to choose an appropriate method to carefully assess the spatial temporal characteristics of the wfp in addition quantifying the contributions of various factors to determining the wfp is critically important as such information can provide insights that could be used to optimize the allocation of regional water resources for soybean production study of spatial temporal variation in the soybean water footprint and the factors driving this variation is essential for establishing priority areas for water footprint regulation formulating water management strategies enhancing soybean production and ensuring china s food security although water footprint theory has been applied to many countries and crops information on the soybean water footprint in china is scarce soybean production in china has undergone significant spatial shifts in recent years sun et al 2020 yang and zhu 2020 which has resulted in changes to the water footprint however few studies have examined the spatial and temporal changes in the soybean water footprint and the factors affecting variation in the soybean water footprint in china here the components spatial temporal variation as well as the driving factors of the county scale wfp during the period of 1985 2015 in china were firstly studied to provide information that could be used to promote increases in soybean production while minimizing the consumption of excessive water resources the specific objectives of our study were to 1 quantify the water footprint for soybean production and its components at the county scale 2 characterize spatial temporal variation in and patterns of the soybean water footprint in 1985 2015 and 3 explore the impact of various factors on the soybean water footprint in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in 31 provinces municipal cities and autonomous regions of mainland china due to limitations in available data hong kong macao and taiwan were not considered in our study china was divided into six soybean cultivation areas based on geographical location and agricultural production status northeast region north central region northwest region middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river region southwest region and southeast region fig 1 the administrative divisions climatic conditions and basic information relating to soybean production for the six cultivation areas are shown in table 1 2 2 water footprint calculation the total water footprint is the sum of the blue water footprint and green water footprint which are calculated according to the water footprint network hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 as follows 1 wfp wfp blue wfp g reen where wfp is the total water footprint m3 wfp blue is the blue water footprint m3 and wfp green is the green water footprint m3 the wfp y is calculated by dividing wfp by crop yield 2 wfp y wfp y where wfp y is the water footprint of per unit soybean product m3 t 1 and y is the soybean yield t wfp blue and wfp green are calculated by the following equations 3 wfp blue 10 et blue a 4 wfp green 10 et green a 5 et blue max 0 et c p e 6 et

green is the green water evapotranspiration mm a is the soybean planting area ha et c is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm and p e is the effective precipitation mm which is calculated by the following equations 7 p ej 0 p j 5 mm 0 9 p j 5 mm p j 50 mm 0 75 p j p j 50 mm 8 p e j 1 n p ej i where p ej is the effective precipitation at the j th time mm p j is the total precipitation amount at the j th time mm p ej i is the effective precipitation at the j th time in the i th phase mm n is the precipitation time from 1 to n in the i th phase the variable i represents the soybean growth period in the current study the method used to measure effective precipitation was based on that of kang and cai 1996 and has been extensively used in previous studies guo et al 2022 yang et al 2021b et c can be calculated based on the reference evapotranspiration et0 which is estimated according to the penman monteith equation recommended by fao56 allen et al 1998 the equation is developed based on co2 condition in 1998 which might result in a slight bias in estimating long term crop evapotranspiration under elevated co2 emissions morison 1998 despite the limitation the penman monteith equation is still widely used to calculate crop evapotranspiration li et al 2020 cao et al 2018 chu et al 2017 the specific equations are as follow 9 et c k c et 0 10 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t em 273 u

growth stage which is dependent on daily maximum temperature t max and minimum temperature t min the single crop coefficient approach was used to calculate the soybean coefficient allen et al 1998 to accurately reflect the evapotranspiration of soybean the k c values were calculated for the initial growth stage rapid development stage mid season stage and late season stage the generalized crop coefficient curve is shown in fig s1 the standard k c values were 0 40 for the initial growth stage 1 15 for the mid season stage and 0 50 for the end of the late season stage for non stressed well managed crops in subhumid climate conditions allen et al 1998 at the same time the k c values for the mid season stage were adjusted by the above equations and local meteorological data in our study of which h was 0 4 m during the mid season stage the actual evapotranspiration and effective precipitation of soybean at the station scale were calculated in r 3 6 1 and interpolated into raster maps at a spatial resolution of 1 km using inverse distance weighted interpolation in arcgis 10 6 these layers were then averaged at the county scale using the zonal statistics tool according with actual data of soybean production to quantify the water footprint 2 3 spatial autocorrelation analysis spatial autocorrelation analysis reflects the degree of spatial dependence among variables within a geographic area and has been extensively used in water footprint research to explore spatial patterns in different variables santos and naval 2020 yang et al 2021a the two main types of spatial autocorrelation analyses that can be conducted are global analyses and local analyses global moran s i was used to determine the degree of spatial clustering or dispersion of variables for the entire study area the statistic was calculated using eq 14 moran 1948 14 global moran s i n i j w ij x i x x j x i j w ij i i x i x 2 where w ij is the matrix of the spatial weight n is the number of samples x i and x j are the values of variable x at the location i and location j respectively and x is the average value of variable x the value of global moran s i is between 1 and 1 moran s i 0 indicates positive spatial correlation and larger values correspond to stronger spatial correlation conversely moran s i 0 indicates negative spatial correlation if moran s i equals 0 the spatial distribution of the variable is random furthermore the statistical significance of the spatial autocorrelation was examined using permutation tests absolute values of the standardized z score that exceed 1 96 or 2 58 indicate that the degree of spatial autocorrelation is greater or less than 95 or 99 of the observations in a standard normal distribution respectively and thus that the degree of spatial autocorrelation is significant global moran s i can reflect the overall trend in spatial autocorrelation across the entire study area however it fails to identify the presence of local clustering of attributes therefore local autocorrelation analysis lisa was employed to calculate the local moran s i of all counties which are commonly divided into four categories high high cluster low low cluster low high outlier and high low outlier anselin 1995 the first two categories indicate that the level high or low of the variable in this county is consistent with adjacent counties whereas the last two categories indicate that the level high or low of the variable in this county is different from adjacent counties global autocorrelation analysis and local autocorrelation analysis were conducted to characterize the degree of spatial clustering in wfp which was performed using arcgis 10 6 2 4 driving factors analysis our study focused on four major drivers of the wfp relating to agricultural production climate yield crop distribution and total production the virtual scenarios analysis was used to separate the responses of wfp into different factors for every virtual scenario only one factor was held fixed at its initial value in 1985 while all other factors were free to change from 1985 to 2015 wfp at the county scale was then recalculated and compared with the actual wfp the relative change in wfp was then determined by the single factor in turn four virtual scenarios were formulated in this study table 2 the detailed parameters for the virtual scenarios were as follows s1 keep climatic conditions constant with 1985 s2 keep yield constant with 1985 s3 keep crop distribution constant with 1985 and s4 keep total production constant with 1985 ultimately s1 s2 s3 and s4 were developed to reveal the impacts of climate yield crop distribution and total production on wfp respectively 2 5 data collection the climate data 1985 2015 from 718 meteorological observation stations fig 1 including daily maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature precipitation relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed were derived from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn given the difficulty of collecting long term sequence data at the county level data on county scale soybean production were only collected in seven representative years 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 and were provided by the institute of agricultural information chinese academy of agricultural sciences soybean phenological data were collected and collated from china s major crop growing period atlas and the crop phenology dataset provided by the china meteorological data website china meteorological administration 2019 cui et al 1984 mei et al 2016 chinese terrestrial ecosystem spatial distribution data were downloaded from the resource environmental science and data center institute of geographical sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn 3 results 3 1 wfp and wfp y in china as shown in fig 2 the national wfp first increased and then decreased from 26 86 g m3 109 m3 in 1985 24 62 g m3 in 2015 a similar trend was observed in the national total production and planting area for soybean fig 3 in 2005 china produced 18 63 m t soybean and consumed 34 32 g m3 of water resources ranking the first in annual wfp in the studied period by contrast china produced 13 39 m t soybean and consumed the lowest amount of water resources annual wfp of 24 62 g m3 in 2015 the wfp was dominated by the wfp green component which was responsible for more than 70 of the wfp wfp blue was the highest in 2000 9 78 g m3 and the lowest in 1985 2 36 g m3 wfp y exhibited a significant downward trend from 2734 51 m3 t 1 in 1985 1838 60 m3 t 1 in 2015 and the average was 2194 59 m3 t 1 3 2 spatial temporal variation in the water footprint the wfp at the county scale was estimated and shown in fig 4 the high value areas for wfp were primarily distributed in the northeast and north central regions in 1985 and 2000 in addition the distribution of high value counties in the northwest and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river regions was dispersed in 2015 the high value counties for wfp were distributed in the northern portion of the northeast region the southern portion of the north central region the southeastern portion of the northwest region the northeastern portion of the southwest region and the northern portion of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river region there was a significant decreasing trend in wfp in the north central region and the southern portion of the northeast region from 1985 to 2015 fig 4d by contrast an increasing trend was observed in the northwest region southwest region and the northern portion of the northeast region this was consistent with the observed changes in the soybean planting area and total production in the same period fig s2 fig 5 shows the temporal variation in wfp for the six soybean cultivation areas from 1985 2015 compared with other regions the northeast region consumed the most water resources for soybean production during the study period which reached a peak of 8 74 17 19 g m3 a total of 2 15 4 27 m ha soybeans were planted in the northeast region an important agricultural production area which comprised approximately 41 4 of national production fig 3 the wfp proportion was slightly higher in the north central region than in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river region before 2000 and ranked second among all regions however the latter has consumed more water resources for soybean production in the past 15 years than the former the two regions were responsible for 37 4 of national soybean production the wfp in the northwest and southwest regions increased to 4 27 g m3 and 3 56 g m3 in 2015 respectively the wfp in the southeast region remained stable at a low level over the entire study period approximately 2 57 of national wfp which stemmed from the fact that the soybean planting area and production in this region were the lowest among the six regions fig 3 wfp was decomposed into wfp green and wfp blue the spatial distribution of wfp green wfp blue and their relative changes are shown in fig s3 and s4 the high value areas for wfp green were mainly concentrated in the northeast and north central regions where wfp green also had a significant downward trend about 3 29 g m3 and 3 32 g m3 in 1985 2015 respectively fig s5 a decreasing trend in wfp blue was observed in the southern areas including the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river southwest and southeast regions 0 32 g m3 for the entire study period notably the counties with a decrease greater than 3 0 106 m3 in wfp blue were concentrated in the southern portion of the north central region where soybean planting area and production are greatly reduced fig s2 in the northeast and northwest regions wfp blue increased by 1 36 g m3 and 1 02 g m3 over the study period respectively the proportion of wfp green was stable over time in the southeast and southwest regions fig 6 in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river region the wfp green proportion increased from 92 6 in 1985 to 99 0 in 2015 however the wfp green proportion showed a volatile decreasing trend over time in the northern areas including the northeast northwest and north central regions in other words the proportion of wfp blue increased in northern areas 3 3 spatial temporal pattern characteristics of the water footprint table s1 shows the global moran s i standardized z score and p value for wfp in 1985 2015 the global moran s i was 0 in all years meaning that wfp across the entire country was positively spatially correlated meanwhile the standardized z value was higher than the critical value 2 58 which indicates that spatial autocorrelation was significant p 0 01 global moran s i exhibited a volatile decreasing trend fig 7 and table s1 indicating that the degree of spatial autocorrelation gradually weakened with time the specific spatial characteristics of the local areas are shown in fig 7 the high high clustered counties were mainly distributed in the northeast region and shrunk northward during the period 1985 2015 at the same time the high high clustered areas in henan and anhui provinces exhibited a contracting trend high high clustered counties appeared in sichuan province in 2015 low low clustered areas were mainly located in the northwest and southwest regions and shrunk northward and westward the wfp exhibited a clustered spatial distribution over the entire study area but the spatial distribution at the county level tends to be dispersed in studied period 3 4 driving factors of water footprint the contributions of climate yield crop distribution and total production to changes in regional and national wfp are shown in fig 8 across the entire study area the effects of climate and total production accounted for 88 71 106 m3 and 6942 01 106 m3 of the increase in wfp in 2015 respectively whereas yield and crop distribution affected 50748 28 106 m3 and 936 30 106 m3 decrease in the national wfp respectively overall yield was the dominant factor affecting changes in wfp whereas climate was the least important variable as can be seen in fig 8 there were spatial differences in the effects of the different factors on wfp climate caused the wfp to increase by 368 60 106 m3 218 72 106 m3 and 43 22 106 m3 in the northeast northwest and north central regions respectively but decrease by 464 86 106 m3 1 75 106 m3 and 75 23 106 m3 in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river southeast and southwest regions respectively the effect of yield contributed to water resources saving for soybean production in all cultivation regions by 565 11 106 m3 to 20993 36 106 m3 the effect of the crop distribution caused the wfp to decrease by 2031 83 106 m3 and 2983 77 106 m3 in the northeast and north central regions respectively while increase by 103 26 1819 38 106 m3 in the other four cultivation regions total production had positive effects on the wfp in the other five regions except for the north central region in the north central region the total soybean production decreased from 2 42 m t in 1985 1 69 m t in 2015 fig 3b which reduced the wfp by 1128 23 106 m3 by contrast the soybean output of the other five regions increased by 9 7 239 5 fig 3b which jointly increased the wfp by 8070 24 106 m3 4 discussion assessment of the crop water footprint is essential for regulating regional water resources and alleviating water shortages in china a major agricultural country the national wfp first increased and then decreased throughout the study period and wfp y decreased by 32 80 from 2734 51 m3 t 1 in 1985 1838 60 m3 t 1 in 2015 given the lack of relevant studies that have quantified the total water consumption for soybean production in china we compared the wfp y with previously published studies yang et al 2021b demonstrated that wfp y for rained soybean in 2001 and 2016 was 3120 m3 t 1 and 2780 m3 t 1 whereas wfp y for irrigated soybean was 2840 m3 t 1 and 2800 m3 t 1 respectively in addition wfp y for soybean production in 2008 was estimated to be 2134 m3 t 1 zhuo et al 2016 these results slightly differed from those of the current study which might be explained by the following considerations in this study the soybean yields were derived from national statistical data which represent actual production however soybean yields were simulated using the aquacrop model in previous studies yang et al 2021a zhuo et al 2016 these simulated yields represent the attainable yield under certain agricultural management schemes the aquacrop model a water driven daily crop simulation model simulates crop growth and development and only considers limitations in water raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 hence the simulated yields usually exhibit some bias compared with actual production battisti et al 2017 exploration of the spatial temporal characteristics of the crop water footprint aids the identification of priority areas for water footprint regulation and the development of appropriate water management strategies the current study found that the high value counties were mainly distributed in the northeast north central and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river regions the above three regions are major soybean producing areas average of 1 37 2 99 m ha and were jointly responsible for 78 8 of national production in the observed period which was far higher than the other three regions fig 3 national bureau of statistics 2020 larger planting scales result in the greater consumption of water resources for soybean production in these regions xu et al 2015 additionally new high value areas appeared in the southwest region in 2015 specifically in sichuan chongqing and yunnan provinces which might reflect the fact that they have become major emerging soybean producing regions since 2013 yang and zhu 2020 the wfp decreased in the north central region and the southern part of the northeast region which stems from the decreasing trend in soybean planting acreage in the above regions over time yang and zhu 2020 the above changes were the reason why the distribution of wfp at the county scale gradually tended to become more dispersed during the study period fig 7 our results demonstrate that spatial temporal variation in the wfp was closely related to the soybean planting area and total production fig 4 and s2 this stems from the fact that the water consumed for crop production is mainly affected by the planting scale and output in a given geographic area cao et al 2018 xu et al 2015 the uneven distribution of water resources and arable land is the major factor restricting agricultural production in china sun et al 2013a the proportion of arable land in northern regions is approximately 60 but the water resources in northern regions make up only 19 of the total amount of water resources in china zhang et al 2009 the arable land in southern regions has gradually decreased due to socio economic development and urbanization garnaut et al 2018 and this has shifted grain production westward and northward to the water scarce northern regions wang et al 2014 the crop related virtual water embedded by grain trade flows from northern to southern china which aggravates the conflict between water resources and grain production zhuo et al 2016 the wfp for soybean production was determined by wfp green which is consistent with studies of other crops such as wheat maize rice and potatoes cao et al 2014 li et al 2020 zhuo et al 2016 meanwhile we found that the proportion of wfp green decreased in northern areas while the wfp blue proportion increased in northern areas among six cultivation areas the northeast region showed the largest change in the wfp green proportion a 16 2 decrease fig 6 dai et al 2018 suggested that soybean water consumption gradually increased in the area whereas precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend especially during the soybean growth period according to long term data piao et al 2010 hence more irrigation water blue water was consumed for soybean production during 1985 2015 the blue water footprint in the northeast and northwest regions increased by 1 36 g m3 and 1 02 g m3 respectively fig s5 because of the increasing domestic demand for soybean and policies encouraged by the government the soybean cultivated area increased by 2 83 106 ha in 2015 2019 the soybean cultivated area in the northwest and northeast regions increased by 80 5 and 76 4 respectively national bureau of statistics 2020 this suggests that more water resources need to be appropriated for soybean production yet this intensifies water scarcity in the above regions reducing the crop water footprint is considered an effective approach for alleviating regional water shortages especially in water scarce regions such as northern china in these regions reducing irrigation water consumption blue water during the crop growing period is particularly important in light of the complementary characteristics among blue and green water and the low opportunity cost of green water liu et al 2009 precipitation green water should be consumed for crop production as much as possible adaptive strategies including drought tolerant varieties straw mulch rational planting date cropping systems and tillage management should be implemented to increase precipitation use efficiency anda et al 2020 casa and lo cascio 2008 ren et al 2016 assessing the components of and variation in the crop water footprint is essential for regulating the use of regional water resources many researchers have examined these topics in previous studies and this work has made valuable contributions however how to reduce crop water footprint still is a confusing issue which is because the crop water footprint is affected by many factors including climatic conditions agricultural water and fertilizer management and the planting scale cao et al 2018 chu et al 2017 sun et al 2013b analysis of the factors driving variation in the water footprint can provide more practical insights that could be used to reduce the water footprint of crop production fig 8 shows that the yield is the dominant factor driving change in wfp whereas climatic conditions had the weakest effect on wfp the water footprint of per unit crop product is determined by actual crop evapotranspiration and crop yield crop evapotranspiration is mainly affected by climatic conditions and its change li et al 2020 climatic conditions have complicated impacts on crop water consumption and development because of their high variability piao et al 2010 even within the same region or province climatic change can have different effects increasing and decreasing on soybean water consumption dai et al 2018 in sum climatic change had a negative effect on wfp reductions in the northern regions but the opposite was observed in southern regions fig 8 this might be increasing soybean water consumption caused by climatic change which was observed in the northeast region dai et al 2018 climatic conditions are one of the factors affecting the wfp but its relative importance is smaller compared with crop yield or production scale dai et al 2018 sun et al 2013b crop yields have increased because of the development of alternative cultivars and improvements in agricultural management especially fertilizer input which is the main reason why the water footprint of per unit crop product has been observed to decrease in most crops mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 sun et al 2013b the water footprint of per ton soybean coupled with regional soybean production affected the total water footprint in a given area the positive effect of yield increase on reducing wfp was observed in all cultivation regions fig 8 hence improving crop yield is an important strategy for decreasing the water footprint of per unit crop product and reducing the water consumption of crop production in major agricultural countries dai et al 2018 li et al 2020 xu et al 2015 showed that production scale increases the total water consumption of crops in certain geographic areas and our results are consistent with this finding fig 8 an appropriate crop planting structure based on the crop water consumption characteristics local climatic conditions water resource distribution and food demand plays an important role in optimizing agricultural water allocation and reducing the water footprint of crop production chu et al 2017 xu et al 2015 additionally some socio economic factors can have indirect effects on the total water footprint of crop production li et al 2021 in this study we focused on the major factors affecting the wfp therefore other factors that might affect the water footprint of crops should be explored in future studies as such work could provide more insights into how the water footprint of crop production could be reduced and regional water scarcity could be alleviated last but not least we would like to mention that the gray water footprint was not assessed in our study by definition gray water refers to the volume of freshwater required to dilute the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 the gray water footprint is often used to assess the environmental load of agricultural ecosystem induced by crop production which is not the actual water consumption xu et al 2015 zhao et al 2021a in this study we mainly paid attention to the consumptive water footprint of soybean production consequently the gray water footprint was not considered spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to explore the degree of spatial clustering or dispersion of wfp as this analysis has a rigorous mathematical basis this method provides more objective results that are superior to superficial descriptions of estimated values additionally the virtual scenarios were employed to distinguish the effects of various factors our results confirm the availability and practicability of these methods and provide valuable new insights into regional water management and the layout of soybean plantations the water footprint theory and our methods could be applied to other crops and major agricultural countries especially in water scarce regions our results coupled with regional water resources farmland distribution the production of other crops and food demand indicate that systematic and comprehensive studies are needed to formulate more detailed crop planting plans to achieve both water and food security in china 5 conclusions the annual water consumption for soybean production was between 24 62 g m3 and 34 32 g m3 in china and it first increased and then decreased over the period 1985 2015 wfp exhibited a clustered spatial distribution over the entire study area but the distribution of wfp at the county level tended to be more dispersed over the study period the high value areas for the wfp were primarily distributed in the northeast north central and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river regions which was similar to the distribution of wfp green the wfp green proportion decreased in northern areas whereas the wfp blue proportion increased in northern areas soybean yield was the most important factor affecting wfp as increases in soybean yield contributed to the decrease in wfp y from 2734 51 m3 t 1 to 1838 60 m3 t 1 with time further influenced the national wfp decreased by 50 75 g m3 in 2015 the above results provide new insights that could be used to optimize regional water management and achieve water security in china credit

making it the 6th most important crop globally after wheat rice corn potato and barley lebot 2008 and the 4th most important crop commodity in africa lópez lavalle et al 2021 the global production is estimated at around 300 million tonnes globally about 63 of cassava is produced in africa 28 in asia and 9 in the americas nigeria is the largest cassava producing country in the world with about 60

and livelihoods are dependent on cassava and with production increasing to keep pace with the increasing population prediction of both the effects of the environment and of agronomic management on cassava production has become crucial in addition to the growing population many regions and communities around the world are facing or will face water scarcity due to anthropogenic pressures and climate crisis there is a growing uncertainty regarding water availability for agriculture agriculture uses as high as 70 of global fresh water withdrawals making it the biggest consumer of water in this context fao developed the aquacrop simulation model to help consultants irrigation engineers agronomists non governmental organizations and even farm managers with the formulation and evaluation of guidelines to increase crop water productivity with improved agronomic practices raes et al 2009 this water driven crop model simulates the evolution of attainable crop biomass and harvestable yield based on soil water content in the root zone to facilitate the ease of use the aquacrop model only needs a relatively small number of parameters and mostly intuitive input variables steduto et al 2009 with the release of several versions of the model the calibration and validation of 15 important crops amongst others maize wheat rice soybean cotton etc was included steduto et al 2012 new crops and studies are continuously being added by a constantly enlarging aquacrop users community for crops such as cabbage kiptum et al 2013 wellens et al 2013 for irrigation strategies geerts et al 2010 or for simulations in batch mode to make regional field level maize yield estimates abdoul hamid et al 2019 however cassava is a major crop which has not yet been calibrated and validated for

predicts biomass and yield response to water fao chose a water driven growth engine since water is a crucial driver in agricultural production and often the limiting factor in attaining high yields another advantage of this water driven approach is the fine balance between its robustness accuracy and simplicity in formalization and parametrization geerts 2008 steduto et al 2009 steduto et al

not be determined using the available datasets table 6b the parameters of table 6 realistically represent cassava physiology and production system and are in line with the recent review by cock and connor 2021 firstly cassava has a relatively high photosynthetic rate among c3 crops hence the relatively high wp that was selected regarding the transpiration coefficient kc tr cock and connor 2021 provided evidence of substantial midday stomatal closure in response to vapour pressure deficit vpd in cassava under non limiting soil water and also reported a decoupling coefficient for cassava of 0 2 indicating strong control of transpiration via reduced canopy conductance therefore a kc tr below 1 0 was chosen to better simulate the regulation of transpiration by cassava canopies fig 1 confirms these parameter values for the ensemble of water unlimited fields biomass measurements normalized for co2 were plotted against the cumulative normalized transpiration with a regression line slope equivalent to the wp of 17 g m² and an r² of 0 97 finally by adding the water limited datasets the finetuning of stress coefficients led to the selection of a high threshold for the kssto value given the sensitivity of cassava stomata to water status cock and connor 2021 and references therein some simulation results taken from the calibration and validation datasets are presented in fig 2 the left side figures show the simulated black line vs observed fractional green canopy cover grey dots the water balance for each field is presented in the middle of fig 2 the depletion rate in the soil

along the growing season rainfall blue columns and or irrigation light green columns contributions are added as well the different water stress threshold levels are also shown if the depletion rate

biomass simulations black line vs observations grey dots along the growing season expressed in days after planting dap each line gives a comprehensive overview of the water soil plant interactions for each field at the moment for instance in the case of field mven 77 of 1978 colombia aquacrop was not fully able to simulate the canopy cover drop produced by leaf shedding because of prolonged drought clearly visible in the water balance but this drop in canopy activity is nevertheless very nicely translated in a pause of biomass production which is the final objective i e to simulate biomass and yield responses to water in sevekpota togo during the 2012 growing season the onset of a second growing cycle was from 220 to 240 days after planting soil moisture increases in the water balance and canopy cover also redevelops aquacrop is however not yet capable of simulating multiple cycles nevertheless given the differences in studied cases different varieties field managements and agro ecological regions aquacrop handled the crop simulations very well see figs 2 4 and table 7 fig 3 and table 7 show the calibration and validation results for simulated and observed final dry matter biomass calibration and validation yielded an r2 of 0 96 and 0 87 respectively the root mean square errors rmse and its variations were also satisfyingly low calibration and validation of the yield estimates were slightly more complicated fig 4 and table 7 given the different varieties in the colombian dataset it was not possible to find a single hi value the growth characteristics of these varieties differ with limited data per variety table 8 proposes a mean hio of 45 for the varieties grown in colombia indicative values for the different varieties are also given for the tme 419 variety hio of 60 of togo and nigeria in both cases results were good with a calibration r2 of 0 94 and a validation r2 of 0 95 3 2 discussion aquacrop has proven to be a robust and solid crop water productivity model requiring limited easily interpretable and obtainable data a unique cassava crop file was parametrized calibrated and validated for different varieties and agro ecological regions using first degree biomass and yield and second degree climate soil and canopy cover data the model also performed well in simulating biomass and yield obtained from other similar studies however standard deviations in the observed data were often missing and hence overall omitted available climate soil and canopy cover data were not fully adapted for aquacrop additional climate variables had to be downloaded from the nasa larc power site in order to calculate daily eto values which are critical in aquacrop nasa power satellite based data can replace missing weather data but caution must be taken as these data can sometimes be unreliable marzouk 2021 as for the soil data none of them contained saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat measurements only for some fields soil hydraulic properties were provided and the number of soil layers and their depths varied between the different datasets and even between fields within the same dataset however for all fields granulometric sand and clay mass distributions were given so all the needed soil hydraulic properties were derived in aquacrop using saxton transfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 and where needed soil profiles were simplified to a simple soil profile of 2 m depth fractional green canopy cover measurements were not available and had to be derived from measured light interception and lai for future fine tuning aerial image traits analysis offers promising results to directly assess fractional green canopy cover selvaraj et al 2020 despite all these simplifications the cassava simulations with aquacrop model performed well we expect this present paper will simulate further calibration efforts with additional experimental datasets in different environments to confirm or modify our proposed crop parameter file the crop stress factors could not be calibrated based on soil moisture measurements since they were not available however the most important components of the soil water balance were available in a detailed and accurate way to properly simulate it namely the i total available water taw in the root zone ii precipitation and or irrigation and iii crop transpiration aquacrop expresses the impact of water limitation as a fraction of taw the difference between water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point in the root zone steduto et al 2012 these soil hydraulic properties including saturated hydraulic conductivity were derived for each field by means of pedotransfer functions precipitation was measured daily in rain gauges near the different fields and irrigation doses and dates were specified if applied crop transpiration was correctly calibrated as shown priorly in fig 1 as a consequence the crop stress factors were indirectly estimated from soil water balance simulations and visual interpretation of canopy cover and biomass evolutions nevertheless soil moisture observations could have improved the calibration and validation of these stress factors harvest index hi was only calibrated and validated for the tme 419 variety for the cassava varieties grown in colombia storage root yields varied widely among different varieties so no satisfactory single hi could be proposed for this ensemble of varieties in aquacrop a reference hi hio is variety dependent but there were not enough observations for each variety to assess the specific hio values of the different varieties however since aquacrop calculates storage root yield from biomass at the end of the growing season and not per intermediate harvest along the growing season these parameters can be easily obtained by minor additional field measurements by those wanting to further adapt the present cassava crop file for their specific varieties the actual version of aquacrop does not yet simulate cassava s typical multiple growing cycles with intermediate dormancy except for the nigerian data none of the datasets covered multiple growing cycles the simulation of these fields was stopped during the dormancy phase for the other and major part of the fields simulations ran until harvest covering one growing cycle an option could have been to parametrize an additional crop file to simulate this second growing cycle as was done for sugarcane by wellens et al 2020 presently there is not enough data available to properly calibrate and validate such a second growth cassava crop file though every model has its advantages and disadvantages strengths and weaknesses aquacrop stacked up very successfully with other existing cassava models the manihot cassava model incorporated in dssat and originally developed on the veltkamp 1985 dataset obtained an average biomass rmse of 3 3 tonnes dm ha for some of the varieties used mcol 1684 mcol 22 mptr 26 and mven 77 moreno cardena 2018 and also for one growing cycle using the parameter rich lintul cassava model ezui et al 2018 obtained an overall r² close to 1 and an nrmse of 6 6 for total biomass production and 5 8 for final storage roots yield their work concentrated on 4 trials in southern togo with the same tme 419 variety but for two growing cycles adiele et al 2021 recalibrated lintul cassava model and validated it using data obtained from 5 different fields with the same tme 419 an r² of 0 92 and a rmse of 4 93 tonnes dm ha was attained for the storage root yields at 4 months after planting map vegetative period 8 map mid season and at final harvest 4 conclusion increasing yield and water use efficiency is becoming increasingly important when cultivating crops in climate change vulnerable regions in this context aquacrop was calibrated and validated for cassava a single crop file was able to cover different varieties and agro ecological regions for some cases minor and easily obtainable modifications might be needed to better adapt the crop file to local conditions albeit based on different qualitative datasets a rigorous calibration and validation procedure was successfully achieved also it was shown that missing data replaced from third parties or data conversion transfer procedure had almost no impact on the final simulations the resulting crop file can be applied with confidence in further studies concentrating on improved water and or field management to produce more crop with every drop and so be an important new tool in mitigating the impact of a changing climate on cassava production

making it the 6th most important crop globally after wheat rice corn potato and barley lebot 2008 and the 4th most important crop commodity in africa lópez lavalle et al 2021 the global production is estimated at around 300 million tonnes globally about 63 of cassava is produced in africa 28 in asia and 9 in the americas nigeria is the largest cassava producing country in the world with about 60 million tonnes fresh storage root yield togo is ranked 30th on a list of 98 cassava producing countries with about 1 million tonnes paraguay is the highest ranked south american cassava producing country at 20th position on the list with about 3 5 million tonnes colombia ranks 32nd producing about 1 million tonnes of fresh storage root yield faostat 2021 as numerous communities food security and livelihoods are dependent on cassava and with production increasing to keep pace with the increasing population prediction of both the effects of the environment and of agronomic management on cassava production has become crucial in addition to the growing population many regions and communities around the world are facing or will face water scarcity due to anthropogenic pressures and climate crisis there is a growing uncertainty regarding water availability for agriculture agriculture uses as high as 70 of global fresh water withdrawals making it the biggest consumer of water in this context fao developed the aquacrop simulation model to help consultants irrigation engineers agronomists non governmental organizations and even farm managers with the formulation and evaluation of guidelines to increase crop water productivity with improved agronomic practices raes et al 2009 this water driven crop model simulates the evolution of attainable crop biomass and harvestable yield based on soil water content in the root zone to facilitate the ease of use the aquacrop model only needs a relatively small number of parameters and mostly intuitive input variables steduto et al 2009 with the release of several versions of the model the calibration and validation of 15 important crops amongst others maize wheat rice soybean cotton etc was included steduto et al 2012 new crops and studies are continuously being added by a constantly enlarging aquacrop users community for crops such as cabbage kiptum et al 2013 wellens et al 2013 for irrigation strategies geerts et al 2010 or for simulations in batch mode to make regional field level maize yield estimates abdoul hamid et al 2019 however cassava is a major crop which has not yet been calibrated and validated for aquacrop some well known models have already been adapted successfully for cassava the manihot model integrated in the dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer package hoogenboom et

development and improvement of these models were shared to also calibrate and validate aquacrop these data are again briefly presented as part of this study for more detailed information the reader is

predicts biomass and yield response to water fao chose a water driven growth engine since water is a crucial driver in agricultural production and often the limiting factor in attaining high yields another advantage of this water driven approach is the fine balance between its robustness accuracy and simplicity in formalization and parametrization geerts 2008 steduto et al 2009 steduto et al 2012 actual crop transpiration tr is translated into biomass b through a crop specific water productivity wp parameter eq 1 steduto 2003 the wp exhibits a conservative behaviour when it is normalised wp for evaporative demand and for co2 concentration steduto et al 2007 the harvestable yield y is portioned from the biomass by means of another crop or variety specific parameter defined as the harvest index hi eq 2 1 b wp σ tr 2 y hi b furthermore the leaf area index lai the usual indicator of canopy size in other crop models has been replaced by the more straightforward fractional green canopy cover cc fractional coverage of green cover per unit of soil to modulate crop transpiration and as a consequence biomass production crop responses to water stress are taken into account by

not be determined using the available datasets table 6b the parameters of table 6 realistically represent cassava physiology and production system and are in line with the recent review by cock and connor 2021 firstly cassava has a relatively high photosynthetic rate among c3 crops hence the relatively high wp that was selected regarding the transpiration coefficient kc tr cock and connor 2021 provided evidence of substantial midday stomatal closure in response to vapour pressure deficit vpd in cassava under non limiting soil water and also reported a decoupling coefficient for cassava of 0 2 indicating strong control of transpiration via reduced canopy conductance therefore a kc tr below 1 0 was chosen to better simulate the regulation of transpiration by cassava canopies fig 1 confirms these parameter values for the ensemble of water unlimited fields biomass measurements normalized for co2 were plotted against the cumulative normalized transpiration with a regression line slope equivalent to the wp of 17 g m² and an r² of 0 97 finally by adding the water limited datasets the finetuning of stress coefficients led to the selection of a high threshold for the kssto value given the sensitivity of cassava stomata to water status cock and connor 2021 and references therein some simulation results taken from the calibration and validation datasets are presented in fig 2 the left side figures show the simulated black line vs observed fractional green canopy cover grey dots the water balance for each field is presented in the middle of fig 2 the depletion rate in the soil profile black line is depicted against the depletion rates at field capacity i e 0 and permanent wilting point grey lines the potential and actual depletion rates increase with root zone development along the growing season rainfall blue columns and or irrigation light green columns contributions are added as well the different water stress threshold levels are also shown if the depletion rate drops below these thresholds water stress kicks in affecting canopy development green threshold line stomatal closure red line and early senescence orange line on the right are presented dry matter biomass simulations black line vs observations grey dots along the growing season expressed in days after planting dap each line gives a comprehensive overview of the water soil plant interactions for each field at the moment for instance in the case of field mven 77 of 1978 colombia aquacrop was not fully able to simulate the canopy cover drop produced by leaf shedding because of prolonged drought clearly visible in the water balance but this drop in canopy activity is nevertheless very nicely translated in a pause of biomass production which is the final objective i e to simulate biomass and yield responses to water in sevekpota togo during the 2012 growing season the onset of a second growing cycle was from 220 to 240 days after planting soil moisture increases in the water balance and canopy cover also redevelops aquacrop is however not yet capable of simulating multiple cycles nevertheless given the differences in studied cases different varieties field managements and agro ecological regions aquacrop handled the crop simulations very well see figs 2 4 and table 7 fig 3 and table 7 show the calibration and validation results for simulated and observed final dry matter biomass calibration and validation yielded an r2 of 0 96 and 0 87 respectively the root mean square errors rmse and its variations were also satisfyingly low calibration and validation of the yield estimates were slightly more complicated fig 4 and table 7 given the different varieties in the colombian dataset it was not possible to find a single hi value the growth characteristics of these varieties differ with limited data per variety table 8 proposes a mean hio of 45 for the varieties grown in colombia indicative values for the different varieties are also given for the tme 419 variety hio of 60 of togo and nigeria in both cases results were good with a calibration r2 of 0 94 and a validation r2 of 0 95 3 2 discussion aquacrop has proven to be a robust and solid crop water productivity model requiring limited easily interpretable and obtainable data a unique cassava crop file was parametrized calibrated and validated for different varieties and agro ecological regions using first degree biomass and yield and second degree climate soil and canopy cover data the model also performed well in simulating biomass and yield obtained from other similar studies however standard deviations in the observed data were often missing and hence overall omitted available climate soil and canopy cover data were not fully adapted for aquacrop additional climate variables had to be downloaded from the nasa larc power site in order to calculate daily eto values which are critical in aquacrop nasa power satellite based data can replace missing weather data but caution must be taken as these data can sometimes be unreliable marzouk 2021 as for the soil data none of them contained saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat measurements only for some fields soil hydraulic properties were provided and the number of soil layers and their depths varied between the different datasets and even between fields within the same dataset however for all fields granulometric sand and clay mass distributions were given so all the needed soil hydraulic properties were derived in aquacrop using saxton transfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 and where needed soil profiles were simplified to a simple soil profile of 2 m depth fractional green canopy cover measurements were not available and had to be derived from measured light interception and lai for future fine tuning aerial image traits analysis offers promising results to directly assess fractional green canopy cover selvaraj et al 2020 despite all these simplifications the cassava simulations with aquacrop model performed well we expect this present paper will simulate further calibration efforts with additional experimental datasets in different environments to confirm or modify our proposed crop parameter file the crop stress factors could not be calibrated based on soil moisture measurements since they were not available however the most important components of the soil water balance were available in a detailed and accurate way to properly simulate it namely the i total available water taw in the root zone ii precipitation and or irrigation and iii crop transpiration aquacrop expresses the impact of water limitation as a fraction of taw the difference between water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point in the root zone steduto et al 2012 these soil hydraulic properties including saturated hydraulic conductivity were derived for each field by means of pedotransfer functions precipitation was measured daily in rain gauges near the different fields and irrigation doses and dates were specified if applied crop transpiration was correctly calibrated as shown priorly in fig 1 as a consequence the crop stress factors were indirectly estimated from soil water balance simulations and visual interpretation of canopy cover and biomass evolutions nevertheless soil moisture observations could have improved the calibration and validation of these stress factors harvest index hi was only calibrated and validated for the tme 419 variety for the cassava varieties grown in colombia storage root yields varied widely among different varieties so no satisfactory single hi could be proposed for this ensemble of varieties in aquacrop a reference hi hio is variety dependent but there were not enough observations for each variety to assess the specific hio values of the different varieties however since aquacrop calculates storage root yield from biomass at the end of the growing season and not per intermediate harvest along the growing season these parameters can be easily obtained by minor additional field measurements by those wanting to further adapt the present cassava crop file for their specific varieties the actual version of aquacrop does not yet simulate cassava s typical multiple growing cycles with intermediate dormancy except for the nigerian data none of the datasets covered multiple growing cycles the simulation of these fields was stopped during the dormancy phase for the other and major part of the fields simulations ran until harvest covering one growing cycle an option could have been to parametrize an additional crop file to simulate this second growing cycle as was done for sugarcane by wellens et al 2020 presently there is not enough data available to properly calibrate and validate such a second growth cassava crop file though every model has its advantages and disadvantages strengths and weaknesses aquacrop stacked up very successfully with other existing cassava models the manihot cassava model incorporated in dssat and originally developed on the veltkamp 1985 dataset obtained an average biomass rmse of 3 3 tonnes dm ha for some of the varieties used mcol 1684 mcol 22 mptr 26 and mven 77 moreno cardena 2018 and also for one growing cycle using the parameter rich lintul cassava model ezui et al 2018 obtained an overall r² close to 1 and an nrmse of 6 6 for total biomass production and 5 8 for final storage roots yield their work concentrated on 4 trials in southern togo with the same tme 419 variety but for two growing cycles adiele et al 2021 recalibrated lintul cassava model and validated it using data obtained from 5 different fields with the same tme 419 an r² of 0 92 and a rmse of 4 93 tonnes dm ha was attained for the storage root yields at 4 months after planting map vegetative period 8 map mid season and at final harvest 4 conclusion increasing yield and water use efficiency is becoming increasingly important when cultivating crops in climate change vulnerable regions in this context aquacrop was calibrated and validated for cassava a single crop file was able to cover different varieties and agro ecological regions for some cases minor and easily obtainable modifications might be needed to better adapt the crop file to local conditions albeit based on different qualitative datasets a rigorous calibration and validation procedure was successfully achieved also it was shown that missing data replaced from third parties or data conversion transfer procedure had almost no impact on the final simulations the resulting crop file can be applied with confidence in further studies concentrating on improved water and or field management to produce more crop with every drop and so be an important new tool in mitigating the impact of a changing climate on cassava production

9664,this work was initiated in 2019 within the fao weps project framework 2018 2022 aiming to determine the water productivity wp of the tunisian olive orchards combining two scales of measurements for soil moisture determination one for the global analysis remote sensing and the other for the field scale application the experiment was made in 2019 and 2020 in the centre of tunisia kairouan city locality of elhouereb which is one of the largest irrigation area of tunisia wp was computed regarding the actual crop evapotranspiration eta which was determined following the water balance method as eta r i δs where δs is the amount of water stored in the soil 0 60 cm and r and i are the amounts of the seasonal rainfall and the irrigation volume respectively the annual eta reached 293 mm for the rainfed orchard 823 mm for the semi intensive irrigated plantation and 819 mm for the intensive fertigated orchard the wp defined as being the ratio of yield kg olives tree eta ranged between 0 29 kg m3 rainfed and 0 77 kg m3 fertigated depending on the cultivation system soil moisture was found to be correlated to the average backscatter coefficient r 0 34 for the rainfed and 0 91 for the irrigated orchards which was determined from the radar images which were treated by using different applications snap odk qgis this result shows the performance of the remote sensing tools for such application to conclude wp is at least two times higher in the irrigated orchards than in the rainfed grove this indicates a great potential of wp improvement if the horticultural practices are well applied in the orchad pruning irrigation so that the wp can be used as a decision making tool for farmers and makers in the future keywords olea europaea sentinel images actual evapotranspiration backscatter coefficient correlation 1 introduction olive is largely cultivated around the mediterranean basin spain italy and tunisia provide more than 70 of the olive oil world production i o c 2020 international olive council i o c 2020 in tunisia most olive orchards are rainfed and growing under semi arid and arid climates in this area low yield 0 7 ton ha is recorded due to the use of the traditional horticultural practices for these reasons many research fields were carried out during the last decades to assess the responses of olive trees to water application with the main objective the increase of olive and oil production increasing the yield of the olive plantations with less water use is also the major objective of the f a o which is concerned by the food security all over the world and particularly in the arid and semi arid areas like in north africa where water becomes the most limiting factor for olive and wheat productions according to many papers substantial increase of yield may be attained if the correct amounts of water and the efficient irrigation equipment and practices are used pastor et al 2007 molden et al 2010 ahumada orellana et al 2017 masmoudi charfi et al 2021 in these papers results showed that the reconversion of the irrigated areas introduction of mechanization irrigation and the use of the regulated deficit irrigation rdi and the partial root drying prd are found to increase the yield of the olive orchards and their water productivity wp which is defined as being the ratio of yield per unit of water applied to the crop food and agriculture organization fao 2002 in tunisia for example the di regimes showed significant improvement of the wp which increases from 0 42 1 5 kg m3 rainfed to 1 6 3 9 kg m3 irrigated olive orchards the lowest wp was recorded for most studied varieties at the full irrigation regime masmoudi charfi et al 2010 2021 determination of wp needs an accurate measure of the actual evapotranspiration eta this is the main problem facing the scientists working on olive which is characterized by a discontinuous and variable soil cover the eta can be obtained at field level through the establishment of the water balance wb which is a labor and time consuming approach mostly used with research purposes rather than for optimizing the crop water use in the commercial orchards although it is a suitable approach for estimating the fraction of water used by the crop and that stored in the soil palomo et al 2002 masmoudi charfi and ben mechlia 2012 many works allen et al 2007 filion 2015 gorrab 2016 gao et al 2017 zribi et al 2020 showed that the combination of this approach with the use of remote sensing provided accurate estimates of the crop yield and the soil moisture at the same time it makes the field work easier baghdadi et al 2010 used the multi date sentinel1 images in synergy with the landsat 8 optical data to evaluate the soil and the biomass characteristics amongst the backscatter coefficient which is derived from the radar images and used to measure the retro diffused signal of a certain source soil via the radar the backscatter coefficient varies from 5 db for clear surfaces to 40 db for dark surfaces depending on the characteristics of the soil surface gorrab 2016 according to filion 2015 the statistic relationship between the backscatter coefficient and the geo physical parameters of the soil is linear zribi et al 2020 find that for soils with soil moisture higher than 35 the radar signal evolves according to a logarithmic function as the soil moisture increases and a linear function when the soil moisture varies between 10 and 30 this work was carried out within the framework of the fao weps project implementing the 2030 agenda for water efficiency productivity and water sustainability in mena countries gcp rne 009 swe 2019 2020 considering the main olive cultivation systems of the centre of tunisia in this paper we adopted a combined approach to i provide a satisfactory classified map of the lc of the studied area and to identify the area cultivated with olive trees ii to determine the olive tree water consumption eta based on the water balance approach and the wp of the rainfed and irrigated olive plantations and finally iii to provide a practical tool backscatter coefficient derived from the satellite images that allows accurate estimates of the soil moisture the main objective of this study originality of this work is to combine different scales of measurements and to establish certain relationships between the data provided by the satellite images and those measured at field level in order to determine a support decision system based on remote sensing which can be widely used in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sites of experiments the irrigated area of elhouareb is localized in the centre of tunisia lat 35 40 686 n long 10 5 7798 e kairouan city it is a large plain where arid climate prevails with average annual

cereals 300 ha olive trees 870 ha and vegetables are the main crops cultivated in this area which is deserved by the dam of elhouareb crda kairouan 2019 intensive and hyper intensive olive plantations are irrigated from this dam and the borehole water is used when the dam water is not available the orchardists stop irrigating their plantations between november harvest and january pruning period in this area of great interest many research projects were made during the last 15 years mergusi bird ird the study began with a survey by using a questioner sheet provided by the fao based on a list of some objective criteria accessibility to the orchard security management of the olive grove willingness of the farmer to collaborate and his training level availability of the orchard s historical data and the survey results three olive orchards two are irrigation and the third is rainfed of cv chemlali were considered for the experiment representing each a main farming system of this region fig 1 in the first orchard n 35 34 57 e 9 50 11 olive trees are planted at 278 trees ha on sandy loam clay soil 50 l 21 c with no ploughing it was fertigated daily each tree received annually 2 kg of nitrogen supplied from march to october 1 kg of p2o5 applied from march to july and 4 kg of p2o5 given from may to october the second orchard n35 33 38 e 9 49 26 is semi intensive trees are cultivated

at 10m 10m spacing on sandy loam soil with biennial supply of 20 kg tree of manure soil was tilled regularly in each orchard three homogeneous trees were considered for field monitoring the average climatic data of the studied area table 1 were used to establish the irrigation programs 65 et et is the crop evapotranspiration which were compared to those practiced by the orchardists at the end of the experiment the farmer field school approach was adopted to disseminate the horticultural practices that we recommended to the orchardists to improve their wp with the support of the regional agricultural development offices 2 2 acquisition of the satellite images and pre treatments the first step of the work was the establishment of the land cover map lc of the study area of elhouereb considering 200 gps points acquired in june 10 12th 2019 fig 1 the polarimetric spatial data from sentinel1 and sentinel2 satellite images were downloaded in june july september and october 2019by using the s 1a sensor source https scihub copernicus eu dhus home the sentinel1 data were downloaded from the esa s copernicus open access hub https scihub copernicus eu dhus home for the year 2018 2019 band frequency with a spatial resolution of 10 m in dual polarizations vv and vh operating with a c band frequency of 5 4 ghz the mode chosen for our study is the interferometric wide swath iw the size of each image is 3227pixels in linex2917pixels in column and is coded on 16bits they were used for regular soil moisture estimation by the means of a multi temporal analysis consisting of a multi time surveillance of the water content at the soil surface the radar images sentinel 2 are available in the slc or grd formats they were used to determine the soil surface moisture images are preliminary corrected to avoid errors related to sensor sensitivity and geometric distortions by using the snap application and the geo referencing these steps are necessary to provide a precise location of each pixel in the image and offer the possibility to integrate all data in the same cartographic projection system 32632wgs84 utm zone 32 n the applications used to acquire and pre treat the sentinel1 images and the determination of the backscatter coefficients after a long chain of radiometric pre processing calibration and filtration are detailed in the following section to determine the land characteristics some descriptors are computed expressed in terms of energy and in l1 standard from the sub bands classification of the sentinel1 polarimetric images was made by using the minimum distance criterion with the multivariate approach based on the principal component analysis pca the vv and vh polarization images are de correlated the steps followed to pre tread the radar images are detailed below 1 sampling of the gps points by the odk application application on android in which we load the geotagged tci image and the form that we will fill in when acquiring the gps points by using the tci composite image of sentinel2 06 06 2019 composed from the red bands b04 green b03 and blue b02 which is converted so that it can be opened on the odk application a form provided by the fao was installed on the odk application and used to identify the different existing soil occupations as well as the horticultural practices the odk briefcase application installed on the pc was used for data processing to convert the data recorded on odk into xlm file 2 the field xml format data files were then transferred from the android to the pc and placed in the same directory as the odk briefcase application to convert the data to the csv format files then into a shp file by using the qgis software maping the gps points taken during the field trip so that the georeferenced points can be superimposed on the sentinel2 image of the study area 2 3 soil moisture determination soil moisture was determined considering two simultaneous spatial scales i the satellite images of elhouereb area which were downloaded from june to october 2019and 2 the gravimetric measurements soil sampling which were made at field level to 0 6 m depth for each orchard there are three replicates 3 olive trees 2 3 1 field measurements soil measurements were performed in each orchard during the fruit growing season in 2019 and in 2020 soil moisture hv was determined considering gravimetric soil samples taken at 20 40 and 60 cm depth in two sites under the canopies of the tagged trees and between the rows of trees with maximum depth of 60 cm soil moisture hv and soil water content s mm are computed considering equations eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 as follows 1 hm fw dw dw 2 hv da hm and 3 s 10xdxhv where fw and dw g are the fresh and dry weights of the soil samples hm is the massic soil moisture hv is the average volumetric soil moisture of each orchard 3 olive trees da is the actual soil density and d m is the depth at which the sampling was done the water balance wb was established for each orchard at both sites considering different time periods and from which we deduced the actual evapotranspiration eta considering equation eq 4 eta r i δs where δs is the amount of water stored in the soil 0 60 cm during a certain period and r and i are the amounts of the seasonal rainfall and the irrigation volume respectively recorded for the same period herein we note that as the watered orchards are drip irrigated at optimal seasonal value comparison between our calendars and those used by the orchardists we considered that there is no water percolation 2 3 2 satellite data based on sentinel1 images the soil moisture was determined by using the multi date polarimetric data and several tools such as the color composition the principal component analysis pca and entropy these methods allow monitoring of the soil moisture over time based on the polarimetric images other methods have been tested using the statistical approach including the calculation of the means and the variances of the backscattering in the vv and vh polarizations then the sentinel1 data were pre processed by using the sentinel application platform snap geometric correction speckle filtering and radiometric correction of images to determine the backscatter coefficient as follow i the calibration step allows the conversion of the signal recorded by the sensor into backscatter coefficient ii the geometric corrections geo referencing step uses the digital elevation model dem proposed by the nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm iii the thermal noise removal step uses the lee filter the sub images were extracted from the vh and vv polarization images the backscatter coefficient σ derived from the radar images is used to measure the retro diffused signal of a certain source via the radar i e the received and the emitted energy and expressed following gorrab 2016 2 4 water productivity wp determination at harvest the individual olive production y kg tree is determined for each tree and then averaged for each orchard water productivity is determined as follows wp kg m3 y kg of olives tree eta m3water tree eq 5 2 5 determination of the backscatter coefficient and correlation with the soil moisture the radar backscatter coefficients are determined at different dates from the sentinel1 imagesby using the software envi 4 7 extract the statistics of the signal level backscattered on the images and then averaged and correlated to the soil moisture to do this task the field data in shape files format representing the test orchards are superimposed on the radar images and then converted into regions of interest roi in order to extract the statistic characteristics of the radar signal for each orchard on each of the images processed using the roi stat command under the envi 4 7 software it is important to precise here that the iw s1 images recorded in both polarizations are used to estimate the soil moisture they were generated at high resolution and level1 ground range https sentinel esa int web sentinel user guides sentinel 1 sar product types processing levels level 1 to localize the studied orchards a sentinel 2b image is downloaded in june 2019 and used as a support tool to the gps points the same resolution 10mx10m is used for thesentinel1 and sentinel2 images 3 results and discussion 3 1 field measurement actual evapotranspiration eta and water productivity wp determination table 2 presents the field measurements made on each orchard considering three olive trees per orchard orchard 2 has the highest average record for olive production orchard 3 was the less productive one and presented very low soil water contents sandy loam soil soil water content measured at the end of irrigation season sf was higher than that observed at the beginning of the irrigation season in orchard 1 and orchard 2 during the year 2019 but it was lower than the si in 2020 eta increased between 2019 on year and 2020 off year about 1 7 to x2 1 time depending on the orchard values reached in average 819 mm year in orchard 1 fertigated 823 mm in orchard 2 irrigated and 293 mm in the rainfed orchard water consumption was about three times higher in the irrigated orchards than in the rainfed orchard i e eta irrigated orchard 2 8 eta rainfed orchard for the same orchard eta measured under the canopies of the olive trees showed little variation cv 10 however the measurements showed a significant variability when the samplings are made between the rows of trees data not shown and particularly for orchard 2 where trees are planted at larger spacing in comparison to orchard 1 water productivity kg of olives m3 eta was computed with regard to the eta values table 2 results showed significant differences between the irrigated orchards 1 and 2 and between the irrigated orchards and the rainfed orchard wp is 2 1 times higher in orchard 1 0 77 kg m3 than in orchard 2 0 37 kg m3 i e wp ferti irrigated orchard 2 1 wp irrigated orchard due to fertigation and the higher tree density wp is 2 7 times higher in orchard 1 than in orchard 3 0 29 kg m3 i e wp ferti irrigated orchard 2 7 wp rainfed orchard variability between trees is higher in orchard 2 than in orchard 1 and orchard 3 which is rainfed and fertilized occasionally results obtained for experiment corroborate previous works made in tunisia masmoudi charfi et al 2021 spain salvador et al 2011 and morocco hadiddou et al 2013 balaghi 2014 indicating the existence of a real potential of wp improvement for the olive orchards most research works showed that olive trees respond favorably and rapidly to water supplies even when low amounts of water are used irrigation at optimal amount comparison between orchard 1 and 3 and the correct management of water i e daily drip irrigation comparison orchard 1 and orchard 2 are essential to attain high wp in addition high tree density intensification of the orchard is important to consider if water is available comparison between orchard 1 and orchard 2 so that we can consider that orchard 2 and the semi intensive irrigated system in general is less efficient eue 0 43 than the intensive system 1 06 the amount of water used by each tree is very important and great amounts of water are lost through the soil water evaporation process e which was found to represent about 53 of the eta values for intensive olive trees and more for the extensive systems masmoudi charfi et al 2010 so that the orchards can be classified as follows orchard 1 orchard 2 orchard 1 orchard 1 is the most efficient one in average it uses less water and provided more fruits 3 2 values of the backscatter coefficient and correlation with the soil water content the backscatter coefficients were determined in 2019 values are highly dependent on soil moisture polarization and the site of measure under or between the rows of trees the vv backscatter coefficient evolves between 10 and 14db from june to october the highest most negative coefficients are recorded for both polarizations in the rainfed orchard orchard 3 due to the low soil moisture during the months of august and september σ decreases for all orchards in response to rainwater supplies 99 mm from 30 7 2019 27 9 2019 which increases soil moisture orchard 1 has the highest values of σ 10db and it is the least affected 0 5 1 db by the rainfall due to regular daily irrigation tree spacing is lower than in orchard 2 and the rows between trees and the canopies are highly shaded in orchard 2 σ has intermediate values between 11 and 12 db and shows greater variability 1 1 5db than in orchard 1 there trees and rows are completely exposed to sunlight irrigation is applied at the same amount but twice a week only orchard 3 has the lowest values of σ between 12 and 14db and it was the most affected orchard even during the rainy period the vh backscatter coefficient evolves between 22 and 16db from june to october the highest 16db and the lowest between 20 and 22 db values are observed for orchard 1 and 3 respectively during the rainy period the radar signal increases for orchards 1 and 3 due to the increase of the leaf turgor the development of new vegetation the canopy structure and the shoot distribution which depolarizes the radar signal orchard 1 is the least affected orchard 1 5 2 db by the rainwater table 3 shows the backscatter coefficients following the vh and vv polarizations for orchard 1 orchard 2 and orchard 3 table 3 shows the depolarization ratio σ vh vv computed for all orchards the variability of this ratio 2 4 db depends on the orchard surface soil doughtiness tree spacing and if the soil is tilled or not and varies from 1 46 to 1 90 from june to october the lowest values of σ vh vv are recorded for orchard 3 from the backscatter coefficient values σ 0 obtained at vv and vh polarizations and from the ratio of σ 0 vh vv we can see that the vegetation depolarizes the signal reflects the roughness effect of the vegetation the radar signal is more intense on the vh than on the vv polarization for all orchards however the wetter the soil the stronger is the radar signal the slope of the σ 0 vh vv curves as a function of the image acquisition dates established for the three orchards increases with the water input the greater the amount of water brought to the orchard the steeper is the slop the use of the remote sensing for soil water content determination showed the performance of this tool for such aim this corroborates allen et al 2007 according to whom the satellite multi spectral measurements allow accurate determination of the soil water content and exclude the need to have access to in situ soil moisture data and samplings however as it is necessary to improve our correlations the number of field measures should be increased the results showed the importance of the site and depth of measures and soil sampling in such work and also the polarization of the images for the irrigated orchards the correlation coefficients found between hv and the backscatter coefficients are positive for the following combinations vv polarization sampling made at the depth of 0 20 cm and vh polarization sampling made at 0 60 cm in the rainfed orchard r is positive for the vv polarization and negative for the vh polarization both for the depth of 0 60 cm comparison between the vv and vh polarizations σ vh vv as a function of the rainfall variation showed the impact of the biomass increases and the soil surface structure this ratio may increase or decrease in the same orchard depending on how the orchard is managed state of tillage soil texture planting density in addition results show that by a judicious choice of certain parameters optimal filters it is possible to achieve higher rates of identification in our case 5 land use masks were developed by the tkl providing rates of identification greater than 57 3 3 correlation between the backscatter coefficients and the soil water content the relationships between the backscatter coefficients values σ 0 and the soil moisture measured at different depths 0 20 cm 0 60 cm are presented as follows table 4 1 the correlation is negative and significative when the relationship is established between the backscatter coefficients derived from the radar images and the hv measures for orchard1 under the canopies of trees at 20 cm depth r 0 46 considering the vh polarization and under the canopy of the trees at 60 cm depth r 0 46 following the vv polarization orchard3 between the row of trees at 20 cm depth r 0 99 considering the vh polarization and for both sites at 60 cm depth considering the vh polarization r 0 32 under the canopy and r 0 98 between the rows of trees 2 the correlation is positive and

9664,this work was initiated in 2019 within the fao weps project framework 2018 2022 aiming to determine the water productivity wp of the tunisian olive orchards combining two scales of measurements for soil moisture determination one for the global analysis remote sensing and the other for the field scale application the experiment was made in 2019 and 2020 in the centre of tunisia kairouan city locality of elhouereb which is one of the largest irrigation area of tunisia wp was computed regarding the actual crop evapotranspiration eta which was determined following the water balance method as eta r i δs where δs is the amount of water stored in the soil 0 60 cm and r and i are the amounts of the seasonal rainfall and the irrigation volume respectively the annual eta reached 293 mm for the rainfed orchard 823 mm for the semi intensive irrigated plantation and 819 mm for the intensive fertigated orchard the wp defined as being the ratio of yield kg olives tree eta ranged between 0 29 kg m3 rainfed and 0 77 kg m3 fertigated depending on the cultivation system soil moisture was found to be correlated to the average backscatter coefficient r 0 34 for the rainfed and 0 91 for the irrigated orchards which was determined from the radar images which were treated by using different applications snap odk qgis this result shows the performance of the remote sensing tools for such application to conclude wp is at least two times higher in the irrigated orchards than in the rainfed grove this indicates a great potential of wp improvement if the horticultural practices are well applied in the orchad pruning irrigation so that the wp can be used as a decision making tool for farmers and makers in the future keywords olea europaea sentinel images actual evapotranspiration backscatter coefficient correlation 1 introduction olive is largely cultivated around the mediterranean basin spain italy and tunisia provide more than 70 of the olive oil world production i o c 2020 international olive council i o c 2020 in tunisia most olive orchards are rainfed and growing under semi arid and arid climates in this area low yield 0 7 ton ha is recorded due to the use of the traditional horticultural practices for these reasons many research fields were carried out during the last decades to assess the responses of olive trees to water application with the main objective the increase of olive and oil production increasing the yield of the olive plantations with less water use is also the major objective of the f a o which is concerned by the food security all over the world and particularly in the arid and semi arid areas like in north africa where water becomes the most limiting factor for olive and wheat productions according to many papers substantial increase of yield may be attained if the correct amounts of water and the efficient irrigation equipment and practices are used pastor et al 2007 molden et al 2010 ahumada orellana et al 2017 masmoudi charfi et al 2021 in these papers results showed that the reconversion of the irrigated areas introduction of mechanization irrigation and the use of the regulated deficit irrigation rdi and the partial root drying prd are found to increase the yield of the olive orchards and their water productivity wp which is defined as being the ratio of yield per unit of water applied to the crop food and agriculture organization fao 2002 in tunisia for example the di regimes showed significant improvement of the wp which increases from 0 42 1 5 kg m3 rainfed to 1 6 3 9 kg m3 irrigated olive orchards the lowest wp was recorded for most studied varieties at the full irrigation regime masmoudi charfi et al 2010 2021 determination of wp needs an accurate measure of the actual evapotranspiration eta this is the main problem facing the scientists working on olive which is characterized by a discontinuous and variable soil cover the eta can be obtained at field level through the establishment of the water balance wb which is a labor and time consuming approach mostly used with research purposes rather than for optimizing the crop water use in the commercial orchards although it is a suitable approach for estimating the fraction of water used by the crop and that stored in the soil palomo et al 2002 masmoudi charfi and ben mechlia 2012 many works allen et al 2007 filion 2015 gorrab 2016 gao et al 2017 zribi et al 2020 showed that the combination of this approach with the use of remote sensing provided accurate estimates of the crop yield and the soil moisture at the same time it makes the field work easier baghdadi et al 2010 used the multi date sentinel1 images in synergy with the landsat 8 optical data to evaluate the soil and the biomass characteristics amongst the backscatter coefficient which is derived from the radar images and used to measure the retro diffused signal of a certain source soil via the radar the backscatter coefficient varies from 5 db for clear surfaces to 40 db for dark surfaces depending on the characteristics of the soil surface gorrab 2016 according to filion 2015 the statistic relationship between the backscatter coefficient and the geo physical parameters of the soil is linear zribi et al 2020 find that for soils with soil moisture higher than 35 the radar signal evolves according to a logarithmic function as the soil moisture increases and a linear function when the soil moisture varies between 10 and 30 this work was carried out within the framework of the fao weps project implementing the 2030 agenda for water efficiency productivity and water sustainability in mena countries gcp rne 009 swe 2019 2020 considering the main olive cultivation systems of the centre of tunisia in this paper we adopted a combined approach to i provide a satisfactory classified map of the lc of the studied area and to identify the area cultivated with olive trees ii to determine the olive tree water consumption eta based on the water balance approach and the wp of the rainfed and irrigated olive plantations and finally iii to provide a practical tool backscatter coefficient derived from the satellite images that allows accurate estimates of the soil moisture the main objective of this study originality of this work is to combine different scales of measurements and to establish certain relationships between the data provided by the satellite images and those measured at field level in order to determine a support decision system based on remote sensing which can be widely used in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sites of experiments the irrigated area of elhouareb is localized in the centre of tunisia lat 35 40 686 n long 10 5 7798 e kairouan city it is a large plain where arid climate prevails with average annual rainfall 1980 2020 of 385 2 mm source https fr tutiempo net climat ws 607350 html the penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto reached 1346 mm in 2019 and 1359 mm in 2020 database metric cereals 300 ha olive trees 870 ha and vegetables are the main crops cultivated in this area which is deserved by the dam of elhouareb crda kairouan 2019 intensive and hyper intensive olive plantations are irrigated from this dam and the borehole water is used when the dam water is not available the orchardists stop irrigating their plantations between november harvest and january pruning period in this area of great interest many research projects were made during the last 15 years mergusi bird ird the study began with a survey by using a questioner sheet provided by the fao based on a list of some objective criteria accessibility to the orchard security management of the olive grove willingness of the farmer to collaborate and his training level availability of the orchard s historical data and the survey results three olive orchards two are irrigation and the third is rainfed of cv chemlali were considered for the experiment representing each a main farming system of this region fig 1 in the first orchard n 35 34 57 e 9 50 11 olive trees are planted at 278 trees ha on sandy loam clay soil 50 l 21 c with no ploughing it was fertigated daily each tree received annually 2 kg of nitrogen supplied from march to october 1 kg of p2o5 applied from march to july and 4 kg of p2o5 given from may to october the second orchard n35 33 38 e 9 49 26 is semi intensive trees are cultivated at 100 trees ha on sandy clay soil 9 l 10 2 c it was irrigated twice a week ploughed regularly and fertilized annually 2 kg of nitrogen tree year plus 15 20 kg of manure tree year the seasonal june october irrigation amount applied to orchards 1 and 2 was 492 mm in 2019 and 459 mm in 2020 0 4 2 7 mm day depending on the season the third orchard n 35 33 38 e 9 49 25 is rainfed trees are planted at 10m 10m spacing on sandy loam soil with biennial supply of 20 kg tree of manure soil was tilled regularly in each orchard three homogeneous trees were considered for field monitoring the average climatic data of the studied area table 1 were used to establish the irrigation programs 65 et et is the crop evapotranspiration which were compared to those practiced by the orchardists at the end of the experiment the farmer field school approach was adopted to disseminate the horticultural practices that we recommended to the orchardists to improve their wp with the support of the regional agricultural development offices 2 2 acquisition of the satellite images and pre treatments the first step of the work was the establishment of the land cover map lc of the study area of elhouereb considering 200 gps points acquired in june 10 12th 2019 fig 1 the polarimetric spatial data from sentinel1 and sentinel2 satellite images were downloaded in june july september and october 2019by using the s 1a sensor source https scihub copernicus eu dhus home the sentinel1 data were downloaded from the esa s copernicus open access hub https scihub copernicus eu dhus home for the year 2018 2019 band frequency with a spatial resolution of 10 m in dual polarizations vv and vh operating with a c band frequency of 5 4 ghz the mode chosen for our study is the interferometric wide swath iw the size of each image is 3227pixels in linex2917pixels in column and is coded on 16bits they were used for regular soil moisture estimation by the means of a multi temporal analysis consisting of a multi time surveillance of the water content at the soil surface the radar images sentinel 2 are available in the slc or grd formats they were used to determine the soil surface moisture images are preliminary corrected to avoid errors related to sensor sensitivity and geometric distortions by using the snap application and the geo referencing these steps are necessary to provide a precise location of each pixel in the image and offer the possibility to integrate all data in the same cartographic projection system 32632wgs84 utm zone 32 n the applications used to acquire and pre treat the sentinel1 images and the determination of the backscatter coefficients after a long chain of radiometric pre processing calibration and filtration are detailed in the following section to determine the land characteristics some descriptors are computed expressed in terms of energy and in l1 standard from the sub bands classification of the sentinel1 polarimetric images was made by using the minimum distance criterion with the multivariate approach based on the principal component analysis pca the vv and vh polarization images are de correlated the steps followed to pre tread the radar images are detailed below 1 sampling of the gps points by the odk application application on android in which we load the geotagged tci image and the form that we will fill in when acquiring the gps points by using the tci composite image of sentinel2 06 06 2019 composed from the red bands b04 green b03 and blue b02 which is converted so that it can be opened on the odk application a form provided by the fao was installed on the odk application and used to identify the different existing soil occupations as well as the horticultural practices the odk briefcase application installed on the pc was used for data processing to convert the data recorded on odk into xlm file 2 the field xml format data files were then transferred from the android to the pc and placed in the same directory as the odk briefcase application to convert the data to the csv format files then into a shp file by using the qgis software maping the gps points taken during the field trip so that the georeferenced points can be superimposed on the sentinel2 image of the study area 2 3 soil moisture determination soil moisture was determined considering two simultaneous spatial scales i the satellite images of elhouereb area which were downloaded from june to october 2019and 2 the gravimetric measurements soil sampling which were made at field level to 0 6 m depth for each orchard there are three replicates 3 olive trees 2 3 1 field measurements soil measurements were performed in each orchard during the fruit growing season in 2019 and in 2020 soil moisture hv was determined considering gravimetric soil samples taken at 20 40 and 60 cm depth in two sites under the canopies of the tagged trees and between the rows of trees with maximum depth of 60 cm soil moisture hv and soil water content s mm are computed considering equations eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 as follows 1 hm fw dw dw 2 hv da hm and 3 s 10xdxhv where fw and dw g are the fresh and dry weights of the soil samples hm is the massic soil moisture hv is the average volumetric soil moisture of each orchard 3 olive trees da is the actual soil density and d m is the depth at which the sampling was done the water balance wb was established for each orchard at both sites considering different time periods and from which we deduced the actual evapotranspiration eta considering equation eq 4 eta r i δs where δs is the amount of water stored in the soil 0 60 cm during a certain period and r and i are the amounts of the seasonal rainfall and the irrigation volume respectively recorded for the same period herein we note that as the watered orchards are drip irrigated at optimal seasonal value comparison between our calendars and those used by the orchardists we considered that there is no water percolation 2 3 2 satellite data based on sentinel1 images the soil moisture was determined by using the multi date polarimetric data and several tools such as the color composition the principal component analysis pca and entropy these methods allow monitoring of the soil moisture over time based on the polarimetric images other methods have been tested using the statistical approach including the calculation of the means and the variances of the backscattering in the vv and vh polarizations then the sentinel1 data were pre processed by using the sentinel application platform snap geometric correction speckle filtering and radiometric correction of images to determine the backscatter coefficient as follow i the calibration step allows the conversion of the signal recorded by the sensor into backscatter coefficient ii the geometric corrections geo referencing step uses the digital elevation model dem proposed by the nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm iii the thermal noise removal step uses the lee filter the sub images were extracted from the vh and vv polarization images the backscatter coefficient σ derived from the radar images is used to measure the retro diffused signal of a certain source via the radar i e the received and the emitted energy and expressed following gorrab 2016 2 4 water productivity wp determination at harvest the individual olive production y kg tree is determined for each tree and then averaged for each orchard water productivity is determined as follows wp kg m3 y kg of olives tree eta m3water tree eq 5 2 5 determination of the backscatter coefficient and correlation with the soil moisture the radar backscatter coefficients are determined at different dates from the sentinel1 imagesby using the software envi 4 7 extract the statistics of the signal level backscattered on the images and then averaged and correlated to the soil moisture to do this task the field data in shape files format representing the test orchards are superimposed on the radar images and then converted into regions of interest roi in order to extract the statistic characteristics of the radar signal for each orchard on each of the images processed using the roi stat command under the envi 4 7 software it is important to precise here that the iw s1 images recorded in both polarizations are used to estimate the soil moisture they were generated at high resolution and level1 ground range https sentinel esa int web sentinel user guides sentinel 1 sar product types processing levels level 1 to localize the studied orchards a sentinel 2b image is downloaded in june 2019 and used as a support tool to the gps points the same resolution 10mx10m is used for thesentinel1 and sentinel2 images 3 results and discussion 3 1 field measurement actual evapotranspiration eta and water productivity wp determination table 2 presents the field measurements made on each orchard considering three olive trees per orchard orchard 2 has the highest average record for olive production orchard 3 was the less productive one and presented very low soil water contents sandy loam soil soil water content measured at the end of irrigation season sf was higher than that observed at the beginning of the irrigation season in orchard 1 and orchard 2 during the year 2019 but it was lower than the si in 2020 eta increased between 2019 on year and 2020 off year about 1 7 to x2 1 time depending on the orchard values reached in average 819 mm year in orchard 1 fertigated 823 mm in orchard 2 irrigated and 293 mm in the rainfed orchard water consumption was about three times higher in the irrigated orchards than in the rainfed orchard i e eta irrigated orchard 2 8 eta rainfed orchard for the same orchard eta measured under the canopies of the olive trees showed little variation cv 10 however the measurements showed a significant variability when the samplings are made between the rows of trees data not shown and particularly for orchard 2 where trees are planted at larger spacing in comparison to orchard 1 water productivity kg of olives m3 eta was computed with regard to the eta values table 2 results showed significant differences between the irrigated orchards 1 and 2 and between the irrigated orchards and the rainfed orchard wp is 2 1 times higher in orchard 1 0 77 kg m3 than in orchard 2 0 37 kg m3 i e wp ferti irrigated orchard 2 1 wp irrigated orchard due to fertigation and the higher tree density wp is 2 7 times higher in orchard 1 than in orchard 3 0 29 kg m3 i e wp ferti irrigated orchard 2 7 wp rainfed orchard variability between trees is higher in orchard 2 than in orchard 1 and orchard 3 which is rainfed and fertilized occasionally results obtained for experiment corroborate previous works made in tunisia masmoudi charfi et al 2021 spain salvador et al 2011 and morocco hadiddou et al 2013 balaghi 2014 indicating the existence of a real potential of wp improvement for the olive orchards most research works showed that olive trees respond favorably and rapidly to water supplies even when low amounts of water are used irrigation at optimal amount comparison between orchard 1 and 3 and the correct management of water i e daily drip irrigation comparison orchard 1 and orchard 2 are essential to attain high wp in addition high tree density intensification of the orchard is important to consider if water is available comparison between orchard 1 and orchard 2 so that we can consider that orchard 2 and the semi intensive irrigated system in general is less efficient eue 0 43 than the intensive system 1 06 the amount of water used by each tree is very important and great amounts of water are lost through the soil water evaporation process e which was found to represent about 53 of the eta values for intensive olive trees and more for the extensive systems masmoudi charfi et al 2010 so that the orchards can be classified as follows orchard 1 orchard 2 orchard 1 orchard 1 is the most efficient one in average it uses less water and provided more fruits 3 2 values of the backscatter coefficient and correlation with the soil water content the backscatter coefficients were determined in 2019 values are highly dependent on soil moisture polarization and the site of measure under or between the rows of trees the vv backscatter coefficient evolves between 10 and 14db from june to october the highest most negative coefficients are recorded for both polarizations in the rainfed orchard orchard 3 due to the low soil moisture during the months of august and september σ decreases for all orchards in response to rainwater supplies 99 mm from 30 7 2019 27 9 2019 which increases soil moisture orchard 1 has the highest values of σ 10db and it is the least affected 0 5 1 db by the rainfall due to regular daily irrigation tree spacing is lower than in orchard 2 and the rows between trees and the canopies are highly shaded in orchard 2 σ has intermediate values between 11 and 12 db and shows greater variability 1 1 5db than in orchard 1 there trees and rows are completely exposed to sunlight irrigation is applied at the same amount but twice a week only orchard 3 has the lowest values of σ between 12 and 14db and it was the most affected orchard even during the rainy period the vh backscatter coefficient evolves between 22 and 16db from june to october the highest 16db and the lowest between 20 and 22 db values are observed for orchard 1 and 3 respectively during the rainy period the radar signal increases for orchards 1 and 3 due to the increase of the leaf turgor the development of new vegetation the canopy structure and the shoot distribution which depolarizes the radar signal orchard 1 is the least affected orchard 1 5 2 db by the rainwater table 3 shows the backscatter coefficients following the vh and vv polarizations for orchard 1 orchard 2 and orchard 3 table 3 shows the depolarization ratio σ vh vv computed for all orchards the variability of this ratio 2 4 db depends on the orchard surface soil doughtiness tree spacing and if the soil is tilled or not and varies from 1 46 to 1 90 from june to october the lowest values of σ vh vv are recorded for orchard 3 from the backscatter coefficient values σ 0 obtained at vv and vh polarizations and from the ratio of σ 0 vh vv we can see that the vegetation depolarizes the signal reflects the roughness effect of the vegetation the radar signal is more intense on the vh than on the vv polarization for all orchards however the wetter the soil the stronger is the radar signal the slope of the σ 0 vh vv curves as a function of the image acquisition dates established for the three orchards increases with the water input the greater the amount of water brought to the orchard the steeper is the slop the use of the remote sensing for soil water content determination showed the performance of this tool for such aim this corroborates allen et al 2007 according to whom the satellite multi spectral measurements allow accurate determination of the soil water content and exclude the need to have access to in situ soil moisture data and samplings however as it is necessary to improve our correlations the number of field measures should be increased the results showed the importance of the site and depth of measures and soil sampling in such work and also the polarization of the images for the irrigated orchards the correlation coefficients found between hv and the backscatter coefficients are positive for the following combinations vv polarization sampling made at the depth of 0 20 cm and vh polarization sampling made at 0 60 cm in the rainfed orchard r is positive for the vv polarization and negative for the vh polarization both for the depth of 0 60 cm comparison between the vv and vh polarizations σ vh vv as a function of the rainfall variation showed the impact of the biomass increases and the soil surface structure this ratio may increase or decrease in the same orchard depending on how the orchard is managed state of tillage soil texture planting density in addition results show that by a judicious choice of certain parameters optimal filters it is possible to achieve higher rates of identification in our case 5 land use masks were developed by the tkl providing rates of identification greater than 57 3 3 correlation between the backscatter coefficients and the soil water content the relationships between the backscatter coefficients values σ 0 and the soil moisture measured at different depths 0 20 cm 0 60 cm are presented as follows table 4 1 the correlation is negative and significative when the relationship is established between the backscatter coefficients derived from the radar images and the hv measures for orchard1 under the canopies of trees at 20 cm depth r 0 46 considering the vh polarization and under the canopy of the trees at 60 cm depth r 0 46 following the vv polarization orchard3 between the row of trees at 20 cm depth r 0 99 considering the vh polarization and for both sites at 60 cm depth considering the vh polarization r 0 32 under the canopy and r 0 98 between the rows of trees 2 the correlation is positive and significative when the relationship is established between the backscatter coefficients derived from the radar images and the hv measures for orchard1 under the canopies of trees at 20 cm depth r 0 51 considering the vv polarization and under the canopies of trees considering the overall depth and the vh polarization orchard2 in both sites considering the overall depth for both polarizations orchard3 between the rows of trees at both depths 0 20 cm and 0 60 cm considering the vv polarization r 0 97 and under the canopies of trees at 20 cm depth considering the vh polarization r 0 51 for orchard 2 the backscatter coefficient is independent of soil moisture measured at 20 cm depth orchard3 behaves differently from orchard1 the correlations evolve in the opposite way for measurements made under the canopies 4 conclusion water productivity was determined for olive orchards considering the three main cultivation systems present in the centre of tunisia intensive and ferti irrigated orchard 1 semi intensive and irrigated orchard 2 and rainfed orchard3 systems orchard 1 provided the highest values of water productivity 0 77 kg m3eta and water use efficiency 1 06 kg m3 irrigation
