19165,chlorprothixene cptx is an antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class although it is widely used as a tranquillizer in psychiatry anesthesiology pediatrics and in general medical practice there is a gap in knowledge regarding its occurrence and fate in the environment therefore we provide for the first time data on the environmental fate and ecotoxicity of cptx and its potential photo transformations products ptps firstly two standardized biodegradation tests closed bottle test cbt and manometric respiratory test mrt were performed to assess cptx s environmental biodegradability then its photodegradability was studied using xenon and uv lamps effects of different conditions initial drug concentration ph and temperature were applied during uv photodegradation subsequently the time courses of cptx and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations were monitored throughout the photodegradation tests after that high resolution mass spectrometry was employed to elucidate the structures of the formed photo transformation products ptps in addition biodegradation tests were performed for the photolytic mixtures to assess the biodegradability of the ptps finally the eco toxicity assessment for cptx and its photolytic mixtures was predicted using different quantitative structure activity relationship q sar software cptx was found to be not readily biodegradable in cbt and mrt cptx was not eliminated by irradiation with the xenon lamp however primarily eliminated using the uv lamp the cptx elimination during uv irradiation was faster at lower concentrations cptx uv photodegradation was affected by ph value while not affected by the temperature of the irradiated solution 13 ptps were detected in uv photolysis mixtures one additional product was detected in cptx standard solution and it was degraded simultaneously with cptx during uv irradiation on one hand biodegradation assays revealed that uv photolytic mixtures of cptx containing its ptps were not better biodegradable than cptx itself on the other hand lc ms analysis showed some ptps which were eliminated after the biodegradation tests indicating possible biodegradability of these ptps this because those ptps are present in low concentrations in the photolysis mixture and their effect can be hindered by the effect of cptx and other non biodegradable ptps qsar analysis revealed that cptx and some of its ptps may have some human and or eco toxic properties in conclusion the release of cptx into aquatic environments could be harmful therefore further research focusing on cptx and its ptps are strongly recommended graphical abstract image 1 keywords thioxanthene photodegradation transformation 1 introduction the occurrence of emerging organic contaminants in the aquatic environment has been raised in recent years pharmaceuticals and their byproducts from incomplete mineralization are an important part of these contaminants and may cause adverse ecological and or human health effects rastogi et al 2014 santos et al 2010 most of these contaminants were not regulated or controlled pharmaceuticals in general and neurological drugs in particular have been found in different environmental compartments such as rivers psychiatric hospitals effluent and wastewater treatment plants in the concentration range of ng l to μg l herrmann et al 2016 writer et al 2013 yuan et al 2013 although the consumption of neurological drugs is high their potential hazard including their environmental fate and behaviour is still not well understood compared to other drugs such as antibiotics chlorprothixene cptx c18h18clns cas nr 6469 93 8 is a neuroleptic of the thioxanthene class cptx is widely used as a major tranquillizer in psychiatry anesthesiology pediatrics and in general medical practice huus and khan 1967 santiago et al 2011 it is also prescribed for anxiety and agitation because of its strong sedative effect chen et al 2012 in the year 2016 the consumption of prescribed cptx in germany was 1 8 tons schwabe et al 2017 in addition it was reported by herrmann et al that cptx is highly used in nursing homes and in psychiatric hospitals in germany herrmann et al 2015b cptx is metabolized in human bodies mainly to nor chlorprothixene and chlorprothixene sulfoxide cptx and its metabolites are excreted in urine and feces käferstein et al 2013 like other pharmaceuticals cptx will reach the influents of sewage treatment plants stps either through excretion or through unproperly drug disposal if no effluent treatment is in place cptx and its metabolites will directly enter surface water in aquatic systems cptx can undergo biotic degradation by microorganisms henning et al 2018 herrmann et al 2016 and photodegradation by sunlight or uv irradiation which is used in drinking water purification systems and is discussed for advanced wastewater treatment herrmann et al 2015a khaleel et al 2016 2017 kovalova et al 2013 despite that nothing is known about the occurrence and fate of cptx in the aquatic environment therefore more data in this respect is needed for a sound environmental risk assessment incomplete mineralization of pharmaceuticals in the environment results in the formation of new chemicals i e transformation products tps in general environmental fate and hazardous properties of tps can strongly differ from their parent compounds illés et al 2014 mahmoud et al 2014 therefore it is important to identify the structure of the possibly formed tps and to study their fate and toxic properties the research about tps is a huge and difficult task most often they are not commercially available and their synthesis or their isolation and enrichment are tedious expensive and time consuming if possible at all also there are often many tps generated from one parent compound therefore experimental investigation of individual tps is most often impossible quantitative structure activity relationships q sars are increasingly used to identify hazardous structural features therefore consequently qsar methodologies were recently suggested to be used for the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and their tps mahmoud et al 2013 menz et al 2017 the main objectives of this research were to provide for the first time data about the fate and effects of cptx and possibly within a treatment or the aquatic environment formed tps through studying biodegradability photo degradability under different conditions and toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chlorprothixene cas number 6469 93 8 of analytical reagent grade was supplied by sigma aldrich steinheim germany acetonitrile lichrosolv lc ms grade and formic acid were purchased from vwr darmstadt germany aqueous mobile phase standard solutions and solutions for photolysis uv and xenon and biodegradation cbt and mrt treatments were prepared with ultrapure water obtained from a sg ultra clear uv tm water purification system with toc monitoring from sg wasseraufbereitung und regenerierstation barsbüttel germany all the nutrients used in biodegradation tests have a purity of 98 5 at least 2 2 photo degradation experimental setup photo degradation experiments were performed at concentrations higher than the ones to be expected in the environment in order to be able to perform subsequently biodegradation tests which demand at least a concentration of test compound theoretical oxygen demand thod around 5 mg l in addition higher concentrations are also required to good identify the ptps and to follow their formation curves the effect of starting concentration on photolysis was addressed by testing the following range of concentrations 5 10 50 and 100 mg l xenon lamp and uv lamp were employed in order to simulate sunlight

106 mol photons cm 2 s 1 more information in text s1 sm cptx shows high absorption in the uv range with the absorption maximum at 270 nm which means that cptx was expected based on its absorption spectrum to have a high accessibility for uv radiation used here fig s1 sm in photodegradation experiments about 800 ml of the working solution was used in a 1000 ml laboratory batch glass photoreactor during the entire experiments mixtures were magnetically stirred to ensure a constant mixing of the solutions the temperature was maintained to the desired value by a circulating cooler wkl230 lauda berlin and ph was monitored throughout the test during the experiments samples were drawn from the reactor at different time intervals 0 2 4 8 16 32 64 and 128 min to assess concentration

concentration of 10 mg l at 20 c and ph value of 5 photolysis experiments using the uv lamp were performed under different conditions initial cptx concentrations of 5 10 50 and 100 mg l temperatures of 10 20 30 and 40 c and ph values of 3 5 7 and 9 in order to study the effect of these parameters on the degradation kinetics and on the ptps formed for cbt and mrt of the photolytic mixture samples were collected at 0 min and after 4 16 and 128 min of uv irradiation the initial concentration of cptx in the photolytic treated samples was adjusted by measuring the doc of the tested substance 0 min i e before photolysis and of the photolyzed samples to determine the required carbon content and to calculate the theoretical oxygen demand thod for each cbt and mrt a pseudo first order kinetic model was used according to the oecd guidelines to determine the photo degradation rate constants oecd 2008 2 3 analytical methods cptx concentration was determined by using a high performance liquid

chromatographic method described above was also used for lc msn analysis for more information about the used lc msn systems see text s2 sm an absolute measurement of the individual concentrations of the tps is not possible due to the lack of standards for these tps furthermore a peak of low intensity does not necessarily correspond to a low concentration of the related tp and vice versa therefore the peak area of tps a was related to the peak area of cptx at time point 0 min a0 to calculate the recovery of each tp every tp exceeding 0 5 of a a0 was structurally elucidated structures were analyzed using auto ms mode and to improve the reliability of results the lc hrms up to ms3 was studied moreover the occurrence of tps in different conditions was studied to confirm their formation samples from the biodegradation tests were analyzed with lc itms using recovered peak areas of cptx and its tps s s0 s is the peak area of the tp at day 28 and s0 is the peak area of the tp at day 0 2 4 biodegradation testing closed bottle test cbt and manometric respiratory test mrt cbt and mrt were performed according to the oecd 301d and 301f guidelines respectively the basic experimental set ups and validity criteria are described in detail elsewhere calisto and esteves 2009 the standard test period for both cbt and mrt is 28 days and they are performed at room temperature 20 1 c in the dark at ph of 7 5 temperature and ph were monitored during the test the test systems in cbt and mrt contain four different series test substance toxicity control blank and quality control mrt contains an additional fifth series named sterile control sterile control vessel contains sodium azide to account for abiotic degradation toxicity controls allow for the recognition of false negative results caused by the toxicity of the test compound against the degrading bacteria used in the tests all test vessels were inoculated with an aliquot from the effluent of the municipal stp of agl in lüneburg

day 28 were taken and stored at 20 c for subsequent hplc uv and lc msn analyses measurements were performed in duplicates respectively the final biodegradation in percentage was calculated after subtracting the blank values from the quality control toxicity control and test compound values in both tests the chemical is classified as readily biodegradable if the measured biochemical oxygen

photodegradation the direct photo degradation and mineralization results of 10 mg l cptx 20 c and ph 5 using xe lamp and uv lamp were followed to evaluate the fate of cptx under sunlight and uv irradiation fig 1 with xe lamp cptx showed no significant elimination or mineralization during 128 min of irradiation that is in agreement with expectation as absorbance spectrum of cptx does not significantly overlap with the emission spectrum of the xenon light source with uv lamp 10 mg l cptx was primary eliminated and partially mineralized within the first 16 min of uv irradiation 99 6 0 4 of cptx was eliminated at the same time there was no significant loss of cptx observed in dark controls so cptx underwent photolytic degradation only by the effect of the uv lamp used slower mineralization was observed and doc elimination at 16 min of uv radiation was not more than 20 after 16 min of uv radiation the doc elimination continued to increase and it reached the value of about 70 elimination after 128 min of radiation the incomplete removal of doc and the primary elimination of cptx indicate the formation of ptps during the uv irradiation at the beginning of 10 mg l cptx uv experiment the ph of the solution was 5 2 0 4 and it decreased gradually to reach the value of 3 9 0 5 at the end of the test 128 min this might indicate that the formed ptps can have acidic nature the uv photolysis curves of cptx using different initial concentrations are shown in fig 2 experiments performed at different initial concentrations fit pseudo first order kinetics with high linearity r2 0 98 with k values equal to 0 054 0 094 0 386 and 0 702 min 1 at concentrations of 100 50 10 and 5 mg l respectively fig s2 sm the degree of doc removal results showed that after 128 min of irradiation in the experiments at 100 50 10 and 5 mg l mineralization was about 14 1 19 9 69 8 and 87 1 respectively fig 2 the quantum yield was only possible to be calculated for the initial concentration of 5 mg l and it was determined to be 0 064 from the above mentioned results it is obvious that cptx elimination kinetics and the corresponding doc removal were faster at lower initial concentration this because more cptx molecules and more intermediates and ptps at higher concentrations do compete to absorb the radiant energy in the irradiated solution gutowski et al 2015 therefore degradation of cptx might be quite fast under real world conditions but it cannot be also excluded that there will be other compounds present in the environmental water i e quenching compounds as well as radiation absorbing compounds that may slow down the photo transformation process oliveira et al 2019 trovó et al 2014 in photodegradation tests of 100 mg l cptx at different temperatures 10 c 20 c 30 c and 40 c in up water ph 5 0 the photolysis and the mineralization rate values are very close fig s3 sm so the temperature showed not a highly remarkable effect on the uv photolysis of cptx the degradation kinetic rates at 10 c and 40 c are slightly faster than that at 20 c and the slowest degradation rate was observed at 30 c experiments fig s4 sm 3 2 influence of ph on photo degradation of cptx the ph influence on the photo degradation of 100 mg l cptx was investigated by performing tests at ph values ranging from 3 0 to 7 0 fig 3 in the dark controls cptx was found to be soluble at ph 7 at ph 7 cptx dissolved concentration 100 mg l decreased and the solution became a little turbid because about 25 of the added cptx precipitated photodegradation in highly alkaline ph was not studied here because cptx precipitates at higher ph and a fluctuation in the concentration at the test beginning was observed affecting the quality of the test fig s5 sm shows the soluble part in of 100 mg l cptx at different ph values the pk a value of cptx is 9 76 and it has two forms in aqueous solution fig s6 sm chemaxon 2015 marvin sketch 15 6 15 0 photodegradation of cptx at ph 3 5 and 7 fitted first order kinetics cptx shows the highest degradation rate at ph 3 in which cptx is in its protonated form hcptx the slowest degradation rate was observed at ph 5 conditions which followed first order kinetic with k value equal 0 0544 fig s7 sm under ph 3 and ph 7 conditions the degradation of cptx showed two staged degradation rates a first faster rate till 32 min of uv irradiation with k values equal 0 071 and 0 0596 respectively followed by a slower rate with k values equal 0 0434 and 0 0456 at ph 3 and ph 7 experiments respectively fig s7 sm the degradation rate at ph 7 could be not only due to the ph effect but also due to the lower dissolved concentration fig 3b shows the doc removal kinetics of cptx at studied ph values the rates of change in the degree of mineralization during irradiation at different ph experiments are nearly the same which means that ph could have a non remarkable effect on the mineralization rate of cptx 3 3 identification of cptx transformation products the lc ms total and extracted ion chromatograms were checked for samples of the uv irradiated aqueous solution of cptx 14 tps were observed and their chemical structure could be assigned respectively the log p values for the tps were predicted using qsar models table s4 sm and it helped in the differentiation between the isomers because the compound which has lower log p value is more polar and therefore should appear at relative lower tr on the applied non polar analytical column fig 4 shows the tentative photodegradation pathway of cptx according to our results table s2 sm shows cptx and its tps which are labeled according to their m z values it is obvious from table s2 sm that all the formed tps appear at lower tr than cptx itself and therefore showed lower log p values in table s4 sm so the formed tps are expected to show higher mobility and persistence in the aquatic environment in addition cptx s tps can be harder removed from water by sorption processes due to their higher polarity than cptx and thus higher water solubility reemtsma et al 2016 the fragmentation pattern for each tp can be found in figs s8 s20 sm all the observed tps had not been observed in any earlier studies in cptx standard samples before photolysis one product at m z 282 13 was observed with a low peak intensity and it degraded gradually during the uv irradiation this tp could be either an impurity or a hydrolysis transformation product and it is labeled as tp282 it has the suggested molecular formula of c18h20ns and predicted to be a de chlorinated derivative from cptx fig s9 sm two ptps were detected with m z 316 and they were labeled as ptp316 1 and ptp316 2 ptp316 1 m z 316 14 is suggested to be formed from cptx after de chlorination and di hydroxylation processes fig s10 sm ptp316 2 m z 316 09 has suggested molecular formula and relative double bond rdb value similar to cptx in addition its msn fragmentation pattern was mostly as cptx with little differences which cannot be used to suggest the difference between the two substances therefore ptp316 2 is assumed as an isomer to cptx fig s8 s11 sm five precursor ion peaks with m z 332 were observed and can be divided into two groups the first one has the exact m z value of 332 13 and the suggested molecular formula c18h22o3ns this group includes ptp332 1 ptp332 2 and ptp332 3 which are suggested to be isomers generated from cptx after de chlorination and tri hydroxylation these three ptps gave msn fragmentation patterns that are mostly the same with very little differences which allow not to differentiate them figs s12 14 sm combining the obtained fragmentation pattern and the log p values ptp332 1 can have two hydroxyl groups on the tricyclic ring and one on the first or second carbon atom of the aliphatic side chain ptp332 2 can have two hydroxyl groups on the tricyclic ring and one on the third carbon atom of the aliphatic side chain ptp332 3 can have the three hydroxyl groups on the tricyclic ring the second group has the m z value of 332 09 with the suggested molecular formula of c18h19oncls and it includes ptp332 4 and ptp332 5 they differ only in their retention time and have the same rdb values and their msn fragmentation pattern is almost the same therefore this group is identified as isomers formed by mono hydroxylation of cptx where they differ in the position of the hydroxylation figs s15 16 sm according to the log p values ptp332 4 is hydroxylated on the aliphatic sidechain and ptp332 5 on the tricyclic ring the ptp with m z 334 1 could be formed through the hydration of cptx fig s17 sm the ptp detected with m z 348 13 is suggested to be formed from the de chlorination of cptx and the addition of four hydroxyl groups fig s18 sm with m z 350 1 one ptp was observed that could have been generated from cptx after hydration and mono hydroxylation processes fig s19 sm three ptp isomers with m z 298 12 were produced from a de chlorination of cptx followed by a mono hydroxylation process fig s20 sm according to the log p predicted values the hydroxylation in ptp298 1 is likely to occur at the aliphatic sidechain as it appears at lower tr ptp298 2 and ptp298 3 are probably hydroxylated on the tricyclic ring in a study with chlorpromazine which is a structurally highly related substance trautwein and kümmerer 2012 most of the photolysis products were formed by sulfoxidation in our study the sulfoxide product was excluded because the ms2 fragment which indicates the extrusion of the so moiety 48 m z was not detected in addition our lc ms results showed a loss of water which confirms the hydroxylation at a carbon atom not at the sulfur atom furthermore the rdb values of our ptps excluded any sulfoxidation fig s21 sm shows the appearance disappearance of the tps formed with a a0 above 0 5 during the photolysis of cptx initial concentration of cptx is 100 mg l ph 5 and temperature 20 c n 3 ptp316 1 ptp298 1 and ptp334 4 are the main transformation intermediate during cptx photolysis their yields reached up to 12 6 10 5 and 6 5 a a0 respectively concentration of products ptp316 1 ptp332 1 ptp332 3 ptp32 4 ptp332 5 ptp348 ptp298 1 ptp298 2 and ptp298 3 increased quickly during the first 16 or 32 min of reaction and then decreased slowly the concentration of ptp332 2 increased slowly during the first hour and then decreased quickly while the concentration of products ptp316 2 ptp334 and ptp350 increased quickly during the first 8 min of reaction and decreased also quickly during the next 8 min at lower initial concentration the tps formed and eliminated faster than at higher concentrations fig s22 sm some tps were not detected at lower concentrations such as ptp332 3 ptp332 5 ptp348 and tp282 which are not detected at experiments performed with 5 mg l cptx this finding agrees with many other findings herrmann et al 2015a herrmann et al 2016 khaleel et al 2017 on the other hand the temperature showed no highly significant effect on the formation behavior of the tps fig s23 sm 3 4 influence of solution ph value on ptp formation the behavior of the identified tps is compared in uv photolysis experiments performed at different ph values of 3 5 and 7 fig s24 sm as the ph of the real water samples is mostly slightly alkaline so the ptps that formed with higher a a0 value in the ph 7 experiment could be more relevant to the environment it was observed that ptp316 1 was detected with the highest peaks as it showed a a0 value equal 12 6 and 9 0 in experiments performed at ph 5 and ph 7 respectively at ph 3 ptp316 1 was formed with very low a a0 value this means that the de chlorination of cptx combined with di hydroxylation processes could favorably occur in neutral and weakly acidic conditions and is unlikely to take place under strongly acidic conditions and therefore normally of high interest in the aquatic environment a similar case was also observed for ptp316 2 which was formed with a a0 value equal 3 7 and 7 1 at experiments performed at ph 5 and ph 7 respectively corresponding to only 0 6 a a0 value in the ph 3 experiment this can lead to the conclusion that the isomerization of cptx can favorably occur when the ph value increases until ph 7 and is less likely to take place in strongly acidic condition and that ptp316 2 is of interest to the environment ptp334 showed a a0 values equal 10 6 6 5 and 1 7 in experiments at ph 7 ph 5 and ph 3 respectively this indicates that hydration of cptx can more likely happen when the solution ph value increases till ph 7 and that this ptp is of further interest ptps 298 2 and 298 3 are formed with a a0 values equal 9 0 and 10 8 5 2 and 6 0 and 2 5 and 2 6 in ph 3 ph 5 and ph 7 experiments respectively this means that de chlorination and hydroxylation of the tricyclic ring in cptx molecule are favored in strongly acidic media and its occurrence is inversely proportional to the ph value and therefore they are normally of less interest in the aquatic environment the case was reversed in case of ptp298 1 which is of high interest in the environment as it formed with higher a a0 values at ph 5 and ph 7 experiments equal 13 1 and 9 6 respectively corresponding to 0 2 a a0 at ph 3 it can be concluded that de chlorination and hydroxylation of the aliphatic side chain in the cptx molecule is difficult to occur at ph 3 and is likely to take place at weak acidic and neutral conditions ptp332 3 was the one with the highest peak area formed compared with the five ptps with m z 332 its highest formation ratio was seen at ph 5 experiment 4 6 followed by ph 3 with a a0 value equal to 2 4 and its concentration was lower at ph 7 with 0 6 a a0 so it is of less interest to the environment ptp332 5 showed a a0 values of 1 2 0 9 and 0 3 in experiments performed at ph 3 ph 5 and ph 7 respectively indicating probable non significant relevant to the environment the ph had no effect on formation behavior of ptp332 1 ptp332 2 and ptp332 4 as they showed nearly similar a a0 values in experiments performed at different ph values the formation ratio of ptp350 is directly proportional to the solution ph as it showed 3 7 0 7 and 0 1 a a0 in ph 7 ph 5 and ph 3 experiments respectively the previously mentioned case is similar to ptp334 and this confirmed the previous conclusion for ptp334 in addition ptp348 has formed also with a a0 values directly proportional to the ph of the solution so ptp350 and ptp348 could be relevant to the aquatic environment tp282 was formed and eliminated with nearly the same ratio in the three compared ph experiments indicating the probability that the ph has no effect on the elimination of the chloride atom from cptx molecule 3 5 aerobic biodegradation of cptx and its tps according to the criteria of the oecd guideline all performed tests were valid fig s25 sm in comparison with the cbt mrt showed similar or only a little higher biodegradation rates table s3 sm no significant change in ph was observed in all the test vessels the biodegradation values of cptx were very low in both cbt and mrt the lc ms recoveries of cptx after 28 days in cbt and mrt were 95 8 5 3 and 99 9 7 6 respectively in agreement no tps from cptx s biodegradation was observed accordingly cptx is neither readily biodegradable nor abiotically degradable nor was it eliminated by sorption the results of the toxicity controls showed an inhibitory effect in the investigated mrt assays within the first 2 and 9 days in cptx s photodegraded samples taken at 16 and 128 min of photo treatment respectively this indicates that the inoculum s bacteria were not degrading readily biodegradable sodium acetate reference substance within the first days in the cbt this effect was not observed which can be due to the lower concentrations of the tps applied in this test the same observation was reported by rastogi et al in studying the biodegradability of diatrizoic acid photodegradation samples rastogi et al 2014 in cbt and mrt tests of cptx s irradiated samples taken after 4 16 and 128 min the oxygen consumption indicated that the formed tps are not readily biodegradable the doc elimination in these samples showed a slight increase when compared to that in cptx standard sample table s3 sm this indicates that only a few tps could be biodegradable to a certain degree or alternatively some more but only incompletely therefore the peak areas of the detected tps were compared for the start and the end of the two tests performed fig 5 the peak recoveries of lc ms analysis of samples after 28 days for some of the formed tps were around 100 thereby excluding any microbial biotransformation for these products ptp316 1 ptp316 2 ptp332 5 ptp350 ptp298 1 ptp298 2 ptp298 3 ptp282 concluding these products and the parent compound cptx to persist in the environment on the other hand some ptps showed better elimination in biodegradation tests than cptx ptp334 is biotically eliminated during the two biodegradation tests 70 3 ptp348 was mostly eliminated 99 4 with no elimination in the sterile control indicating biotic degradation four ptps with m z 332 ptp332 1 ptp332 2 ptp332 3 and ptp332 4 show high elimination in test vessels with no elimination in sterile samples indicating biotic elimination although ptp332 4 and ptp332 5 are isomers ptp332 4 is biodegradable and ptp332 5 is not therefore it can be concluded that the position of the functional group in the compound can affect the ability of the bacteria to degrade these compounds which mean that the isomerization is an important factor that can affect the biodegradability of compounds in the environment hao et al 2009 3 6 in silico prediction of properties of cptx and its tps 3 6 1 biodegradability the structure of cptx and its tps were analyzed for predicting their ready biodegradability by using in silico models the compound is classified as biodegradable or not according to certain predicted activating and deactivating alerts which are identified by all qsar models in silico prediction of ready biodegradation of the tps has been applied here in order to support our analytical results from the biodegradation tests as in biodegradation tests biodegradation of each tp was not possible as it measures the biodegradability of the mixture as all and then we measure the elimination not biodegradation of each tp using lc ms method table s4 sm summarizes the in silico models used for the predictions of the ready biodegradability of cptx and its tps the two models of oasis catalogic software and the two models of episuite software for ready biodegradability predicted the output values as 0 14 for cptx table s4 sm these output values are below the pass criterion for ready biodegradability under miti i test and mrt conditions the result from case ultra about cptx biodegradability was negative that confirmed the experimental results the five models used for ready biodegradability predicted the formed tps to be not readily biodegradable with very few non significant positive results which are not in agreement with the analytical results in addition the catalogic oecd 301f model predicted biodegradation availability values for the tps relatively higher than that predicted by catalogic oecd 301c model accordingly cptx and its tps can be categorized as a non readily biodegradable which is in agreement with the results found experimentally in the cbt and mrt on the other hand these results are not in agreement with the lc ms analytical results which suggest some tps to be biodegradable in summary in silico and the experimental biodegradation and analytical testing indicated that cptx and some of its tps are not readily biodegradable and that some other tps could be biodegradable therefore if cptx and its non biodegradable tps reach the aquatic systems like surface waters they are expected to persist in the aquatic environment this would lead to an increase in the number of hazardous substances in the aquatic environment in addition further research focusing on the biodegradability of the tps are recommended 3 6 2 toxicity the in silico prediction models for toxicity were used to assess the toxicity of the tps compared to cptx the in silico assessment of the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of cptx and its tps are summarized in table s5 sm using the different models of the ichm7 guideline conformal set from case ultra the qsar teratogenicity predictions are summarized in table s6 sm and the ecotoxicity prediction results are shown in table s7 sm ecotoxicity the v fischeri modules oasis catalogic have predicted higher ic50 for all the tps than for cptx itself indicating higher ecotoxicity for cptx in addition most of the tps formed with m z 332b 334 350 and 282 showed lower ic50 values compared with other tps therefore the previously mentioned products could be relatively more ecotoxic than the others in microtox toxicity to environmental bacteria aua v fischeri and rainbow trout toxicity aue modules cptx was assessed as inconclusive and out of domain respectively indicating that no ecotoxic prediction is possible for cptx all the suggested structures of ptp298 and ptp282 showed the same ecotoxic results as cptx in both aua and aue tests on the other hand most of the suggested structures for ptp316 ptp332a and ptp348 are predicted to be toxic to rainbow trout in the aue model only and some of the predicted structures for ptp332b are predicted toxic in the aua model vibrio fisheri only most of the established structures for ptp334 and ptp350 are predicted to be toxic against rainbow trout and vibrio fisheri the predicted active ptps is due to the presence of two or three of the positive alerts shown in fig s23 sm mutagenicity carcinogenicity and teratogenicity cptx is predicted to be a mutagen in salmonella module gt1 a7b due to the presence of two alerts id 161 and id 661 fig s23 sm cptx was active also in salmonella mutagenicity pharm salm because of the alerts id 38 and id 3230 in e coli mutagenicity models cptx gives negative results cptx is predicted to be carcinogenic in the gt expert model because of the presence of a polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic conjugated system id a3 1 and id a3 9 fig s23 sm cptx is predicted to be no teratogen by the four applied models ptp332b gave mostly the same results as cptx based on the same positive alerts as cptx the toxicity results for ptp298 and tp282 are also the same as cptx except in the gti a7b model for salmonella toxicity in which these ptps in contrast to cptx were mostly predicted as negatives this is because in ptp298 and tp282 all the alerts as cptx are present except the alert id 661 most of the established structures of ptp332a ptp348 and ptp350 are predicted non mutagenic and non carcinogenic while predicted positive teratogens in some of the applied modules the presence of many hydroxyl functional groups that give positive alerts fig s26 sm is the reason on the other hand ptp316 and ptp334 are mostly predicted to be non mutagenic non teratogenic and non carcinogenic in the used models due to the absence of positive alerts summarizing the obtained results provide indications that the activities of various tps related to the toxic endpoints studied here may be altered by photolysis of cptx in general there were indications that some tps of cptx can be toxic and these tps showed receive more attention in future studies on the other hand some tps such as ptp332a ptp334 and ptp348 are expected to be less toxic and more biodegradable than cptx and this provides a first hint for further studies on potential substitutes of cptx 4 conclusions in this study the environmental fate and behaviour of cptx were assessed for the first time by studying its biodegradability photo degradability and toxicity including possibly formed tps the obtained results showed that cptx was neither readily biodegradable nor photolyzed by xe lamp but it was primarily eliminated by uv irradiation the uv photodegradation rate of cptx was affected by cptx initial concentration and ph value of the solution while not affected by the temperature moreover it was shown that the photodegradation pathway was only slightly affected by the initial concentration and some tps were difficulty appeared at lower concentrations therefore it was possible to use a comparably high initial concentration of cptx under experimental conditions to identify and determine the characteristic fate and effects of tps uv photodegradation of cptx lead to the formation of 13 ptps none of them were reported before the main uv degradation pathway of cptx is hydroxylation combined with or without de chlorination the results of biodegradation tests showed that the tps were not readily biodegradable while lc ms analysis showed six probably biodegradable tps the in silico toxicity assessment combined with biodegradation tests provides a first indication that photodegradation of cptx by uv treatment might lead to some non biodegradable tps that are more toxic than cptx and some others possibly biodegradable tps that are less toxic than cptx therefore further investigations should be conducted regarding the environmental occurrence risk assessment and pharmacological activity of the formed ptps from cptx for this the combination of in silico methods and experimental work turned out to be very supportive acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the federal ministry of research and

19165,chlorprothixene cptx is an antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class although it is widely used as a tranquillizer in psychiatry anesthesiology pediatrics and in general medical practice there is a gap in knowledge regarding its occurrence and fate in the environment therefore we provide for the first time data on the environmental fate and ecotoxicity of cptx and its potential photo transformations products ptps firstly two standardized biodegradation tests closed bottle test cbt and manometric respiratory test mrt were performed to assess cptx s environmental biodegradability then its photodegradability was studied using xenon and uv lamps effects of different conditions initial drug concentration ph and temperature were applied during uv photodegradation subsequently the time courses of cptx and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations were monitored throughout the photodegradation tests after that high resolution mass spectrometry was employed to elucidate the structures of the formed photo transformation products ptps in addition biodegradation tests were performed for the photolytic mixtures to assess the biodegradability of the ptps finally the eco toxicity assessment for cptx and its photolytic mixtures was predicted using different quantitative structure activity relationship q sar software cptx was found to be not readily biodegradable in cbt and mrt cptx was not eliminated by irradiation with the xenon lamp however primarily eliminated using the uv lamp the cptx elimination during uv irradiation was faster at lower concentrations cptx uv photodegradation was affected by ph value while not affected by the temperature of the irradiated solution 13 ptps were detected in uv photolysis mixtures one additional product was detected in cptx standard solution and it was degraded simultaneously with cptx during uv irradiation on one hand biodegradation assays revealed that uv photolytic mixtures of cptx containing its ptps were not better biodegradable than cptx itself on the other hand lc ms analysis showed some ptps which were eliminated after the biodegradation tests indicating possible biodegradability of these ptps this because those ptps are present in low concentrations in the photolysis mixture and their effect can be hindered by the effect of cptx and other non biodegradable ptps qsar analysis revealed that cptx and some of its ptps may have some human and or eco toxic properties in conclusion the release of cptx into aquatic environments could be harmful therefore further research focusing on cptx and its ptps are strongly recommended graphical abstract image 1 keywords thioxanthene photodegradation transformation 1 introduction the occurrence of emerging organic contaminants in the aquatic environment has been raised in recent years pharmaceuticals and their byproducts from incomplete mineralization are an important part of these contaminants and may cause adverse ecological and or human health effects rastogi et al 2014 santos et al 2010 most of these contaminants were not regulated or controlled pharmaceuticals in general and neurological drugs in particular have been found in different environmental compartments such as rivers psychiatric hospitals effluent and wastewater treatment plants in the concentration range of ng l to μg l herrmann et al 2016 writer et al 2013 yuan et al 2013 although the consumption of neurological drugs is high their potential hazard including their environmental fate and behaviour is still not well understood compared to other drugs such as antibiotics chlorprothixene cptx c18h18clns cas nr 6469 93 8 is a neuroleptic of the thioxanthene class cptx is widely used as a major tranquillizer in psychiatry anesthesiology pediatrics and in general medical practice huus and khan 1967 santiago et al 2011 it is also prescribed for anxiety and agitation because of its strong sedative effect chen et al 2012 in the year 2016 the consumption of prescribed cptx in germany was 1 8 tons schwabe et al 2017 in addition it was reported by herrmann et al that cptx is highly used in nursing homes and in psychiatric hospitals in germany herrmann et al 2015b cptx is metabolized in human bodies mainly to nor chlorprothixene and chlorprothixene sulfoxide cptx and its metabolites are excreted in urine and feces käferstein et al 2013 like other pharmaceuticals cptx will reach the influents of sewage treatment plants stps either through excretion or through unproperly drug disposal if no effluent treatment is in place cptx and its metabolites will directly enter surface water in aquatic systems cptx can undergo biotic degradation by microorganisms henning et al 2018 herrmann et al 2016 and photodegradation by sunlight or uv irradiation which is used in drinking water purification systems and is discussed for advanced wastewater treatment herrmann et al 2015a khaleel et al 2016 2017 kovalova et al 2013 despite that nothing is known about the occurrence and fate of cptx in the aquatic environment therefore more data in this respect is needed for a sound environmental risk assessment incomplete mineralization of pharmaceuticals in the environment results in the formation of new chemicals i e transformation products tps in general environmental fate and hazardous properties of tps can strongly differ from their parent compounds illés et al 2014 mahmoud et al 2014 therefore it is important to identify the structure of the possibly formed tps and to study their fate and toxic properties the research about tps is a huge and difficult task most often they are not commercially available and their synthesis or their isolation and enrichment are tedious expensive and time consuming if possible at all also there are often many tps generated from one parent compound therefore experimental investigation of individual tps is most often impossible quantitative structure activity relationships q sars are increasingly used to identify hazardous structural features therefore consequently qsar methodologies were recently suggested to be used for the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and their tps mahmoud et al 2013 menz et al 2017 the main objectives of this research were to provide for the first time data about the fate and effects of cptx and possibly within a treatment or the aquatic environment formed tps through studying biodegradability photo degradability under different conditions and toxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chlorprothixene cas number 6469 93 8 of analytical reagent grade was

experiments were performed at concentrations higher than the ones to be expected in the environment in order to be able to perform subsequently biodegradation tests which demand at least a concentration of test compound theoretical oxygen demand thod around 5 mg l in addition higher concentrations are also required to good identify the ptps and to follow their formation curves the effect of starting concentration on photolysis was addressed by testing the following range of concentrations 5 10 50 and 100 mg l xenon lamp and uv lamp were employed in order to simulate sunlight

were collected at 0 min and after 4 16 and 128 min of uv irradiation the initial concentration of cptx in the photolytic treated samples was adjusted by measuring the doc of the tested substance 0 min

photodegradation the direct photo degradation and mineralization results of 10 mg l cptx 20 c and ph 5 using xe lamp and uv lamp were followed to evaluate the fate of cptx under sunlight and uv irradiation fig 1 with xe lamp cptx showed no significant elimination or mineralization during 128 min of irradiation that is in agreement with expectation as absorbance spectrum of cptx does not significantly overlap with the emission spectrum of the xenon light source with uv lamp 10 mg l cptx was primary eliminated and partially mineralized within the first 16 min of uv irradiation 99 6 0 4 of cptx was eliminated at the same time there was no significant loss of cptx observed in dark controls so cptx underwent photolytic degradation only by the effect of the uv lamp used slower mineralization was observed and doc elimination at 16 min of uv radiation was not more than 20 after 16 min of uv radiation the doc elimination continued to increase and it reached the value of about 70 elimination after 128 min of radiation the incomplete removal of doc and the primary elimination of cptx indicate the formation of ptps during the uv irradiation at the beginning of 10 mg l cptx uv experiment the ph of the solution was 5 2 0 4 and it decreased gradually to reach the value of 3 9 0 5 at the end of the test 128 min this might indicate that the formed ptps can have acidic nature the uv photolysis curves of cptx using different initial concentrations are shown in fig 2 experiments performed at different initial concentrations fit pseudo first order kinetics with high linearity r2 0 98 with k values equal to 0 054 0 094 0 386 and 0 702 min 1 at concentrations of 100 50 10 and 5 mg l respectively fig s2 sm the degree of doc removal results showed that after 128 min of irradiation in the experiments at 100 50 10 and 5 mg l mineralization was about 14 1 19 9 69 8 and 87 1 respectively fig 2 the quantum yield was only possible to be calculated for the initial concentration of 5 mg l and it was determined to be 0 064 from the above mentioned results it is obvious that cptx elimination kinetics and the corresponding doc removal were faster at lower initial concentration this because more cptx molecules and more intermediates and ptps at higher concentrations do compete to absorb the radiant energy in the irradiated solution gutowski et al 2015 therefore degradation of cptx might be quite fast under real world conditions but it cannot be also excluded that there will be other compounds present in the environmental water i e quenching compounds as well as radiation absorbing compounds that may slow down the photo transformation process oliveira et al 2019 trovó et al 2014 in photodegradation tests of 100 mg l cptx at different temperatures 10 c 20 c 30 c and 40 c in up water ph 5 0 the photolysis and the mineralization rate values are very close fig s3 sm so the temperature showed not a highly remarkable effect on the uv photolysis of cptx the degradation kinetic rates at 10 c and 40 c are slightly faster than that at 20 c and the slowest degradation rate was observed at 30 c experiments fig s4 sm 3 2 influence of ph on photo degradation of cptx the ph influence on the photo degradation of 100 mg l cptx was investigated by performing tests at ph values ranging from 3 0 to 7 0 fig 3 in the dark controls cptx was found to be soluble at ph 7 at ph 7 cptx dissolved concentration 100 mg l decreased and the solution became a little turbid because about 25 of the added cptx precipitated photodegradation in highly alkaline ph was not studied here because cptx precipitates at higher ph and a fluctuation in the concentration at the test beginning was observed affecting the quality of the test fig s5 sm shows the soluble part in of 100 mg l cptx at different ph values the pk a value of cptx is 9 76 and it has two forms in aqueous solution fig s6 sm chemaxon 2015 marvin sketch 15 6 15 0 photodegradation of cptx at ph 3 5 and 7 fitted first order kinetics cptx shows the highest degradation rate at ph 3 in which cptx is in its protonated form hcptx the slowest degradation rate was observed at ph 5 conditions which followed first order kinetic with k value equal 0 0544 fig s7 sm under ph 3 and ph 7 conditions the degradation of cptx showed two staged degradation rates a first faster rate till 32 min of uv irradiation with k values equal 0 071 and 0 0596 respectively followed by a slower rate with k values equal 0 0434 and 0 0456 at ph 3 and ph 7 experiments respectively fig s7 sm the degradation rate at ph 7 could be not only due to the ph effect but also due to the lower dissolved concentration fig 3b shows the doc removal kinetics of cptx at studied ph values the rates of change in the degree of mineralization during irradiation at different ph experiments are nearly the same which means that ph could have a non remarkable effect on the mineralization rate of cptx 3 3 identification of cptx transformation products the lc ms total and extracted ion chromatograms were checked for samples of the uv irradiated aqueous solution of cptx 14 tps were observed and their chemical structure could be assigned respectively the log p values for the tps were predicted using qsar models table s4 sm and it helped in the differentiation between the isomers because the compound which has lower log p value is more polar and therefore should appear at relative lower tr on the applied non polar analytical column fig 4 shows the tentative photodegradation pathway of cptx according to our results table s2 sm shows cptx and its tps which are labeled according to their m z values it is obvious from table s2 sm that all the formed tps appear at lower tr than cptx itself and therefore showed lower log p values in table s4 sm so the formed tps are expected to show higher mobility and persistence in the aquatic environment in addition cptx s tps can be harder removed from water by sorption processes due to their higher polarity than cptx and thus higher water solubility reemtsma et al 2016 the fragmentation pattern for each tp can be found in figs s8 s20 sm all the observed tps had not been observed in any earlier studies in cptx standard samples before photolysis one product at m z 282 13 was observed with a low peak intensity and it degraded gradually during the uv irradiation this tp could be either an impurity or a hydrolysis transformation product and it is labeled as tp282 it has the suggested molecular formula of c18h20ns and predicted to be a de chlorinated derivative from cptx fig s9 sm two ptps were detected with m z 316 and they were labeled as ptp316 1 and ptp316 2 ptp316 1 m z 316 14 is suggested to be formed from cptx after de chlorination and di hydroxylation processes fig s10 sm ptp316 2 m z 316 09 has suggested molecular formula and relative double bond rdb value similar to cptx in addition its msn fragmentation pattern was mostly as cptx with little differences which cannot be used to suggest the difference between the two substances therefore ptp316 2 is assumed as an isomer to cptx fig s8 s11 sm five precursor ion peaks with m z 332 were observed and can be divided into two groups the first one has the exact m z value of 332 13 and the suggested molecular formula c18h22o3ns this group includes ptp332 1 ptp332 2 and ptp332 3 which are suggested to be isomers generated from cptx after de chlorination and tri hydroxylation these three ptps gave msn fragmentation patterns that are mostly the same with very little differences which allow not to differentiate them figs s12 14 sm combining the obtained fragmentation pattern and the log p values ptp332 1 can have two hydroxyl groups on the tricyclic ring and one on the first or second carbon atom of the aliphatic side chain ptp332 2 can have two hydroxyl groups on the tricyclic ring and one on the third carbon atom of the aliphatic side chain ptp332 3 can have the three hydroxyl groups on the tricyclic ring the second group has the m z value of 332 09 with the suggested molecular formula of c18h19oncls and it includes ptp332 4 and ptp332 5 they differ only in their retention time and have the same rdb values and their msn fragmentation pattern is almost the same therefore this group is identified as isomers formed by mono hydroxylation of cptx where they differ in the position of the hydroxylation figs s15 16 sm according to the log p values ptp332 4 is hydroxylated on the aliphatic sidechain and ptp332 5 on the tricyclic ring the ptp with m z 334 1 could be formed through the hydration of cptx fig s17 sm the ptp detected with m z 348 13 is suggested to be formed from the de chlorination of cptx and the addition of four hydroxyl groups fig s18 sm with m z 350 1 one ptp was observed that could have been generated from cptx after hydration and mono hydroxylation processes fig s19 sm three ptp isomers with m z 298 12 were produced from a de chlorination of cptx followed by a mono hydroxylation process fig s20 sm according to the log p predicted values the hydroxylation in ptp298 1 is likely to occur at the aliphatic sidechain as it appears at lower tr ptp298 2 and ptp298 3 are probably hydroxylated on the tricyclic ring in a study with chlorpromazine which is a structurally highly related substance trautwein and kümmerer 2012 most of the photolysis products were formed by sulfoxidation in our study the sulfoxide product was excluded because the ms2 fragment which indicates the extrusion of the so moiety 48 m z was not detected in addition our lc ms results showed a loss of water which confirms the hydroxylation at a carbon atom not at the sulfur atom furthermore the rdb values of our ptps excluded any sulfoxidation fig s21 sm shows the appearance disappearance of the tps formed with a a0 above 0 5 during the photolysis of cptx initial concentration of cptx is 100 mg l ph 5 and temperature 20 c n 3 ptp316 1 ptp298 1 and ptp334 4 are the main transformation intermediate during cptx photolysis their yields reached up to 12 6 10 5 and 6 5 a a0 respectively concentration of products ptp316 1 ptp332 1 ptp332 3 ptp32 4 ptp332 5 ptp348 ptp298 1 ptp298 2 and ptp298 3 increased quickly during the first 16 or 32 min of reaction and then decreased slowly the concentration of ptp332 2 increased slowly during the first hour and then decreased quickly while the concentration of products ptp316 2 ptp334 and ptp350 increased quickly during the first 8 min of reaction and decreased also quickly during the next 8 min at lower initial concentration the tps formed and eliminated faster than at higher concentrations fig s22 sm some tps were not detected at lower concentrations such as ptp332 3 ptp332 5 ptp348 and tp282 which are not detected at experiments performed with 5 mg l cptx this finding agrees with many other findings herrmann et al 2015a herrmann et al 2016 khaleel et al 2017 on the other hand the temperature showed no highly significant effect on the formation behavior of the tps fig s23 sm 3 4 influence of solution ph value on ptp formation the behavior of the identified tps is compared in uv photolysis experiments performed at different ph values of 3 5 and 7 fig s24 sm as the ph of the real water samples is mostly slightly alkaline so the ptps that formed with higher a a0 value in the ph 7 experiment could be more relevant to the environment it was observed that ptp316 1 was detected with the highest peaks as it showed a a0 value equal 12 6 and 9 0 in experiments performed at ph 5 and ph 7 respectively at ph 3 ptp316 1 was formed with very low a a0 value this means that the de chlorination of cptx combined with di hydroxylation processes could favorably occur in neutral and weakly acidic conditions and is unlikely to take place under strongly acidic conditions and therefore normally of high interest in the aquatic environment a similar case was also observed for ptp316 2 which was formed with a a0 value equal 3 7 and 7 1 at experiments performed at ph 5 and ph 7 respectively corresponding to only 0 6 a a0 value in the ph 3 experiment this can lead to the conclusion that the isomerization of cptx can favorably occur when the ph value increases until ph 7 and is less likely to take place in strongly acidic condition and that ptp316 2 is of interest to the environment ptp334 showed a a0 values equal 10 6 6 5 and 1 7 in experiments at ph 7 ph 5 and ph 3 respectively this indicates that hydration of cptx can more likely happen when the solution ph value increases till ph 7 and that this ptp is of further interest ptps 298 2 and 298 3 are formed with a a0 values equal 9 0 and 10 8 5 2 and 6 0 and 2 5 and 2 6 in ph 3 ph 5 and ph 7 experiments respectively this means that de chlorination and hydroxylation of the tricyclic ring in cptx molecule are favored in strongly acidic media and its occurrence is inversely proportional to the ph value and therefore they are normally of less interest in the aquatic environment the case was reversed in case of ptp298 1 which is of high interest in the environment as it formed with higher a a0 values at ph 5 and ph 7 experiments equal 13 1 and 9 6 respectively corresponding to 0 2 a a0 at ph 3 it can be concluded that de chlorination and hydroxylation of the aliphatic side chain in the cptx molecule is difficult to occur at ph 3 and is likely to take place at weak acidic and neutral conditions ptp332 3 was the one with the highest peak area formed compared with the five ptps with m z 332 its highest formation ratio was seen at ph 5 experiment 4 6 followed by ph 3 with a a0 value equal to 2 4 and its concentration was lower at ph 7 with 0 6 a a0 so it is of less interest to the environment ptp332 5 showed a a0 values of 1 2 0 9 and 0 3 in experiments performed at ph 3 ph 5 and ph 7 respectively indicating probable non significant relevant to the environment the ph had no effect on formation behavior of ptp332 1 ptp332 2 and ptp332 4 as they showed nearly similar a a0 values in experiments performed at different ph values the formation ratio of ptp350 is directly proportional to the solution ph as it showed 3 7 0 7 and 0 1 a a0 in ph 7 ph 5 and ph 3 experiments respectively the previously mentioned case is similar to ptp334 and this confirmed the previous conclusion for ptp334 in addition ptp348 has formed also with a a0 values directly proportional to the ph of the solution so ptp350 and ptp348 could be relevant to the aquatic environment tp282 was formed and eliminated with nearly the same ratio in the three compared ph experiments indicating the probability that the ph has no effect on the elimination of the chloride atom from cptx molecule 3 5 aerobic biodegradation of cptx and its tps according to the criteria of the oecd guideline all performed tests were valid fig s25 sm in comparison with the cbt mrt showed similar or only a little higher biodegradation rates table s3 sm no significant change in ph was observed in all the test vessels the biodegradation values of cptx were very low in both cbt and mrt the lc ms recoveries of cptx after 28 days in cbt and mrt were 95 8 5 3 and 99 9 7 6 respectively in agreement no tps from cptx s biodegradation was observed accordingly cptx is neither readily biodegradable nor abiotically degradable nor was it eliminated by sorption the results of the toxicity controls showed an inhibitory effect in the investigated mrt assays within the first 2 and 9 days in cptx s photodegraded samples taken at 16 and 128 min of photo treatment respectively this indicates that the inoculum s bacteria were not degrading readily biodegradable sodium acetate reference substance within the first days in the cbt this effect was not observed which can be due to the lower concentrations of the tps applied in this test the same observation was reported by rastogi et al in studying the biodegradability of diatrizoic acid photodegradation samples rastogi et al 2014 in cbt and mrt tests of cptx s irradiated samples taken after 4 16 and 128 min the oxygen consumption indicated that the formed tps are not readily biodegradable the doc elimination in these samples showed a slight increase when compared to that in cptx standard sample table s3 sm this indicates that only a few tps could be biodegradable to a certain degree or alternatively some more but only incompletely therefore the peak areas of the detected tps were compared for the start and the end of the two tests performed fig 5 the peak recoveries of lc ms analysis of samples after 28 days for some of the formed tps were around 100 thereby excluding any microbial biotransformation for these products ptp316 1 ptp316 2 ptp332 5 ptp350 ptp298 1 ptp298 2 ptp298 3 ptp282 concluding these products and the parent compound cptx to persist in the environment on the other hand some ptps showed better elimination in biodegradation tests than cptx ptp334 is biotically eliminated during the two biodegradation tests 70 3 ptp348 was mostly eliminated 99 4 with no elimination in the sterile control indicating biotic degradation four ptps with m z 332 ptp332 1 ptp332 2 ptp332 3 and ptp332 4 show high elimination in test vessels with no elimination in sterile samples indicating biotic elimination although ptp332 4 and ptp332 5 are isomers ptp332 4 is biodegradable and ptp332 5 is not therefore it can be concluded that the position of the functional group in the compound can affect the ability of the bacteria to degrade these compounds which mean that the isomerization is an important factor that can affect the biodegradability of compounds in the environment hao et al 2009 3 6 in silico prediction of properties of cptx and its tps 3 6 1 biodegradability the structure of cptx and its tps were analyzed for predicting their ready biodegradability by using in silico models the compound is classified as biodegradable or not according to certain predicted activating and deactivating alerts which are identified by all qsar models in silico prediction of ready biodegradation of the tps has been applied here in order to support our analytical results from the biodegradation tests as in biodegradation tests biodegradation of each tp was not possible as it measures the biodegradability of the mixture as all and then we measure the elimination not biodegradation of each tp using lc ms method table s4 sm summarizes the in silico models used for the predictions of the ready biodegradability of cptx and its tps the two models of oasis catalogic software and the two models of episuite software for ready biodegradability predicted the output values as 0 14 for cptx table s4 sm these output values are below the pass criterion for ready biodegradability under miti i test and mrt conditions the result from case ultra about cptx biodegradability was negative that confirmed the experimental results the five models used for ready biodegradability predicted the formed tps to be not readily biodegradable with very few non significant positive results which are not in agreement with the analytical results in addition the catalogic oecd 301f model predicted biodegradation availability values for the tps relatively higher than that predicted by catalogic oecd 301c model accordingly cptx and its tps can be categorized as a non readily biodegradable which is in agreement with the results found experimentally in the cbt and mrt on the other hand these results are not in agreement with the lc ms analytical results which suggest some tps to be biodegradable in summary in silico and the experimental biodegradation and analytical testing indicated that cptx and some of its tps are not readily biodegradable and that some other tps could be biodegradable therefore if cptx and its non biodegradable tps reach the aquatic systems like surface waters they are expected to persist in the aquatic environment this would lead to an increase in the number of hazardous substances in the aquatic environment in addition further research focusing on the biodegradability of the tps are recommended 3 6 2 toxicity the in silico prediction models for toxicity were used to assess the toxicity of the tps compared to cptx the in silico assessment of the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of cptx and its tps are summarized in table s5 sm using the different models of the ichm7 guideline conformal set from case ultra the qsar teratogenicity predictions are summarized in table s6 sm and the ecotoxicity prediction results are shown in table s7 sm ecotoxicity the v fischeri modules oasis catalogic have predicted higher ic50 for all the tps than for cptx itself indicating higher ecotoxicity for cptx in addition most of the tps formed with m z 332b 334 350 and 282 showed lower ic50 values compared with other tps therefore the previously mentioned products could be relatively more ecotoxic than the others in microtox toxicity to environmental bacteria aua v fischeri and rainbow trout toxicity aue modules cptx was assessed as inconclusive and out of domain respectively indicating that no ecotoxic prediction is possible for cptx all the suggested structures of ptp298 and ptp282 showed the same ecotoxic results as cptx in both aua and aue tests on the other hand most of the suggested structures for ptp316 ptp332a and ptp348 are predicted to be toxic to rainbow trout in the aue model only and some of the predicted structures for ptp332b are predicted toxic in the aua model vibrio fisheri only most of the established structures for ptp334 and ptp350 are predicted to be toxic against rainbow trout and vibrio fisheri the predicted active ptps is due to the presence of two or three of the positive alerts shown in fig s23 sm mutagenicity carcinogenicity and teratogenicity cptx is predicted to be a mutagen in salmonella module gt1 a7b due to the presence of two alerts id 161 and id 661 fig s23 sm cptx was active also in salmonella mutagenicity pharm salm because of the alerts id 38 and id 3230 in e coli mutagenicity models cptx gives negative results cptx is predicted to be carcinogenic in the gt expert model because of the presence of a polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic conjugated system id a3 1 and id a3 9 fig s23 sm cptx is predicted to be no teratogen by the four applied models ptp332b gave mostly the same results as cptx based on the same positive alerts as cptx the toxicity results for ptp298 and tp282 are also the same as cptx except in the gti a7b model for salmonella toxicity in which these ptps in contrast to cptx were mostly predicted as negatives this is because in ptp298 and tp282 all the alerts as cptx are present except the alert id 661 most of the established structures of ptp332a ptp348 and ptp350 are predicted non mutagenic and non carcinogenic while predicted positive teratogens in some of the applied modules the presence of many hydroxyl functional groups that give positive alerts fig s26 sm is the reason on the other hand ptp316 and ptp334 are mostly predicted to be non mutagenic non teratogenic and non carcinogenic in the used models due to the absence of positive alerts summarizing the obtained results provide indications that the activities of various tps related to the toxic endpoints studied here may be altered by photolysis of cptx in general there were indications that some tps of cptx can be toxic and these tps showed receive more attention in future studies on the other hand some tps such as ptp332a ptp334 and ptp348 are expected to be less toxic and more biodegradable than cptx and this provides a first hint for further studies on potential substitutes of cptx 4 conclusions in this study the environmental fate and behaviour of cptx were assessed for the first time by studying its biodegradability photo degradability and toxicity including possibly formed tps the obtained results showed that cptx was neither readily biodegradable nor photolyzed by xe lamp but it was primarily eliminated by uv irradiation the uv photodegradation rate of cptx was affected by cptx initial concentration and ph value of the solution while not affected by the temperature moreover it was shown that the photodegradation pathway was only slightly affected by the initial concentration and some tps were difficulty appeared at lower concentrations therefore it was possible to use a comparably high initial concentration of cptx under experimental conditions to identify and determine the characteristic fate and effects of tps uv photodegradation of cptx lead to the formation of 13 ptps none of them were reported before the main uv degradation pathway of cptx is hydroxylation combined with or without de chlorination the results of biodegradation tests showed that the tps were not readily biodegradable while lc ms analysis showed six probably biodegradable tps the in silico toxicity assessment combined with biodegradation tests provides a first indication that photodegradation of cptx by uv treatment might lead to some non biodegradable tps that are more toxic than cptx and some others possibly biodegradable tps that are less toxic than cptx therefore further investigations should be conducted regarding the environmental occurrence risk assessment and pharmacological activity of the formed ptps from cptx for this the combination of in silico methods and experimental work turned out to be very supportive acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the federal ministry of research and

19166,soluble microbial products smps are the predominate foulants determining fouling extent in membrane bioreactors mbrs however exact mechanism underlying their typical fouling behaviors remains unrevealed in this study the typical fouling behaviors of smps during initial operational period of a mbr were characterized it was found that although being low content smps rather than sludge particulates preferentially adhered to membrane surface to accumulate a gel layer and moreover specific filtration resistance sfr of smps was approximately 700 times larger than that of the sludge particulates at operational day 3 according to energy balance principle a unified thermodynamic mechanism underlying these fouling behaviors of smps was proposed thermodynamic analyses demonstrated that the attractive interaction energy strength in contact between smps and membrane was larger by around 3700 times than that between sludge particulates and membrane well explaining the extremely high adhesive ability of smps over sludge particlulates meanwhile filtration through a smps layer was modelled and simulated as a thermodynamic process simulation on an agar gel showed that about 92 6 of sfr was originated from mixing free energy change during filtration such a result satisfactorily interpreted the extremely high sfr of smps layer over sludge cake layer the revealed thermodynamic mechanism underlying smps fouling behaviors significantly deepened understanding of fouling and facilitated to development of effective fouling control strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords soluble microbial products membrane bioreactor thermodynamic analysis specific filtration resistance membrane fouling 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr has been widely adopted for wastewater treatment due to its compensation for the deficiencies of conventional activated sludge process lin et al 2012 meng et al 2017 wang et al 2014b it is estimated that the treatment capacity of mbr plants in the world exceeds 5 107 m3 d in 2019 krzeminski et al 2017 and the annual growth rate of the treatment capacity maintains about 15 judd 2016 however the rapid development of mbr technology encounters a major problem membrane fouling which has drawn the maximum attention from the research community concerning mbr technology hong et al 2016 meng et al 2017 wang et al 2014a 2014b soluble microbial products smps are defined as the pool of organic compounds that are released into the solution from substrate metabolism usually with biomass growth and biomass decay barker and stuckey 1999 while the membrane fouling in mbrs is much complicated owing to the complexity of foulants and interactions between membrane and foulants it is generally accepted that smps are the predominant foulants determining membrane fouling extent in mbrs jarusutthirak and amy 2006 tian et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 hence exploring the fouling mechanisms related with smps is critical important for mbr technology smps are related with several interesting fouling behaviours regarding adhesion and filtration smps and other particulates including sludge flocs bacteria and debris are simultaneously presented in the sludge suspension in mbrs it has been frequently reported that intense aeration could efficiently prevent adhesion of other particulates but was futile for accumulation of smps on membrane surface hong et al 2014 wang and waite 2009 smps with concentration of around 0 1 g l was reported to be much more important for foulant layer formation than biomass sludge with concentration of 5 g l lin et al 2010 moreover the accumulated smps on membrane surface would eventually form a gel layer it was found that gel layer possessed a highly porous egg box structure teng et al 2018b wang and waite 2008a and simultaneously high specific filtration resistance sfr which would be higher by thousands of times than the sludge cake layer formed in the same mbr chen et al 2016 nagaoka et al 1996 apparently these fouling behaviours related with smps are in conflict with the predictions of the convertional adhesion and filtration theories for example the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory which is currently the best favoured model theory for describing adhesion behaviors of foulants brant and childress 2002 lin et al 2014b yu et al 2018 cannot plausibly explain the extremely high adhesion propensity of smps over other particulates meanwhile since gel layer is generally porous and thin classical filtration theory represented by carman kozeny equation will predict low filtration resistance bai and leow 2002 and thus fail to interpret the extremely high sfr of gel layer mainly formed by smps in mbrs chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 other currently available fouling mechanisms including pore clogging foulant layer formation and effects of hydrodynamic conditions can neither interpret these puzzling fouling behaviors of smps in mbrs krzeminski et al 2017 lin et al 2012 meng et al 2017 wang et al 2014b this research situation indicates that the fouling mechanisms underlying these behaviors have not been exactly revealed and calls for development of new theories so that the related fouling behaviors can be efficiently controlled although it has been always a neglected area of membrane fouling thermodynamics can provide valuable mechanistic insights into fouling behaviors of smps recent studies have revealed that both of adhesion and filtration process related with smps or gel layer are kind of thermodynamic process chen et al 2012 hong et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 literature studies have suggested that interaction energy between smps and membrane surface during adhesion process would significantly vary with the separation distance between them cai et al 2018 chen et al 2012 meanwhile it was deduced that the water in smps gel layer possessed quite lower chemical potential chemical potential is the partial molar gibbs free energy than the permeate of mbrs so that drawing water from gel layer to permeate during filtration process needs an extra energy to compensate for this energy difference which will significantly add filtration resistance hong et al 2014 teng et al 2018b zhang et al 2017 obviously membrane fouling in the adhesion and filtration processes is related with significant energy change meanwhile these fouling behaviours related with smps are generally more notable in the initial operational process of mbr because the sludge characteristics will be significantly changed in this process hong et al 2014 wang and waite 2008a 2009 wang et al 2008 in this context the hypothesis of this study is that analysis from thermodynamic viewpoint during the initial operation period of a mbr system could offer a reasonable answer to above mentioned puzzling fouling behaviors of smps in mbrs such an effort may significantly deepen understanding of membrane fouling and give a boost to develop novel fouling control strategies therefore this study was conducted to provide a unified thermodynamic framework for the fouling behaviors of smps the fouling behaviors of smps during the initial operation period of a mbr was firstly characterized according to energy balance principle the representative formula to describe the thermodynamic mechanism underlying the fouling behaviors of smps were deduced and simulated this study would provide an in depth thermodynamic insight into membrane fouling 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental operation and sample preparation in current study a bench scale submerged mbr apparatus with the configuration shown in fig 1 was run for simulated municipal wastewater treatment the apparatus primarily consists of a bioreactor and a membrane module the bioreactor tank was made of polymethylmethacrylate pmma which allows to visible observation of the configuration of mbr the working volume of the bioreactor was about 26 l the membrane module consisted of a frame where 4 flat sheet membrane elements were located the membrane was made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and possessed 0 10 μm normalized pore size and 0 40 m2 effective membrane area the simulated municipal wastewater primarily consisted of glucose 300 mg cod l 1 and mineral medium the mineral medium was made up of kh2po4 7 mg p l 1 na2co3 50 mg co3 l 1 nh4 2so4 27

activated sludge was inoculated from a large local sewage treatment plant with an inoculation content of 1 g mlss l 1 peristaltic pump was used to pump out the permeate in an intermittent mode of 4 min on and 1 min off outflow flux was maintained at around 5 l m 2 h 1 lmh corresponding to a hydraulic retention time hrt of about 5 h this study focused upon the fouling behaviors and their thermodynamic mechanism during the initial operational period of the mbr this study used several types of samples which were prepared by the following procedure sludge suspension samples for filtration tests were prepared by replacing the supernatant with a phosphate buffer comprised of nacl 9 mm nah2po4 4 mm na3po4 2 mm and kcl 1 mm at ph 7 the supernatant samples were obtained by centrifuging sludge suspension at 5000 g for 5 min and then filtering through a 0 45 μm filter agar gel solution samples for filtration tests were prepared by microwave heating desolved agar solution for 10 min in order to obtain the smps and cake layer samples for contact angle measurements aforementioned supernatant sample was concentrated by thermal volatilization which was further subjected to filtration for forming a smps layer similarly sludge suspension was filtrated to a sludge cake layer thereafter the foulant layers were fasten within 2 glass slides and then placed in a dryer for 24 h 2 2 filtration resistance tests the filtration resistance of the sludge suspension concentrated smps supernatant and agar gel solution was measured in the stirred cell shanghai sinp co ltd china the effective volume and membrane area a of the cell were 50 ml and 0 00012 m2 respectively a series of filtration resistances can be calculated based on darcy s law 1 r t δ p j σ r m r p r f where δ p j and σ represent transmembrane pressure difference pa filtration flux l m 2 h 1 and permeate viscosity pa s respectively r t r m r p and r f are total resistance membrane resistance pore blocking resistance and foulant layer resistance m 1 respectively for such a stirred cell sfr of the foulants in foulant suspension could be obtained according to ognier et al 2002 2 s f r 2000 a 2 δ p b σ c s where c s is foulant concentration g l 1 b means the time to filtration ratio this ratio is equivalent to the filtration curve slope which is derived by plotting ratio of filtration time to permeate

membrane smps pristine membrane and gel layer sludge layer were considered to identify the adhesive ability of different foulants fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of these three possible interaction scenarios for the first scenario of sludge particulates pristine membrane fig 2a our recent study teng et al 2018a has developed a complete solution for interation energy evaluation reconstruction of a continuous membrane surface by atomic force microscopy afm analysis combined with triangulation technique and total interaction energy quantification by element integration sei method which incorporates the related spatial relationship this method allowed to calculate interaction energy within sludge particulates and membrane surface with randomly rough morphology the main equations involved in the calculation are shown as follows 7 u h p a r t i c u l a t e δ g h r d θ d r 8 h r d r 2 r 2 z z max where r is the radius of circular ring on particle surface nm dθ is the differential angle corresponding to the differential circular arc in the circular ring r and d are sludge particulate radius nm and the closest distance between a floc and a planar surface nm respectively z and z max are the height of point p nm and the largest height value nm respectively z max can be measured by afm analysis z of point p can be obtained in forms of x and y coordinates by eq 9 since 3 neighbouring vetexes of a triangular facet are known 9 n p 1 p n p 1 p 2 p 3 x 1 x y 1 y z 1 z 0 where n p 1 p is the vector between point p 1 and p n p 1 p 2 p 3 is the normal vector vertical to the triangular facet the calculation details could refer to teng et al 2018a the latter 2 interaction scenarios fig 2 b and c can be deemed to a scenario of 2 flat surfaces since smps are in dispersed form and small size and tend to fit membrane surface once approach to it a similar assumption has been reported in the literature wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 xdlvo theory provides primary approach for calculation of the interaction energy for the scenario of 2 flat surfaces hoek and agarwal 2006 van oss 1993 accordingly interaction energy in terms of lw ab and el adhesive

mol 1 and the absolute temperature k respectively n 1 and n 2 are the number of moles of solvent and polymer mol respectively ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the volume fraction of solvent and polymer respectively χ is the flory huggins interaction parameter which takes account of the energy of interdispersing polymer and solvent molecules chemical potential δ μ m i x is the partial molar gibbs free energy j mol

generally assumed to infinity for cross linked polymer filtration through a gel can be regarded as the inverse process of gel formation therefore the chemical potential change during gel formation should be offset in order to ensure the occurrence of gel filtration according to thermodynamic principles the chemical potential of a system will increase if an extra pressure is exerted on the system 15 δ μ m i x v b δ p where v b is the solvent molar volume m3 mol 1 v b can approximate to the molar volume of solution v m3 mol 1 for a dilute solution 2 4 analytical methods sludge suspension sample obtained from the mbr reactor was firstly centrifuged at 2500 g for 5 min gtr16 2 beijing era beili co ltd china to get supernatant sample this sample was further filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to get smps solution sample the organics in the smps solution sample were generally considered to mainly consist of smps similar procedure for smps solution sample preparation has been adopted in lots of studies barker and stuckey 1999 hong et al 2014 wang and waite 2008a 2009 smps content was normalized to be sum of polysaccharides and proteins which were colorimetrically determined by phenol sulfuric acid method and folin method respectively total smps in terms of cod content and sludge content in terms of mixed liquid suspended solids mlss concentration were also determined based on the standard methods apha 2005 considering the small size of glucose used in the feeding it may be difficult to distinguish glucose cod with smps in supernatant but the glucose concentration in the supernatant is expected to be quite low because glucose is easy to degrade and the hrt of mbr is relatively long zeta potential and contact angle represent two of the most important surface property items for a substance contact angle of probe liquid was determined according to the drip stop method by a contact angle meter kino industry co ltd usa herein probe liquids of ultrapure water glycerol and methylene iodide were choosed for contact angle measurements in order to derive the solid s surface tension components zeta potential of both of the foulants and membrane samples were measured accordingly instrument of malvern zetasizer nano zs was used to measure zeta potential of sludge suspension and supernatant samples based on electrophoretic light scattering spectrophotometer method whereas instrument of zeta 90 plus was used to measure zeta potential of membrane samples membrane surface morphology was measured by an afm instrument nt mdt and a matrix 256 256 of height values of the selected membrane was derived from the nanoscope analysis 1 7 such a matrix was translated into a continuous surface based on triangulation technique teng et al 2018a a 2 w v agar gel layer was prepared by microwave heating method a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 was utilized to characterize its structure the agar gel sample for sem observation was prepared by freezing in liquid nitrogen for 30 s followed by fixing upon a sample tray in a vacuum environment for a gold spraying process the sem characterization was operated at 5 kv interaction energy evaluation related with rough surface is quite complicated and requires massive computations in this study a self programming package operated in matlab 2016b was used to execute the massive computations 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental characterization of fouling behaviors of smps this study focused on the fouling behaviors during the initial operational period of the mbr it was observed that cod removal of the mbr system was higher than 90 since at day 3 indicating the quick adaptation of the inoculated sludge biomass to the synthetic wastewater this result was probably due to the easy biodegradability of the synthetic wastewater and the origination of the inoculated sludge which was previously used to treat municipal wastewater while the cod removal was relatively high and stable the characteristics of sludge suspension in the mbr underwent a tremendous change in the initial operational period fig 3 shows the surpnatant organic concentration in terms of cod and sludge biomass concentration in terms of mlss at day 3 day 7 and day 14 in the initial operational period of the mbr initially the surpnatant organic content is quite high as 73 7 mg cod l 1 at day 3 which was gradually reduced to 46 7 mg l 1 at day 7 and 39 1 mg l 1 at day 14 it should be noted that the smps solution sampled in this study may contain certain glucose considering the small size of glucose in the feeding and the relatively unstable operational period nevertheless the organics in the supernatant should mainly consist of smps considering easy degradation of glucose and the relatively long mbr hrt in contrast sludge biomass concentration continuously increased from 1080 mgmlss l at day 3 5260 mgmlss l 1 at day 14 the organics in supernatant in terms of proteins and polysaccharides were also measured the proteins at day 3 day 7 and day 14 were measured to be 35 78 0 50 mg l 1 15 60 1 15 mg l 1 and 27 76 0 22 mg l 1 respectively whereas the polysaccharides at day 3 day 7 and day 14 were measured to be 20 96 0 18 mg l 1 10 28 0 24 mg l 1 and 4 58 0 06 mg l 1 respectively the ratio of proteins to polysaccharides increased from 1 95 at day 3 6 06 at day 14 this increase may be attributed to the cell lysis and the easier degradation of polysaccharides than proteins for sludge biomass chen et al 2017b lee et al 2003 another important foulants extracellular polymeric substances epss by definition should be bounded in microbial aggregates and cannot solely adhere to membrane surface to form a gel layer lin et al 2014a therefore they were not considered in study of gel fouling mechanism tremendous changes in sludge characteristics in the initial operational period of mbrs have been always reported in the literature diaz et al 2016 ferraris et al 2009 mannina and di bella 2012 fig 4 shows the images of foulant layer formed on membrane surface at day 3 day 7 and day 14 in the initial mbr operational period though intensive aeration was provided a relatively thin slime and homogeneous gel layer formed on membrane surface at operation of day 3 fig 4a the formed gel layer became denser at day 7 fig 4b at day 14 the formed gel layer turned into a cake layer fig 4c the formed gel layer was identified to mainly contain proteins and polysaccharides indicating that it should be mainly formed by smps in the sludge suspension extensive research has reported that gel layer formed in mbrs primarily consisted of smps hong et al 2014 wang and waite 2008a b wang and waite 2009 wang et al 2008 sludge suspension in the mbr is a complex mixture where smps and other particulates including sludge flocs free bacteria and debris are simultaneously presented in the whole initial operational period smps content was much lower than other particulates 0 039 0 070 g l 1 v s 1 08 5 26 g l 1 however smps rather than other particulates preferentially adhered to membrane surface to form a gel layer this result indicated that smps possessed extremely higher adhesive ability than sludge particulates previous studies also frequently reported the similar observation regarding the extremely higher adhesive ability of smps wang and waite 2008a b wang and waite 2009 wang et al 2008 extensive research has been devoted to explore the causes of this phenomenon wang and waite 2008a b wang and waite 2009 wang et al 2008 yu et al 2014 it has been long suspected that smps may possess significantly different surface properties from the sludge particulates in sludge suspension wang and waite 2009 wang et al 2008 yu et al 2014 table 1 lists the surface characteristics in terms of suface contact angle and zeta potential of the smps layer sludge flocs and membrane in this study obviously smps layer and sludge flocs in this study had similar values of suface zeta potential and contact angles therefore the extremely great difference of adhesive ability between the smps and the sludge particulates was not likely caused by the small difference in these surface characteristics and should reside in other aspects the underlying mechanism will be significantly explored in section 3 2 fig 5 shows the sfr of the sludge biomass and supernatant smps solution at day 3 day 7 and day 14 in the initial operational period of the mbr the biomass of sludge suspension and supernatant solution mainly contains the sludge biomass and smps respectively as shown in fig 5 at day 3 the sfr of smps is about 700 times of that of the sludge biomass 2 66 1016 m kg 1 v s 3 99 1013 m kg 1 although smps content is only 1 37 of the latter in the sludge suspension similar great sfr differences between the smps and sludge biomass can be observed at day 7 and day 14 the similar fouling behaviors of smps regarding higher adhesion ability and sfr over sludge biomass have been reported in the literature wang and waite 2008a b wang and waite 2009 wang et al 2008 these fouling behaviors are obviously anomalous because their underlying mechanism has not been well revealed these fouling behaviors cannot be efficiently regulated or controlled without revealing their exact mechanism it is generally believed that sfr of foulants is closely related with foulant surface characteristics choi et al 2006 liang et al 2013 yu et al 2014 however with the similar surface characteristics of zeta potential and contact angle between the 2 foulants the exact mechanism of the giant sfr differences between the smps and sludge biomass should be further explored 3 2 interpretation to the high adhesive ability of smps from thermodynamic viewpoint the adhesive ability can be measured by the interaction energy within foulant and membrane according to teng et al 2018a such a measurement primarily required reconstructing surface morphology of membrane and addressing surface characteristics of both foulants and membrane table 1 lists the surface characteristics in terms of suface contact angle and zeta potential of the smps layer sludge flocs and membrane in this study fig 6 shows the afm scanned image and the reconstructed continuous morphology of the pvdf membrane the surface characteristics and the membrane surface morphology definitely affect interaction energy within foulant and membrane surface bhattacharjee et al 1998 cai et al 2017 hoek and agarwal 2006 qu et al 2018 these data were used for interaction energy calculation herein 3 interaction scenarios as shown in fig 7 namely sludge particulates pristine membrane smps pristine membrane and gel layer sludge layer were considered to identify the adhesive ability of different foulants fig 7 shows the interaction energy profiles for the 3 interaction scenarios between sludge particulates pristine membrane smps pristine membrane and gel layer sludge layer it can be seen that for all the 3 interaction scenarios the individual interation energies and the total interaction energy show the same change trend with the separation distance within the 2 interaction surfaces especially the attractive total interaction energy has a rather high sensitivity to the separation distance moreover the total interaction energy strength within sludge particulates and pristine membrane is very weak as compared with those for other 2 interaction scenarios it is generally accepted that total interaction energy at minimum separation distance d 0 0 158 nm u f w m t o t d 0 is a critical index of adhesive ability of a foulant bhattacharjee et al 1998 chen et al 2012 2017a van oss 1993 in fig 7 u f w m t o t d 0 is 32 4 103 kt 12 1 107 kt 17 5 107 kt for the 3 interaction scenarios respectively it should be particularly noted that u f w m t o t d 0 within smps and the pristine membrane is greater by over 3700 times than that within sludge particulates and the pristine membrane for unit membrane surface area this means that under conditions in this study the adhesive ability of smps is over 3700 times of that of sludge particulates this result can plausibly explain the preferential adhesion of smps upon membrane surface fig 4a and b u f w m t o t d 0 within sludge layer and gel layer is even more strengthened than that within smps and the pristine membrane 17 5 107 kt v s 12 1 107 kt this means that the formed gel layer will facilitate to the following adhesion of sludge particulates to form a cake layer well explaining the phenomenon shown in fig 4c therefore thermodynamic assessment of interactions provides a satisfactory interpretation to the extremely high adhesive ability of smps since the surface characteristics in terms of zeta potential and contact angles are similar for smps and sludge particlulates the result of over 3700 times difference in adhesive ability between them seems very anomalous actually this result should be reasonable as considering the totally different morphology of them the total interaction energy between 2 entities is short ranged and very sensitive to the separation distance bhattacharjee et al 1998 brant and childress 2002 chen et al 2012 hoek and agarwal 2006 hong et al 2013 van oss 1993 for a relatively large particle like sludge floc the real separation distance between most of floc surface area and membrane surface is relatively long even when the floc contacts to the membrane surface shown in fig 9 c moreover the surface of the pristine membrane was very rough with a roughness range of 206 7 158 1 nm shown in fig 6a this will even enlarge the real separation distance however for smps due to the dispersed form and small size they tend to fit rough membrane surface morphology jacquin et al 2017 tansel et al 2006 as a result most surface area of smps can get close to membrane surface significantly reducing the real separation distance when they contact to membrane surface in this context it is suggested that the morphology of smps significantly contributes to the extremely high adhesive ability of smps to membrane surface 3 3 interpretation to the high sfr of gel layer 3 3 1 thermodynamic insights into gel filtration the mass of gel layer was mainly originated from smps in the mbr in order to explore the general thermodynamic mechanism underlying the gel s high sfr agar was selected to be a model gel agent for study considering its easiness for gel formation cost effectiveness relatively simple chemical composition and similar behaviors to smps wang and waite 2009 yarnpakdee et al 2015 fig 8 shows the sem structure image of a 2 w v agar gel the agar gel sample in fig 8 possesses large size pores and high porosity according to classical filtration theory represented by carman kozeny equation bai and leow 2002 large pore size and high porosity correspond to low filtration resistance and sfr clearly classical filtration theory could not interpret the extremely high sfr of gel layer the extremely high sfr of gel layer over cake layer however can be reasonably explained if considering energy balance principle and foulant layer structure fig 9 illustrates the schematic of smps polymeric structure gel layer and cake layer upon membrane surface in the mbr as demonstrated in fig 9a smps have a cross linked matrix due to effects of multivalent cation bridging and entanglement lin et al 2014a raszka et al 2006 such a matrix is always called as egg box structure lee et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 which provides the backbone of a gel layer upon membrane surface such a physical structure can be verified by fig 8 the cross linked polymeric chains have strong interactions with water as results of mixing dissolution and changes of enthalpy and entropy borchard and steinbrecht 1991 lei et al 2016 mönch et al 2006 as shown in fig 9b although the backbone of gel layer is porous there is almost no visible pore through the gel layer as the gel layer is relatively homogeneous from thermodynamic viewpoint formation of a homogeneous gel layer is favorable in energy or in other words is of a spontaneous process the polymeric matrix tends to adsorb mix as much water as possible swelling process because in this way the entropy of gel layer is largest as compared to the sum of entropy of pure water and pure polymeric matrix sakai et al 2014 and so that the formed gel layer is most stable fig 3 a and b show that a relatively homogeneous and slime gel layer could spontaneously form in the mbr providing the experimental evidence supporting the real occurrence of the thermodynamic mechanism underlying the gel layer formation owning to lack of visible pores through gel layer as illustrated as the cross section picture of gel layer shown in fig 9b filtration through gel layer needs to drag mixing bound water from gel to the permeate side which definitely results in high filtration resistance as compared with gel layer sludge cake layer always possesses relatively low filtration resistance this phenomenon can be explained by the structure of cake layer fig 9c shows that there exist some visible connected pores through the cake layer because it is formed by sludge particulates with relatively large size and certain rigidity as illustrated as the cross section picture of cake layer shown in fig 9c the filtration resistance of an ideal cake layer can be even correctly calculated by carman kozeny equation bai and leow 2002 as all this study revealed the exact thermodynamic mechanism underlying filtration behaviours of a gel layer 3 3 2 modelling and simulation of sfr of gel layer above mentioned section revealed the general thermodynamic mechanism but only provided a qualitative interpretation to the high sfr of gel layer therefore modelling and simulation of sfr of gel layer were performed in order to provide a quantitative interpretation to the high sfr of gel layer due to the complicated components of the real gel model gel agar gel in this study was used for modelling and simulation in order to well document the universal mechanism underlying the gel filtration this is a general operation for mechanism research according to energy balance principle extra energy needs to be provided to balance the energy gap between the gel layer and the permeate our previous study chen et al 2016 has linked the chemical potential change to sfr during filtration through a gel layer combining eq 1 with eqs 14 and 15 the gel sfr caused by the free energy change can be given by 16 s f r r t m g v b j σ ln 1 φ 2 ϕ 2 χ φ 2 2 where m g is the dry mass of gel layer kg for a model gel like agar gel values of the critical parameters v b χ m g φ 2 j and σ can refer to the literature or be experimtally measured therefore the deduced model can be simulated for a gel layer it should be noted that deduction of eq 16 is based on the basic thermodynamic principles energy balance principle correctness of all the involved equations and the thermodynamic principles used for model deduction has been well verified in order to simulate the deduced model the involved parameter data were experimtally measured or referred to the literature as for the experimental measurements foulants in 3 different operational days were used and each sample was characterized in triplication all these aspects can ensure the reliability and repeatability of the obtained results the agar gel solution was filtrated in dead end mode the corresponding sfr was experimentally measured according to eq 2 and simultaneously simulated in theory according to eq 16 table 2 presents the parameters data used to calculate the sfr of the agar gel solution under conditions in this study the experimentally measured sfr and the simulated sfr are 2 03 1016 m kg 1 and 1 88 1016 m kg 1 for the agar gel respectively it is clear that the simulated sfr is quite close to the experimentally measured value accounting for 92 6 suggesting the feasibility of the proposed thermodynamic mechanism to interpret the high sfr of gel layer it is should noted that there is still a small gap between the simulated and the experimentally measured sfr values existence of a small gap is reasonable because the simulation only accounts for mixting chemical potential energy change while ignores other minor energy changes during gel filtration according to flory huggins theory mönch et al 2006 petrovic et al 1987 the energy change during gel formation primarily consists of three components mixting free energy elastic free energy and ion free energy among them mixting free energy is major while elastic free energy and ion free energy are minor and may totally account for 5 15 of total energy change teng et al 2018b therefore the thermodynamic mechanism could plausibly interpret the high sfr of gel layer mainly formed by smps in literature extensive efforts have been made to investigate membrane fouling while significant achievements have been obtained previous studies simply attributed membrane fouling to pore clogging foulant layer formation or effects of hydrodynamic conditions krzeminski et al 2017 lin et al 2012 meng et al 2017 wang et al 2014b however the fouling behaviors of one of the major foulants namely smps can not be reasonably explained by currently available fouling theory this situation highly impeded understanding and control of membrane fouling from energy viewpoint this study proposed thermodynamic mechanisms and satisfactorily interpreted the typical fouling behaviors of smps this study improved fundamental insights into membrane fouling 3 4 summary of the unified mechanism and its implications based on the aforementioned sections a unified thermodynamic mechanism underlying the anomalous fouling behaviors of smps can be implicitly summarized fig 10 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed unified thermodynamic mechanism basically the proposed mechanism unifies the adhesion mechanism and filtration mechanism related with smps from viewpoint of energy thermodynamics change for adhesion process as shown in fig 10 there is more strengthened adhesive energy between smps and membrane surface than that between sludge particulates and membrane surface for unit membrane area the strengthened adhesive energy related with smps is mainly caused by their dispersed form and small size when they get close to membrane they tend to fit rough membrane surface morphology jacquin et al 2017 tansel et al 2006 and thus significantly reduce the separation distance resulting in a more strengthened adhesive energy as compared to sludge particulates the energy calculation based on xdlvo approaches showed that u f w m t o t d 0 within smps and the pristine membrane was greater by over 3700 times than that within sludge particulates and the pristine membrane for unit membrane surface area under conditions in this study the quantitative results well explained the preferential adhesion of smps over sludge particulates on membrane surface in the mbr for filtration process there is also a significant energy change when the permeat is dragged out from the gel layer mainly formed by smps fig 10 this energy change can be quantified based on flory huggins theory this study further linked this energy change with gel sfr according to the thermodynamic principles allowing to quantification of the gel sfr the quantification results showed that under conditions in this study the simulated sfr was 1 88 1016 m kg 1 for the agar gel very close to the experimentally measured sfr of 2 03 1016 m kg 1 therefore the thermodynamic mechanism well explained the extremely high sfr of gel layer in the mbr currently it is generally considered that membrane fouling in mbrs is caused by pore blocking foulant layer formation and or concentration polarization meng et al 2009 wang et al 2014c honestly there mechanisms were based on physical observation and not in depth from energy viewpoint this study proposed a more essential and deeper fouling mechanism which unified adhesion process and filtration process related with smps any breakthroughs in essential mechanism may bring new control strategies it is suggested that the proposed mechanism would offer important implications for membrane fouling control for example the proposed mechanism predicts the importance of surface morphology to foulant adhesion in nature the super anti adhesion ability of lotus nelumbo nucifera leaf inspires worldwide researchers to fabricate membranes with special surface morphology ganesh et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 the proposed mechanism should be very conductive to develop such a biomimetic measure for fouling control meanwhile the proposed mechanism also suggests that the energy change during gel filtration is directly dependent of the cross linking degree of polymers any measures to break the cross linking structure will significantly reduce the filtration resistance offering new idea to establish effective fouling control measures 4 conclusions fouling behaviors of soluble microbial products smps during initial operation period of a membrane bioreactor mbr were characterized while being low content smps other than sludge particulates preferentially adhered to membrane surface to form a gel layer meanwhile smps possessed a specific filtration resistance sfr which could be about 700 times over that of sludge particulates these fouling behaviors could be plausibly explained by a unified thermodynamic mechanism based on energy balance principle under conditions in this study the strength of the attractive interaction energy in contact between smps and membrane was over 3700 times of that between sludge particulates and membrane resulting in the extremely high adhesive ability of smps modelling and simulating filtration through a smps layer showed that energy change caused high sfr and about 92 6 of sfr was originated from mixing free energy change during filtration this study provided a unified thermodynamic framework for the fouling behaviors of smps and significantly improved the fundamental understanding of fouling acknowledgements this study was financially supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51578509 
19166,soluble microbial products smps are the predominate foulants determining fouling extent in membrane bioreactors mbrs however exact mechanism underlying their typical fouling behaviors remains unrevealed in this study the typical fouling behaviors of smps during initial operational period of a mbr were characterized it was found that although being low content smps rather than sludge particulates preferentially adhered to membrane surface to accumulate a gel layer and moreover specific filtration resistance sfr of smps was approximately 700 times larger than that of the sludge particulates at operational day 3 according to energy balance principle a unified thermodynamic mechanism underlying these fouling behaviors of smps was proposed thermodynamic analyses demonstrated that the attractive interaction energy strength in contact between smps and membrane was larger by around 3700 times than that between sludge particulates and membrane well explaining the extremely high adhesive ability of smps over sludge particlulates meanwhile filtration through a smps layer was modelled and simulated as a thermodynamic process simulation on an agar gel showed that about 92 6 of sfr was originated from mixing free energy change during filtration such a result satisfactorily interpreted the extremely high sfr of smps layer over sludge cake layer the revealed thermodynamic mechanism underlying smps fouling behaviors significantly deepened understanding of fouling and facilitated to development of effective fouling control strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords soluble microbial products membrane bioreactor thermodynamic analysis specific filtration resistance membrane fouling 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr has been widely adopted for wastewater treatment due to its compensation for the deficiencies of conventional activated sludge process lin et al 2012 meng et al 2017 wang et al 2014b it is estimated that the treatment capacity of mbr plants in the world exceeds 5 107 m3 d in 2019 krzeminski et al 2017 and the annual growth rate of the treatment capacity maintains about 15 judd 2016 however the rapid development of mbr technology encounters a major problem membrane fouling which has drawn the maximum attention from the research community concerning mbr technology hong et al 2016 meng et al 2017 wang et al 2014a 2014b soluble microbial products smps are defined as the pool of organic compounds that are released into the solution from substrate metabolism usually with biomass growth and biomass decay barker and stuckey 1999 while the membrane fouling in mbrs is much complicated owing to the complexity of foulants and interactions between membrane and foulants it is generally accepted that smps are the predominant foulants determining membrane fouling extent in mbrs jarusutthirak and amy 2006 tian et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 hence exploring the fouling mechanisms related with smps is critical important for mbr technology smps are related with several interesting fouling behaviours regarding adhesion and filtration smps and other particulates including sludge flocs bacteria and debris are simultaneously presented in the sludge suspension in mbrs it has been frequently reported that intense aeration could efficiently prevent adhesion of other particulates but was futile for accumulation of smps on membrane surface hong et al 2014 wang and waite 2009 smps with concentration of around 0 1 g l was reported to be much more important for foulant layer formation than biomass sludge with concentration of 5 g l lin et al 2010 moreover the accumulated smps on membrane surface would eventually form a gel layer it was found that gel layer possessed a highly porous egg box structure teng et al 2018b wang and waite 2008a and simultaneously high specific filtration resistance sfr which would be higher by thousands of times than the sludge cake layer formed in the same mbr chen et al 2016 nagaoka et al 1996 apparently these fouling behaviours related with smps are in conflict with the predictions of the convertional adhesion and filtration theories for example the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory which is currently the best favoured model theory for describing adhesion behaviors of foulants brant and childress 2002 lin et al 2014b yu et al 2018 cannot plausibly explain the extremely high adhesion propensity of smps over other particulates meanwhile since gel layer is generally porous and thin classical filtration theory represented by carman kozeny equation will predict low filtration resistance bai and leow 2002 and thus fail to interpret the extremely high sfr of gel layer mainly formed by smps in mbrs chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 other currently available fouling mechanisms including pore clogging foulant layer formation and effects of hydrodynamic conditions can neither interpret these puzzling fouling behaviors of smps in mbrs krzeminski et al 2017 lin et al 2012 meng et al 2017 wang et al 2014b this research situation indicates that the fouling mechanisms underlying these behaviors have not been exactly revealed and calls for development of new theories so that the related fouling behaviors can be efficiently controlled although it has been always a neglected area of membrane fouling thermodynamics can provide valuable mechanistic insights into fouling behaviors of smps recent studies have revealed that both of adhesion and filtration process related with smps or gel layer are kind of thermodynamic process chen et al 2012 hong et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 literature studies have suggested that interaction energy between smps and membrane surface during adhesion process would significantly vary with the separation distance between them cai et al 2018 chen et al 2012 meanwhile it was deduced that the water in smps gel layer possessed quite lower chemical potential chemical potential is the partial molar gibbs free energy than the permeate of mbrs so that drawing water from gel layer to permeate during filtration process needs an extra energy to compensate for this energy difference which will significantly add filtration resistance hong et al 2014 teng et al 2018b zhang et al 2017 obviously membrane fouling in the adhesion and filtration processes is related with significant energy change meanwhile these fouling behaviours related with smps are generally more notable in the initial operational process of mbr because the sludge characteristics will be significantly changed in this process hong et al 2014 wang and waite 2008a 2009 wang et al 2008 in this context the hypothesis of this study is that analysis from thermodynamic viewpoint during the initial operation period of a mbr system could offer a reasonable answer to above mentioned puzzling fouling behaviors of smps in mbrs such an effort may significantly deepen understanding of membrane fouling and give a boost to develop novel fouling control strategies therefore this study was conducted to provide a unified thermodynamic framework for the fouling behaviors of smps the fouling behaviors of smps during the initial operation period of a mbr was firstly characterized according to energy balance principle the representative formula to describe the thermodynamic mechanism underlying the fouling behaviors of smps were deduced and simulated this study would provide an in depth thermodynamic insight into membrane fouling 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental operation and sample preparation in current

activated sludge was inoculated from a large local sewage treatment plant with an inoculation content of 1 g mlss l 1 peristaltic pump was used to pump out the permeate in an intermittent mode of 4 min on and 1 min off outflow flux was maintained at around 5 l m 2 h 1 lmh corresponding to a hydraulic retention time hrt of about 5 h this study focused upon the fouling behaviors and their thermodynamic mechanism during the initial operational period of the mbr this study used several types of samples which were prepared by the following procedure sludge suspension samples for filtration tests were prepared by replacing the supernatant with a phosphate buffer comprised of nacl 9 mm nah2po4 4 mm na3po4 2 mm and kcl 1 mm at ph 7 the supernatant samples were obtained by centrifuging sludge suspension at 5000 g for 5 min and then filtering through a 0 45 μm filter agar gel solution samples for filtration tests were prepared by microwave heating desolved agar solution for 10 min in order to obtain the smps and cake layer samples for contact angle measurements aforementioned supernatant sample was concentrated by thermal volatilization which was further subjected to filtration for forming a smps layer similarly sludge suspension was filtrated to a sludge cake layer thereafter the foulant layers were fasten within 2 glass slides and then placed in a dryer for 24 h

membrane smps pristine membrane and gel layer sludge layer were considered to identify the adhesive ability of different foulants fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of these three possible interaction scenarios for the first scenario of sludge particulates pristine membrane fig 2a our recent study teng et al 2018a has developed a complete solution for interation energy evaluation reconstruction of a continuous membrane surface by atomic force microscopy afm analysis combined with triangulation technique and total interaction energy quantification by element integration sei method which incorporates the related spatial relationship this method allowed to calculate interaction energy within sludge particulates and membrane surface with randomly rough morphology the main equations involved in the calculation are shown as follows 7 u h p a r t i c u l a t e δ g h r d θ d r 8 h r d r 2 r 2 z z max where r is the radius of circular ring on particle surface nm dθ is the differential angle corresponding to the differential circular arc in the circular ring r and d are sludge particulate radius nm and the closest distance between a floc and a planar surface nm respectively z and z max are the height of point p nm and the largest height value nm respectively z max can be measured by afm analysis z of point p can be obtained in forms of x and y coordinates by eq 9 since 3 neighbouring vetexes of a triangular facet are known 9 n p 1 p n p 1 p 2 p 3 x 1 x y 1 y z 1 z 0 where n p 1 p is the vector between point p 1 and p n p 1 p 2 p 3 is the normal vector vertical to the triangular facet the calculation details could refer to teng et al 2018a the latter 2 interaction scenarios fig 2 b and c can be deemed to a scenario of 2 flat surfaces since smps are in dispersed form and small size and tend to fit membrane surface once approach to it a similar assumption has been reported in the literature wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 xdlvo theory provides primary approach for calculation of the interaction energy for the scenario of 2 flat surfaces hoek and agarwal 2006 van oss 1993 accordingly interaction energy in terms of lw ab and el adhesive

gibbs energy change g mix j chen et al 2016 flory 1941 this energy change can be described as 13 δ g m i x r t n 1 ln ϕ 1 n 2 ln ϕ 2 n 1 ϕ 2 χ where r and t are the universal gas constant 8 31 j k 1 mol 1 and the absolute temperature k respectively n 1 and n 2 are the number of moles of solvent and polymer mol respectively ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the volume fraction of solvent and polymer respectively χ

generally assumed to infinity for cross linked polymer filtration through a gel can be regarded as the inverse process of gel formation therefore the chemical potential change during gel formation should be offset in order to ensure the occurrence of gel filtration according to thermodynamic principles the chemical potential of a system will increase if an extra pressure is exerted on the system 15 δ μ m i x v b δ p where v b is the solvent molar volume m3 mol 1 v b can approximate to the molar volume of solution v m3 mol 1 for a dilute solution 2 4 analytical methods sludge suspension sample obtained from the mbr reactor was firstly centrifuged at 2500 g for 5 min gtr16 2 beijing era beili co ltd china to get supernatant sample this sample was further filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to get smps solution sample the organics in the smps solution sample were generally considered to mainly consist of smps similar procedure for smps solution sample preparation has been adopted in lots of studies barker and stuckey 1999 hong et al 2014 wang and waite 2008a 2009 smps content was normalized to be sum of polysaccharides and proteins which were colorimetrically determined by phenol sulfuric acid method and folin method respectively total smps in terms of cod content and sludge content in terms of mixed liquid suspended solids mlss concentration were also determined based on the standard methods apha 2005 considering the small size of glucose used in the feeding it may be difficult to distinguish glucose cod with smps in supernatant but the glucose concentration in the supernatant is expected to be quite low because glucose is easy to degrade and the hrt of mbr is relatively long zeta potential and contact angle represent two of the most important surface property items for a substance contact angle of probe liquid was determined according to the drip stop method by a contact angle meter kino industry co ltd usa herein probe liquids of ultrapure water glycerol and methylene iodide were choosed for contact angle measurements in order to derive the solid s surface tension components zeta potential of both of the foulants and membrane samples were measured accordingly instrument of malvern zetasizer nano zs was used to measure zeta potential of sludge suspension and supernatant samples based on electrophoretic light scattering spectrophotometer method whereas instrument of zeta 90 plus was used to measure zeta potential of membrane samples membrane surface morphology was measured by an afm instrument nt mdt and a matrix 256 256 of height values of the selected membrane was derived from the nanoscope analysis 1 7 such a matrix was translated into a continuous surface based on triangulation technique teng et al 2018a a 2 w v agar gel layer was prepared by microwave heating method a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 was utilized to characterize its structure the agar gel sample for sem observation was prepared by freezing in liquid nitrogen for 30 s followed by fixing upon a sample tray in a vacuum environment for a gold spraying process the sem characterization was operated at 5 kv interaction energy evaluation related with rough surface is quite complicated and requires massive computations in this study a self programming package operated in matlab 2016b was used to execute the massive computations 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental characterization of fouling behaviors of smps this study focused on the fouling behaviors during the initial operational period of the mbr it was observed that cod removal of the mbr system was higher than 90 since at day 3 indicating the quick adaptation of the inoculated sludge biomass to the synthetic wastewater this result was probably due to the easy biodegradability of the synthetic wastewater and the origination of the inoculated sludge which was previously used to treat municipal wastewater while the cod removal was relatively high and stable the characteristics of sludge suspension in the mbr underwent a tremendous change in the initial operational period fig 3 shows the surpnatant organic concentration in terms of cod and sludge biomass concentration in terms of mlss at day 3 day 7 and day 14 in the initial operational period of the mbr initially the surpnatant organic content is quite high as 73 7 mg cod l 1 at day 3 which was gradually reduced to 46 7 mg l 1 at day 7 and 39 1 mg l 1 at day 14 it should be noted that the smps solution sampled in this study may contain certain glucose considering the small size of glucose in the feeding and the relatively unstable operational period nevertheless the organics in the supernatant should mainly consist of smps considering easy degradation of glucose and the relatively long mbr hrt in contrast sludge biomass concentration continuously increased from 1080 mgmlss l at day 3 5260 mgmlss l 1 at day 14 the organics in supernatant in terms of proteins and polysaccharides were also measured the proteins at day 3 day 7 and day 14 were measured to be 35 78 0 50 mg l 1 15 60 1 15 mg l 1 and 27 76 0 22 mg l 1 respectively whereas the polysaccharides at day 3 day 7 and day 14 were measured to be 20 96 0 18 mg l 1 10 28 0 24 mg l 1 and 4 58 0 06 mg l 1 respectively the ratio of proteins to polysaccharides increased from 1 95 at day 3 6 06 at day 14 this increase may be attributed to the cell lysis and the easier degradation of polysaccharides than proteins for sludge biomass chen et al 2017b lee et al 2003 another important foulants extracellular polymeric substances epss by definition should be bounded in microbial aggregates and cannot solely adhere to membrane surface to form a gel layer lin et al 2014a therefore they were not considered in study of gel fouling mechanism tremendous changes in sludge characteristics in the initial operational period of mbrs have been always reported in the literature diaz et al 2016 ferraris et al 2009 mannina and di bella 2012 fig 4 shows the images of foulant layer formed on membrane surface at day 3 day 7 and day 14 in the initial mbr operational period though intensive aeration was provided a relatively thin slime and homogeneous gel layer formed on membrane surface at operation of day 3 fig 4a the formed gel layer became denser at day 7 fig 4b at day 14 the formed gel layer turned into a cake layer fig 4c the formed gel layer was identified to mainly contain proteins and polysaccharides indicating that it should be mainly formed by smps in the sludge suspension extensive research has reported that gel layer formed in mbrs primarily consisted of smps hong et al 2014 wang and waite 2008a b wang and waite 2009 wang et al 2008 sludge suspension in the mbr is a complex mixture where smps and other particulates including sludge flocs free bacteria and debris are simultaneously presented in the whole initial operational period smps content was much lower than other particulates 0 039 0 070 g l 1 v s 1 08 5 26 g l 1 however smps rather than other particulates preferentially adhered to membrane surface to form a gel layer this result indicated that smps possessed extremely higher adhesive ability than sludge particulates previous studies also frequently reported the similar observation regarding the extremely higher adhesive ability of smps wang and waite 2008a b wang and waite 2009 wang et al 2008 extensive research has been devoted to explore the causes of this phenomenon wang and waite 2008a b wang and waite 2009 wang et al 2008 yu et al 2014 it has been long suspected that smps may possess significantly different surface properties from the sludge particulates in sludge suspension wang and waite 2009 wang et al 2008 yu et al 2014 table 1 lists the surface characteristics in terms of suface contact angle and zeta potential of the smps layer sludge flocs and membrane in this study obviously smps layer and sludge flocs in this study had similar values of suface zeta potential and contact angles therefore the extremely great difference of adhesive ability between the smps and the sludge particulates was not likely caused by the small difference in these surface characteristics and should reside in other aspects the underlying mechanism will be significantly explored in section 3 2 fig 5 shows the sfr of the sludge biomass and supernatant smps solution at day 3 day 7 and day 14 in the initial operational period of the mbr the biomass of sludge suspension and supernatant solution mainly contains the sludge biomass and smps respectively as shown in fig 5 at day 3 the sfr of smps is about 700 times of that of the sludge biomass 2 66 1016 m kg 1 v s 3 99 1013 m kg 1 although smps content is only 1 37 of the latter in the sludge suspension similar great sfr differences between the smps and sludge biomass can be observed at day 7 and day 14 the similar fouling behaviors of smps regarding higher adhesion ability and sfr over sludge biomass have been reported in the literature wang and waite 2008a b wang and waite 2009 wang et al 2008 these fouling behaviors are obviously anomalous because their underlying mechanism has not been well revealed these fouling behaviors cannot be efficiently regulated or controlled without revealing their exact mechanism it is generally believed that sfr of foulants is closely related with foulant surface characteristics choi et al 2006 liang et al 2013 yu et al 2014 however with the similar surface characteristics of zeta potential and contact angle between the 2 foulants the exact mechanism of the giant sfr differences between the smps and sludge biomass should be further explored 3 2 interpretation to the high adhesive ability of smps from thermodynamic viewpoint the adhesive ability can be measured by the interaction energy within foulant and membrane according to teng et al 2018a such a measurement primarily required reconstructing surface morphology of membrane and addressing surface characteristics of both foulants and membrane table 1 lists the surface characteristics in terms of suface contact angle and zeta potential of the smps layer sludge flocs and membrane in this study fig 6 shows the afm scanned image and the reconstructed continuous morphology of the pvdf membrane the surface characteristics and the membrane surface morphology definitely affect interaction energy within foulant and membrane surface bhattacharjee et al 1998 cai et al 2017 hoek and agarwal 2006 qu et al 2018 these data were used for interaction energy calculation herein 3 interaction scenarios as shown in fig 7 namely sludge particulates pristine membrane smps pristine membrane and gel layer sludge layer were considered to identify the adhesive ability of different foulants fig 7 shows the interaction energy profiles for the 3 interaction scenarios between sludge particulates pristine membrane smps pristine membrane and gel layer sludge layer it can be seen that for all the 3 interaction scenarios the individual interation energies and the total interaction energy show the same change trend with the separation distance within the 2 interaction surfaces especially the attractive total interaction energy has a rather high sensitivity to the separation distance moreover the total interaction energy strength within sludge particulates and pristine membrane is very weak as compared with those for other 2 interaction scenarios it is generally accepted that total interaction energy at minimum separation distance d 0 0 158 nm u f w m t o t d 0 is a critical index of adhesive ability of a foulant bhattacharjee et al 1998 chen et al 2012 2017a van oss 1993 in fig 7 u f w m t o t d 0 is 32 4 103 kt 12 1 107 kt 17 5 107 kt for the 3 interaction scenarios respectively it should be particularly noted that u f w m t o t d 0 within smps and the pristine membrane is greater by over 3700 times than that within sludge particulates and the pristine membrane for unit membrane surface area this means that under conditions in this study the adhesive ability of smps is over 3700 times of that of sludge particulates this result can plausibly explain the preferential adhesion of smps upon membrane surface fig 4a and b u f w m t o t d 0 within sludge layer and gel layer is even more strengthened than that within smps and the pristine membrane 17 5 107 kt v s 12 1 107 kt this means that the formed gel layer will facilitate to the following adhesion of sludge particulates to form a cake layer well explaining the phenomenon shown in fig 4c therefore thermodynamic assessment of interactions provides a satisfactory interpretation to the extremely high adhesive ability of smps since the surface characteristics in terms of zeta potential and contact angles are similar for smps and sludge particlulates the result of over 3700 times difference in adhesive ability between them seems very anomalous actually this result should be reasonable as considering the totally different morphology of them the total interaction energy between 2 entities is short ranged and very sensitive to the separation distance bhattacharjee et al 1998 brant and childress 2002 chen et al 2012 hoek and agarwal 2006 hong et al 2013 van oss 1993 for a relatively large particle like sludge floc the real separation distance between most of floc surface area and membrane surface is relatively long even when the floc contacts to the membrane surface shown in fig 9 c moreover the surface of the pristine membrane was very rough with a roughness range of 206 7 158 1 nm shown in fig 6a this will even enlarge the real separation distance however for smps due to the dispersed form and small size they tend to fit rough membrane surface morphology jacquin et al 2017 tansel et al 2006 as a result most surface area of smps can get close to membrane surface significantly reducing the real separation distance when they contact to membrane surface in this context it is suggested that the morphology of smps significantly contributes to the extremely high adhesive ability of smps to membrane surface 3 3 interpretation to the high sfr of gel layer 3 3 1 thermodynamic insights into gel filtration the mass of gel layer was mainly originated from smps in the mbr in order to explore the general thermodynamic mechanism underlying the gel s high sfr agar was selected to be a model gel agent for study considering its easiness for gel formation cost effectiveness relatively simple chemical composition and similar behaviors to smps wang and waite 2009 yarnpakdee et al 2015 fig 8 shows the sem structure image of a 2 w v agar gel the agar gel sample in fig 8 possesses large size pores and high porosity according to classical filtration theory represented by carman kozeny equation bai and leow 2002 large pore size and high porosity correspond to low filtration resistance and sfr clearly classical filtration theory could not interpret the extremely high sfr of gel layer the extremely high sfr of gel layer over cake layer however can be reasonably explained if considering energy balance principle and foulant layer structure fig 9 illustrates the schematic of smps polymeric structure gel layer and cake layer upon membrane surface in the mbr as demonstrated in fig 9a smps have a cross linked matrix due to effects of multivalent cation bridging and entanglement lin et al 2014a raszka et al 2006 such a matrix is always called as egg box structure lee et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 which provides the backbone of a gel layer upon membrane surface such a physical structure can be verified by fig 8 the cross linked polymeric chains have strong interactions with water as results of mixing dissolution and changes of enthalpy and entropy borchard and steinbrecht 1991 lei et al 2016 mönch et al 2006 as shown in fig 9b although the backbone of gel layer is porous there is almost no visible pore through the gel layer as the gel layer is relatively homogeneous from thermodynamic viewpoint formation of a homogeneous gel layer is favorable in energy or in other words is of a spontaneous process the polymeric matrix tends to adsorb mix as much water as possible swelling process because in this way the entropy of gel layer is largest as compared to the sum of entropy of pure water and pure polymeric matrix sakai et al 2014 and so that the formed gel layer is most stable fig 3 a and b show that a relatively homogeneous and slime gel layer could spontaneously form in the mbr providing the experimental evidence supporting the real occurrence of the thermodynamic mechanism underlying the gel layer formation owning to lack of visible pores through gel layer as illustrated as the cross section picture of gel layer shown in fig 9b filtration through gel layer needs to drag mixing bound water from gel to the permeate side which definitely results in high filtration resistance as compared with gel layer sludge cake layer always possesses relatively low filtration resistance this phenomenon can be explained by the structure of cake layer fig 9c shows that there exist some visible connected pores through the cake layer because it is formed by sludge particulates with relatively large size and certain rigidity as illustrated as the cross section picture of cake layer shown in fig 9c the filtration resistance of an ideal cake layer can be even correctly calculated by carman kozeny equation bai and leow 2002 as all this study revealed the exact thermodynamic mechanism underlying filtration behaviours of a gel layer 3 3 2 modelling and simulation of sfr of gel layer above mentioned section revealed the general thermodynamic mechanism but only provided a qualitative interpretation to the high sfr of gel layer therefore modelling and simulation of sfr of gel layer were performed in order to provide a quantitative interpretation to the high sfr of gel layer due to the complicated components of the real gel model gel agar gel in this study was used for modelling and simulation in order to well document the universal mechanism underlying the gel filtration this is a general operation for mechanism research according to energy balance principle extra energy needs to be provided to balance the energy gap between the gel layer and the permeate our previous study chen et al 2016 has linked the chemical potential change to sfr during filtration through a gel layer combining eq 1 with eqs 14 and 15 the gel sfr caused by the free energy change can be given by 16 s f r r t m g v b j σ ln 1 φ 2 ϕ 2 χ φ 2 2 where m g is the dry mass of gel layer kg for a model gel like agar gel values of the critical parameters v b χ m g φ 2 j and σ can refer to the literature or be experimtally measured therefore the deduced model can be simulated for a gel layer it should be noted that deduction of eq 16 is based on the basic thermodynamic principles energy balance principle correctness of all the involved equations and the thermodynamic principles used for model deduction has been well verified in order to simulate the deduced model the involved parameter data were experimtally measured or referred to the literature as for the experimental measurements foulants in 3 different operational days were used and each sample was characterized in triplication all these aspects can ensure the reliability and repeatability of the obtained results the agar gel solution was filtrated in dead end mode the corresponding sfr was experimentally measured according to eq 2 and simultaneously simulated in theory according to eq 16 table 2 presents the parameters data used to calculate the sfr of the agar gel solution under conditions in this study the experimentally measured sfr and the simulated sfr are 2 03 1016 m kg 1 and 1 88 1016 m kg 1 for the agar gel respectively it is clear that the simulated sfr is quite close to the experimentally measured value accounting for 92 6 suggesting the feasibility of the proposed thermodynamic mechanism to interpret the high sfr of gel layer it is should noted that there is still a small gap between the simulated and the experimentally measured sfr values existence of a small gap is reasonable because the simulation only accounts for mixting chemical potential energy change while ignores other minor energy changes during gel filtration according to flory huggins theory mönch et al 2006 petrovic et al 1987 the energy change during gel formation primarily consists of three components mixting free energy elastic free energy and ion free energy among them mixting free energy is major while elastic free energy and ion free energy are minor and may totally account for 5 15 of total energy change teng et al 2018b therefore the thermodynamic mechanism could plausibly interpret the high sfr of gel layer mainly formed by smps in literature extensive efforts have been made to investigate membrane fouling while significant achievements have been obtained previous studies simply attributed membrane fouling to pore clogging foulant layer formation or effects of hydrodynamic conditions krzeminski et al 2017 lin et al 2012 meng et al 2017 wang et al 2014b however the fouling behaviors of one of the major foulants namely smps can not be reasonably explained by currently available fouling theory this situation highly impeded understanding and control of membrane fouling from energy viewpoint this study proposed thermodynamic mechanisms and satisfactorily interpreted the typical fouling behaviors of smps this study improved fundamental insights into membrane fouling 3 4 summary of the unified mechanism and its implications based on the aforementioned sections a unified thermodynamic mechanism underlying the anomalous fouling behaviors of smps can be implicitly summarized fig 10 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed unified thermodynamic mechanism basically the proposed mechanism unifies the adhesion mechanism and filtration mechanism related with smps from viewpoint of energy thermodynamics change for adhesion process as shown in fig 10 there is more strengthened adhesive energy between smps and membrane surface than that between sludge particulates and membrane surface for unit membrane area the strengthened adhesive energy related with smps is mainly caused by their dispersed form and small size when they get close to membrane they tend to fit rough membrane surface morphology jacquin et al 2017 tansel et al 2006 and thus significantly reduce the separation distance resulting in a more strengthened adhesive energy as compared to sludge particulates the energy calculation based on xdlvo approaches showed that u f w m t o t d 0 within smps and the pristine membrane was greater by over 3700 times than that within sludge particulates and the pristine membrane for unit membrane surface area under conditions in this study the quantitative results well explained the preferential adhesion of smps over sludge particulates on membrane surface in the mbr for filtration process there is also a significant energy change when the permeat is dragged out from the gel layer mainly formed by smps fig 10 this energy change can be quantified based on flory huggins theory this study further linked this energy change with gel sfr according to the thermodynamic principles allowing to quantification of the gel sfr the quantification results showed that under conditions in this study the simulated sfr was 1 88 1016 m kg 1 for the agar gel very close to the experimentally measured sfr of 2 03 1016 m kg 1 therefore the thermodynamic mechanism well explained the extremely high sfr of gel layer in the mbr currently it is generally considered that membrane fouling in mbrs is caused by pore blocking foulant layer formation and or concentration polarization meng et al 2009 wang et al 2014c honestly there mechanisms were based on physical observation and not in depth from energy viewpoint this study proposed a more essential and deeper fouling mechanism which unified adhesion process and filtration process related with smps any breakthroughs in essential mechanism may bring new control strategies it is suggested that the proposed mechanism would offer important implications for membrane fouling control for example the proposed mechanism predicts the importance of surface morphology to foulant adhesion in nature the super anti adhesion ability of lotus nelumbo nucifera leaf inspires worldwide researchers to fabricate membranes with special surface morphology ganesh et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 the proposed mechanism should be very conductive to develop such a biomimetic measure for fouling control meanwhile the proposed mechanism also suggests that the energy change during gel filtration is directly dependent of the cross linking degree of polymers any measures to break the cross linking structure will significantly reduce the filtration resistance offering new idea to establish effective fouling control measures 4 conclusions fouling behaviors of soluble microbial products smps during initial operation period of a membrane bioreactor mbr were characterized while being low content smps other than sludge particulates preferentially adhered to membrane surface to form a gel layer meanwhile smps possessed a specific filtration resistance sfr which could be about 700 times over that of sludge particulates these fouling behaviors could be plausibly explained by a unified thermodynamic mechanism based on energy balance principle under conditions in this study the strength of the attractive interaction energy in contact between smps and membrane was over 3700 times of that between sludge particulates and membrane resulting in the extremely high adhesive ability of smps modelling and simulating filtration through a smps layer showed that energy change caused high sfr and about 92 6 of sfr was originated from mixing free energy change during filtration this study provided a unified thermodynamic framework for the fouling behaviors of smps and significantly improved the fundamental understanding of fouling acknowledgements this study was financially supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51578509

when compared to cyclically operated filters reducing the empty bed contact time ebct increased biomass density under continuous flow conditions however once normalized to biomass it was shown that cyclically operated filters exhibited higher enzyme activity indicating that this method of operation may improve bacterial function reduction of organics was generally similar for both continuous and cyclical filters with the same ebct however cyclical filters demonstrated higher variability during the first 4 h following start up overall haa formation potential was better controlled by continuously operated filters due to poor performance by the cyclical filters upon start up while thm precursors were removed equally well by all filters to understand the removal capacity for ndma precursors through biological filters both naturally occurring ndma fp and ndma fp resulting from spiked anthropogenic precursors was monitored through the filter depth all the filters removed 90 of the naturally occurring ndma fp within the first 45 cm cyclical operation resulted in higher reduction of spiked anthropogenic ndma precursors 50 higher than continuously operated demonstrating the advantage of routine shut down on overall microbial activity tools to monitor and predict biofilter performance are in high demand here we present an effective activity term which combines enzyme activity with contact time ebct effective esterase activity was strongly correlated to doc reduction as a function of filter operation cyclical or continuous and ebct effective phosphatase activity

an ndma precursor leavey roback et al 2016 however there is limited information on the impact of biofilter operation in terms of subsequent ndma precursor removal or formation in an effort to improve biofilter performance with respect to organic and dbp precursor removal alternative operating strategies are often studied and implemented it has been shown that longer empty bed contact time ebct results in increased removals terry and summers 2018 when testing ebct impacts many studies utilize multiple sampling ports on a single filter as opposed to testing the impact of increased loading rates chen et al 2016 the former approach may limit the validity of results since the fluid velocity is not altered this is important as biological community composition has been shown to differ based on applied shear stress related to loading rate and nutrient availability which decreases with filter depth boon et al 2011 as an alternative to increasing ebct improved organics reduction has been shown to occur in biological systems when periodic shutdown periods are implemented saby et al 2003 indicated that activated sludge systems demonstrated increased organic removal when operation alternated between aerobic and anoxic conditions however previous drinking water related studies have not elucidated the mechanism associated with this increase niquette et al 1998 in practice drinking water treatment plants with excess capacity can apply this strategy previous studies have shown biofilter shutdown to be associated with anoxic conditions dissolved oxygen 1 mg l however the direct impact to biomass activity is currently unknown mckie et al 2016 this study directly compared pilot biofilters operated continuously and cyclically shutdown for 12 4 h daily according to full scale operation with ebcts of 15 or 30 min and evaluated in terms of biological activity and treated water quality specifically the filters ability to control thm haa and ndma precursors was quantified finally relationships between biofilm character biomass and biological activity and treatment performance were developed to identify effective biofilter monitoring and control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of biofiltration pilot pilot scale studies were conducted at the georgina water treatment plant wtp ontario canada four biofilters 7 6 cm diameter 1 m filter

cyclically cyc approximately 8 16 h per day when the full scale plant was running at the same flow rates as the continuously operated filters 0 15 and 0 3 l min and are referred to as cyc15 and cyc30 a process flow diagram is provided in fig 1 the filter media was calgon f 300 activated carbon moon township pa obtained from full scale filters at the same location which had been in service for 13 years prior to the study previous studies reported that limited adsorptive capacity remained nemani et al 2018 since the upstream uf membranes removed turbidity to 0 1 ntu headloss in the filters was minimal 0 01 m d as such backwash was conducted approximately every two months to eliminate any potential air binding associated with seasonal temperature changes 2 2 sampling details water samples were collected from the cyclically operated filters immediately after the flow was restored time 0 and every 2 h thereafter for a total of 8 h based on the shortest expected daily operating cycle continuously operated filters were sampled at time 0 when the plant turned on and 8 h later immediately before the plant turned off therefore samples collected from the continuous filters corresponded with time 0 and time 8 samples from the cyclical filters media samples were collected from the filters at the same time intervals on the following day water samples were collected from the pilot

collected between 2 and 4 h following filter start up to avoid water quality variability associated with filter start up during initial sampling events low concentrations of ndma precursors were observed in the filter influent and effluent which complicated data analysis due to concentrations which were below detection limits 2 ng l subsequent studies were conducted using a 530 ng l ranitidine spike ranitidine has been shown to be an effective ndma precursor with molar conversions exceeding 80 shen and andrews 2011 spiking resulted in an influent ndma fp of 120 ng l effluent ndma

canada atp analyses were conducted using a luminultra deposit surface analysis kit dsa 100c fredricton nb canada according to the manufacturer s instructions esterase and phenoloxidase were measured using a method similar to that presented by lautenschlager et al 2014 briefly 15 ml of tris buffer ph 8 0 was added to 1 g of biofilter media in a 40 ml amber glass vial the samples were then sonicated for 15 min applied energy 400 w quantification of esterase activity was completed by adding 1 6 ml of extract to 0 4 ml of 200 μm 4 methylumbelliferone acetate 4 mub acetate sigma aldrich

phenoloxidase activity absorbance λ 460 nm was measured every 15 min for 48 h using a tecan sunrise microplate reader chapel hill nc usa similar to esterase measurements enzyme activity was evaluated by calculating the rate of conversion per unit time to the maximum concentration prior to thm and haa analyses samples were chlorinated to achieve a free chlorine residual of 1 0 0 4 mg l after 24 2 h

chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform and haas monochloroacetic acid monobromoacetic acid dichloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid bromochloroacetic acid dibromoacetic

respectively to evaluate the formation of ndma samples were dosed under uniform formation conditions ufc based on previous works by shen and andrews 2011 and krasner et al 2012 briefly samples were chloraminated to achieve a monochloramine residual of 2 5 0 3 mg l after 24 h using chlorine demand free bottles without ph adjustment pre formed monochloramine was prepared at a cl2 n ratio of 4 2 1 samples were held at room temperature 20 2 c for the duration of the 24 h reaction chlorine demand free glass amber bottles with low density polyethylene ldpe caps were used for all ndma fp tests ndma fp analyses were performed using solid phase extraction spe followed by gc ms analysis extractions were carried out using lewatit af 5 beads conditioned at 320 c for 3 h before use similar to shen and andrews 2011 analysis of ndma was performed using a varian 3800 gc coupled with a varian 400 ion trap mass spectrometer and combipal autosampler mississauga on chemical ionization was applied using methanol as the reagent liquid both ndma and d6 ndma internal standard were eluted at a retention time of approximately 8 6 min with indicating ions measured at 75 amu and 81 amu respectively 2 4 statistical methods all statistical comparisons between filters were conducted using a paired student t test to minimize bias resulting from variations in influent water quality a significance of 95 was used as a baseline in all cases a two tailed test was used where identification of differences between filters was a primary objective p values indicate the level at which a relationship shows significant difference such that relationships with higher p values are more likely to be statistically similar notched box plots were prepared using grapher 11 golden software golden co usa from bottom to top horizontal lines represent the 25th 50th and 75th percentile values the notch represents the 90 confidence interval of the mean this interval may extend beyond the 25th or 75th percentile making the box appear pointed at the top or bottom comparing the notched values between two samples allows for a visual analysis of statistical difference if the notched range does not overlap it is likely that the results are statistically different 3 results 3 1 biomass activity and density previous studies have identified atp as a surrogate for active biomass density on biofilter media pharand et al 2014 atp was used in this study to evaluate the impact of filter flow rate and run time on biomass density and cellular activity while enzyme assays were used as a measure of the metabolic activity of the biomass in agreement with van der aa et al 2006 and xiang et al 2013 the density of biomass was highest at the top of the filter and decreased with depth fig 2 this trend has been attributed to the decrease in bioavailable nutrients through the media as the active biofilm consumes carbon nitrogen and phosphorus while water passes through the filter on average continuously operated biofilters cont 15 and cont30 had higher biomass concentrations throughout the entire depth when compared to filters operated cyclically cyc15 and cyc30 as shown in fig 2 the increase in biomass density may be attributed to the continuous supply of nutrients which supports a diverse microbial flora diversity is important for resilience to perturbations in influent water quality or unintended exposure to oxidants such as chlorine schwering et al 2013 cyclically operated filters imposed periods of intermittent starvation in terms of nutrient supply and dissolved oxygen this feast famine operation strategy is routinely used in wastewater treatment as a selective pressure to select for robust microbial communities and stimulate the metabolic rates of healthy flora previous studies at this location have shown dissolved oxygen to rapidly decline following filter shutdown 8 mg do l reduction in 4 h resulting in anoxic conditions 1 mg do l mckie et al 2016 the intermittent starvation had a direct impact on the atp levels for both cyc15 and cyc30 filters as shown in fig 2 where biomass density and cellular activity was almost 50 lower at the top 5 cm than the continuously operated filters nutrient loading also impacted the biomass levels where lower flow rates ebct 30 min had on average lower atp levels compared to filters operated at higher flow rates ebct 15 min similar to the results of previous studies degerman et al 2013 it was previously hypothesized that atp would increase during a given filter run stoddart et al 2016 reflecting the increase in cellular activity and density of the biomass as expected the continuously operated filter had stable atp values through the bed depth indicative of stable activity and density levels fig 3 cont15 dashed lines for intermittently operated filters the atp levels measured near the top of the filter 5 cm and 25 cm depths increased over the first 4 h of a typical filter run before reaching a steady state for the remainder of the filter run similar results were observed for cyc30 results not shown this rapid change in atp is a potential indicator of biofilm recovery and metabolic response to stressful conditions as such measurement of atp on filter media through a filter run may serve as a monitoring tool for biofilter robustness and overall performance 3 2 enzyme activity enzyme activity of media extracts was measured to characterize the biodegradation capacity of the biofilm esterase phosphatase and phenoloxidase activity analyses were conducted according to lautenschlager et al 2014 in addition chitinase and α glucosidase were also assayed however no fluorescent response was observed for these two compounds 0 02 μm min 4 mub production esterase activity served as an indicator of general biological activity based on the degradation of a fluorescently labelled carbon based compound 4 mub acetate battin 1997 fig 4 a similar to the atp results presented in fig 2 esterase activity was observed to decrease with filter depth since esterase provides a measure of general biological activity this trend was anticipated as biodegradable substrate concentrations are highest in the upper layers of the filter and decrease along the filter bed as they are consumed filters operated with a 15 min ebct had higher esterase activities than those operated with a 30 min ebct which may be an adaptation to higher flow rates and subsequent nutrient loading in fact the cyclically operated filters had similar esterase activities as the continuously operated filters even though the atp levels were significantly higher in the continuous filters p 0 05 in this way esterase activity provides greater insight on the activity levels of the filter when compared to atp levels which reflect the overall density of active biomass after normalizing esterase activity to atp the data indicate that cyclically operated biofilters demonstrate a higher biological function per unit biomass when compared to continuously operated biofilters fig 4b to date this is first study to address the impact of shutdown or starvation conditions on enzyme activity levels of drinking water biofilters changes in esterase activity through a filter run at 5 filter depths was also measured fig 5 esterase activity was similar to atp where continuously operated filters were stable at time 0 and 8 h activity kinetics from the top 25 cm of the cyclical biofilter increased over the first 4 h of the filter run prior to stabilizing for the remainder of a filter cycle similar to esterase activity phosphatase activity generally decreased with increasing filter depth likely due to substrate consumption through the depth of the filter resulting in less available substrate fig s1 supplemental info these enzyme kinetic assays provide mechanistic explanation for the increased organics removal reported by niquette et al 1998 following biofilter shutdowns phenoloxidase activity was consistent throughout within differences of 10 fig s2 supplemental info in addition there was no upregulation in activity of phosphatase or phenoloxidase when the filters were placed back into operation based on previous examinations of bacteria present on biofilter media at this location it is possible that facultative aerobes which can survive periods of anoxic stress had very quick recovery response times resulting in stable activity for the majority of the filter run cycle nemani et al 2018 3 3 treated water quality doc thm fp and haa fp were quantified to evaluate the performance of the various operating conditions with respect to the removal of organics in general greater organics removal was achieved with longer ebct fig 6 which is consistent with previous research mckie et al 2015 wang et al 1995 on average the cyclically operated filters achieved similar water quality to continuously operated filters with respect to doc and thm fp significant differences p 0 05 were only observed with respect to haa fp where cont 30 was significantly better when compared to all other filters table s1 based on these results operating conditions shutdown and ebct did not practically impact treatment performance reduction of thm fp was found to be relatively stable over time and not impacted by filter start up haa reduction in cyclically operated biofilters was impacted by the transition period experienced during the first 4 h of operation fig 7 when averaged over an entire filter run cyc15 and cyc30 achieved approximately 16 and 20 haa fp reduction respectively haa fp reductions increased to 25 7 and 27 5 respectively when only 4 6 and 8 h samples were considered haa fp in samples collected during the first 2 h of operation were 30 40 higher than those collected in the last 4 h based on these results samples collected from the cyclically operated filter during steady state conditions may overestimate haa fp reductions by 38 56 when compared to a composite including filter start up during the last 4 h of the filter run both cyc15 and cyc30 performed equally with cont30 removing significantly more haa precursors than cont15 as such cyclically operated biofilters perform similarly regardless of ebct however for filters experiencing daily shutdowns filter to waste periods prior to start up may be more appropriate than backwashing due to the expected loss of biomass and water use associated with regular backwash to characterize cyclical biofilter operation with respect to chloraminated dbps an examination of ndma formation was conducted it has been suggested that extracellular polymeric substances eps present in biofilms or bacteria themselves may serve as a source of ndma precursors due to the amine groups contained within krasner et al 2015 based on the potential for sources of ndma fp from influent water or from within the biofilter itself it was unclear whether the biofilters would act as an overall source of precursors or result in a net removal ndma sampling was conducted during warm water conditions 18 20 c to monitor periods associated with maximum biomass density when chloraminated under uniform formation conditions ufc 2 5 0 2 mg l monochloramine residual after 24 h influent ndma concentrations ranged from 10 to 50 ng l filter effluent concentrations ranged from below detection 2 ng l to 4 ng l fig s3 these results indicate that the biofilters were able to effectively metabolize or transform naturally occurring ndma precursors to reduce subsequent ndma formation biofilter operation cyclical or continuous and ebct did not impact overall treatment performance with respect to ndma precursor reduction due to the high number of filter effluent samples with ndma fp below detection limit and rapid degradation of precursors in the top 25 cm of the filter it was difficult to characterize the removal as a function of filter operation as such an ndma precursor 530 ng l ranitidine was spiked into each filter to achieve an ndma fp of 123 6 4 ng l in the influent removal of ndma fp following a ranitidine spike is shown in fig 8 similar to results presented in fig s3 high removals 84 104 ng l were observed in the top 25 cm with all filters achieving 90 reductions of ndma fp at a 95 cm depth ndma fp reduction at each of the monitored depths was significantly higher in cyclically operated filters using a student s t test p 0 014 and corresponds with higher metabolic and biomass densities however monoamine reducing activity was not examined as part of this study and would be an asset to include in subsequent studies flow rate 15 vs 30 min ebct did not have a significant impact when considering filters operated cyclically p 0 26 or continuously p 0 61 3 4 biofilm characteristics as a predictor of water quality enzyme kinetic assays were performed on biofilm extracts to provide a measure for the metabolic degradation of a known substrate across the filter in each time period several published studies have also conducted this type of enzyme based analysis although the activities measured did not correlate well with active biomass as measured by atp or bulk organic removals lautenschlager et al 2014 pharand et al 2014 rahman et al 2016 perhaps a limitation in the previous work was the fact that filter operation i e ebct was not considered a variable this is of particular importance since enzyme activity is reported as a rate of substrate conversion per unit time moles time and omitting filter contact time does not allow for an appropriate interpretation of results in the current study average enzyme activity measured at a 5 cm depth in each filter was multiplied by the ebct of that particular filter 15 or 30 min to develop an effective enzyme activity term a 5 cm depth 0 75 or 1 5 min ebct was selected as this region of the filter would be the simplest point for full scale monitoring program in addition the upper 5 cm is associated with the maximum biodensity and activity values a strong correlation r2 0 8 was observed between the maximum effective enzyme activity and effluent doc removal figs 9 and 10 calculation effective activity at other depths resulted in weak correlations r2 0 5 which may be a function of nutrient depletion in lower regions of the filter the relationship between effective esterase activity and doc removal fig 9 was found to be dependent on filter operation and ebct this was anticipated as cyclical operation was shown to increase esterase activity per unit biomass fig 5 resulting in higher doc removals at a lower effective esterase activity or lower atp values this suggests that cyclical operation can either induce esterase activity or select for bacteria with higher esterase activity in response to starvation conditions while the underlying mechanism was not examined in the present study it is evident that increased esterase activity was associated with higher doc removals this was not anticipated as esterase activity is measured using a fluorescently labelled acetate which is representative of carbon degradation but not a direct pathway of carbon removal to quantify the benefit associated with cyclical operation the slopes of best fit lines were compared as they are indicative of the doc reduction per unit increase in effective esterase activity slope for cyclical operation increased by 10 compared to continuously operated filters with a 15 min ebct and by 50 when operated with a 30 min ebct as such cyclically operated filters were able to degrade organics more efficiently i e equal degradation at a lower esterase activity than continuously operated filters when examining effective phosphatase activity no discernible relationship was observed in terms of filter operation or ebct fig 10 phosphatases and kinases are key enzymes for cell signalling cascades through cyclical phosphorylation of target proteins although these enzymes are not directly related to orthophosphate uptake as opposed to esterase activity which is a surrogate for carbon degradation a strong relationship between phosphatase activity and phosphate uptake was observed this result provides addition evidence for integrating enzyme activity with ebct as a means for characterizing substrate degradation by a biological filter when compared to monitoring either enzyme activity or ebct alone in addition to examining relationships as a function of enzyme activity those between water quality parameters and atp were also evaluated a strong relationship was observed between the cumulative atp i e the sequential sum of atp measured at each filter depth through the depth of the filter and ndma fp reduction based on filter operation fig 11 a strong linear relationship between the cumulative atp and ndma precursor reduction through the depth of each biofilter was observed these results indicate that ndma precursor reduction increases with filter depth as expected and the observed removal is proportional to the active biomass present in the filter especially in the middle and lower regions of the biofilters the relationships presented in fig 11 focus on the linear region for the continuous filters representative of filter depths from 25 to 95 cm as the 5 cm samples which are the leftmost points in each of the plotted series of data had the highest densities of atp although incorporating the 5 cm samples only lowers the r2 to 0 92 and 0 84 for cont15 and cont30 respectively which is still indicative of a strong linear relationship the deviation of these samples from linearity indicates that there are other factors at play in the top region of the continuously operated biofilters which merit further investigation it also suggests that precursor reductions in the very upper regions of these filters and perhaps also in the cyclically operated filters above the 5 cm port may be lower than what would be represented by the linear relationships of fig 11 regardless it is evident that most of the ndma precursors are removed transformed or otherwise neutralized to further reaction within the first 5 25 cm of the filters when analyzing regression data associated with filter operation cyclical vs continuous and flow rate 15 vs 30 min two notable trends are evident first the y intercept which is indicative of the minimum ndma precursor reduction that could be anticipated is relatively similar for all of the operating conditions 53 64 this removal may be associated with easily biodegradable precursors which are removed in the top 5 cm of the biofilter adsorption to the gac or absorption into the eps layer produced by the bacteria although the exact mechanism of removal was not identified in this study ultimately there was good removal of ndma precursors achieved by all of the biofilters 81 95 secondly when examining the slopes of the regression lines the filters operated with a 30 min ebct have a higher slope than those operated with a 15 min ebct this indicates that greater ndma precursor removal was observed per unit of atp measured in filters operated with longer ebcts likely due to the extended contact period within the filter from this analysis of ndma fp reduction as a function of atp it can be concluded that ebct dictates the ultimate removal of ndma precursors achieved by a biological filter a majority of the precursors 50 were removed in the top 5 cm of the filter of the remaining precursors which were removed at greater filter depths increasing the ebct from 15 to 30 min resulted in greater removals with smaller increases in atp likely due to the increased contact time between the microorganisms and the precursors 4 conclusions this study compared biofilters operated continuously and cyclically operating 8 12 h day at two ebcts 15 and 30 min continuously operated biofilters were associated with high levels of biomass atp when compared to cyclically operated filters atp concentrations observed on cyclical biofilter media increased for up to 4 h immediately following filter start up filters operated with a 15 min ebct had higher concentrations of atp than those operated at 30 min atp concentrations decreased with increasing filter depth regardless of operating conditions esterase and phosphatase activity surrogates for biological activity decreased with increasing filter depth similar to atp cyclical biofilter operation was shown to increase esterase activity in comparison to continuously operated filters with the same ebct suggesting the potential for increased carbon reduction this study also introduced the concept of effective enzyme activity which was calculated by multiplying the maximum measured enzyme activity for a given filter with its respective ebct effective esterase activity was strongly correlated with doc reduction r2 0 97 in 3 of 4 filters effective phosphatase activity showed correlations with phosphate reduction r2 0 80 independent of filter operation on average cyclically operated biofilters removed more doc than continuously operated filters with the same ebct statistically continuously operated biofilters with a 30 min ebct were superior to all other filters with respect to haa fp reduction however this was a negligible amount overall based on the results of this study biofiltration is an effective treatment technology for the removal of ndma fp 10 to 100 ng l to below regulatory limits the bulk of the removals occurred in the top 45 cm of the filter 80 limited ndma fp removals 10 were achieved between depths of 45 and 95 cm this might help guide future design of filter beds to increase surface area and minimize filter bed depth filter operation directly influenced the reduction of ndma fp all of the filters achieved similar removals of ndma precursors removal of ndma precursors improved with longer ebcts e g 30 vs 15 min as would be expected filters operated with a 30 min ebct were able to reduce more ndma fp 95 than filters operated with a 15 min ebct 84 acknowledgements this project was

19167,the objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of cyclical operated 8 12 h per day and continuous biofilter operation with respect to biomass development biological enzyme activity and treated water quality in terms of organics nutrients and disinfection by product dbp formation potential continuously operated biofilters developed greater densities of biomass as measured by atp when compared to cyclically operated filters reducing the empty bed contact time ebct increased biomass density under continuous flow conditions however once normalized to biomass it was shown that cyclically operated filters exhibited higher enzyme activity indicating that this method of operation may improve bacterial function reduction of organics was generally similar for both continuous and cyclical filters with the same ebct however cyclical filters demonstrated higher variability during the first 4 h following start up overall haa formation potential was better controlled by continuously operated filters due to poor performance by the cyclical filters upon start up while thm precursors were removed equally well by all filters to understand the removal capacity for ndma precursors through biological filters both naturally occurring ndma fp and ndma fp resulting from spiked anthropogenic precursors was monitored through the filter depth all the filters removed 90 of the naturally occurring ndma fp within the first 45 cm cyclical operation resulted in higher reduction of spiked anthropogenic ndma precursors 50 higher than continuously operated demonstrating the advantage of routine shut down on overall microbial activity tools to monitor and predict biofilter performance are in high demand here we present an effective activity term which combines enzyme activity with contact time ebct effective esterase activity was strongly correlated to doc reduction as a function of filter operation cyclical or continuous and ebct effective phosphatase activity

chloramines used for secondary disinfection mitch and sedlak 2002 ndma formation in systems utilizing biofiltration has recently become a greater concern as the potential exists for biomass to act as an ndma precursor leavey roback et al 2016 however there is limited information on the impact of biofilter operation in terms of subsequent ndma precursor removal or formation in an effort to improve biofilter performance with respect to organic and dbp precursor removal alternative operating strategies are often studied and implemented it has been shown that longer empty bed contact time ebct results in increased removals terry and summers 2018 when testing ebct impacts many studies utilize multiple sampling ports on a single filter as opposed to testing the impact of increased loading rates chen et al 2016 the former approach may limit the validity of results since the fluid velocity is not altered this is important as biological community composition has been shown to differ based on applied shear stress related to loading rate and nutrient availability which decreases with filter depth boon et al 2011 as an alternative to increasing ebct improved organics reduction has been shown to occur in biological systems when periodic shutdown periods are implemented saby et al 2003 indicated that activated sludge systems demonstrated increased organic removal when operation alternated between aerobic and anoxic conditions however previous drinking water related studies have not elucidated the mechanism associated with this increase niquette et al 1998 in practice drinking water treatment plants with excess capacity can apply this strategy previous studies have shown biofilter shutdown to be associated with anoxic conditions dissolved oxygen 1 mg l however the direct impact to biomass activity is currently unknown mckie et al 2016 this study directly compared pilot biofilters operated continuously and cyclically shutdown for 12 4 h daily according to full scale operation with ebcts of 15 or 30 min and evaluated in terms of biological activity and treated water quality specifically the filters ability to control thm haa and ndma precursors was quantified finally relationships between biofilm character biomass and biological activity and treatment performance were developed to identify effective biofilter monitoring and control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of biofiltration pilot pilot scale studies were conducted at the georgina water treatment plant wtp ontario canada four biofilters 7 6 cm diameter 1 m filter

cyclically cyc approximately 8 16 h per day when the full scale plant was running at the same flow rates as the continuously operated filters 0 15 and 0 3 l min and are referred to as cyc15 and cyc30 a process flow diagram is provided in fig 1 the filter media was calgon f 300 activated carbon moon township pa obtained from full scale filters at the same location which had been in service for 13

using a method similar to that presented by lautenschlager et al 2014 briefly 15 ml of tris buffer ph 8 0 was added to 1 g of biofilter media in a 40 ml amber glass vial the samples were then sonicated for 15 min applied energy 400 w quantification of esterase activity was completed by adding 1 6 ml of extract to 0 4 ml of 200 μm 4 methylumbelliferone acetate 4 mub acetate sigma aldrich

phenoloxidase activity absorbance λ 460 nm was measured every 15 min for 48 h using a tecan sunrise microplate reader chapel hill nc usa similar to esterase measurements enzyme activity was evaluated by calculating the rate of conversion per unit time to the maximum concentration prior to thm and haa analyses samples were chlorinated to achieve a free chlorine residual of 1 0 0 4 mg l after 24 2 h

respectively to evaluate the formation of ndma samples were dosed under uniform formation conditions ufc based on previous works by shen and andrews 2011 and krasner et al 2012 briefly samples were chloraminated to achieve a monochloramine residual of 2 5 0 3 mg l after 24 h using chlorine demand free bottles without ph adjustment pre formed monochloramine was prepared at a cl2 n ratio of 4 2 1

fp analyses were performed using solid phase extraction spe followed by gc ms analysis extractions were carried out using lewatit af 5 beads conditioned at 320 c for 3 h before use similar to shen and andrews 2011 analysis of ndma was performed using a varian 3800 gc coupled with a varian 400 ion trap mass spectrometer and combipal autosampler mississauga on chemical ionization was applied using methanol as the reagent liquid both ndma and d6 ndma internal standard were eluted at a retention time of approximately 8 6 min with indicating ions measured at 75 amu and 81 amu respectively 2 4 statistical methods all statistical comparisons between filters were conducted using a paired student t test to minimize bias resulting from variations in influent water quality a significance of 95 was used as a baseline in all cases a two tailed test was used where identification of differences between filters was a primary objective p values indicate the level at which a relationship shows significant difference such that relationships with higher p values are more likely to be statistically similar notched box plots were prepared using grapher 11 golden software golden co usa from bottom to top horizontal lines represent the 25th 50th and 75th percentile values the notch represents the 90 confidence interval of the mean this interval may extend beyond the 25th or 75th percentile making the box appear pointed at the top or bottom comparing the notched values between two samples allows for a visual analysis of statistical difference if the notched range does not overlap it is likely that the results are statistically different 3 results 3 1 biomass activity and density previous studies have identified atp as a surrogate for active biomass density on biofilter media pharand et al 2014 atp was used in this study to evaluate the impact of filter flow rate and run time on biomass density and cellular activity while enzyme assays were used as a measure of the metabolic activity of the biomass in agreement with van der aa et al 2006 and xiang et al 2013 the density of biomass was highest at the top of the filter and decreased with depth fig 2 this trend has been attributed to the decrease in bioavailable nutrients through the media as the active biofilm consumes carbon nitrogen and phosphorus while water passes through the filter on average continuously operated biofilters cont 15 and cont30 had higher biomass concentrations throughout the entire depth when compared to filters operated cyclically cyc15 and cyc30 as shown in fig 2 the increase in biomass density may be attributed to the continuous supply of nutrients which supports a diverse microbial flora diversity is important for resilience to perturbations in influent water quality or unintended exposure to oxidants such as chlorine schwering et al 2013 cyclically operated filters imposed periods of intermittent starvation in terms of nutrient supply and dissolved oxygen this feast famine operation strategy is routinely used in wastewater treatment as a selective pressure to select for robust microbial communities and stimulate the metabolic rates of healthy flora previous studies at this location have shown dissolved oxygen to rapidly decline following filter shutdown 8 mg do l reduction in 4 h resulting in anoxic conditions 1 mg do l mckie et al 2016 the intermittent starvation had a direct impact on the atp levels for both cyc15 and cyc30 filters as shown in fig 2 where biomass density and cellular activity was almost 50 lower at the top 5 cm than the continuously operated filters nutrient loading also impacted the biomass levels where lower flow rates ebct 30 min had on average lower atp levels compared to filters operated at higher flow rates ebct 15 min similar to the results of previous studies degerman et al 2013 it was previously hypothesized that atp would increase during a given filter run stoddart et al 2016 reflecting the increase in cellular activity and density of the biomass as expected the continuously operated filter had stable atp values through the bed depth indicative of stable activity and density levels fig 3 cont15 dashed lines for intermittently operated filters the atp levels measured near the top of the filter 5 cm and 25 cm depths increased over the first 4 h of a typical filter run before reaching a steady state for the remainder of the filter run similar results were observed for cyc30 results not shown this rapid change in atp is a potential indicator of biofilm recovery and metabolic response to stressful conditions as such measurement of atp on filter media through a filter run may serve as a monitoring tool for biofilter robustness and overall performance 3 2 enzyme activity enzyme activity of media extracts was measured to characterize the biodegradation capacity of the biofilm esterase phosphatase and phenoloxidase activity analyses were conducted according to lautenschlager et al 2014 in addition chitinase and α glucosidase were also assayed however no fluorescent response was observed for these two compounds 0 02 μm min 4 mub production esterase activity served as an indicator of general biological activity based on the degradation of a fluorescently labelled carbon based compound 4 mub acetate battin 1997 fig 4 a similar to the atp results presented in fig 2 esterase activity was observed to decrease with filter depth since esterase provides a measure of general biological activity this trend was anticipated as biodegradable substrate concentrations are highest in the upper layers of the filter and decrease along the filter bed as they are consumed filters operated with a 15 min ebct had higher esterase activities than those operated with a 30 min ebct which may be an adaptation to higher flow rates and subsequent nutrient loading in fact the cyclically operated filters had similar esterase activities as the continuously operated filters even though the atp levels were significantly higher in the continuous filters p 0 05 in this way esterase activity provides greater insight on the activity levels of the filter when compared to atp levels which reflect the overall density of active biomass after normalizing esterase activity to atp the data indicate that cyclically operated biofilters demonstrate a higher biological function per unit biomass when compared to continuously operated biofilters fig 4b to date this is first study to address the impact of shutdown or starvation conditions on enzyme activity levels of drinking water biofilters changes in esterase activity through a filter run at 5 filter depths was also measured fig 5 esterase activity was similar to atp where continuously operated filters were stable at time 0 and 8 h activity kinetics from the top 25 cm of the cyclical biofilter increased over the first 4 h of the filter run prior to stabilizing for the remainder of a filter cycle similar to esterase activity phosphatase activity generally decreased with increasing filter depth likely due to substrate consumption through the depth of the filter resulting in less available substrate fig s1 supplemental info these enzyme kinetic assays provide mechanistic explanation for the increased organics removal reported by niquette et al 1998 following biofilter shutdowns phenoloxidase activity was consistent throughout within differences of 10 fig s2 supplemental info in addition there was no upregulation in activity of phosphatase or phenoloxidase when the filters were placed back into operation based on previous examinations of bacteria present on biofilter media at this location it is possible that facultative aerobes which can survive periods of anoxic stress had very quick recovery response times resulting in stable activity for the majority of the filter run cycle nemani et al 2018 3 3 treated water quality doc thm fp and haa fp were quantified to evaluate the performance of the various operating conditions with respect to the removal of organics in general greater organics removal was achieved with longer ebct fig 6 which is consistent with previous research mckie et al 2015 wang et al 1995 on average the cyclically operated filters achieved similar water quality to continuously operated filters with respect to doc and thm fp significant differences p 0 05 were only observed with respect to haa fp where cont 30 was significantly better when compared to all other filters table s1 based on these results operating conditions shutdown and ebct did not practically impact treatment performance reduction of thm fp was found to be relatively stable over time and not impacted by filter start up haa reduction in cyclically operated biofilters was impacted by the transition period experienced during the first 4 h of operation fig 7 when averaged over an entire filter run cyc15 and cyc30 achieved approximately 16 and 20 haa fp reduction respectively haa fp reductions increased to 25 7 and 27 5 respectively when only 4 6 and 8 h samples were considered haa fp in samples collected during the first 2 h of operation were 30 40 higher than those collected in the last 4 h based on these results samples collected from the cyclically operated filter during steady state conditions may overestimate haa fp reductions by 38 56 when compared to a composite including filter start up during the last 4 h of the filter run both cyc15 and cyc30 performed equally with cont30 removing significantly more haa precursors than cont15 as such cyclically operated biofilters perform similarly regardless of ebct however for filters experiencing daily shutdowns filter to waste periods prior to start up may be more appropriate than backwashing due to the expected loss of biomass and water use associated with regular backwash to characterize cyclical biofilter operation with respect to chloraminated dbps an examination of ndma formation was conducted it has been suggested that extracellular polymeric substances eps present in biofilms or bacteria themselves may serve as a source of ndma precursors due to the amine groups contained within krasner et al 2015 based on the potential for sources of ndma fp from influent water or from within the biofilter itself it was unclear whether the biofilters would act as an overall source of precursors or result in a net removal ndma sampling was conducted during warm water conditions 18 20 c to monitor periods associated with maximum biomass density when chloraminated under uniform formation conditions ufc 2 5 0 2 mg l monochloramine residual after 24 h influent ndma concentrations ranged from 10 to 50 ng l filter effluent concentrations ranged from below detection 2 ng l to 4 ng l fig s3 these results indicate that the biofilters were able to effectively metabolize or transform naturally occurring ndma precursors to reduce subsequent ndma formation biofilter operation cyclical or continuous and ebct did not impact overall treatment performance with respect to ndma precursor reduction due to the high number of filter effluent samples with ndma fp below detection limit and rapid degradation of precursors in the top 25 cm of the filter it was difficult to characterize the removal as a function of filter operation as such an ndma precursor 530 ng l ranitidine was spiked into each filter to achieve an ndma fp of 123 6 4 ng l in the influent removal of ndma fp following a ranitidine spike is shown in fig 8 similar to results presented in fig s3 high removals 84 104 ng l were observed in the top 25 cm with all filters achieving 90 reductions of ndma fp at a 95 cm depth ndma fp reduction at each of the monitored depths was significantly higher in cyclically operated filters using a student s t test p 0 014 and corresponds with higher metabolic and biomass densities however monoamine reducing activity was not examined as part of this study and would be an asset to include in subsequent studies flow rate 15 vs 30 min ebct did not have a significant impact when considering filters operated cyclically p 0 26 or continuously p 0 61 3 4 biofilm characteristics as a predictor of water quality enzyme kinetic assays were performed on biofilm extracts to provide a measure for the metabolic degradation of a known substrate across the filter in each time period several published studies have also conducted this type of enzyme based analysis although the activities measured did not correlate well with active biomass as measured by atp or bulk organic removals lautenschlager et al 2014 pharand et al 2014 rahman et al 2016 perhaps a limitation in the previous work was the fact that filter operation i e ebct was not considered a variable this is of particular importance since enzyme activity is reported as a rate of substrate conversion per unit time moles time and omitting filter contact time does not allow for an appropriate interpretation of results in the current study average enzyme activity measured at a 5 cm depth in each filter was multiplied by the ebct of that particular filter 15 or 30 min to develop an effective enzyme activity term a 5 cm depth 0 75 or 1 5 min ebct was selected as this region of the filter would be the simplest point for full scale monitoring program in addition the upper 5 cm is associated with the maximum biodensity and activity values a strong correlation r2 0 8 was observed between the maximum effective enzyme activity and effluent doc removal figs 9 and 10 calculation effective activity at other depths resulted in weak correlations r2 0 5 which may be a function of nutrient depletion in lower regions of the filter the relationship between effective esterase activity and doc removal fig 9 was found to be dependent on filter operation and ebct this was anticipated as cyclical operation was shown to increase esterase activity per unit biomass fig 5 resulting in higher doc removals at a lower effective esterase activity or lower atp values this suggests that cyclical operation can either induce esterase activity or select for bacteria with higher esterase activity in response to starvation conditions while the underlying mechanism was not examined in the present study it is evident that increased esterase activity was associated with higher doc removals this was not anticipated as esterase activity is measured using a fluorescently labelled acetate which is representative of carbon degradation but not a direct pathway of carbon removal to quantify the benefit associated with cyclical operation the slopes of best fit lines were compared as they are indicative of the doc reduction per unit increase in effective esterase activity slope for cyclical operation increased by 10 compared to continuously operated filters with a 15 min ebct and by 50 when operated with a 30 min ebct as such cyclically operated filters were able to degrade organics more efficiently i e equal degradation at a lower esterase activity than continuously operated filters when examining effective phosphatase activity no discernible relationship was observed in terms of filter operation or ebct fig 10 phosphatases and kinases are key enzymes for cell signalling cascades through cyclical phosphorylation of target proteins although these enzymes are not directly related to orthophosphate uptake as opposed to esterase activity which is a surrogate for carbon degradation a strong relationship between phosphatase activity and phosphate uptake was observed this result provides addition evidence for integrating enzyme activity with ebct as a means for characterizing substrate degradation by a biological filter when compared to monitoring either enzyme activity or ebct alone in addition to examining relationships as a function of enzyme activity those between water quality parameters and atp were also evaluated a strong relationship was observed between the cumulative atp i e the sequential sum of atp measured at each filter depth through the depth of the filter and ndma fp reduction based on filter operation fig 11 a strong linear relationship between the cumulative atp and ndma precursor reduction through the depth of each biofilter was observed these results indicate that ndma precursor reduction increases with filter depth as expected and the observed removal is proportional to the active biomass present in the filter especially in the middle and lower regions of the biofilters the relationships presented in fig 11 focus on the linear region for the continuous filters representative of filter depths from 25 to 95 cm as the 5 cm samples which are the leftmost points in each of the plotted series of data had the highest densities of atp although incorporating the 5 cm samples only lowers the r2 to 0 92 and 0 84 for cont15 and cont30 respectively which is still indicative of a strong linear relationship the deviation of these samples from linearity indicates that there are other factors at play in the top region of the continuously operated biofilters which merit further investigation it also suggests that precursor reductions in the very upper regions of these filters and perhaps also in the cyclically operated filters above the 5 cm port may be lower than what would be represented by the linear relationships of fig 11 regardless it is evident that most of the ndma precursors are removed transformed or otherwise neutralized to further reaction within the first 5 25 cm of the filters when analyzing regression data associated with filter operation cyclical vs continuous and flow rate 15 vs 30 min two notable trends are evident first the y intercept which is indicative of the minimum ndma precursor reduction that could be anticipated is relatively similar for all of the operating conditions 53 64 this removal may be associated with easily biodegradable precursors which are removed in the top 5 cm of the biofilter adsorption to the gac or absorption into the eps layer produced by the bacteria although the exact mechanism of removal was not identified in this study ultimately there was good removal of ndma precursors achieved by all of the biofilters 81 95 secondly when examining the slopes of the regression lines the filters operated with a 30 min ebct have a higher slope than those operated with a 15 min ebct this indicates that greater ndma precursor removal was observed per unit of atp measured in filters operated with longer ebcts likely due to the extended contact period within the filter from this analysis of ndma fp reduction as a function of atp it can be concluded that ebct dictates the ultimate removal of ndma precursors achieved by a biological filter a majority of the precursors 50 were removed in the top 5 cm of the filter of the remaining precursors which were removed at greater filter depths increasing the ebct from 15 to 30 min resulted in greater removals with smaller increases in atp likely due to the increased contact time between the microorganisms and the precursors 4 conclusions this study compared biofilters operated continuously and cyclically operating 8 12 h day at two ebcts 15 and 30 min continuously operated biofilters were associated with high levels of biomass atp when compared to cyclically operated filters atp concentrations observed on cyclical biofilter media increased for up to 4 h immediately following filter start up filters operated with a 15 min ebct had higher concentrations of atp than those operated at 30 min atp concentrations decreased with increasing filter depth regardless of operating conditions esterase and phosphatase activity surrogates for biological activity decreased with increasing filter depth similar to atp cyclical biofilter operation was shown to increase esterase activity in comparison to continuously operated filters with the same ebct suggesting the potential for increased carbon reduction this study also introduced the concept of effective enzyme activity which was calculated by multiplying the maximum measured enzyme activity for a given filter with its respective ebct effective esterase activity was strongly correlated with doc reduction r2 0 97 in 3 of 4 filters effective phosphatase activity showed correlations with phosphate reduction r2 0 80 independent of filter operation on average cyclically operated biofilters removed more doc than continuously operated filters with the same ebct statistically continuously operated biofilters with a 30 min ebct were superior to all other filters with respect to haa fp reduction however this was a negligible amount overall based on the results of this study biofiltration is an effective treatment technology for the removal of ndma fp 10 to 100 ng l to below regulatory limits the bulk of the removals occurred in the top 45 cm of the filter 80 limited ndma fp removals 10 were achieved between depths of 45 and 95 cm this might help guide future design of filter beds to increase surface area and minimize filter bed depth filter operation directly influenced the reduction of ndma fp all of the filters achieved similar removals of ndma precursors removal of ndma precursors improved with longer ebcts e g 30 vs 15 min as would be expected filters operated with a 30 min ebct were able to reduce more ndma fp 95 than filters operated with a 15 min ebct 84 acknowledgements this project was

19168,there is a growing move towards using the quantitative polymerase chain qpcr based sewage associated marker genes to assess surface water quality however a lack of understanding about the persistence of many sewage associated markers creates uncertainty for those tasked with investigating microbial water quality in this study we investigated the decay of two qpcr fib e coli ec and enterococcus spp ent 23s rrna genes and four sewage associated microbial source tracking mst marker genes human bacteroides hf183 16s rrna adenovirus hadv and polyomavirus hpyv and crassphage a recently described bacteriophage in feces in outdoor mesocosms containing fresh and marine waters and their corresponding sediments decay rates of ec 23s rrna ent 23s rrna and hf183 16s rrna were significantly p 0 05 faster than the hadv hpyv and crassphage markers in water samples from all mesocosms in general decay rates of bacterial targets were similar in the water columns of the studied mesocosms similarly decay rates of viral targets were also alike in mesocosm water columns in relation to each other the decay rates of fib and sewage associated markers were significantly faster in water samples compared to sediments in all three mesocosms in the event of resuspension fib and marker genes from sediments can potentially recontaminate overlying waters thus care should be taken when interpreting the occurrence of fib and sewage associated mst markers in water which may have originated from sediments the differential decay of these targets may also influence health outcomes and need to be considered in risk assessment models graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial source tracking marker genes decay mesocosms sewage contamination health risks 1 introduction sewage pollution can introduce elevated levels of nutrients organic matter chemicals and clinically significant microorganisms into the environment mandaric et al 2017 stark et al 2016 these contaminants may have adverse impacts on the environment and human health water contaminated with untreated or partially treated sewage can transmit disease causing pathogens in humans betancourt et al 2014 hamza et al 2014 young et al 2016 waterborne diseases are responsible for 2 million deaths year worldwide and the majority is due to mortality among young children in developing countries the economic burden of waterborne diseases is estimated at 12 billion us year alhamlan et al 2015 the direct monitoring of pathogens in water provides important information for development of management plans to minimize health risks many pathogens can be present in contaminated water due to point and nonpoint sources of fecal contamination cabral 2010 therefore it is not practical to monitor water quality for every pathogen on a routine basis moreover the distribution and abundance of pathogens in water with low levels of fecal contamination can be highly variable making detection difficult harwood et al 2014 the absence of a particular pathogen does not indicate that the water is free from other pathogens and vice versa therefore as a proxy fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli ec and enterococcus ent spp are generally used to monitor the microbiological quality of recreational water and beach sand heaney et al 2014 oun et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 the fib are highly abundant in the intestinal tract of warm blooded animals including humans and may co occur with many enteric pathogens toranzos and mcfeters 1997 therefore high numbers of fib in environmental water samples indicate fecal pollution and the possible presence of pathogens holvoet et al 2014 this in essence is the basis of the fecal indicator concept used to routinely monitor water quality on a worldwide basis relatively simple cost effective culture based methods are used to monitor fib abundance in water in addition epidemiological studies have established a link between gastrointestinal gi illness of swimmers in the recreational water and the abundance of culturable fib prüss 1998 wade et al 2006 also noted a significant trend between increased gi illness of swimmers and qpcr ent numbers at two recreational beaches in the usa despite these advantages the use of fib has been questioned due to their poor correlation with pathogens in recreational waters mcquaig et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 furthermore fib have the ability to grow in aquatic vegetation badgely et al 2011 and persist in sediment and soil ishii et al 2006 another notable limitation of monitoring fib is that their presence in water does not provide information on the contributing source s of fecal contamination microbial source tracking mst tools can distinguish between the sources of fecal contamination by targeting host associated marker genes ahmed et al 2016 harwood et al 2014 these tools are currently being applied throughout the world to gain insight into the sources of fecal pollution and to aid in the remediation harwood et al 2014 sewage contamination of recreational waters is a common problem around the world ahmed et al 2016 when such pollution occurs the recreational area is generally closed for several days until follow up water quality monitoring i e fib enumeration using culture or quantitative pcr qpcr based methods meets acceptable standards while sewage contamination can be identified in recreational waters using sewage associated marker genes there is no clear guidance for interpreting mst marker gene concentration data mattioli et al 2017 recent studies attempted to determine marker gene concentration threshold data in terms of human health risk using a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra ahmed et al 2018b boehm et al 2015 these studies suggested that for improved risk estimates and to refine marker gene concentration threshold data relative decay rates of marker genes and pathogens need to be incorporated in the qmra models the magnitude of potential health risks vary depending on pathogen decay or growth in the environment decay and growth of microorganisms are influenced by environmental conditions such as water activity in sands soils and sediments sunlight temperature ph humidity salinity predation organic matter and environmental matrix properties anderson et al 2005 ishii and sadowsky 2008 korajkic et al 2013 byappanahalli et al 2012 rochelle newall et al 2015 several studies have determined the inactivation of fib and pathogens in fresh and marine water microcosms beach sand and sediment anderson et al 2005 lee et al 2006 wait and sobsey 2001 however information concerning environmental decay rates of currently used mst marker genes especially sewage associated viral markers in relation to each other and qpcr fib are not well documented ahmed et al 2014 bae and wuertz 2012 kirs et al 2016 this information is critical for water quality managers and health regulators to protect swimmers and other recreational users from adverse health risks the primary aim of this study was to investigate the decay of four sewage associated bacterial and viral markers hf183 hadv hpyv and crassphage in relation to each other and qpcr fib in sewage contaminated fresh and marine waters and accompanying sandy sediments outdoor mesocosms containing water and sediment were inoculated with untreated sewage and qpcr assays were used to quantify each target over 40 days to determine their decay rates the thorough understanding of the decay dynamics of qpcr fib and sewage markers in recreational waters presented in this study will aid in the risk assessment associated with sewage contamination 2 materials and methods 2 1 mesocosm set up for decay experiments sediment and overlying water samples were collected from bribie island bi and nudgee beach nb representing marine environments and lake somerset ls representing a freshwater recreational area to avoid cross contamination of microbes between water and sediment within a location water samples were collected first followed by a sediment sample for the seeding experiment a fresh untreated sewage sample was collected from the primary influent of a sewage treatment plant stp in brisbane australia which treats sewage from 250 000 people the water and sewage samples were collected in sterile 10 l polypropylene carboys and the sediment samples were collected in 12 l plastic containers samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and upon arrival ph salinity turbidity and total organic carbon toc were determined for each ambient water sample according to the methods described below a 200 g sediment sample from each site was used for particle size analysis sieved samples prepared using the iso 14688 1 2002 and as 4816 1 2002 standard methods were weighed and grain size classification as a percentage was determined particle size proportions were characterized and included silt 63 μm fine sand 63 125 μm coarse sand 125 250 μm 0 25 0 50 mm 0 50 2 mm and fine gravel 2 4 mm three mesocosms were constructed at the ecosciences precinct esp dutton park southeast queensland seq australia using 8 l plastic containers filled with sediment 4 5 cm depth for each type of water producing nine mesocosms in total a schematic diagram of the mesocosms is shown in supplementary fig s1 approximately 4 5 l of unfiltered or non autoclaved water that was collected from each site was gently added to each container to avoid mixing with the sediment unfiltered or non autoclaved water was used to allow the decay of microorganisms to occur in the presence of autochthonous microorganisms all containers were enclosed in a large 1200 l plastic container filled with approximately 200 l of water in order to maintain the water temperature similar to that at the environmental site mesocosms were allowed to equilibrate for 24 h prior to seeding with 500 ml of fresh untreated sewage 9 1 dilution an air stone was placed in each mesocosm and air was pumped continuously for the duration of the experiment to maintain dissolved oxygen and keep the water column mixed it is possible that placing an airstone in each microcosm may affect anaerobic bacteroides decay however such an effect if any was not addressed in this study non seeded water and sediment used as control ahmed et al 2014 some evaporation of the overlying water occurred over the course of the experiment due to exposure to natural sunlight the volume of water lost due to evaporation was noted on each sampling day and corrected by adding the corresponding environmental water into the respective mesocosms a cover was placed over mesocosms during rainfall events to minimize the possibility of overflowing variables such as the volume of water temperature uv radiation mixing the quantity of sewage inoculum and ambient weather conditions were similar for all mesocosms the type of water and sediment were the only independent variables from each mesocosm one water sample 100 ml was collected on each of days 0 1 4 8 14 24 and 40 on day 0 water in the mesocosms was sampled using a 25 ml pipette within 30 min after sewage inoculation sediment core samplers made by cutting the ends of plastic 10 ml pipettes were used for sampling sediment from each mesocosm one sediment sample approximately 1 g was collected from each mesocosm on days 0 1 4 8 14 24 and 40 water samples were collected before sediment samples to minimize any influence of sediment resuspension which may have artificially elevate the abundance of microorganisms in the water column temperature data loggers hobo devices onset computer corporation pocasset ma were placed in the control mesocosm to record water temperature at 2 h intervals for the duration of the experiment ambient climatic data i e

of gc that can be reliably detected or quantified in 2 3 qpcr reactions 2 5 data analysis qpcr fib and sewage associated marker data from all three mesocosms were initially evaluated by a gaussian model using davies test davies 1987 piepho and ogutu 2003 data points aloq were excluded from the decay rate calculation if results of the davies test were significant p 0 05 the markers were examined using a biphasic decay model log 10 c t c 0 k 1 t once t t and log 10 c t c 0 k 1 t k 2 t t once t t otherwise markers were conducted by the first order decay model log 10 c t c 0 k t davies et al

coefficient of the first order decay model the turning point of the biphasic decay model t and the decay coefficients of the two phases k 1 and k 2 were identified based on two segment piecewise regression analysis muggeo 2003 the performances of the two kinetic models were evaluated based on the goodness of fit r2 akaike information criterion aic was used to further evaluate the performance of the biphasic decay model of the selected marker genes and to compare the two models shipley 2013 thet 90 values were calculated using the equation t 90 2 303 k as described previously gourmelon et al 2010 fisher s least significant difference lsd test was used to compare slopes among the different samples this allowed identification of the effect of water and sediment types and type of targets on the decay rate pearson s correlation was used to determine correlations among different genes associated with fib sewage associated markers and physico chemical parameters and ambient weather conditions for this purpose the quantitative values for the non detection of fib and sewage associated markers were predicted by using the robust regression on order statistic ros followed by monte carlo simulation n 1000 as described previously zhang et al 2016 in general statistical findings were considered significant at an α level of 0 5 all statistical analyses were done using r version 3 3

the values are shown in supplementary table s2 the mean intra coefficient of variation cv values across four sets of standards ranging from 3 to 3 106 gc reaction were 5 for all qpcr assays the qpcr alod was determined to be 3 gc reaction for all assays and aloq was determined to be 30 gc reaction for all assays 3 2 background concentrations of qpcr fib and sewage associated mst markers in untreated sewage water and sediment samples used to establish mesocosms the background concentrations of ec and ent in untreated raw sewage were 7 87 and 7 92 log10 gc 100 ml respectively table 1 among the four sewage associated markers the mean concentrations of crassphage and hf183 were 8 34 log10 gc 100 ml and 8 09 log10 gc 100 ml respectively the concentration of hadv was two orders of magnitude lower than the hf183 and crassphage marker genes the concentration of hpyv 5 69 log10 gc 100 ml was the lowest among all four sewage associated markers the concentrations of ec in background water samples ranged from 3 91 to 4 59 log10 gc 100 ml of water the concentration of ent in water was lower than ec and ranged from 3 19 to 4 04 log10 gc 100 ml of water the concentrations of ec and ent in sediment samples ranged from 4 54 to 4 77 and 4 04 to 5 27 log10 gc g of sand none of the mst markers was detected in the sediment and overlying water samples collected from the bi nb and ls sites except for crassphage which was detected in the sediment sample from ls site with a mean concentration of 2 87 log10 gc g 3 3 physico chemical properties of mesocosm and weather conditions the mesocosm experiments were run from march to may in 2017 the physico chemical properties of sediment samples from the three sites differed significantly supplementary table s3 all of the beach sediments had a high portion of sand sized particles 80 99 of 0 125 2 mm in contrast the bi sediment contained a greater portion of coarse sand 92 of 0 25 2 mm and nb and ls contained mostly fine sand size particles 12 20 of 63 125 μm and 60 67 of 0 125 0 25 mm the physico chemical parameters measured during this study are shown in supplementary fig s2 the ph of water in the bi mesocosm was low 5 80 at the beginning of the experiment but increased to 6 17 on day 40 the water ph of the nb site remained stable throughout the experiment ranging from 5 74 to 6 28 similarly the ph of the ls water was also stable ranging from 6 62 to 7 40 up to day 28 but then declined to 6 01 the electrical conductivity values of bi and nb mesocosms reflected their marine characteristics initially 48 6 and 53 9 ms cm respectively compared to the freshwater ls 1 1 ms cm as a result of the evaporation and replacement of lost volume with site water the waters of bi and nb mesocosms became progressively more saline during the experiment being 63 1 and 72 4 ms cm respectively on day 40 water turbidity values of all three mesocosms were greater immediate after inoculation of untreated sewage and then the values decreased considerably and remained stable throughout the experiment total organic carbon toc values were also greater up to day 4 and then the values decreased and remained stable until the end of the experiment the average evaporation relative humidity and sunlight ranged from 1 40 to 13 8 mm 32 5 93 5 and 0 10 9 h respectively precipitation occurred during days 2 4 11 41 8 mm and on days 9 10 mm and 21 3 20 mm the water temperature in the mesocosms ranged from 18 2 to 27 6 c during the study 3 4 decay rates of qpcr fib and sewage associated markers the ec and ent 23s rrna genes were quantifiable in dna extracted from both water and sediment samples from the bi nb and ls mesocosms until day 40 fig 1 sewage associated bacteroides hf183 was quantifiable up to day 4 in the water and sediment samples from all three mesocosms and the hadv was quantifiable up to day 8 in water samples from bi and nb marine and up to day 14 in water from ls freshwater similarly hadvs were quantifiable up to day 8 in sediment samples from bi and ls whereas they were quantifiable in a water sample from nb until day 14 the concentration of hpyv declined aloq rapidly compared to hadv while the concentration of hpyv in water samples reached aloq on day 8 they could not be quantified after day 4 in the sediment in contrast the crassphage marker gene was quantifiable for relatively longer periods of time compared to hf183 hpyv and hadv in both water and sediment samples from all three mesocosms crassphage was quantifiable up to day 14 in water samples from bi and ls whereas they were quantifiable in nb water sample until day 24 the crassphage marker gene was quantifiable in sediment samples from bi and ls up to day 24 and at day 40 in the sediment sample from nb the decay of fib and sewage associated markers occurred in water and sediment samples from all three mesocosms except for a few targets i e ent hadv and hpyv in sediment samples targets that did not decay over the course of this study were not used in the decay rate calculations the declining concentrations of targets were fitted with either first order or biphasic decay models data points fitting biphasic decay models were evaluated by aic the biphasic models had smaller aic values i e a better fit compared to the first order decay model according to the first order decay model ent in sediment samples from bi k 0 03 t 90 87 days and ls k 0 08 t 90 29 7 days mesocosms exhibited slow decay rates table 2 the hf183 marker gene in water and sediment samples from all three mesocosms followed a first order decay the decay of hf183 was faster k 0 97 to 1 01 t 90 2 37 to 2 29 days in water samples compared to sediment k 0 49 0 09 t 90 4 69 26 days the decay of hf183 in water from all mesocosms was significantly different from sediment p 0 05 according to the fisher s lsd test fig 2 the decay rates of hadv in water samples from all three microcosms ranged from 0 24 to 0 58 t 90 9 4 to 3 95 days the decay rate of hadv in sediment was significantly slower p 0 05 than in water from the nb mesocosm the decay rates of hpyv in water were similar to those of hadv ranging from 0 26 to 0 42 t 90 8 93 to 5 53 days the decay of hpyv was significantly p 0 05 slower in nb sediment samples than in water although the hpyv decay was slightly faster in ls sediment compared to water the difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 the decay rates of crassphage in water samples from both bi and ls mesocosms were similar to hadv and hpyv ranging from 0 30 to 0 33 t 90 7 73 to 6 91 days however the crassphage decay rate in sediment was much slower than that seen in water ranging from 0 05 to 0 03 t 90 45 1 90 3 days the decay of hf183 in water from both bi and ls mesocosms was significantly different p 0 05 from sediment according to the biphasic decay model ec exhibited a faster decay rate in water during the first phase k 1 0 33 to 0 67 t 90 6 98 to 3 45 days in all three mesocosms compared to sediment k 1 0 23 to 0 29 t 90 9 84 to 8 04 days table 3 the differences were significant p 0 05 for the bi and ls mesocosms but not for the nb mesocosm p 0 05 the first phase of the biphasic decay of ent k 1 0 72 to 1 19 t 90 3 18 to 1 93 days and crassphage k 1 0 38 t 90 6 05 days in water were similar to first order decay of hf183 k 0 97 to 1 01 t 90 2 37 to 2 29 days hadv k 0 24 to 0 58 t 90 9 4 to 3 95 days and hpyv k 0 26 to 0 42 t 90 8 93 to 5 53 days respectively in contrast the second phase of the biphasic decay was significantly slower p 0 05 than the first phase in all 10 instances decay rates first order and the first phase of the biphasic of the bacterial targets ec ent and hf183 were significantly different p 0 05 than the viral targets hadv hpyv and crassphage in water samples from bi and ls mesocosms similarly decay rates of bacterial targets were significantly different p 0 05 than those of the viral targets in the nb mesocosm except for ec marker gene in the nb mesocosm which decayed at a similar rate at those viral targets decay rates first order and the first phase of the biphasic of the bacterial targets in the studied mesocosms were also similar to viral targets in sediment samples significant differences p 0 05 in decay rates were observed in only a few cases i e ec vs crassphage in nb and ls ent vs hpyv in ls and hf183 vs crassphage in ls mesocosms 3 5 correlation between target decay in water and physicochemical parameters ambient weather conditions the crassphage ent and hadv marker genes showed significant correlations with mesocosm water temperature table 4 while the hpyv marker was significantly p 0 05 positively correlated with water temperature in the bi and ls mesocosms however statistically significant correlation p 0 05 was not observed between hpyv and water temperature in the nb mesocosm ec decay was significantly p 0 05 positively correlated with water temperature in the nb and ls mesocosms but was not significantly correlated p 0 05 with water temperature in the bi mesocosm crassphage from all three mesocosms showed significant and positive correlations p 0 05 with relative humidity only the hadv marker from the ls mesocosm was significantly p 0 05 correlated with humidity electrical conductivity had significant negative correlations with fib and sewage associated markers in the bi and nb mesocosms representing marine environments in contrast positive correlations were seen between each target and electrical conductivity in the ls mesocosm but the results were not statistically significant p 0 05 toc had significant strong positive correlations with all targets in all three mesocosms the decay of crassphage did not significantly correlate with water turbidity from any of the mesocosms however hf183 and ec decay in the bi mesocosm was significantly p 0 05 correlated with water turbidity the decay rates of ec ent hf183 hadv and hpyv were significantly p 0 05 correlated with water turbidity in the nb mesocosms significant positive correlations were also seen among fib and sewage associated markers in water samples from all three mesocosms evaporation sunlight and ph had no statistically significant correlations or most cases had negative correlations with all targets in all three mesocosms 4 discussion the marker genes used for mst field studies are associated with obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria or viruses the differential decay of these mst markers could lead to different risk assessment interpretations and remediation outcomes depending on which marker is used at present very little is known about the persistence of qpcr based sewage associated markers and fib in water and sediment in relation to each other this information is critical for risk estimation and protecting public health microcosms mesocosms in laboratory conditions that focus on a single factor have been found to differ from onsite experiments balleste and blanch 2010 green et al 2011 bae and wuertz 2015 several studies have determined the decay of fib mst markers and pathogens in freshwater and seawater microcosms using culture based or qpcr methods for the decay experiment we used mesocosms since these are ideal tools for studying the impacts of a contaminant on an ecosystem under simulated field conditions stewart et al 2013 a mesocosm is subjected to the natural environment taking into account relevant in situ characteristics without losing the advantage of reliable reference conditions and replication the ec and ent 23s rrna exhibited biphasic decay patterns in water samples from all three mesocosms similar biphasic decay patterns of culturable ec and ent in seawater and beach sand and sediment microcosms have been reported in a recent study zhang et al 2015 schulz and childers 2011 also noted biphasic decay dynamics of alternative fecal indicators in freshwater at various temperatures and salinities rogers et al 2011 noted biphasic decay of entero1 and genbac3 qpcr fib in manure amended soils various factors such as the depletion of predators over time population heterogeneity due to different strains genetically or nongenetically differentiated cells different growth or cell cycle stage clumping hardening or the specific decay rate could be directly or indirectly affected by the cell density rogers et al 2011 hellweger et al 2009 this may also be due to microbial die off at an initial rapid rate leading to second phase of decay which is slower because the microbes present are better adapted to the environment and the nutrients present easton et al 2005 two subpopulations with different decay rates may also be present in water samples from mesocosms velz 1984 modelling biphasic decay is important since it has been reported that failure to consider biphasic pathogen dynamics can lead to substantial under or overestimation of disease risks and pathogen concentrations brouwer et al 2017 the ent 23s rrna present in the bi and ls sediment mesocosms was detected up to day 40 these data suggest that the detection of the ent 23s rrna in the fresh and marine sediment environments may not indicate the age of fecal pollution similar results have been reported in a recent study which investigated the decay of ent1a genetic marker in six different types of ambient sediment in california zimmer faust et al 2017 here the ent1a marker remained stable over the course of the 21 day sampling period in all six ambient sediments tested another study investigated the decay of ent 23s rrna in two depths 0 2 cm and 4 6 cm of sediment microcosm kept in the dark at 20 c kim and wuertz 2015 the authors did not observe ent 23s rrna decay during the 28 day of experimental period similar results were observed for ent 23s rrna gene in the nb sediment mesocosm where no decay was observed however in our study decay was observed in ent dna in bi t 90 87 days and ls t 90 29 7 days sediments decay may have been due to the elevated temperature and sunlight as these parameters were different in this study compared to that of kim and wuertz 2015 during the decay experiment the water temperature ranged from 18 2 to 27 6 c and all the mesocosms received sunlight hf183 decay rates and t 90 in these conditions were similar to decay rates of hf183 in a light exposed microcosm exposed to a similar temperature in previous studies liang et al 2012 green et al 2011 ahmed et al 2014 gilpin et al 2013 such results suggest that the hf183 marker may be more suitable for identifying recent human fecal pollution in this study mesocosms were continuously aerated up to day 40 which may have accelerated the decay of the hf183 marker it has been reported that the hf183 marker i e dna persisted better in freshwater sediment under anaerobic conditions kim and wuertz 2015 hf183 persisted longer in sediment samples from the bi and nb mesocosms compared to the sediment in ls the decay rate of the hf183 in the freshwater ls mesocosm was similar to beach sediment that contained 28 moisture in dark microcosm in a previous study eichmiller et al 2014 a recent study reported that the hf183 marker exhibited statistically similar decay rate constants in six freshwater sediments microcosm at a constant temperature of 20 c zimmer faust et al 2017 the results of this study were in close agreement with the results obtained in a previous study for decay rates obtained for hf183 in a freshwater sediment mesocosm such results suggest that hf183 may also be a reliable marker to detect recent fecal pollution in freshwater beach sand the t 90 values of hadv were faster in water samples ranging from 3 95 to 9 40 days which is similar to a previous study that reported hadv persistence also determined using qpcr in freshwater microcosms under sunlight and dark conditions at 22 c bae and wuertz 2012 however the hadv decay rates in mesocosm water in the current study were faster than those shown in a previous mesocosm study the difference in results may be due to the slightly higher temperatures in this study ahmed et al 2014 hpyv t 90 values obtained in this study were similar to a recent study which reported 6 days t 90 value of hpyv in sunlight unfiltered fresh and marine water microcosms in hawaii kirs et al 2016 the decay rate of crassphage in water was similar to those of hadv and hpyv the crassphage marker persisted longer in sediment than did hadv and hpyv moreover the crassphage in nb sediment persisted longer than in the bi and ls sediment mesocosms this could be attributed to the particle characteristics of the nb sediment which was silty and fluffy in nature compared to the coarse bi and ls sediments this may have led to better persistence of nb as a previous study also reported better persistence of poliovirus and rotavirus in fluffy sediment rao et al 1984 and a range of viruses such as hepatitis a virus poliovirus 1 echovirus 1 and ms2 in loamy sand compared to coarse sand sobsey et al 1995 in addition attachment of viruses to solid particles may result in protection from uv inactivation chrysikopoulos and aravantinou 2012 generally the viral targets in water that we examined persisted longer than did the bacterial targets double stranded dna viruses such as hadv can be extremely stable when subjected to chlorination or uv because their undamaged dna or rna strand may serve as a template for repair by host enzymes during infections furthermore these viruses have a high molecular weight that may also impart increased uv resistance gerba et al 2002 hpyv are also reported to be highly stable through sewage treatment processes and are stable in external environments bo fill mas et al 2006 it is also possible that viral targets in water preferentially adsorb onto particles and in remain stable longer than bacteria rao et al 1984 moreover due to their small size virus particles may be less susceptible to predation than bacteria which serve as the food source of some protozoa among the eight physico chemical and ambient weather parameters examined in the decay experiment water mesocosm temperature positively correlated to the decay rates of fib and sewage associated markers in the studied mesocosms similar trends have been reported in previous studies for example islam et al 2017 noted positive correlations between fib and water temperature in subtropical and continental regions have been observed ishii et al 2006 islam et al 2017 we also observed a positive correlation between turbidity and the mst marker gene concentrations in mesocosm water samples in the past it has been noted that microbial contamination is commonly accompanied by increases in turbidity mann et al 2007 the toc i e nutrient availability also had a positive correlation with the concentration of targets which is in agreement with previous studies showing that nutrient availability significantly effects the survival of microbes kirschner et al 2004 pote et al 2009 in this study we did not measure the decay rates of culturable fib and in relation to qpcr fib and sewage associated marker genes this is important as culturable fib is used by regulatory agencies throughout the world the decay of hf183 and ent23s rrna in marine and freshwater mesocosms were similar to culturable fib reported in previous studies ahmed et al 2014 solecki et al 2011 the decay rates of hadv were also similar to a pervious study which determined the decay of hadv in freshwater microcosms under sunlight and dark conditions bae and wuertz 2012 ent 23s rrna gene persisted longer in sediment similar results have been documented in a previous study that determined the decay of culturable enterococcus spp in salt water sediment anderson et al 2005 the decay rates of ent 23s rrna in sediment sample from ls mesocosm reported in this study was similar to the decay rates of ent1a gene in sediment microcosms inoculated with sewage in a previous study zimmer faust et al 2017 caution should be exercised when comparing the results of decay rates of the fib and sewage markers in sediment among studies undertaken in various geographical regions because decay rates can be influenced by many factors and experimental conditions which may have attribute the differences in decay rates and thus making direct comparison difficult the decay of mst markers measured here may also be the result of protozoan grazing or other bacterivores as others have observed in fresh waters korajkic et al 2013 in general fib and sewage associated markers persisted longer in sediment compared to water the survival and regrowth of culturable fib in beach sediment has been documented desmarais et al 2002 hartz et al 2008 lee et al 2006 beach sediment may provide feasible conditions for the persistence of fib and mst marker dna by providing protection from sunlight irradiation predation favorable nutrient conditions and colonizable surfaces for biofilm formation davies et al 1995 haller et al 2009 the prolonged persistence of host associated bacteroidales suggests that sediments should be considered in practical applications of mst because they can act as non point sources of fecal markers the greater persistence of fib and mst markers in sediment may need to be considered because sediment may contribute fib and mst markers in water column and elevate the pollution level after resuspension further research is necessary to determine the relationship of the survival and persistence of the bacteroidales markers in sediments with those of pathogenic bacteria also the quantitative estimation of microbial release from sediments into the overlying water column will provide a better foundation to assess health risks associated with sediment resuspension 5 conclusions decay rates of bacterial targets two fib and hf183 were fast and similar in water samples across three mesocosms similarly decay rates of viral targets hadv hpyv and crassphage were similar in water samples however viral targets persisted significantly p 0 05 longer than did bacterial targets decay rates of fib and sewage associated markers in sediment mesocosm samples varied greatly across the marine and freshwater mesocosms decay rates of fib and sewage associated markers were significantly faster in water samples compared to sediment in all mesocosms fib ec and or ent exhibited biphasic decay rates compared to mst markers in water and sediment samples from all mesocosms due to the nature of decay they may not be reliable markers to detect recent fecal pollution decay rates of fib and mst markers significantly and positively correlated with mesocosm water temperature toc and turbidity and were mostly negatively correlated with rainfall electrical conductivity evaporation sunlight and ph further research into the introduction distribution and

19168,there is a growing move towards using the quantitative polymerase chain qpcr based sewage associated marker genes to assess surface water quality however a lack of understanding about the persistence of many sewage associated markers creates uncertainty for those tasked with investigating microbial water quality in this study we investigated the decay of two qpcr fib e coli ec and enterococcus spp ent 23s rrna genes and four sewage associated microbial source tracking mst marker genes human bacteroides hf183 16s rrna adenovirus hadv and polyomavirus hpyv and crassphage a recently described bacteriophage in feces in outdoor mesocosms containing fresh and marine waters and their corresponding sediments decay rates of ec 23s rrna ent 23s rrna and hf183 16s rrna were significantly p 0 05 faster than the hadv hpyv and crassphage markers in water samples from all mesocosms in general decay rates of bacterial targets were similar in the water columns of the studied mesocosms similarly decay rates of viral targets were also alike in mesocosm water columns in relation to each other the decay rates of fib and sewage associated markers were significantly faster in water samples compared to sediments in all three mesocosms in the event of resuspension fib and marker genes from sediments can potentially recontaminate overlying waters thus care should be taken when interpreting the occurrence of fib and sewage associated mst markers in water which may have originated from sediments the differential decay of these targets may also influence health outcomes and need to be considered in risk assessment models graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial source tracking marker genes decay mesocosms sewage contamination health risks 1 introduction sewage pollution can introduce elevated levels of nutrients organic matter chemicals and clinically significant microorganisms into the environment mandaric et al 2017 stark et al 2016 these contaminants may have adverse impacts on the environment and human health water contaminated with untreated or partially treated sewage can transmit disease causing pathogens in humans betancourt et al 2014 hamza et al 2014 young et al 2016 waterborne diseases are responsible for 2 million deaths year worldwide and the majority is due to mortality among young children in developing countries the economic burden of waterborne diseases is estimated at 12 billion us year alhamlan et al 2015 the direct monitoring of pathogens in water provides important information for development of management plans to minimize health risks many pathogens can be present in contaminated water due to point and nonpoint sources of fecal contamination cabral 2010 therefore it is not practical to monitor water quality for every pathogen on a routine basis moreover the distribution and abundance of pathogens in water with low levels of fecal contamination can be highly variable making detection difficult harwood et al 2014 the absence of a particular pathogen does not indicate that the water is free from other pathogens and vice versa therefore as a proxy fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli ec and enterococcus ent spp are generally used to monitor the microbiological quality of recreational water and beach sand heaney et al 2014 oun et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 the fib are highly abundant in the intestinal tract of warm blooded animals including humans and may co occur with many enteric pathogens toranzos and mcfeters 1997 therefore high numbers of fib in environmental water samples indicate fecal pollution and the possible presence of pathogens holvoet et al 2014 this in essence is the basis of the fecal indicator concept used to routinely monitor water quality on a worldwide basis relatively simple cost effective culture based methods are used to monitor fib abundance in water in addition epidemiological studies have established a link between gastrointestinal gi illness of swimmers in the recreational water and the abundance of culturable fib prüss 1998 wade et al 2006 also noted a significant trend between increased gi illness of swimmers and qpcr ent numbers at two recreational beaches in the usa despite these advantages the use of fib has been questioned due to their poor correlation with pathogens in recreational waters mcquaig et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 furthermore fib have the ability to grow in aquatic vegetation badgely et al 2011 and persist in sediment and soil ishii et al 2006 another notable limitation of monitoring fib is that their presence in water does not provide information on the contributing source s of fecal contamination microbial source tracking mst tools can distinguish between the sources of fecal contamination by targeting host associated marker genes ahmed et al 2016 harwood et al 2014 these tools are currently being applied throughout the world to gain insight into the sources of fecal pollution and to aid in the remediation harwood et al 2014 sewage contamination of recreational waters is a common problem around the world ahmed et al 2016 when such pollution occurs the recreational area is generally closed for several days until follow up water quality monitoring i e fib enumeration using culture or quantitative pcr qpcr based methods meets acceptable standards while sewage contamination can be identified in recreational waters using sewage associated marker genes there is no clear guidance for interpreting mst marker gene concentration data mattioli et al 2017 recent studies attempted to determine marker gene concentration threshold data in terms of human health risk using a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra ahmed et al 2018b boehm et al 2015 these studies suggested that for improved risk estimates and to refine marker gene concentration threshold data relative decay rates of marker genes and pathogens need to be incorporated in the qmra models the magnitude of potential health risks vary depending on pathogen decay or growth in the environment decay and growth of microorganisms are influenced by environmental conditions such as water activity in sands soils and sediments sunlight temperature ph humidity salinity predation organic matter and environmental matrix properties anderson et al 2005 ishii and sadowsky 2008 korajkic et al 2013 byappanahalli et al 2012 rochelle newall et al 2015 several studies have determined the inactivation of fib and pathogens in fresh and marine water microcosms beach sand and sediment anderson et al 2005 lee et al 2006 wait and sobsey 2001 however information concerning environmental decay rates of currently used mst marker genes especially sewage associated viral markers in relation to each other and qpcr fib are not well documented ahmed et al 2014 bae and wuertz 2012 kirs et al 2016 this information is critical for water quality managers and health regulators to protect swimmers and other recreational users from adverse health risks the primary aim of this study was to investigate the decay of four sewage associated bacterial and viral markers hf183 hadv hpyv and crassphage in relation to each other and qpcr fib in sewage contaminated fresh and marine waters and accompanying sandy sediments outdoor mesocosms containing water and sediment were inoculated with untreated sewage and qpcr assays were used to quantify each target over 40 days to determine their decay rates the thorough understanding of the decay dynamics of qpcr fib and sewage markers in recreational waters presented in this study will aid in the risk assessment associated with sewage contamination 2 materials and methods 2 1 mesocosm set up for decay experiments sediment and overlying water samples were collected from bribie island bi and nudgee beach nb representing marine environments and lake somerset ls representing a freshwater recreational area to avoid cross contamination of microbes between water and sediment within a location water samples were collected first followed by a sediment sample for the seeding experiment a fresh untreated sewage sample was collected from the primary influent of a sewage treatment plant stp in brisbane australia which treats sewage from 250 000 people the water and sewage samples were collected in sterile 10 l polypropylene carboys and the sediment samples were collected in 12 l plastic containers samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and upon arrival ph salinity turbidity and total organic carbon toc were determined for each ambient water sample according to the methods described below a 200 g sediment sample from each site was used for particle size analysis sieved samples prepared using the iso 14688 1 2002 and as 4816 1 2002 standard methods were weighed and grain size classification as a percentage was determined particle size proportions were characterized and included silt 63 μm fine sand 63 125 μm coarse sand 125 250 μm 0 25 0 50 mm 0 50 2 mm and fine gravel 2 4 mm three mesocosms were constructed at the ecosciences precinct esp dutton park southeast queensland seq australia using 8 l plastic containers filled with sediment 4 5 cm depth for each type of water producing nine mesocosms in total a schematic diagram of the mesocosms is shown in supplementary fig s1 approximately 4 5 l of unfiltered or non autoclaved water that was collected from each site was gently added to each container to avoid mixing with the sediment unfiltered or non autoclaved water was used to allow the decay of microorganisms to occur in the presence of autochthonous microorganisms all containers were enclosed in a large 1200 l plastic container filled with approximately 200 l of water in order to maintain the water temperature similar to that at the environmental site mesocosms were allowed to equilibrate for 24 h prior to seeding with 500 ml of fresh untreated sewage 9 1 dilution an air stone was placed in each mesocosm and air was pumped continuously for the duration of the experiment to maintain dissolved oxygen and keep the water column mixed it is possible that placing an airstone in each microcosm may affect anaerobic bacteroides decay however such an effect if any was not addressed in this study non seeded water and sediment used as control ahmed et al 2014 some evaporation of the overlying water occurred over the course of the experiment due to exposure to natural sunlight the volume of water lost due to evaporation was noted on each sampling day and corrected by adding the corresponding environmental water into the respective mesocosms a cover was placed over mesocosms during rainfall events to minimize the possibility of overflowing variables such as the volume of water temperature uv radiation mixing the quantity of sewage inoculum and ambient weather conditions were similar for all mesocosms the type of water and sediment were the only independent variables from each mesocosm one water sample 100 ml was collected on each of days 0 1 4 8 14 24 and 40 on day 0 water in the mesocosms was sampled using a 25 ml pipette within 30 min after sewage inoculation sediment core samplers made by cutting the ends of plastic 10 ml pipettes were used for sampling sediment from each mesocosm one sediment sample approximately 1 g was collected from each mesocosm on days 0 1 4 8 14 24 and 40 water samples were collected before sediment samples to minimize any influence of sediment resuspension which may have artificially elevate the abundance of microorganisms in the water column temperature data loggers hobo devices onset computer corporation pocasset ma were placed in the control mesocosm to record water temperature at 2 h intervals for the duration of the experiment ambient climatic data i e temperature rainfall evaporation and relative humidity were collected from the australian bureau of meteorology bom website 2 2 sample processing and dna extraction each 100 ml water sample was filtered through 0 45 μm pore size 47 mm diameter negatively charged ha membranes merck millipore tokyo japan a 250 mg sediment sample was carefully drawn out from the core sampler dna was directly extracted from the membranes containing targets from water and sediment using mo bio power soil dna kits mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa in order to obtain information on background microorganisms present in matrices dna was directly extracted in triplicate from 250 μl samples of untreated sewage 100 ml aliquots of ambient water and 250 mg aliquots of sediment taken from each site before seeding with untreated sewage dna was extracted using a mo bio power soil dna kit all dna samples were stored at 80 c until used the concentration of dna in each sample was measured by using a nano drop 2000 instrument thermo scientific ma usa an experiment was conducted to determine the presence of pcr inhibitors in extracted dna samples using a sketa22 real time pcr assay haugland et al 2005 samples with a 2 quantification cycle cq delay were considered to have pcr inhibitors staley et al 2012 2 3 chemical and metal analysis from each mesocosm one water sample 100 ml was collected on days 0 1 4 8 14 24 and 40 and tested for ph salinity turbidity and total organic carbon toc analysis the ph and salinity were measured using a ph conductivity meter orion star a215 thermoscientific ma usa

as cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb v and zn methods and results are shown in supplementary materials and supplementary tables s4 s6 2 4 qpcr assays the qpcr standards for ec 23s rrna and ent 23s rrna were prepared from the genomic dna of e coli atcc 35150 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433 respectively as described elsewhere ahmed et al 2012 ten fold dilutions of genomic dna standards ranging from 3 to 3 106 gene copies gc reaction were prepared and stored at 20 c the ec and ent 23s rrna qpcr assays were performed in 20 μl reaction mixtures using 10 μl of ssoadvanced universal probe supermix bio

this study are shown in supplementary table s1 all qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate for each qpcr assay positive controls i e genomic or plasmid standards and three negative controls sterile water were included to assess successful amplification and contamination qpcr standards were analysed to determine the amplification efficiencies e and the correlation coefficient r 2 supplementary table s2 inter assay variability of each qpcr assay was measured using four separate qpcr runs performed on four different days using three replicates of the standard ranging from 3 to 3 106 gc reaction the qpcr assay s lower limit of detection alod and quantification aloq values were determined from cq values of the standards run n 4 the alod and aloq was defined as the lowest number of gc that can be reliably detected or quantified in 2 3 qpcr reactions 2 5 data analysis qpcr fib and sewage associated marker data from all three mesocosms were initially evaluated by a gaussian model using davies test davies 1987 piepho and ogutu 2003 data points aloq were excluded from the decay rate calculation if results of the davies test were significant p 0 05 the markers were examined

coefficient of the first order decay model the turning point of the biphasic decay model t and the decay coefficients of the two phases k 1 and k 2 were identified based on two segment piecewise regression analysis muggeo 2003 the performances of the two kinetic models were evaluated based on the goodness of fit r2 akaike information criterion aic was used to further evaluate the performance of the biphasic decay model of the selected marker genes and to compare the two models shipley 2013 thet 90 values were calculated using the equation t 90 2 303 k as described previously gourmelon et al 2010 fisher s least significant difference lsd test was used to compare slopes among the different samples this allowed identification of the effect of water and sediment types and type of targets on the decay rate pearson s correlation was used to determine correlations among different genes associated with fib sewage associated markers and physico chemical parameters and ambient weather conditions for this purpose the quantitative values for the non detection of fib and sewage associated markers were predicted by using the robust regression on order statistic ros followed by monte carlo simulation n 1000 as described previously zhang et al 2016 in general statistical findings were considered significant at an α level of 0 5 all statistical analyses were done using r version 3 3 1 3 results 3 1 qpcr performance characteristics standard curves n 4 were generated for each qpcr assay the optimal reactions conditions were determined based on the criteria a slope factor of 3 099 to 3 59 corresponding to a pcr efficiency of 90 110 a correlation coefficient 0 98 the range of qpcr efficiencies were within the optimal range as recommended by miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 and the values are shown in supplementary table s2 the mean intra coefficient of variation cv values across four sets of standards ranging from 3 to 3 106 gc reaction were 5 for all qpcr assays the qpcr alod was determined to be 3 gc reaction for all assays and aloq was determined to be 30 gc reaction for all assays 3 2 background concentrations of qpcr fib and sewage associated mst markers in untreated sewage water and sediment samples used to establish mesocosms the background concentrations of ec and ent in untreated raw sewage were 7 87 and 7 92 log10 gc 100 ml respectively table 1 among the four sewage associated markers the mean concentrations of crassphage and hf183 were 8 34 log10 gc 100 ml and 8 09 log10 gc 100 ml respectively the concentration of hadv was two orders of magnitude lower than the hf183 and crassphage marker genes the concentration of hpyv 5 69 log10 gc 100 ml was the lowest among all four sewage associated markers the concentrations of ec in background water samples ranged from 3 91 to 4 59 log10 gc 100 ml of water the concentration of ent in water was lower than ec and ranged from 3 19 to 4 04 log10 gc 100 ml of water the concentrations of ec and ent in sediment samples ranged from 4 54 to 4 77 and 4 04 to 5 27 log10 gc g of sand none of the mst markers was detected in the sediment and overlying water samples collected from the bi nb and ls sites except for crassphage which was detected in the sediment sample from ls site with a mean concentration of 2 87 log10 gc g 3 3 physico chemical properties of mesocosm and weather conditions the mesocosm experiments were run from march to may in 2017 the physico chemical properties of sediment samples from the three sites differed significantly supplementary table s3 all of the beach sediments had a high portion of sand sized particles 80 99 of 0 125 2 mm in contrast the bi sediment contained a greater portion of coarse sand 92 of 0 25 2 mm and nb and ls contained mostly fine sand size particles 12 20 of 63 125 μm and 60 67 of 0 125 0 25 mm the physico chemical parameters measured during this study are shown in supplementary fig s2 the ph of water in the bi mesocosm was low 5 80 at the beginning of the experiment but increased to 6 17 on day 40 the water ph of the nb site remained stable throughout the experiment ranging from 5 74 to 6 28 similarly the ph of the ls water was also stable ranging from 6 62 to 7 40 up to day 28 but then declined to 6 01 the electrical conductivity values of bi and nb mesocosms reflected their marine characteristics initially 48 6 and 53 9 ms cm respectively compared to the freshwater ls 1 1 ms cm as a result of the evaporation and replacement of lost volume with site water the waters of bi and nb mesocosms became progressively more saline during the experiment being 63 1 and 72 4 ms cm respectively on day 40 water turbidity values of all three mesocosms were greater immediate after inoculation of untreated sewage and then the values decreased considerably and remained stable throughout the experiment total organic carbon toc values were also greater up to day 4 and then the values decreased and remained stable until the end of the experiment the average evaporation relative humidity and sunlight ranged from 1 40 to 13 8 mm 32 5 93 5 and 0 10 9 h respectively precipitation occurred during days 2 4 11 41 8 mm and on days 9 10 mm and 21 3 20 mm the water temperature in the mesocosms ranged from 18 2 to 27 6 c during the study 3 4 decay rates of qpcr fib and sewage associated markers the ec and ent 23s rrna genes were quantifiable in dna extracted from both water and sediment samples from the bi nb and ls mesocosms until day 40 fig 1 sewage associated bacteroides hf183 was quantifiable up to day 4 in the water and sediment samples from all three mesocosms and the hadv was quantifiable up to day 8 in water samples from bi and nb marine and up to day 14 in water from ls freshwater similarly hadvs were quantifiable up to day 8 in sediment samples from bi and ls whereas they were quantifiable in a water sample from nb until day 14 the concentration of hpyv declined aloq rapidly compared to hadv while the concentration of hpyv in water samples reached aloq on day 8 they could not be quantified after day 4 in the sediment in contrast the crassphage marker gene was quantifiable for relatively longer periods of time compared to hf183 hpyv and hadv in both water and sediment samples from all three mesocosms crassphage was quantifiable up to day 14 in water samples from bi and ls whereas they were quantifiable in nb water sample until day 24 the crassphage marker gene was quantifiable in sediment samples from bi and ls up to day 24 and at day 40 in the sediment sample from nb the decay of fib and sewage associated markers occurred in water and sediment samples from all three mesocosms except for a few targets i e ent hadv and hpyv in sediment samples targets that did not decay over the course of this study were not used in the decay rate calculations the declining concentrations of targets were fitted with either first order or biphasic decay models data points fitting biphasic decay models were evaluated by aic the biphasic models had smaller aic values i e a better fit compared to the first order decay model according to the first order decay model ent in sediment samples from bi k 0 03 t 90 87 days and ls k 0 08 t 90 29 7 days mesocosms exhibited slow decay rates table 2 the hf183 marker gene in water and sediment samples from all three mesocosms followed a first order decay the decay of hf183 was faster k 0 97 to 1 01 t 90 2 37 to 2 29 days in water samples compared to sediment k 0 49 0 09 t 90 4 69 26 days the decay of hf183 in water from all mesocosms was significantly different from sediment p 0 05 according to the fisher s lsd test fig 2 the decay rates of hadv in water samples from all three microcosms ranged from 0 24 to 0 58 t 90 9 4 to 3 95 days the decay rate of hadv in sediment was significantly slower p 0 05 than in water from the nb mesocosm the decay rates of hpyv in water were similar to those of hadv ranging from 0 26 to 0 42 t 90 8 93 to 5 53 days the decay of hpyv was significantly p 0 05 slower in nb sediment samples than in water although the hpyv decay was slightly faster in ls sediment compared to water the difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 the decay rates of crassphage in water samples from both bi and ls mesocosms were similar to hadv and hpyv ranging from 0 30 to 0 33 t 90 7 73 to 6 91 days however the crassphage decay rate in sediment was much slower than that seen in water ranging from 0 05 to 0 03 t 90 45 1 90 3 days the decay of hf183 in water from both bi and ls mesocosms was significantly different p 0 05 from sediment according to the biphasic decay model ec exhibited a faster decay rate in water during the first phase k 1 0 33 to 0 67 t 90 6 98 to 3 45 days in all three mesocosms compared to sediment k 1 0 23 to 0 29 t 90 9 84 to 8 04 days table 3 the differences were significant p 0 05 for the bi and ls mesocosms but not for the nb mesocosm p 0 05 the first phase of the biphasic decay of ent k 1 0 72 to 1 19 t 90 3 18 to 1 93 days and crassphage k 1 0 38 t 90 6 05 days in water were similar to first order decay of hf183 k 0 97 to 1 01 t 90 2 37 to 2 29 days hadv k 0 24 to 0 58 t 90 9 4 to 3 95 days and hpyv k 0 26 to 0 42 t 90 8 93 to 5 53 days respectively in contrast the second phase of the biphasic decay was significantly slower p 0 05 than the first phase in all 10 instances decay rates first order and the first phase of the biphasic of the bacterial targets ec ent and hf183 were significantly different p 0 05 than the viral targets hadv hpyv and crassphage in water samples from bi and ls mesocosms similarly decay rates of bacterial targets were significantly different p 0 05 than those of the viral targets in the nb mesocosm except for ec marker gene in the nb mesocosm which decayed at a similar rate at those viral targets decay rates first order and the first phase of the biphasic of the bacterial targets in the studied mesocosms were also similar to viral targets in sediment samples significant differences p 0 05 in decay rates were observed in only a few cases i e ec vs crassphage in nb and ls ent vs hpyv in ls and hf183 vs crassphage in ls mesocosms 3 5 correlation between target decay in water and physicochemical parameters ambient weather conditions the crassphage ent and hadv marker genes showed significant correlations with mesocosm water temperature table 4 while the hpyv marker was significantly p 0 05 positively correlated with water temperature in the bi and ls mesocosms however statistically significant correlation p 0 05 was not observed between hpyv and water temperature in the nb mesocosm ec decay was significantly p 0 05 positively correlated with water temperature in the nb and ls mesocosms but was not significantly correlated p 0 05 with water temperature in the bi mesocosm crassphage from all three mesocosms showed significant and positive correlations p 0 05 with relative humidity only the hadv marker from the ls mesocosm was significantly p 0 05 correlated with humidity electrical conductivity had significant negative correlations with fib and sewage associated markers in the bi and nb mesocosms representing marine environments in contrast positive correlations were seen between each target and electrical conductivity in the ls mesocosm but the results were not statistically significant p 0 05 toc had significant strong positive correlations with all targets in all three mesocosms the decay of crassphage did not significantly correlate with water turbidity from any of the mesocosms however hf183 and ec decay in the bi mesocosm was significantly p 0 05 correlated with water turbidity the decay rates of ec ent hf183 hadv and hpyv were significantly p 0 05 correlated with water turbidity in the nb mesocosms significant positive correlations were also seen among fib and sewage associated markers in water samples from all three mesocosms evaporation sunlight and ph had no statistically significant correlations or most cases had negative correlations with all targets in all three mesocosms 4 discussion the marker genes used for mst field studies are associated with obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria or viruses the differential decay of these mst markers could lead to different risk assessment interpretations and remediation outcomes depending on which marker is used at present very little is known about the persistence of qpcr based sewage associated markers and fib in water and sediment in relation to each other this information is critical for risk estimation and protecting public health microcosms mesocosms in laboratory conditions that focus on a single factor have been found to differ from onsite experiments balleste and blanch 2010 green et al 2011 bae and wuertz 2015 several studies have determined the decay of fib mst markers and pathogens in freshwater and seawater microcosms using culture based or qpcr methods for the decay experiment we used mesocosms since these are ideal tools for studying the impacts of a contaminant on an ecosystem under simulated field conditions stewart et al 2013 a mesocosm is subjected to the natural environment taking into account relevant in situ characteristics without losing the advantage of reliable reference conditions and replication the ec and ent 23s rrna exhibited biphasic decay patterns in water samples from all three mesocosms similar biphasic decay patterns of culturable ec and ent in seawater and beach sand and sediment microcosms have been reported in a recent study zhang et al 2015 schulz and childers 2011 also noted biphasic decay dynamics of alternative fecal indicators in freshwater at various temperatures and salinities rogers et al 2011 noted biphasic decay of entero1 and genbac3 qpcr fib in manure amended soils various factors such as the depletion of predators over time population heterogeneity due to different strains genetically or nongenetically differentiated cells different growth or cell cycle stage clumping hardening or the specific decay rate could be directly or indirectly affected by the cell density rogers et al 2011 hellweger et al 2009 this may also be due to microbial die off at an initial rapid rate leading to second phase of decay which is slower because the microbes present are better adapted to the environment and the nutrients present easton et al 2005 two subpopulations with different decay rates may also be present in water samples from mesocosms velz 1984 modelling biphasic decay is important since it has been reported that failure to consider biphasic pathogen dynamics can lead to substantial under or overestimation of disease risks and pathogen concentrations brouwer et al 2017 the ent 23s rrna present in the bi and ls sediment mesocosms was detected up to day 40 these data suggest that the detection of the ent 23s rrna in the fresh and marine sediment environments may not indicate the age of fecal pollution similar results have been reported in a recent study which investigated the decay of ent1a genetic marker in six different types of ambient sediment in california zimmer faust et al 2017 here the ent1a marker remained stable over the course of the 21 day sampling period in all six ambient sediments tested another study investigated the decay of ent 23s rrna in two depths 0 2 cm and 4 6 cm of sediment microcosm kept in the dark at 20 c kim and wuertz 2015 the authors did not observe ent 23s rrna decay during the 28 day of experimental period similar results were observed for ent 23s rrna gene in the nb sediment mesocosm where no decay was observed however in our study decay was observed in ent dna in bi t 90 87 days and ls t 90 29 7 days sediments decay may have been due to the elevated temperature and sunlight as these parameters were different in this study compared to that of kim and wuertz 2015 during the decay experiment the water temperature ranged from 18 2 to 27 6 c and all the mesocosms received sunlight hf183 decay rates and t 90 in these conditions were similar to decay rates of hf183 in a light exposed microcosm exposed to a similar temperature in previous studies liang et al 2012 green et al 2011 ahmed et al 2014 gilpin et al 2013 such results suggest that the hf183 marker may be more suitable for identifying recent human fecal pollution in this study mesocosms were continuously aerated up to day 40 which may have accelerated the decay of the hf183 marker it has been reported that the hf183 marker i e dna persisted better in freshwater sediment under anaerobic conditions kim and wuertz 2015 hf183 persisted longer in sediment samples from the bi and nb mesocosms compared to the sediment in ls the decay rate of the hf183 in the freshwater ls mesocosm was similar to beach sediment that contained 28 moisture in dark microcosm in a previous study eichmiller et al 2014 a recent study reported that the hf183 marker exhibited statistically similar decay rate constants in six freshwater sediments microcosm at a constant temperature of 20 c zimmer faust et al 2017 the results of this study were in close agreement with the results obtained in a previous study for decay rates obtained for hf183 in a freshwater sediment mesocosm such results suggest that hf183 may also be a reliable marker to detect recent fecal pollution in freshwater beach sand the t 90 values of hadv were faster in water samples ranging from 3 95 to 9 40 days which is similar to a previous study that reported hadv persistence also determined using qpcr in freshwater microcosms under sunlight and dark conditions at 22 c bae and wuertz 2012 however the hadv decay rates in mesocosm water in the current study were faster than those shown in a previous mesocosm study the difference in results may be due to the slightly higher temperatures in this study ahmed et al 2014 hpyv t 90 values obtained in this study were similar to a recent study which reported 6 days t 90 value of hpyv in sunlight unfiltered fresh and marine water microcosms in hawaii kirs et al 2016 the decay rate of crassphage in water was similar to those of hadv and hpyv the crassphage marker persisted longer in sediment than did hadv and hpyv moreover the crassphage in nb sediment persisted longer than in the bi and ls sediment mesocosms this could be attributed to the particle characteristics of the nb sediment which was silty and fluffy in nature compared to the coarse bi and ls sediments this may have led to better persistence of nb as a previous study also reported better persistence of poliovirus and rotavirus in fluffy sediment rao et al 1984 and a range of viruses such as hepatitis a virus poliovirus 1 echovirus 1 and ms2 in loamy sand compared to coarse sand sobsey et al 1995 in addition attachment of viruses to solid particles may result in protection from uv inactivation chrysikopoulos and aravantinou 2012 generally the viral targets in water that we examined persisted longer than did the bacterial targets double stranded dna viruses such as hadv can be extremely stable when subjected to chlorination or uv because their undamaged dna or rna strand may serve as a template for repair by host enzymes during infections furthermore these viruses have a high molecular weight that may also impart increased uv resistance gerba et al 2002 hpyv are also reported to be highly stable through sewage treatment processes and are stable in external environments bo fill mas et al 2006 it is also possible that viral targets in water preferentially adsorb onto particles and in remain stable longer than bacteria rao et al 1984 moreover due to their small size virus particles may be less susceptible to predation than bacteria which serve as the food source of some protozoa among the eight physico chemical and ambient weather parameters examined in the decay experiment water mesocosm temperature positively correlated to the decay rates of fib and sewage associated markers in the studied mesocosms similar trends have been reported in previous studies for example islam et al 2017 noted positive correlations between fib and water temperature in subtropical and continental regions have been observed ishii et al 2006 islam et al 2017 we also observed a positive correlation between turbidity and the mst marker gene concentrations in mesocosm water samples in the past it has been noted that microbial contamination is commonly accompanied by increases in turbidity mann et al 2007 the toc i e nutrient availability also had a positive correlation with the concentration of targets which is in agreement with previous studies showing that nutrient availability significantly effects the survival of microbes kirschner et al 2004 pote et al 2009 in this study we did not measure the decay rates of culturable fib and in relation to qpcr fib and sewage associated marker genes this is important as culturable fib is used by regulatory agencies throughout the world the decay of hf183 and ent23s rrna in marine and freshwater mesocosms were similar to culturable fib reported in previous studies ahmed et al 2014 solecki et al 2011 the decay rates of hadv were also similar to a pervious study which determined the decay of hadv in freshwater microcosms under sunlight and dark conditions bae and wuertz 2012 ent 23s rrna gene persisted longer in sediment similar results have been documented in a previous study that determined the decay of culturable enterococcus spp in salt water sediment anderson et al 2005 the decay rates of ent 23s rrna in sediment sample from ls mesocosm reported in this study was similar to the decay rates of ent1a gene in sediment microcosms inoculated with sewage in a previous study zimmer faust et al 2017 caution should be exercised when comparing the results of decay rates of the fib and sewage markers in sediment among studies undertaken in various geographical regions because decay rates can be influenced by many factors and experimental conditions which may have attribute the differences in decay rates and thus making direct comparison difficult the decay of mst markers measured here may also be the result of protozoan grazing or other bacterivores as others have observed in fresh waters korajkic et al 2013 in general fib and sewage associated markers persisted longer in sediment compared to water the survival and regrowth of culturable fib in beach sediment has been documented desmarais et al 2002 hartz et al 2008 lee et al 2006 beach sediment may provide feasible conditions for the persistence of fib and mst marker dna by providing protection from sunlight irradiation predation favorable nutrient conditions and colonizable surfaces for biofilm formation davies et al 1995 haller et al 2009 the prolonged persistence of host associated bacteroidales suggests that sediments should be considered in practical applications of mst because they can act as non point sources of fecal markers the greater persistence of fib and mst markers in sediment may need to be considered because sediment may contribute fib and mst markers in water column and elevate the pollution level after resuspension further research is necessary to determine the relationship of the survival and persistence of the bacteroidales markers in sediments with those of pathogenic bacteria also the quantitative estimation of microbial release from sediments into the overlying water column will provide a better foundation to assess health risks associated with sediment resuspension 5 conclusions decay rates of bacterial targets two fib and hf183 were fast and similar in water samples across three mesocosms similarly decay rates of viral targets hadv hpyv and crassphage were similar in water samples however viral targets persisted significantly p 0 05 longer than did bacterial targets decay rates of fib and sewage associated markers in sediment mesocosm samples varied greatly across the marine and freshwater mesocosms decay rates of fib and sewage associated markers were significantly faster in water samples compared to sediment in all mesocosms fib ec and or ent exhibited biphasic decay rates compared to mst markers in water and sediment samples from all mesocosms due to the nature of decay they may not be reliable markers to detect recent fecal pollution decay rates of fib and mst markers significantly and positively correlated with mesocosm water temperature toc and turbidity and were mostly negatively correlated with rainfall electrical conductivity evaporation sunlight and ph further research into the introduction distribution and

19169,sludge treatment and disposal have become critical environmental issues in china electro dewatering ed is an attractive technology for enhancing dewaterability and improving the sustainability of waste activated sludge was handling however electrically assisted mechanical dewatering processes consume more energy and the extracellular polymeric substance eps dissolution caused by electrochemical reactions can lead to clogging of the filter cloth carbon based materials cbms such as activated carbon and graphite have electrical conductivity and well developed pore structures which can adsorb the biopolymers therefore addition of cbms is expected to improve was electro dewatering performance for fuel treatment by enhancing sludge conductivity and filterability in this study we evaluated the effects of the three carbon materials ac 0 ac 5 and graphite on sludge electro dewatering behavior and the flammability of sludge cakes the results showed that cbms promote the performance of was electro dewatering and the promoting effect of the carbon materials on the sludge electro dewatering is proportional to the electrical conductivity of the carbon material and carbon materials can increase the electrophoretic mobility of sludge flocs and the electro osmotic effect moreover cbms can adsorb the dissolved eps thus alleviate the plugging and filtration resistance of the filter medium the addition of cbms also decreases the energy consumption for water removal during the electro dewatering process and improves the calorific value and sustainable combustion time of the sludge cake our approach can facilitate the resource utilization of the dewatered sludge cake in electro dewatering processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon based materials cbms electro osmosis dewatering extracellular polymeric substances eps electrochemical reactions sludge dewatering 1 introduction sewage sludge contains a significant amount of organic matter and biomass yuan et al 2006 it is a promising renewable energy resource despite its low energy density high moisture content and complex ash components zhao et al 2017 al mansour and zuwala 2010 indicated that co firing biomass with coal represents a near term low risk low cost and sustainable energy development al mansour and zuwala 2010 over the last decades the increase in municipal and industrial wastewater purification activities has been confronted with a dramatically increasing flow of sewage sludge sludge has a high moisture content and complex composition thereby causing treatment and disposal problems mahmoud et al 2011a the most important part of sludge treatment prior to disposal is the reduction of the sludge volume by solid water separation to reduce the costs of transportation and handling cao et al 2018 mahmoud et al 2013 was is a colloidal system that consists mainly of bacterial microorganisms embedded in a biopolymeric network wu et al 2017 it is generally difficult to dewater was since highly hydrated and negatively charged extracellular polymeric substances eps strengthen on the colloidal stability of microbial aggregation and bind a large volume of water i e bound water within the sludge flocs in comparison to traditional sludge dewatering processes pressure electro dewatering provides many advantages including high sludge dewatering

achieve 35 w w water content navab daneshmand et al 2015 however electrically assisted mechanical dewatering process often consumes more energy in addition complex electrochemical effects eg ohmic heating electrochemical oxidation and reduction and ph gradient effect are accompanied with the electro dewatering process these electrochemical effects will inevitably cause the solubilization and or degradation of extracellular polymeric substances eps subsequently affecting the sludge electro dewatering behavior mahmoud et al 2010a 2011b 2016a therefore despite the considerable work that has investigated the use of conventional electro dewatering for sewage sludge volume reduction commercial applications for such a low value product are not likely to be economical mahmoud et al 2010b sun et al 2017 according to the report of mahmoud et al the conductivity of sewage sludge has an important influence on the effect of electro dewatering and higher conductivity contributes to the enhancement of electro dewatering citeau et al 2011 mahmoud et al 2018 sun et al 2017 in our previous work the electro osmosis effect was terminated in the latter stages of electro dewatering due to the loss of cake conductivity and the final cake moisture content was still high at around 50 55 solid carbon based materials cbms such as activated carbon and graphite have electrical conductivity their pore structures are well developed and able to adsorp biopolymers such as humic acids proteins and microbial metabolites fp et al 2003 hadi et al 2015 sheng et al 2010 moreover the cbms have a high calorific value the combination of derived fuel from both organic sludge and activated carbon can help achieve waste material disposal and provides an alternative fuel by increasing the proportion of home grown energy sources thereby achieving energy conservation chen et al 2012 therefore different cbms modified activated carbons and graphite were used to enhance the electro dewatering performance of was for fuel treatment the effects of different cbms on was electro dewatering behavior were evaluated by characterizing electrochemical properties surface charge and eps in addition energy consumption of cbm enhanced electro dewatering was assessed and the calorific value of sludge cake was analyzed this work is expected to provide a new route for was treatment for synchronous dewatering and resource utilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 waste activated sludge the was was taken from beijing north creek sewage treatment plant in china the sewage treatment plant uses a membrane bioreactor mbr with a handling capacity of 0 2 million cubic meters per day the sample was stored at 4 c and analyzed within 7 days mahmoud et al 2011a 2016b the characteristic properties of the sludge are listed in table 1 particle size distribution was determined using a laser diffraction size analyzer mastersizer malvern instruments the zeta potential of

at 25 1 c 2 1 2 carbon based materials cbms ac 0 is a commercial activated carbon with an average particle size of 45 μm it was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 c for 24 h before use ac 5 was modified from ac 0 graphitization using the method provided by dang et al 2017 firstly ac 0 and koh solid were evenly mixed in the tube furnace according to the mass ratio of 1 4 then the samples were heated from room temperature to 600 c with a heating rate of 5 c min and then incubated for 1 5 h under n2 in addition the samples were naturally cooled to room temperature and washed with deionized water until the ph of the filtrate was neutral finally the sample was dried for 24 h in a vacuum dryer at 80 c and the dried sample was immersed in dilute hno3 w v 30 at room temperature and continuously stirred washed and dried according to the above method the samples were placed in a vacuum desiccator for use table 2 shows the pore texture parameters of the cbms the adsorption performance of carbon materials is correlated with their specific surface area and pore volume li et al 2002 zietzschmann et al 2014 figure s1 shows the adsorption kinetics of soluble eps on three carbon materials it can be seen that the eps adsorption performance is the largest for ac 5 that is followed by ac 0 and graphite respectively figure s2 presents the xrd pattern and tem images of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite the xrd pattern of ac 0 shows two peaks at 17 4 and 43 4 indicating that ac 0 has a disordered carbon structure the modified activated carbon ac 5 contains two peaks at 26 4 and 43 8 which correspond to the 002 peak and 100 peak of the carbon song et al 2012 indicating the crystal of graphite in ac 5 it can be seen from the tem images that the layered structure appears for ac 5 which is similar to graphite the resistivies of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite were 7 8 ω m 157 3 ω m and 470 ω m respectively 2 1 3 apparatus experimental setup for mechanical dewatering md or pressurized electro osmotic dewatering based on the double ended edw device developed by citeau et al 2012a b is presented in fig 1 citeau et al 2012a 2012b mahmoud et al 2018 it comprises a cylindrical laboratory filter press cell cake cross section 25 cm2 volume 62 5 cm3 made from polypropylene dc power supply maisheng 603 0 3a 0 60 v a thermometer and two precision balances the electrodes are disc shaped one is placed behind the filter cloth at the cathode side the other is mounted flush with the piston behind the filter cloth each cell side is covered by a filter cloth of 50 mm aperture to prevent the electrode corrosion we used titanium support coated with a mixed metal oxide layer named ao 2023 dsa electrodes as an electrode from the industry zhi heng china mahmoud et al 2011a 2016b the pressure used in the test was 0 6 mpa and the filtration time of electro dewatering was set to 1 h 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 electro dewatering process firstly 200 ml activated sludge was poured into the laboratory cylindrical filter press cell and then the filtrate was collected putting a beaker on both the two precision balances the data were collected by computer simultaneously in addition the current variation was monitored under electro dewatering process average electro osmosis dewatering rate was calculated according to the equation 1 v a v 1 v 2 v n n i 1 n v i n where va is the average electro osmosis dewatering rate vi is the momentary rate n is the quality acquisition times 2 2 2 sludge pre conditioning with cbms sludge samples and cbms were mixed and stirred at 900 r min 1 for 20 min by using magnetic stirrer 2 2 3 characterization of morphological properties of sludge cake the sludge cakes formed at the two electrodes were cut from both sides of the cake with a thin blade and sludge samples were prepared through low temperature drying at 50 c for 24 h followed by freezing after that the microstructure was observed by su8020 fe sem hitachi japan and surface area was analyzed using asap 2020 plus hd88 fast surface and porosity analyzer micromeritics instrument usa the calorific value and thermogravimetric analysis were measured by calorimeter sande sunday sdacm3100 china and high temperature tga dsc simultaneous thermal analyzer mettler toledo switzerland respectively 2 2 4 eps extraction and characterization soluble eps was extracted according to the procedure described by cao et al 2016 50 ml of sludge was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min subsequently the supernatant was collected as soluble eps 2 2 4 1 dissolved organic material dom collection in this test dom was collected by glass beaker the filtrates from two electrodes were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter 2 2 4 2 dom analysis the content of dom was indicated by total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu japan fluorescence eems were measured on a varian eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f7000 japan in scan mode eem spectra were gathered with scanning emission em spectra by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 220 to 550 nm at 5 nm increments the spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 12000 nm min using excitation and emission slit bandwidths of 5 nm the voltage of the photomultiplier tube pmt was set to 500 v for low level light detection chen et al 2016 2 2 5 other indicators sludge electrical properties were evaluated in a three electrode setup via a computer controlled chi electrochemical workstation electrochemical impedance spectroscopic eis measurements were performed at η 100 mv in the frequency range of 0 1 hz 100 khz ph was measured by ph meter phs 3c shanghai china zeta potential measurements were performed on a zetasizer zetasizer 2000 malvern uk the sludge viscosity was measured by rotary viscometer the resistivity of cbms was measured by the four probe method other sludge parameters including total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were analyzed following apha awwa wef 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the cbms on sludge electro dewatering behavior fig 2 a shows the average electro dewatering rate of sludge after conditioning with different cbms it can be seen that the dewatering rate was much lower at the anode compared to the cathode the addition of cbms greatly improved the dewatering rate at the cathode and graphite performed better than ac 0 and ac 5 in enhancing was electro dewaterability the average dewatering rate at the cathode increased from 0 05 g l to 0 095 g l with 5 g gtss graphite however there was no obvious difference in the dewatering rate at the anode for the cbms fig 2 b presented the cake moisture after electro dewatering the moisture content of sludge cake was decreased with the increased dosage of cbms the moisture of sludge cake was decreased from 58 3 to 50 1 46 3 and 45 2 with 20 g gtss of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite respectively fig 2 c f presents the final sludge cake with and without the cbms after electro dewatering it was evident that many cracks were formed in the cake after graphite enhanced electro dewatering according to citeau cao and their co workers the cathode is the main water permeable side in the electro dewatering process cao et al 2018 citeau et al 2011 mahmoud et al 2018 the filtration rate at the cathode is also an important parameter to evaluate the process performance of electro dewatering the filtration rates at the cathode increased after the addition of cbms indicating that carbon materials can promotes the effect of sludge electro dewatering process moreover mahmoud et al found that the electro dewatering flow velocity for a system can be calculated for the overall porous medium by 2 v dζ 4 πμ φ where d is the dielectric constant of the medium μ is the fluid medium dynamic viscosity ζ is the zeta potential and φ is the applied electrical field equation 2 shows that the electro dewatering flow velocity is proportional to the dielectric constant of the medium moreover sludge floc is negatively charged thus electrokinetic phenomena such as electrophoresis and electro osmosis are involved in the electro dewatering process mahmoud et al 2010b therefore the influence of the cbm on the conductivity and electrokinetic properties of the sludge were investigated to understand the mechanisms of cbms enhanced was electro dewatering 3 2 the effects of the cbm on the electrical properties of sludge 3 2 1 electric current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis fig 3 a c show the changes in electric current during electro dewatering processes after conditioning with ac 0 ac 5 and graphite respectively the electric current increased rapidly at the beginning of the electro dewatering it reached the maximum in 15 min and then fell as the time proceeded the current was increased by raising the dosage of the cbms graphitized activated carbon ac 5 and graphite were more effective at improving sludge conductivity the maximum currents reached were 0 36 a and 0 45 a for ac 5 and graphite at the dosage of 20 g gtss respectively fig 3 d shows the eis measurement at the carbon material dosage of 20 g gtss graphite treated sludge shows the smallest semicircle in the nyquist plot compared to the other samples the sludge resistance was inversely correlated with the conductivity of the cbm as commonly described in the literature the electrical behavior of the samples can be modeled by equivalent circuits mason et al 2002 segalen et al 2015 focusing on how the cbms impact the sludge electrical signature the ideal electrical circuit was modeled with two resistances and one capacitor fig 3 d rct was used for evaluating the electron transfer rate on the electrode surface zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2014 the rct of raw sludge was 357 6 ω and rct value of sludge after conditioning with ac 0 ac 5 and graphite were 347 8 ω 302 7 ω and 235 6 ω respectively the results indicate that the cbms accelerate the rate of electron transfer on the electrode surface 3 2 2 electrokinetic phenomena 3 2 2 1 electrophoresis of sludge floc the sludge cakes at the electrodes were cut from both sides of the sludge cake with a thin blade and the sludge samples were processed with freeze drying treatment fig 4 a shows that the pore volume of the cathodic cake was higher than that at the anode this observation is attributed to the electrophoresis effect which promotes the sludge flocs transferring from cathode to anode and hence the cake formed at the cathode is looser than that at the anode lee 2005 the porosity of sludge cake at the cathode increased with the dosage of cbms and there was a prominent increase in graphite conditioned sludge cake porosity at the cathode the pore volume of the cathode sludge cake was increased from 0 11 cm 3 g to 0 15 cm 3 g with the addition of 20 g gtss graphite indicating that the electrophoresis effect of graphite reinforced sludge floc was stronger than that of ac 0 and ac 5 however mahmoud et al found that the average cake porosity decreases with increasing electric current density mahmoud et al 2018 this difference was mainly due to the effect of carbon materials on sludge system carbon not only improved the conductivity of sludge but increased the structural strength and porosity of sludge cake which was beneficial to water release under pressure filtration therefore the porosity increased with the increase of carbon materials dosage fig 4 b shows the influence of the cbms on the zeta potential of sludge it can be seen that the zeta potentials of sludge floc increased in magnitude with the dosage of cbms the magnitude of the zeta potential of sludge flocs increased from 9 8 mv to 11 3 mv and 12 9 mv with 20 g gtss of ac 5 and graphite indicating that the electrophoretic mobility of sludge floc after conditioning with the two cbms was higher than that of ac 0 which was consistent with the porosity of sludge cake according to the report of qi et al filtration is governed by cake layer once formed the structure of sludge cake influence sludge filtration performance and that the porous cake structure is beneficial to water solid separation qi et al 2011 cbms can not only function as skeleton builders and decrease sludge cake compressibility but provide plentiful channels for water release in addition the cathode is the main water permeating side in the electro dewatering process so the increase in porosity of sludge cake at the cathode contributes to the electro dewatering process 3 3 electro osmotic effect electro osmotic transport can be induced by an external electric field in capillary or porous plug systems where the electric polarization charging of a solid surface occurs in the absence of an external electric field the dewatering rate of the two electrodes was similar while it differed greatly under electrical assistance mitchell and soga 2005 suggested that the dewatering rate difference between two electrodes rd can be used to reflect the electro osmotic effect rd mitchell and soga 2005 fig 5 shows the effects of cbms on sludge electro osmosis it can be seen that the electro osmotic effects were enhanced with cbms and the enhancement effect were consistent with the conductivity of cbms in other words the enhancement of sludge conductivity with the addition of cbms can promote the electro osmotic effect cao et al 2018 moreover the solid carbon can also act as skeleton builders and provide more channels for water passage which facilitate the osmotic effect further 3 4 the effect of cbms on the compartmentalization of eps solubilization 3 4 1 dom concentration many studies have suggested that eps is the predominant factor that affects sludge dewatering behavior higgins and novak 1997 houghton et al 2001 yu et al 2008 in this study we investigated the impact of cbms on compartmentalization of eps solubilization under sludge electro dewatering by analyzing the content and composition of dom in the filtrate fig 6 presented the effect of different cbms on the filtration dom concentration in the electro dewatering process it can be seen that a significant difference of dom content existed between the cathode and anode filtrates the cathode dom content was higher than that of the anode owing to the generation of a large number of hydroxyl oh groups which caused the deprotonation of anionic functional groups in eps cao et al 2018 also negatively charged sludge flocs migrated toward the anode so the cathode dom content was higher than the anode protein like substances are the major constituents of eps the dissolution of proteins increases the sludge viscosity and clogs the filter membrane zhang et al 2016 high concentration of soluble biopolymers especially protein like substances was adverse to sludge filtration and removal of them were conductive to sludge dewatering process it should be noted that ac 5 performed better in adsorbing biopolymers than the other two cbms and the dom content at the cathode and anode were decreased from 49 96 mg l to 28 61 mg l and from 24 21 mg l to14 14 mg l respectively 3 4 2 dom composition fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy is a highly sensitive and selective tool that has been extensively utilized to characterize natural organic matter nom especially from microbial activity chen et al 2003 fig 7 shows eem profiles of dom at both electrodes 20 g gtss there were three main fluorescent components in the dom from both electrodes peak a λex λem 280nm 335 nm tryptophan like protein tpn peak b λex λem 225 nm 340 nm aromatic protein apn and peak c λex λem 330 nm 410 nm humic acid ha the fluorescent intensity of protein substances peak a and peak b of dom at cathode was significantly higher than that at the anode table 3 presents the variation of fluorescent intensities at the cathode of cbms enhanced electro dewatering it was found that the protein like substances peak a and peak b in dom at the cathode were obviously higher than that at the anode for raw sludge the fluorescent intensities of tpn apn and ha in dom at the cathode and anode were 1897 2345 274 and 287 2 407 4 291 respectively the fluorescent intensities decreased with increasing carbon material dosage moreover ac 5 was more effective in reducing the concentration of biopolymers the fluorescent intensity of dom at the cathode and anode decreased to 353 8 499 6 79 7 and 50 4 110 5 86 8 when the dosage of 20 g gtss was used according to our previous research the biopolymers such as proteins and humic substances at the cathode dom exhibited more important influence on the was electro dewatering than that in the anode at the anode the sticky proteins can be oxidized into small molecules under electrochemical oxidation and alleviate their adverse impact on the sludge dewatering process on the other hand the cathode alkalization causes solubilization and release of large amount of eps that can t be degraded and these sticky biopolymers with high molecular weight result in the deterioration of sludge filterability cao et al 2018 it can be seen that sludge viscosity decreased with the increased concentrations of cbms fig 3 the addition of cbms effectively removed the proteins and humic substances in the filtrate thereby relieving the plugging of the filter membrane 3 5 model of cbms to improve sludge electro dewatering and reduce energy consumption it is known that the cathode is the main water permeable side in the electro dewatering process and the effect of sludge electro dewatering is related to electrokinetic phenomena electrophorus and electro osmosis effect and eps release caused by electrochemical reaction cao et al 2018 mahmoud et al 2010b cbms can enhance the sludge conductivity and improve the electrophorus and electro osmosis effect of sludge floc in addition it can also adsorb the released eps and relieve the blockage of the filter cloth concurrently solid carbon can also act as a skeleton and reduce the sludge compressibility thereby providing more channels to release water compared with graphite ac 5 has high surface area and plentiful pores so it performed better in eps adsorption than graphite while graphite shows higher electrical conductivity than ac 5 it is obvious that graphite is more effective in enhancing sludge electro dewatering performance indicating that the electrical conductivity of cbms plays a more determining role than their propensity to adsorb eps for improving the sludge electro dewatering effect fig 8 presents the mechanism of the cbms to improve the electro dewatering process according to the report by mahmoud et al one of the best ways to compare the power consumption is to calculate the energy per the additional mass of water removed in the electro dewatering process rather than dewatering without electrical field mahmoud et al 2010b energy consumption e was calculated by 3 e p m u i t dt m where e is the energy consumption per mass of water removed kj kg p is energy consumption kw h m is the weight of water removed kg u is the applied voltage during dewatering process v i t is the current change over time during dewatering process a t is the applied voltage time s cbms can shorten the power on time and the energy consumption can be decreased by raising cbms concentration among the cbms studied graphite was found to be the most effective in reducing the energy consumption for water removal 3 6 thermal analysis of sludge cake fig 9 a shows the result of the calorific value of electro dewatering sludge cake after conditioning by different cbms the calorific values of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite were 15 76 mj kg 21 66 mj kg and 28 45 mj kg respectively the calorific value of sludge cakes was increased as the dosage of cbms raised the calorific value of raw sludge cake was 13 92 mj kg and the calorific values were increased to 15 73 mj kg 15 74 mj kg and 17 27 mj kg when 20 g gtss of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite were used fig 9 b presents the tg and dtg curves of the cbms it has been found that the weight of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite did not change significantly at the initial temperature increase and the weight of ac 0 and ac 5 sharply dropped as the temperature increased above 600 c graphite showed better thermal stability but began to decompose when the temperature reached 900 c fig 9 c shows the tg and dtg curves of the sludge cake after carbon materials enhanced was electro dewatering it was observed that the weight of the sludge cake started to decrease with temperature two distinct peaks that appear in the dtg curve indicate that sludge cakes had three distinct weight loss intervals the first weight loss peak occurs at about 100 c this is mainly due to the precipitation of bound water in the sludge the second weight loss interval was around 250 350 c and has two weight loss peaks this stage is mainly the precipitation of volatile matter in the sludge it can be seen that the weight loss peak becomes smaller after conditioning with cbms indicating that the addition of cbms can slow down the decomposition rate of the sludge cake and increase sustainable combustion time of sludge among three cbms graphite reinforced sludge cake had the best flammability 3 7 environmental implication addition of cbm to the sludge system can enhance the sludge conductivity and enable adsorption of dissolved eps in the electro dewatering process can relieve clogging of the filter cloth the moisture content of sludge can be reduced to below 50 after the electro dewatering process and carbon based material assisted electro dewatering not only reduces the moisture content to a lower level but increase the calorific value of sludge cake and sustainable combustion time of sludge treated with carbon based materials was also increased table s1 and s2 show the reduction percentage of energy consumption and calorific value increase of sludge cake after adding cbms it can be seen that the energy consumption per kilogram of water removed was decreased with increasing cbms dosage electro dewatering sludge cake after cbms conditioning can be incinerated to generate more energy which facilitates resource utilization and thus the entire sludge treatment process can achieve the simultaneous reduction of waste products as beneficial resources 4 conclusion in this study we evaluated the effects of three carbon materials ac 0 ac 5 and graphite on sludge electro dewatering behavior and the flammability of sludge cakes we found that cbms can promote the effect of sludge electro dewatering the electrical conductivity of the cbm determines its contribution to the sludge electro dewatering moreover carbon materials can increase the electrophoretic mobility of sludge flocs and electro osmotic effects furthermore carbon materials can adsorb the dissolved eps which mainly involves proteins and humic substances that are formed by electrochemical reactions as a result alleviate the plugging and filtration resistance of the filter medium the energy consumption per the additional mass of water removed during the electro dewatering process decreased after the addition of carbon material the enhanced calorific value and sustainable combustion time of sludge cake treated with carbon materials can facilitate the resource utilization of the dewatered sludge cake

generally difficult to dewater was since highly hydrated and negatively charged extracellular polymeric substances eps strengthen on the colloidal stability of microbial aggregation and bind a large volume of water i e bound water within the sludge flocs in comparison to traditional sludge dewatering processes pressure electro dewatering provides many advantages including high sludge dewatering efficiency low conditioner dosage requirements and the resultant cake is beneficial to further recycling of waste sludge by applying an electric field to mechanically dewatered biosolids edw can achieve 35 w w water content navab daneshmand et al 2015 however electrically assisted mechanical dewatering process often consumes more energy in addition complex electrochemical effects eg ohmic heating electrochemical oxidation and reduction and ph gradient effect are accompanied with the electro dewatering process these electrochemical effects will inevitably cause the solubilization and or degradation of extracellular polymeric substances eps subsequently affecting the sludge electro dewatering behavior mahmoud et al 2010a 2011b 2016a therefore despite the considerable work that has investigated the use of conventional electro dewatering for sewage sludge volume reduction commercial applications for such a low value product are not likely to be economical mahmoud et al 2010b sun et al 2017 according to the report of mahmoud et al the conductivity of sewage sludge has an important influence on the effect of electro dewatering and higher conductivity contributes to the enhancement of electro dewatering citeau et al 2011 mahmoud et al 2018 sun et al 2017 in our previous work the electro osmosis effect was terminated in the latter stages of electro dewatering due to the loss of cake conductivity and the final cake moisture content was still high at around 50 55 solid carbon based materials cbms such as activated carbon and graphite have electrical conductivity their pore structures are well developed and able to adsorp biopolymers such as humic acids proteins and microbial metabolites fp et al 2003 hadi et al 2015 sheng et al 2010 moreover the cbms have a high calorific value the combination of derived fuel from both organic sludge and activated carbon can help achieve waste material disposal and provides an alternative fuel by increasing the proportion of home grown energy sources thereby achieving energy conservation chen et al 2012 therefore different cbms modified activated carbons and graphite were used to enhance the electro dewatering performance of was for fuel treatment the effects of different cbms on was electro dewatering behavior were evaluated by characterizing electrochemical properties surface charge and eps in addition energy consumption of cbm enhanced electro dewatering was assessed and the calorific value of sludge cake was analyzed this work is expected to provide a new route for was treatment for synchronous dewatering and resource utilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 waste activated sludge the was was taken from beijing north creek sewage treatment plant in china the sewage treatment plant uses a membrane bioreactor mbr with a handling capacity of 0 2 million cubic meters per day the sample was stored at 4 c and analyzed within 7 days mahmoud et al 2011a 2016b the characteristic properties of the sludge are listed in table 1 particle size distribution was determined using a laser diffraction size analyzer mastersizer malvern instruments the zeta potential of particles was measured with a zetasizer 3000 has malvern instruments the electrical conductivity and ph of sludge were measured with a multi parameter analyzer consort c532 fischer bioblock scientific at 25 1 c 2 1 2 carbon based materials cbms ac 0 is a commercial activated carbon with an average particle size of 45 μm it was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 c for 24 h before use ac 5 was modified from ac 0 graphitization using the method provided by dang et al 2017 firstly ac 0 and koh solid were evenly mixed in the tube furnace according to the mass ratio of 1 4 then the samples were heated from room temperature to 600 c with a heating rate of 5 c min and then incubated for 1 5 h under n2 in addition the samples were naturally cooled to room temperature and washed with deionized water until the ph of the filtrate was neutral finally the sample was dried for 24 h in a vacuum dryer at 80 c and the dried sample was immersed in dilute hno3 w v 30 at room temperature and continuously stirred washed and dried according to the above method the samples were placed in a vacuum desiccator for use table 2 shows the pore texture parameters of the cbms the adsorption performance of carbon materials is correlated with their specific surface area and pore volume li et al 2002 zietzschmann et al 2014 figure s1 shows the adsorption kinetics of soluble eps on three carbon materials it can be seen that the eps adsorption performance is the largest for ac 5 that is followed by ac 0 and graphite respectively figure s2 presents the xrd pattern and tem images of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite the xrd pattern of ac 0 shows two peaks at 17 4 and 43 4 indicating that ac 0 has a disordered carbon structure the modified activated carbon ac 5 contains two peaks at 26 4 and 43 8 which correspond to the 002 peak and 100 peak of the carbon song et al 2012 indicating the crystal of graphite in ac 5 it can be seen from the tem images that the layered structure appears for ac 5 which is similar to graphite the resistivies of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite were 7 8 ω m 157 3 ω m and 470 ω m respectively 2 1 3 apparatus experimental setup for mechanical dewatering md or pressurized electro osmotic dewatering based on the double ended edw device developed by citeau et al 2012a b is presented in fig 1 citeau et al 2012a 2012b mahmoud et al 2018 it comprises a cylindrical laboratory filter press

corrosion we used titanium support coated with a mixed metal oxide layer named ao 2023 dsa electrodes as an electrode from the industry zhi heng china mahmoud et al 2011a 2016b the pressure used in the test was 0 6 mpa and the filtration time of electro dewatering was set to 1 h 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 electro dewatering process firstly 200 ml activated sludge was poured into the laboratory cylindrical filter press cell and then the filtrate was collected putting a beaker on both the two precision balances the data were collected by computer simultaneously in addition the current variation was monitored under electro dewatering process average electro osmosis dewatering rate was calculated according to the equation 1 v a v 1 v 2 v n n i 1 n v i n where va is the average electro osmosis dewatering rate vi is the momentary rate n is the quality acquisition times 2 2 2 sludge pre conditioning with cbms sludge samples and cbms were mixed and stirred at 900 r min 1 for 20 min by using magnetic stirrer 2 2 3 characterization of morphological properties of sludge cake the sludge cakes formed at the two electrodes were cut from both sides of the cake with a thin blade and sludge samples were prepared through low temperature drying at 50 c for 24 h followed by freezing after that the microstructure was observed by su8020 fe sem hitachi japan and surface area was analyzed using asap 2020 plus hd88 fast surface and porosity analyzer micromeritics instrument usa the calorific value and thermogravimetric analysis were measured by calorimeter sande sunday sdacm3100 china and high temperature tga dsc simultaneous thermal analyzer mettler toledo switzerland respectively 2 2 4 eps extraction and characterization soluble eps was extracted according to the procedure described by cao et al 2016 50 ml of sludge was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min subsequently the supernatant was collected as soluble eps 2 2 4 1 dissolved organic material dom collection in this test dom was collected by glass beaker the filtrates from two electrodes were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter 2 2 4 2 dom analysis the content of dom was indicated by total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu japan fluorescence eems were measured on a varian eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f7000 japan in scan mode eem spectra were gathered with scanning emission em spectra by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 220 to 550 nm at 5 nm increments the spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 12000 nm min using excitation and emission slit bandwidths of 5 nm the voltage of the photomultiplier tube pmt was set to 500 v for low level light detection chen et al 2016 2 2 5 other indicators sludge electrical properties were evaluated in a three electrode setup via a computer controlled chi electrochemical workstation electrochemical impedance spectroscopic eis measurements were performed at η 100 mv in the frequency range of 0 1 hz 100 khz ph was measured by ph

measured by the four probe method other sludge parameters including total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were analyzed following apha awwa wef 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the cbms on sludge electro dewatering behavior fig 2 a shows the average electro dewatering rate of sludge after conditioning with different cbms it can be seen that the dewatering rate was much lower at the anode compared to the cathode the addition of cbms greatly improved the dewatering rate at the cathode and graphite performed better than ac 0 and ac 5 in enhancing was electro dewaterability the average dewatering rate at the cathode increased from 0 05 g l to 0 095 g l with 5 g gtss graphite however there was no obvious difference in the dewatering rate at the anode for the cbms fig 2 b presented the cake moisture after electro dewatering the moisture content of sludge cake was decreased with the increased dosage of cbms the moisture of sludge cake was decreased from 58 3 to 50 1 46 3 and 45 2 with 20 g gtss of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite respectively fig 2 c f presents the final sludge cake with and without the cbms after electro dewatering it was evident that many cracks were formed in the cake after graphite enhanced electro dewatering according to citeau cao and their co workers the cathode is the main water permeable side in the electro dewatering process cao et al 2018 citeau et al 2011 mahmoud et al 2018 the filtration rate at the cathode is also an important parameter to evaluate the process performance of electro dewatering the filtration rates at the cathode increased after the addition of cbms indicating that carbon materials can promotes the effect of sludge electro dewatering process moreover mahmoud et al found that the electro dewatering flow velocity for a system can be calculated for the overall porous medium by 2 v dζ 4 πμ φ where d is the dielectric constant of the medium μ is the fluid medium dynamic viscosity ζ is the zeta potential and φ is the applied electrical field equation 2 shows that the electro dewatering flow velocity is proportional to the dielectric constant of the medium moreover sludge floc is negatively charged thus electrokinetic phenomena such as electrophoresis and electro osmosis are involved in the electro dewatering process mahmoud et al 2010b therefore the influence of the cbm on the conductivity and electrokinetic properties of the sludge were investigated to understand the mechanisms of cbms enhanced was electro dewatering 3 2 the effects of the cbm on the electrical properties of sludge 3 2 1 electric current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis fig 3 a c show the changes in electric current during electro dewatering processes after conditioning with ac 0 ac 5 and graphite respectively the electric current increased rapidly at the beginning of the electro dewatering it reached the maximum in 15 min and then fell as the time proceeded the current was increased by raising the dosage of the cbms graphitized activated carbon ac 5 and graphite were more effective at improving sludge conductivity the maximum currents reached were 0 36 a and 0 45 a for ac 5 and graphite at the dosage of 20 g gtss respectively fig 3 d shows the eis measurement at the carbon material dosage of 20 g gtss graphite treated sludge shows the smallest semicircle in the nyquist plot compared to the other samples the sludge resistance was inversely correlated with the conductivity of the cbm as commonly described in the literature the electrical behavior of the samples can be modeled by equivalent circuits mason et al 2002 segalen et al 2015 focusing on how the cbms impact the sludge electrical signature the ideal electrical circuit was modeled with two resistances and one capacitor fig 3 d rct was used for evaluating the electron transfer rate on the electrode surface zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2014 the rct of raw sludge was 357 6 ω and rct value of sludge after conditioning with ac 0 ac 5 and graphite were 347 8 ω 302 7 ω and 235 6 ω respectively the results indicate that the cbms accelerate the rate of electron transfer on the electrode surface 3 2 2 electrokinetic phenomena 3 2 2 1 electrophoresis of sludge floc the sludge cakes at the electrodes were cut from both sides of the sludge cake with a thin blade and the sludge samples were processed with freeze drying treatment fig 4 a shows that the pore volume of the cathodic cake was higher than that at the anode this observation is attributed to the electrophoresis effect which promotes the sludge flocs transferring from cathode to anode and hence the cake formed at the cathode is looser than that at the anode lee 2005 the porosity of sludge cake at the cathode increased with the dosage of cbms and there was a prominent increase in graphite conditioned sludge cake porosity at the cathode the pore volume of the cathode sludge cake was increased from 0 11 cm 3 g to 0 15 cm 3 g with the addition of 20 g gtss graphite indicating that the electrophoresis effect of graphite reinforced sludge floc was stronger than that of ac 0 and ac 5 however mahmoud et al found that the average cake porosity decreases with increasing electric current density mahmoud et al 2018 this difference was mainly due to the effect of carbon materials on sludge system carbon not only improved the conductivity of sludge but increased the structural strength and porosity of sludge cake which was beneficial to water release under pressure filtration therefore the porosity increased with the increase of carbon materials dosage fig 4 b shows the influence of the cbms on the zeta potential of sludge it can be seen that the zeta potentials of sludge floc increased in magnitude with the dosage of cbms the magnitude of the zeta potential of sludge flocs increased from 9 8 mv to 11 3 mv and 12 9 mv with 20 g gtss of ac 5 and graphite indicating that the electrophoretic mobility of sludge floc after conditioning with the two cbms was higher than that of ac 0 which was consistent with the porosity of sludge cake according to the report of qi et al filtration is governed by cake layer once formed the structure of sludge cake influence sludge filtration performance and that the porous cake structure is beneficial to water solid separation qi et al 2011 cbms can not only function as skeleton builders and decrease sludge cake compressibility but provide plentiful channels for water release in addition the cathode is the main water permeating side in the electro dewatering process so the increase in porosity of sludge cake at the cathode contributes to the electro dewatering process 3 3 electro osmotic effect electro osmotic transport can be induced by an external electric field in capillary or porous plug systems where the electric polarization charging of a solid surface occurs in the absence of an external electric field the dewatering rate of the two electrodes was similar while it differed greatly under electrical assistance mitchell and soga 2005 suggested that the dewatering rate difference between two electrodes rd can be used to reflect the electro osmotic effect rd mitchell and soga 2005 fig 5 shows the effects of cbms on sludge electro osmosis it can be seen that the electro osmotic effects were enhanced with cbms and the enhancement effect were consistent with the conductivity of cbms in other words the enhancement of sludge conductivity with the addition of cbms can promote the electro osmotic effect cao et al 2018 moreover the solid carbon can also act as skeleton builders and provide more channels for water passage which facilitate the osmotic effect further 3 4 the effect of cbms on the compartmentalization of eps solubilization 3 4 1 dom concentration many studies have suggested that eps is the predominant factor that affects sludge dewatering behavior higgins and novak 1997 houghton et al 2001 yu et al 2008 in this study we investigated the impact of cbms on compartmentalization of eps solubilization under sludge electro dewatering by analyzing the content and composition of dom in the filtrate fig 6 presented the effect of different cbms on the filtration dom concentration in the electro dewatering process it can be seen that a significant difference of dom content existed between the cathode and anode filtrates the cathode dom content was higher than that of the anode owing to the generation of a large number of hydroxyl oh groups which caused the deprotonation of anionic functional groups in eps cao et al 2018 also negatively charged sludge flocs migrated toward the anode so the cathode dom content was higher than the anode protein like substances are the major constituents of eps the dissolution of proteins increases the sludge viscosity and clogs the filter membrane zhang et al 2016 high concentration of soluble biopolymers especially protein like substances was adverse to sludge filtration and removal of them were conductive to sludge dewatering process it should be noted that ac 5 performed better in adsorbing biopolymers than the other two cbms and the dom content at the cathode and anode were decreased from 49 96 mg l to 28 61 mg l and from 24 21 mg l to14 14 mg l respectively 3 4 2 dom composition fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy is a highly sensitive and selective tool that has been extensively utilized to characterize natural organic matter nom especially from microbial activity chen et al 2003 fig 7 shows eem profiles of dom at both electrodes 20 g gtss there were three main fluorescent components in the dom from both electrodes peak a λex λem 280nm 335 nm tryptophan like protein tpn peak b λex λem 225 nm 340 nm aromatic protein apn and peak c λex λem 330 nm 410 nm humic acid ha the fluorescent intensity of protein substances peak a and peak b of dom at cathode was significantly higher than that at the anode table 3 presents the variation of fluorescent intensities at the cathode of cbms enhanced electro dewatering it was found that the protein like substances peak a and peak b in dom at the cathode were obviously higher than that at the anode for raw sludge the fluorescent intensities of tpn apn and ha in dom at the cathode and anode were 1897 2345 274 and 287 2 407 4 291 respectively the fluorescent intensities decreased with increasing carbon material dosage moreover ac 5 was more effective in reducing the concentration of biopolymers the fluorescent intensity of dom at the cathode and anode decreased to 353 8 499 6 79 7 and 50 4 110 5 86 8 when the dosage of 20 g gtss was used according to our previous research the biopolymers such as proteins and humic substances at the cathode dom exhibited more important influence on the was electro dewatering than that in the anode at the anode the sticky proteins can be oxidized into small molecules under electrochemical oxidation and alleviate their adverse impact on the sludge dewatering process on the other hand the cathode alkalization causes solubilization and release of large amount of eps that can t be degraded and these sticky biopolymers with high molecular weight result in the deterioration of sludge filterability cao et al 2018 it can be seen that sludge viscosity decreased with the increased concentrations of cbms fig 3 the addition of cbms effectively removed the proteins and humic substances in the filtrate thereby relieving the plugging of the filter membrane 3 5 model of cbms to improve sludge electro dewatering and reduce energy consumption it is known that the cathode is the main water permeable side in the electro dewatering process and the effect of sludge electro dewatering is related to electrokinetic phenomena electrophorus and electro osmosis effect and eps release caused by electrochemical reaction cao et al 2018 mahmoud et al 2010b cbms can enhance the sludge conductivity and improve the electrophorus and electro osmosis effect of sludge floc in addition it can also adsorb the released eps and relieve the blockage of the filter cloth concurrently solid carbon can also act as a skeleton and reduce the sludge compressibility thereby providing more channels to release water compared with graphite ac 5 has high surface area and plentiful pores so it performed better in eps adsorption than graphite while graphite shows higher electrical conductivity than ac 5 it is obvious that graphite is more effective in enhancing sludge electro dewatering performance indicating that the electrical conductivity of cbms plays a more determining role than their propensity to adsorb eps for improving the sludge electro dewatering effect fig 8 presents the mechanism of the cbms to improve the electro dewatering process according to the report by mahmoud et al one of the best ways to compare the power consumption is to calculate the energy per the additional mass of water removed in the electro dewatering process rather than dewatering without electrical field mahmoud et al 2010b energy consumption e was calculated by 3 e p m u i t dt m where e is the energy consumption per mass of water removed kj kg p is energy consumption kw h m is the weight of water removed kg u is the applied voltage during dewatering process v i t is the current change over time during dewatering process a t is the applied voltage time s cbms can shorten the power on time and the energy consumption can be decreased by raising cbms concentration among the cbms studied graphite was found to be the most effective in reducing the energy consumption for water removal 3 6 thermal analysis of sludge cake fig 9 a shows the result of the calorific value of electro dewatering sludge cake after conditioning by different cbms the calorific values of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite were 15 76 mj kg 21 66 mj kg and 28 45 mj kg respectively the calorific value of sludge cakes was increased as the dosage of cbms raised the calorific value of raw sludge cake was 13 92 mj kg and the calorific values were increased to 15 73 mj kg 15 74 mj kg and 17 27 mj kg when 20 g gtss of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite were used fig 9 b presents the tg and dtg curves of the cbms it has been found that the weight of ac 0 ac 5 and graphite did not change significantly at the initial temperature increase and the weight of ac 0 and ac 5 sharply dropped as the temperature increased above 600 c graphite showed better thermal stability but began to decompose when the temperature reached 900 c fig 9 c shows the tg and dtg curves of the sludge cake after carbon materials enhanced was electro dewatering it was observed that the weight of the sludge cake started to decrease with temperature two distinct peaks that appear in the dtg curve indicate that sludge cakes had three distinct weight loss intervals the first weight loss peak occurs at about 100 c this is mainly due to the precipitation of bound water in the sludge the second weight loss interval was around 250 350 c and has two weight loss peaks this stage is mainly the precipitation of volatile matter in the sludge it can be seen that the weight loss peak becomes smaller after conditioning with cbms indicating that the addition of cbms can slow down the decomposition rate of the sludge cake and increase sustainable combustion time of sludge among three cbms graphite reinforced sludge cake had the best flammability 3 7 environmental implication addition of cbm to the sludge system can enhance the sludge conductivity and enable adsorption of dissolved eps in the electro dewatering process can relieve clogging of the filter cloth the moisture content of sludge can be reduced to below 50 after the electro dewatering process and carbon based material assisted electro dewatering not only reduces the moisture content to a lower level but increase the calorific value of sludge cake and sustainable combustion time of sludge treated with carbon based materials was also increased table s1 and s2 show the reduction percentage of energy consumption and calorific value increase of sludge cake after adding cbms it can be seen that the energy consumption per kilogram of water removed was decreased with increasing cbms dosage electro dewatering sludge cake after cbms conditioning can be incinerated to generate more energy which facilitates resource utilization and thus the entire sludge treatment process can achieve the simultaneous reduction of waste products as beneficial resources 4 conclusion in this study we evaluated the effects of three carbon materials ac 0 ac 5 and graphite on sludge electro dewatering behavior and the flammability of sludge cakes we found that cbms can promote the effect of sludge electro dewatering the electrical conductivity of the cbm determines its contribution to the sludge electro dewatering moreover carbon materials can increase the electrophoretic mobility of sludge flocs and electro osmotic effects furthermore carbon materials can adsorb the dissolved eps which mainly involves proteins and humic substances that are formed by electrochemical reactions as a result alleviate the plugging and filtration resistance of the filter medium the energy consumption per the additional mass of water removed during the electro dewatering process decreased after the addition of carbon material the enhanced calorific value and sustainable combustion time of sludge cake treated with carbon materials can facilitate the resource utilization of the dewatered sludge cake
