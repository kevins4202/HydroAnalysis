5060,groundwater salinity in an aquifer system is typically measured through field studies e g groundwater sampling and direct current resistivity method the field based measurements are costly and time consuming when they are applied over a large domain in this study a methodology was developed and evaluated based on available hydrogeology and hydrometeorology data and statistical and machine learning techniques to map the groundwater salinity in the southern coastal aquifer of the caspian sea first variables affecting groundwater salinity aquifer transmissivity distance from the sea the mean annual precipitation the mean annual evaporation elevation and the depth to the water table were determined and the dataset was randomly divided into three subsets of training testing and verification next the relationship between groundwater salinity and its controlling factors was established using three methods namely extreme gradient boosting egb deep neural network dnn and multiple linear regression mlr and the models were evaluated by comparing the measured values and the predicted values using the statistical criteria r squared nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and normalized root mean square deviation nrmsd finally the optimum model was applied to the set of known input variables to map the spatial variation of the groundwater salinity across the entire southern coastal plain of the caspian sea and the final map was verified using the verification subset results showed that consideration should be given to the egb method considering its higher performance on the testing subset r squared 0 89 nse 0 87 nrmsd 0 45 in depth analysis of the variables showed that the aquifer transmissivity is the most crucial parameter affecting groundwater salinity in the region the adopted approach could potentially be used for groundwater management purposes in the study area and similar settings elsewhere keywords extreme gradient boosting deep neural network multiple linear regression groundwater salinity modeling the southern coastal aquifer of the caspian sea 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of water for 2 5 billion people around the world and it sustains the well being of many critical terrestrial ecosystems gleeson et al 2012 during the past decades increasing water demand and over exploitation of groundwater resources threatened the sustainability of these resources in many parts of the world wada et al 2010 motevalli et al 2019 excessive withdrawal from coastal aquifers causes erratic changes in groundwater quality and water flow patterns due to the encroachment by seawater intrusion to the coastal aquifers groundwater salinization is a common problem in unconfined coastal aquifers especially where excessive groundwater pumping causes a decrease in the piezometric head in confined and semi confined coastal aquifers hydrogeological processes are more complicated due to the existence of the confining layers which partially separate groundwater from seawater and from the vadose zone where most of the geochemical processes take place therefore seawater intrusion may also occur in semi confined coastal aquifers groen et al 2000 bouchaou et al 2009 shi et al 2020 groundwater salinization occurs in many coastal aquifers around the world barlow and reichard 2010 werner et al 2013 argamasilla et al 2017 this issue is even more critical in arid and semi arid regions with limited available freshwater resources an increase in groundwater salinity adversely affects the ecological health economic progress of the local communities and productivity of coastal crops through the accumulation of salt in plants and soil increased salinity adversely affects the quality of drinking water that endangers human health gholami et al 2017 while small amounts of salt are vital for regulating the fluid balance consumption of salt higher than the normal levels is associated with adverse health effects such as hypertension and stroke nishida et al 2004 moreover groundwater salinization increases the amount of salt in the root zone which creates an osmotic effect on plants compelling them to consume more energy to extract water from the soil that eventually limits the plants ability to grow blaylock 1994 in previous studies several factors affecting groundwater salinity have been identified including evaporation carol et al 2009 infiltration from surface saline water and wastewater aunay et al 2006 upward intrusion of brines from deeper aquifers vengosh et al 1999 and seawater intrusion abd elhamid et al 2020 understanding the source and the mechanisms involved in the salinization process is essential for managing water resources efficiently and sustainably mirzavand et al 2020 the water salinity is described by electrical conductivity ec the ec of the groundwater is determined by the concentration and composition of dissolved salts brown and hamon 1961 ec is typically measured by producing an electric current between the two electrodes of a salinometer in a carefully prepared groundwater sample this method is a point based and measures the ec of groundwater samples while accurate is time consuming to carry out for an extensive area due to the preparation procedure to assess the distribution of the ec for local studies direct current dc resistivity methods have been used in this method a current is generated and introduced into the ground through point electrodes and the potential field is measured using two other electrodes mcneill 1992 el bastawesy et al 2020 the procedure in the resistivity method is also slow and is not applicable for a regional scale in order to map the groundwater salinity for a larger scale e g regional scales several gis based methods have been used tweed et al 2007 arslan 2012 bradai et al 2016 delsman et al 2018 haselbeck et al 2019 the principle idea behind the gis based mapping is to use an interpolation technique to estimate the salinity for unknown data points within the range of a discrete set of measured data points the interpolation techniques are fast and easy but not precise since the error rates are proportional to the square of the distance between the data points ghezelbash et al 2019 diaconu et al 2019 and it ignores the distribution of samples in the areas of high salinity machine learning is a data analysis method that automates an analytical model framework it is a division of artificial intelligence relying on the concept that systems can learn from data recognize patterns and make choices with the least human intervention rahmati et al 2017 machine learning techniques can estimate the groundwater salinity by establishing a linear or nonlinear relationship between water salinity and its controlling factors e g evaporation water table distance to saltwater bodies and using those relationships to predict the water salinity for the areas of unknown data points the major limitation associated with machine learning techniques for predictions is the need for adequate input variables to explain the target data that may not be available everywhere previous attempts in using artificial intelligence based models mostly focused on artificial neural network ann techniques huang and foo 2002 banerjee et al 2011 akramkhanov and vlek 2012 alagha et al 2017 barzegar and moghaddam 2016 the ann has proven to be a useful tool for mapping the salinity however it is difficult to quantify the contribution of the controlling factors in the salinity modeling process due to the black box nature of the ann models this study aimed to provide two major contributions to the previous studies in groundwater salinity modeling first the relationship between groundwater salinity and its controlling factors is complicated geng and boufadel 2017 investigating the complex relationship of ec with its controlling factors e g transmissivity precipitation water table in one hand and the importance of those factors on the other hand requires an in depth analysis of relationships between ec and its controlling factors as well as the interaction between them a practice that is not achievable using the widely used black box models the black box models can predict the salinity with sets of individual variables however they do not reveal the relationships e g linear nonlinear monotonic between the inputs and output and interactions between individual predictors in this study the relationships between the ec and its affecting variables the interaction between the individual variables and their importance were investigated using machine learning techniques second using the southern coastal aquifer of the caspian seashore as a test site a comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate three techniques a statistical model namely multiple linear regression mlr and two state of art machine learning techniques namely deep neural network dnn and extreme gradient boosting egb for modeling the spatial variation of groundwater salinity 2 overview of the study area the study area is the coastal plain of the mazandaran province in the north of iran located between the southern seashore of the caspian sea and alborz mountains the plain is extending from 50 34 e to 54 10 e and 35 47 n to 37 n fig 1 the area of the plain is about 10 000 km2 with minimal variations in slope and topography precipitation in the study area varies from 600 mm in the eastern parts to 1400 mm in the west and rainfall is the predominant type of precipitation tehrani et al 2019 the main types of land use in the study area are agricultural lands rice farms and citrus gardens residential areas rangelands forestlands and water bodies the mazandaran coastal plain consists of alluvial sediments of the quaternary period with several perennial rivers flowing through them the primary aquifer system in the mazandaran plain is the coastal aquifer with a shallow water table gholami et al 2015 there is also a fossil brine aquifer in the northeastern part of the study area that formed from the retreat of the caspian sea in the late holocene causing soil and water salinity in the adjacent areas in the south of the study area alborz mountains the groundwater is found in karst aquifers which is not the primary focus of this study the piezometric wells used for this study were installed in an unconfined aquifer and have depths between 20 and 40 m in recent decades overexploitation of groundwater construction of dams development of tourism and expansion of rice farms have reduced groundwater resources causing an increase in groundwater and soil salinity the area is heavily dependent on the groundwater resources for its extensive farmlands and its densely populated residential areas therefore it is crucial to assess the spatial variation of salinity and its controlling factors in this region 3 materials and methods a three fold exercise was conducted to model the groundwater salinity ec in the southern coastal aquifer of the caspian sea variables affecting groundwater salinity were identified and the dataset was randomly divided into three subsets of training testing and verifying the training set was used for training the models the testing set for performance evaluation of the model and the verification set for verifying the generated map step i the relationship between groundwater salinity and its controlling factors was established using statistical and machine learning methods and the performance of each model was evaluated using statistical criteria step ii using the optimum methodology and available inputs the spatial variation of the groundwater salinity was estimated for the entire study area step iii the details of the data and the adopted methodology is described below 3 1 data in this section the inputs and output of the modeling process will be explained the inputs are factors affecting groundwater salinity including aquifer transmissivity distance from the sea the mean annual precipitation the mean annual evaporation topography elevation and slope and water table the selection of the input variables was based on factors that were reported in previous studies as well as the characteristics of the study area the output or target variable is ec which shows the salinity in groundwater samples the data were collected for 140 piezometric wells as mentioned earlier the dataset was randomly divided into training 75 of the total data testing 25 of the total data the former was used to establish the relationships between inputs and ec and the letter for performance evaluation of the models additional 22 verification wells were used for verifying the final map total number of observations 162 3 1 1 electrical conductivity ec the measure of ec can determine the salinity in water samples salinity can include many different ions however relatively few makeups most of the dissolved salts and minerals in the water the most common are chloride sodium calcium magnesium bicarbonate and sulfate the ec was measured from the water samples of the piezometric wells the ec in this study is the average values of monthly measurements from the year 2015 to 2019 and was reported in micro siemens per centimeter μs cm no significant trend was detected in the recorded data the monthly ec sampling and measurements from the piezometric wells of the study area were conducted by mazandaran regional water company mrwc 3 1 2 transmissivity t the transmissivity in an aquifer is a measure of how much water can be transmitted horizontally through whole saturated thickness and unit width of an aquifer bear 1979 salinity was reported to be highly sensitive to transmissivity wei et al 1990 salinity is expected to be lower in the areas with higher transmissivity because the groundwater in the study area flows from the land to the caspian sea therefore more low salinity freshwater is transmitted to those areas transmissivity t k h is a crucial transmission property of an aquifer which is different from hydraulic conductivity k in that it includes the whole saturation thickness h of the aquifer while k is defined for unit saturation thickness only transmissivity for each well was measured through the pumping test conducted by mrwc the reported transmissivity values were ranged from 75 to 3000 m2 day fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the transmissivity in the mazandaran coastal aquifer 3 1 3 distance from the sea ds distance from the caspian sea ds is another parameter that was used as an input for the modeling process the caspian sea is the largest inland water body in the world the reported average salinity of the caspian sea was 1 2 12 g l tuzhilkin and kosarev 2005 choosing ds as one of the input variables was based on the possible interaction between groundwater and seawater for the areas closer to the caspian sea the salinity expected to be higher for the closer wells to the sea due to possible seawater intrusion to the coastal aquifers the distance from the sea was measured from the digital layer of the location of the wells in gis the distance of the wells from the sea was ranging from 200 m to 32063 m 3 1 4 the depth to the water table dwt the mean annual groundwater level for each well was calculated from the monthly time series data and was used as one of the input variables the values were reported as the depth to the water table dwt the dwt in the recorded wells training wells varies from 0 37 to 40 m average 7 85 m the selection of dwt as one of the variables was because in the areas with shallow water table evaporation increases due to high water content of the saturated zone and capillary force therefore higher salinity was expected in the shallower water table geng and boufadel 2017 the factors controlling water table variations in the study area are recharge through precipitation evaporation from the saturated zone and groundwater withdrawal for agricultural industrial and residential sectors the spatial variation of the dwt was presented in fig 2 3 1 5 mean annual precipitation precipitation determines the inflow rate and it affects the groundwater system by recharging the aquifers and decreasing the salinity by diluting the groundwater precipitation causes infiltration of freshwater into the aquifer and alters saline waters in subsurface regions of coastal aquifers geng and boufadel 2017 the dominant type of precipitation in the study area occurs as rainfall the mean annual precipitation in each recorded site was selected as one of the input variables in the modeling process the mean annual precipitation over the study area was ranging between 600 and 1400 mm average 922 mm the data was obtained from mrwc and the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation was estimated by kriging of the station based observation data in gis fig 2 3 1 6 mean annual evaporation evaporation is a fundamental component of subsurface flow and dissolved particles fujimaki et al 2006 in the coastal aquifers with shallow water tables such as the northern parts of the study area the saturated zone has high water content due to capillary forces which facilitates the evaporation of water from pores the exposure of freshwater to evaporation increases the salinity aquifers geng and boufadel 2017 therefore it is crucial to incorporate evaporation as one of the input variables in the modeling process the data was provided by mrwc from the meteorological stations and the map was generated using the kriging technique in gis the average annual evaporation was ranging between 875 and 1000 mm fig 2 3 1 7 topography the relationship between groundwater salinity and topography was previously investigated in some case studies elmahdy and mohamed 2012 nosetto et al 2013 nosetto et al 2013 showed land use and topography are two crucial controlling factors contributing to 82 and 66 of the spatial variability of groundwater salinity the relationship between topography and groundwater accumulation is complicated water tables are often assumed as subdued replicas of topography hubbert 1940 toth 1963 recent studies showed that groundwater fluxes are mostly managed by topographic gradients rather than gradients in pressure head in humid regions with modest slopes condon and maxwell 2015 the elevation and slope were derived from a high resolution digital elevation model dem in gis the elevation in the study area varies from 27 to 650 m from the mean sea level fig 2 the mean slope of the mazandaran plain is less than five percent 3 2 modeling the groundwater salinity a multiple linear regression mlr and two machine learning methods namely extreme gradient boosting egb deep neural network dnn were used and tested to identify the relationship between the ec and its controlling factors transmissivity distance from the sea precipitation evaporation topography and water table a stepwise method was used to identify the significant input variables by adding and removing individual variables to reach the maximum fit on the testing subset the optimal structure of the models was determined using a trial error procedure and by performance evaluation of the models on the testing subset each method was tested by comparing the predicted ec values to the measured values in the testing subset using three statistical coefficients the data in the testing subset was not used in the modeling process therefore the statistical coefficients represent the actual performance of the adopted models by applying the optimum model on a set of known input variables the values of ec were estimated for the entire study area below is the detailed description of each model 3 2 1 extreme gradient boosting egb extreme gradient boosting egb with decision trees is a predictive modeling procedure in machine learning that was used to model ec from its controlling factors the learning process in the decision tree algorithm is based on a tree like model that goes from observations of input variables branches of the tree to the prediction of the target variable leaves of the tree the goal of this study was to create a model to predict the ec values from a set of input variables controlling factors using trees has several advantages including not limited to handling different types of target variables e g numerical categorical and multivariate ability to model complex interactions and managing missing data with minimum loss of information however there are two principal restrictions with tree based learning algorithms weakness of prediction and problems with the analysis of large trees in order to address the shortcomings mentioned above the gradient boosting algorithm was first proposed by breiman et al 1984 and further developed by others mason 2000 chen and guestrin 2016 in gradient boosting the goal is to use a set of predictors x 1 x n to predict a set of output values y 1 y n by using a model f x y and minimizing the sum of loss function j i 1 n l y i f x i by improving the model f x here the loss function is l x y x y 2 the model improvement algorithm is performed by first calculating the negative gradients of j with respect to f xi j f x i then a regression tree h was fit to negative gradients j f x i finally the new f xi will be f xi γh where γ is the step size in our algorithm to reach the estimated minimum of j and this iteration should be repeated until the desired accuracy is reached as a significant improvement over gradient boosting in the egb the process begins with a loss function l y i f x i h and minimize j i 1 n l y i f x i ω h where ω h γ t 1 2 λ w 2 here t is the number of leaves in the tree and w is the leaf weights the xgboost package written in r programming language was used for implementing the egb model fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of the gradient boosting method 3 2 2 deep neural network dnn the dnn method establishes empirical often nonlinear relationships between the set of independent input variables and corresponding dependent output variables a dnn is based on a series of connected neurons that are intended to replicate the functions of neurons in animal or human brains they pass information between each another a structure that enables dnns to be trained and learn hu et al 2018 compared to artificial neural networks anns which comprised of three layers of input hidden layer and output the deep neural network uses multiple hidden layers for feature transformation the adopted dnn method in this study is known as a multilayer perceptron mlp an mlp consists of units called a perceptron perceptrons have one or more inputs an activation function and an output an mlp model is built up by combining perceptrons in structured layers the perceptrons in a given layer are independent of one another but each connects to all other perceptrons in the following layer each layer is composed of a set of neurons and is trained with a backpropagation algorithm the backpropagation is one of the most extensively used algorithms for supervised training of multilayered neural networks hu et al 2018 backpropagation works by approximating the nonlinear relationship between the input and the output by altering the weight values internally the processes of the backpropagation can be divided into two stages of feedforward and backpropagation in the feedforward step a pattern is applied to the input layer and its effect propagates layer by layer through the network until the output is generated the network s sample of output value is then compared to the observed value and an error signal is estimated for each of the output neurons since all neurons within the hidden layer contributed to the signal errors in the output layer the output errors are transmitted backward from the output layer to each neuron within the hidden layer that contributed to the output layer this process is reiterated layer by layer until each neuron in the network has received an error signal that represents its relative contribution to the total error once the error signal for each neuron has been computed the errors are then applied by the neuron to adjust the values for each connection weights the goal is to minimize the value of the error function in weight space the weights with minimum error functions are then considered to be a solution to the learning problem in a dnn hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins and it controls the model structure e g number of layers number of hidden layers and number of epochs the output of a neuron in the hidden layer is obtained from the following equation 1 h j f i 1 n w j i x i b i where w j i and b i are the weights and biases of the hidden layer neurons and f is a nonlinear activation function also the network output is calculated by 2 y f j 1 m w k j h i b 0 where w k j and b 0 are the weights and biases of the output layer neuron and f is the output layer neuron activation function additional information about the theory behind dnn applications can be found in aggarwal 2018 the dnn model was created using the neuralnet package written in the r programming language fritsch et al 2019 as mentioned before a trial error method was applied to define the optimal structure of each model in the dnn model the number of hyperparameters was determined as the numbers were added gradually until the predicted and observed values start to match the evaluation in the model was carried out using the mean squared error mse performance function in this study the dnn consists of one input layer two hidden layers and one output layer the two hidden layers were made of 8 hidden neurons 5 neurons for the first hidden layer and 3 neurons for the second fig 4 the number of epochs is a hyperparameter that represents the number of complete passes through the training dataset the optimal number of epoch in this study was 135 3 2 3 multiple linear regression mlr the mlr or multiple linear regression model derives patterns in the data and establishes the best fitting linear relationships between two or more dependent variables and the target ec as described earlier a stepwise approach was used in which the selection of variables is carried out by addition to or subtraction from a set of input variables using pre specified coefficients such as the f test the t test and the coefficient of determination in an mlr model every value of the input variable x is associated with a value of the target variable y the regression line for n input variables x1 x2 xn can be explained as follows 3 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b n x n where y is the predicted value of the target variable dependent b0 is the value of y when the values of all input variables are equal to zero x1 xn are input independent variables and b1 through bn are the calculated regression coefficients alshehri et al 2020 sahour et al 2020 in a multiple linear regression model the target variable y ec in this study is assumed to be linearly related to a set of n predictors explanatory input variables x1 x2 xn and the input variables are not highly correlated with each other multicollinearity a condition in which two or more input variables are highly correlated with one another in the mlr model was addressed using the variance inflation factor vif multicollinearity makes it challenging to determine the effect of the individual predictors on the target variable and to identify the variables that should be included in the final model vif is one of the most widely used diagnostic indices for multicollinearity it determines how much the variance of a coefficient is inflated because of linear dependences with other input variables alin 2010 observations were selected independently and randomly from the dataset additionally residuals expected to be normally distributed with a mean value of zero the parameters are trained in such a way to achieve the highest agreement between the predicted and observed values in the training subset the ideal situation is a model in which a data point lies perfectly on the fitted regression line 3 3 performance evaluation of the models the performance evaluation of the adopted models was carried out by a comparison between the predicted values and observed values on the testing subset using statistical coefficients namely r squared normalized root mean squared deviation nrmsd and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as follows 3 rmsd i 1 n y o å p 2 n 4 nrmsd rmsd y oi 5 nse 1 i 1 n å p y o 2 i 1 n y o y oi 2 where y o is the observed ec value y p is the predicted ec value n is the number of observations and y oi is the mean of the observed ec values the strength of the relationship between input variables and target ec was analyzed using feature importance fi the measure of feature importance is based on how many times a given model selects a variable for splitting and how much it is improved because of the splitting friedman and meulman 2003 relative fi was calculated for each input variable and converted to a 0 to 1 scale 3 4 mapping the groundwater salinity the input variables are available for the entire study area in continuous raster formats but the ec is only available for the selected piezometric wells the optimum model for establishing the relationships between ec and input variables was identified in the previous step for generating the final map the optimum model was applied to the set of input variables and the values of ec were estimated across the entire mazandaran plain the generated ec layer in a raster format was entered into gis for the visualization and classification of area based on their salinity rates 4 results the measured ec from groundwater samples was ranging from 65 to 6400 μs cm average 1300 μs cm the performance of the three methods in the training stage was given in table 1 according to the statistical criteria r squared nse and nrmsd the egb performed better nse 0 99 nrmsd 0 01 r squared 0 99 compared to the other methods in the training stage table 1 the dnn was the second best method and the performance of the mlr method was the least among the three methods in the training stage table 1 fig 5 shows the comparison between the predicted and the recorded observed ec in the training and testing stage each model mlr egb and dnn was applied to the testing subset to compare the predicted ec with the observed values the performance evaluation of each method on the test subset was also presented in table 1 the results showed the egb method yielded the most favorable results on the testing subset given its highest r squared and nse values and the lowest nrmsd value among the three methods nse 0 87 nrmsd 0 45 r squared 0 89 table 1 the performance of the dnn was better than that of mlr however both the dnn nse 0 42 nrmsd 0 89 r squared 0 61 and mlr nse 0 09 nrmsd 0 98 r squared 0 48 showed a weak performance in the testing stage the feature importance fi analysis corroborated that aquifer transmissivity is the most influential variable in groundwater salinity of the coastal aquifers of the caspian sea with the relative contribution of 0 73 fig 6 precipitation is the second important variable with 0 18 of relative contribution in modeling ec the water table and distance from the sea are two other significant factors the least relative contribution was associated with the elevation evaporation and slope were removed from the set of final variables in the stepwise procedure in fact ignoring the evaporation and slope in the models particularly mlr it would not result in lower accuracy since the loss value would be minimal in tree nodes for egb and hidden layers for dnn the partial dependence plot pdp shows the marginal effect that features independent variables have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model fig 7 a partial dependence plot can show whether the relationship between the target and a feature is linear monotonic or more complex fig 7 indicates that in the egb model ec has a nonlinear relationship with the five independent variables presented in the model for transmissivity m2 day there is an entirely inverse relationship between the aquifer transmissivity and ec as transmissivity increases from 0 to 2000 m2 day the ec decreases harmonically roughly from 2500 to 1000 μs cm one plausible explanation could be related to the coarser grain size in formations with higher transmissivity that allow groundwater to move faster and dilute the aquifer with low salinity recharge there is a reciprocal relationship between ec and precipitation due to the lower salinity of rainwater so that as precipitation increases from 650 to 1400 mm the ec values decrease from 1850 to 1000 μs cm however for low precipitation areas 650 mm fig 7 ec increases with precipitation indicates that other controlling factors could offset the impacts of precipitation in those areas similar to transmissivity there is an almost everywhere inverse dependency between ec and water level in a sense that when depth to the water table increases from 0 to 15 m the ec values decrease from 1650 to 1200 μs cm and stays almost constant for water levels more than 15 m the aquifer is shallower near the sea therefore the interaction between groundwater and seawater is higher causing higher salinity for the areas with the shallower water table in the study area for elevation m with an increase from 27 to 20 m the ec decreases from 15 000 to 12 500 μs cm and after a 400 μs cm increase the ec value remains almost constant for elevations higher than 70 m the distance from the sea seems to have the most nonlinear relationship with ec where ec increases from 1250 to 1550 μs cm as distance increases from 4000 to 9500 m then after a drawdown on ec values to 1400 μs cm followed by a jump to 1450 μs cm the value of ec stays almost constant for all distances larger than 20000 m it reveals that to some extent other controlling factors such as transmissivity could offset the impact of the distance from the sea in the salination of groundwater using the optimum methodology the egb model the groundwater salinity for the entire area was estimated the fitted egb model was applied to a set of known input variables in continuous raster formats to assess the groundwater salinity ec for the entire study area the spatial distribution of the groundwater salinity was presented in fig 8 the final map was verified through a comparison between ec values of the 22 verification wells and the estimated values on the map fig 8 the verification wells were plotted on the generated map to compare the values from the verification wells with their estimated ec values on the map the calculated r squared nse and nrmsd for the final map were 0 82 0 81 and 0 42 respectively the verification wells and their predicted values were shown in fig 8 the hydrological setting of an aquifer plays an essential role in groundwater salinity various factors contribute to the spatial variation of ec the spatial distribution of ec and transmissivity shows that ec has an inverse relationship with transmissivity in general the formations with coarser grain size have higher transmissivity and therefore the salinity tends to be lower and vice versa the analysis of the ec and dwt shows that groundwater salinity has an inverse relationship with dwt it means that in the area with a higher groundwater level shallower groundwater the salinity is also higher compared to the area with a deeper groundwater level the evaporation and slope were not among the significant variables one explanation could be the high humidity of the study area and the low variations of evaporation 5 discussion the estimated values of ec in the final map was ranging from 50 to 7000 μs cm average 1299 μs cm the low ec areas in the western parts of the study area are associated with the area of high transmissivity high precipitation and groundwater recharge as well as more perennial rivers and less groundwater withdrawal for the agricultural lands since the transmissivity is the most important variables affecting the groundwater salinity the estimated ec values for the areas located in the same class of transmissivity are close together however the ec values could be higher or lower by the effects of precipitation as the second important variable and other variables for example in the northeastern parts where the highest ec values were estimated fig 8 both the transmissivity and precipitation values are at their lowest in the study area fig 2 the west east increasing pattern of the groundwater salinity is correlated with the decreasing values of annual precipitation that shows the role of precipitation in groundwater recharge one explanation could be diluting groundwater with low salinity precipitation in the recharge areas of the coastal aquifers that mostly occur in the western parts rather than the east the area of high salinity on the map is also consistent with the results of sensitivity analysis through feature importance fig 6 as it shows the aquifer transmissivity precipitation water table the distance from the sea and and elevation respectively are the most significant factors in groundwater salinity of the study area moreover the northern section of the mazandaran plain is also associated with the areas of low elevation the low elevation area was reported to be associated with the areas of shallow groundwater alshehri et al 2020 however the major parameters in higher groundwater salinity of the eastern mazandaran plain compared to the west are found to be the lower recharge rate lower precipitation and fewer perennial rivers and more extensive agricultural area and groundwater extraction the final map also revealed that the ground salinity of the area closer to the sea is higher due to three reasons first seawater intrusion and the mobility of the seawater groundwater interface due to water table dropdown second the presence of the fossil aquifer in the northwest section of the mazandaran plain and third the presence of the shallow groundwater and fine grained soil texture with inadequate drainage capabilities gholami et al 2010 the structure and characteristics of the data are an essential factor in adopting a specific methodology in machine learning the deep learning method is suitable for large datasets mao et al 2006 and the learning performance may not be accurate in small datasets as it was the case in our study dnn requires more training data than other machine learning or statistical models such as mlr and egb moreover the black box nature of the dnn model makes it complicated for further interpretations about the importance of the individual predictors e g transmissivity precipitation water table in the modeling process a problem that is not the case with mlr and egb the advantage of the mlr model was the ability to identify the contribution of the variables to predict the values of ec however given the weakness of the predictions it was no used for mapping the groundwater salinity since our dataset was not very large 162 observations machine learning algorithms especially egb are superior in performance indeed the structure of egb makes it more suitable for training a smaller subset of data also computational considerations and experimental cycle times convinced us to prefer egb on our work egb gave superior accuracy in our study however deep learning may outperform egb or any other machine learning algorithm when it is applied on a big dataset the performance evaluation of the models in the training and testing stages showed the high performance of the adopted methodology egb in groundwater salinity modeling especially in the prediction of the minimum and maximum values this is an applicable ability in the egb model since the maximum errors usually occur in the prediction of high and low values the accurate prediction of the extreme values is crucial in mapping the areas of high salinity because it shows the critical zones for groundwater treatment operations the comparison between the values on the verification wells and their associated estimated values showed that the final map accurately classified the different ranges of groundwater salinity including drinkable water ec 1500 μs cm brackish water 1500 ec 3000 μs cm and saline water ec greater than 3000 μs cm the zoning map of the salinity is also useful for proper management of groundwater resources for agricultural products with respect to the types of cultivation 6 conclusion assessment of the spatial variation of groundwater salinity is crucial for any water resources management practices however it is challenging to conduct groundwater sampling for all monitoring wells in a vast region moreover measurements of groundwater salinity in a regional scale require an extensive network of monitoring wells which is costly time consuming and is not applicable for many parts of the world in this study a methodology was proposed based on accurate measurements of ec from water samples in a portion of the study area and the use of machine learning techniques to estimate the ec for the rest of the study area factors controlling groundwater salinity were identified and quantified through field measurements hydroclimate data and processing a high resolution dem in gis the relationships between ec and the controlling factors were established using three machine learning approaches and the performance of each model was assessed by statistical criteria nse nrmsd and r squared the egb performed better and was selected as the optimum model the optimum model was used to estimate the groundwater salinity for the area of unknown ec values the results showed that the combination of field sampling and machine learning techniques is useful for modeling and mapping groundwater salinity the performance of machine learning techniques enhances significantly in a larger dataset sakr et al 2017 to avoid problems related to small datasets and to assess the real predictability power of the models the evaluation was performed on an out of sample testing subset that was not used for training the models the evaluation of the models in training testing and verification subsets showed high performance of the adopted methodology in groundwater salinity modeling especially for extremely high values therefore adopting the same methodology could be useful for modeling and mapping groundwater salinity or any other water quality parameters in similar settings elsewhere declaration of competing interest the authors declare

5060,groundwater salinity in an aquifer system is typically measured through field studies e g groundwater sampling and direct current resistivity method the field based measurements are costly and time consuming when they are applied over a large domain in this study a methodology was developed and evaluated based on available hydrogeology and hydrometeorology data and statistical and machine learning techniques to map the groundwater salinity in the southern coastal aquifer of the caspian sea first variables affecting groundwater salinity aquifer transmissivity distance from the sea the mean annual precipitation the mean annual evaporation elevation and the depth to the water table were determined and the dataset was randomly divided into three subsets of training testing and verification next the relationship between groundwater salinity and its controlling factors was established using three methods namely extreme gradient boosting egb deep neural network dnn and multiple linear regression mlr and the models were evaluated by comparing the measured values and the predicted values using the statistical criteria r squared nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and normalized root mean square deviation nrmsd finally the optimum model was applied to the set of known input variables to map the spatial variation of the groundwater salinity across the entire southern coastal plain of the caspian sea and the final map was verified using the verification subset results showed that consideration should be given to the egb method considering its higher performance on the testing subset r squared 0 89 nse 0 87 nrmsd 0 45 in depth analysis of the variables showed that the aquifer transmissivity is the most crucial parameter affecting groundwater salinity in the region the adopted approach could potentially be used for groundwater management purposes in the study area and similar settings elsewhere keywords extreme gradient boosting deep neural network multiple linear regression groundwater salinity modeling the southern coastal aquifer of the caspian sea 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of water for 2 5 billion people around the world and it sustains the well being of many critical terrestrial ecosystems gleeson et al 2012 during the past decades increasing water demand and over exploitation of groundwater resources threatened the sustainability of these resources in many parts of the world wada et al 2010 motevalli et al 2019 excessive withdrawal from coastal aquifers causes erratic changes in groundwater quality and water flow patterns due to the encroachment by seawater intrusion to the coastal aquifers groundwater salinization is a common problem in unconfined coastal aquifers especially where excessive groundwater pumping causes a decrease in the piezometric head in confined and semi confined coastal aquifers hydrogeological processes are more complicated due to the existence of the confining layers which partially separate groundwater from seawater and from the vadose zone where most of the geochemical processes take place therefore seawater intrusion may also occur in semi confined coastal aquifers groen et al 2000 bouchaou et al 2009 shi et al 2020 groundwater salinization occurs in many coastal aquifers around the world barlow and reichard 2010 werner et al 2013 argamasilla et al 2017 this issue is even more critical in arid and semi arid regions with limited available freshwater resources an increase in groundwater salinity adversely affects the ecological health economic progress of the local communities and productivity of coastal crops through the accumulation of salt in plants and soil increased salinity adversely affects the quality of drinking water that endangers human health gholami et al 2017 while small amounts of salt are vital for regulating the fluid balance consumption of salt higher than the normal levels is associated with adverse health effects such as hypertension and stroke nishida et al 2004 moreover groundwater salinization increases the amount of salt in the root zone which creates an osmotic effect on plants compelling them to consume more energy to extract water from the soil that eventually limits the plants ability to grow blaylock 1994 in previous studies several factors affecting groundwater salinity have been identified including evaporation carol et al 2009 infiltration from surface saline water and wastewater aunay et al 2006 upward intrusion of brines from deeper aquifers vengosh et al 1999 and seawater intrusion abd elhamid et al 2020 understanding the source and the mechanisms involved in the salinization process is essential for managing water resources efficiently and sustainably mirzavand et al 2020 the water salinity is described by electrical conductivity ec the ec of the groundwater is determined by the concentration and composition of dissolved salts brown and hamon 1961 ec is typically measured by producing an electric current between the two electrodes of a salinometer in a carefully prepared groundwater sample this method is a point based and measures the ec of groundwater samples while accurate is time consuming to carry out for an extensive area due to the preparation procedure to assess the distribution of the ec for local studies direct current dc resistivity methods have been used in this method a current is generated and introduced into the ground through point electrodes and the potential field is measured using two other electrodes mcneill 1992 el bastawesy et al 2020 the procedure in the resistivity method is also slow and is not applicable for a regional scale in order to map the groundwater salinity for a larger scale e g regional scales several gis based methods have been used tweed et al 2007 arslan 2012 bradai et al 2016 delsman et al 2018 haselbeck et al 2019 the principle idea behind the gis based mapping is to use an interpolation technique to estimate the salinity for unknown data points within the range of a discrete set of measured data points the interpolation techniques are fast and easy but not precise since the error rates are proportional to the square of the distance between the data points ghezelbash et al 2019 diaconu et al 2019 and it ignores the distribution of samples in the areas of high salinity machine learning is a data analysis method that automates an analytical model framework it is a division of artificial intelligence relying on the concept that systems can learn from data recognize patterns and make choices with the least human intervention rahmati et al 2017 machine learning techniques can estimate the groundwater salinity by establishing a linear or nonlinear relationship between water salinity and its controlling factors e g evaporation water table distance to saltwater bodies and using those relationships to predict the water salinity for the areas of unknown data points the major limitation associated with machine learning techniques for predictions is the need for adequate input variables to explain the target data that may not be available everywhere previous attempts in using artificial intelligence based models mostly focused on artificial neural network ann techniques huang and foo 2002 banerjee et al 2011 akramkhanov and vlek 2012 alagha et al 2017 barzegar and moghaddam 2016 the ann has proven to be a useful tool for mapping the salinity however it is difficult to quantify the contribution of the controlling factors in the salinity modeling process due to the black box nature of the ann models this study aimed to provide two major contributions to the previous studies in groundwater salinity modeling first the relationship between groundwater salinity and its controlling factors is complicated geng and boufadel 2017 investigating the complex relationship of ec with its controlling factors e g transmissivity precipitation water table in one hand and the importance of those factors on the other hand requires an in depth analysis of relationships between ec and its controlling factors as well as the interaction between them a practice that is not achievable using the widely used black box models the black box models can predict the salinity with sets of individual variables however they do not reveal the relationships e g linear nonlinear monotonic between the inputs and output and interactions between individual predictors in this study the relationships between the ec and its affecting variables the interaction between the individual variables and their importance were investigated using machine learning techniques second using the southern coastal aquifer of the caspian seashore as a test site a comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate three techniques a statistical model namely multiple linear regression mlr and two state of art machine learning techniques namely deep neural network dnn and extreme gradient boosting egb for modeling the spatial variation of groundwater salinity 2 overview of the study area the study area is the coastal plain of the mazandaran province in the north of iran located between the southern seashore of the caspian sea and alborz mountains the plain is extending from 50 34 e to 54 10 e and 35 47 n to 37 n fig 1 the area of the plain is about 10 000 km2 with minimal variations in slope and topography precipitation in the study area varies from 600 mm in the eastern parts to 1400 mm in the west and rainfall is the predominant type of precipitation tehrani et al 2019 the main types of land use in the study area are agricultural lands rice farms and citrus gardens residential areas rangelands forestlands and water bodies the mazandaran coastal plain consists of alluvial sediments of the quaternary period with several perennial rivers flowing through them the primary aquifer system in the mazandaran plain is the coastal aquifer with a shallow water table gholami et al 2015 there is also a fossil brine aquifer in the northeastern part of the study area that formed from the retreat of the caspian sea in the late holocene causing soil and water salinity in the adjacent areas in the south of the study area alborz mountains the groundwater is found in karst aquifers which is not the primary focus of this study the piezometric wells used for this study were installed in an unconfined aquifer and have depths between 20 and 40 m in recent decades overexploitation of groundwater construction of dams development of tourism and expansion of rice farms have reduced groundwater resources causing an increase in groundwater and soil salinity the area is heavily dependent on the groundwater resources for its extensive farmlands and its densely populated residential areas therefore it is crucial to assess the spatial variation of salinity and its controlling factors in this region 3 materials and methods a three fold exercise was conducted to model the groundwater salinity ec in the southern coastal aquifer of the caspian sea variables affecting groundwater salinity were identified and the dataset was randomly divided into three subsets of training testing and verifying the training set was used for training the models the testing set for performance evaluation of the model and the verification set for verifying the generated map step i the relationship between groundwater salinity and its controlling factors was established using statistical and machine learning methods and the performance of each model was evaluated using statistical criteria step ii using the optimum methodology and available inputs the spatial variation of the groundwater salinity was estimated for the entire study area step iii the details of the data and the adopted methodology is described below 3 1 data in this section the inputs and output of the modeling process will be explained the inputs are factors affecting groundwater salinity including aquifer transmissivity distance from the sea the mean annual precipitation the mean annual evaporation topography elevation and slope and water table the selection of the input variables was based on factors that were reported in previous studies as well as the characteristics of the study area the output or target variable is ec which shows the salinity in groundwater samples the data were collected for 140 piezometric wells as mentioned earlier the dataset was randomly divided into training 75 of the total data testing 25 of the total data the former was used to establish the relationships between inputs and ec and the letter for performance evaluation of the models additional 22 verification wells were used for verifying the final map total number of observations 162 3 1 1 electrical conductivity ec the measure of ec can determine the salinity in water samples salinity can include many different ions however relatively few makeups most of the dissolved salts and minerals in the water the most common are chloride sodium calcium magnesium bicarbonate and sulfate the ec was measured from the water samples of the piezometric wells the ec in this study is the average values of monthly measurements from the year 2015 to 2019 and was reported in micro siemens per centimeter μs cm no significant trend was detected in the recorded data the monthly ec sampling and measurements from the piezometric wells of the study area were conducted by mazandaran regional water company mrwc 3 1 2 transmissivity t the transmissivity in an aquifer is a measure of how much water can be transmitted horizontally through whole saturated thickness and unit width of an aquifer bear 1979 salinity was reported to be highly sensitive to transmissivity wei et al 1990 salinity is expected to be lower in the areas with higher transmissivity because the groundwater in the study area flows from the land to the caspian sea therefore more low salinity freshwater is transmitted to those areas transmissivity t k h is a crucial transmission property of an aquifer which is different from hydraulic conductivity k in that it includes the whole saturation thickness h of the aquifer while k is defined for unit saturation thickness only transmissivity for each well was measured through the pumping test conducted by mrwc the reported transmissivity values were ranged from 75 to 3000 m2 day fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the transmissivity in the mazandaran coastal aquifer 3 1 3 distance from the sea ds distance from the caspian sea ds is another parameter that was used as an input for the modeling process the caspian sea is the largest inland water body in the world the reported average salinity of the caspian sea was 1 2 12 g l tuzhilkin and kosarev 2005 choosing ds as one of the input variables was based on the possible interaction between groundwater and seawater for the areas closer to the caspian sea the salinity expected to be higher for the closer wells to the sea due to possible seawater intrusion to the coastal aquifers the distance from the sea was measured from the digital layer of the location of the wells in gis the distance of the wells from the sea was ranging from 200 m to 32063 m 3 1 4 the depth to the water table dwt the mean annual groundwater level for each well was calculated from the monthly time series data and was used as one of the input variables the values were reported as the depth to the water table dwt the dwt in the recorded wells training wells varies from 0 37 to 40 m average 7 85 m the selection of dwt as one of the variables was because in the areas with shallow water table evaporation increases due to high water content of the saturated zone and capillary force therefore higher salinity was expected in the shallower water table geng and boufadel 2017 the factors controlling water table variations in the study area are recharge through precipitation evaporation from the saturated zone and groundwater withdrawal for agricultural industrial and residential sectors the spatial variation of the dwt was presented in fig 2 3 1 5 mean annual precipitation precipitation determines the inflow rate and it affects the groundwater system by recharging the aquifers and decreasing the salinity by diluting the groundwater precipitation causes infiltration of freshwater into the aquifer and alters saline waters in subsurface regions of coastal aquifers geng and boufadel 2017 the dominant type of precipitation in the study area occurs as rainfall the mean annual precipitation in each recorded site was selected as one of the input variables in the modeling process the mean annual precipitation over the study area was ranging between 600 and 1400 mm average 922 mm the data was obtained from mrwc and the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation was estimated by kriging of the station based observation data in gis fig 2 3 1 6 mean annual evaporation evaporation is a fundamental component of subsurface flow and dissolved particles fujimaki et al 2006 in the coastal aquifers with shallow water tables such as the northern parts of the study area the saturated zone has high water content due to capillary forces which facilitates the evaporation of water from pores the exposure of freshwater to evaporation increases the salinity aquifers geng and boufadel 2017 therefore it is crucial to incorporate evaporation as one of the input variables in the modeling process the data was provided by mrwc from the meteorological stations and the map was generated using the kriging technique in gis the average annual evaporation was ranging between 875 and 1000 mm fig 2 3 1 7 topography the relationship between groundwater salinity and topography was previously investigated in some case studies elmahdy and mohamed 2012 nosetto et al 2013 nosetto et al 2013 showed land use and topography are two crucial controlling factors contributing to 82 and 66 of the spatial variability of groundwater salinity the relationship between topography and groundwater accumulation is complicated water tables are often assumed as subdued replicas of topography hubbert 1940 toth 1963 recent studies showed that groundwater fluxes are mostly managed by topographic gradients rather than gradients in pressure head in humid regions with modest slopes condon and maxwell 2015 the elevation and slope were derived from a high resolution digital elevation model dem in gis the elevation in the study area varies from 27 to 650 m from the mean sea level fig 2 the mean slope of the mazandaran plain is less than five percent 3 2 modeling the groundwater salinity a multiple linear regression mlr and two machine learning methods namely extreme gradient boosting egb deep neural network dnn were used and tested to identify the relationship between the ec and its controlling factors transmissivity distance from the sea precipitation evaporation topography and water table a stepwise method was used to identify the significant input variables by adding and removing individual variables to reach the maximum fit on the testing subset the optimal structure of the models was determined using a trial error procedure and by performance evaluation of the models on the testing subset each method was tested by comparing the predicted ec values to the measured values in the testing subset using three statistical coefficients the data in the testing subset was not used in the modeling process therefore the statistical coefficients represent the actual performance of the adopted models by applying the optimum model on a set of known input variables the values of ec were estimated for the entire study area below is the detailed description of each model 3 2 1 extreme gradient boosting egb extreme gradient boosting egb with decision trees is a predictive modeling procedure in machine learning that was used to model ec from its controlling factors the learning process in the decision tree algorithm is based on a tree like model that goes from observations of input variables branches of the tree to the prediction of the target variable leaves of the tree the goal of this study was to create a model to predict the ec values from a set of input variables controlling factors using trees has several advantages including not limited to handling different types of target variables e g numerical categorical and multivariate ability to model complex interactions and managing missing data with minimum loss of information however there are two principal restrictions with tree based learning algorithms weakness of prediction and problems with the analysis of large trees in order to address the shortcomings mentioned above the gradient boosting algorithm was first proposed by breiman et al 1984 and further developed by others mason 2000 chen and guestrin 2016 in gradient boosting the goal is to use a set of predictors x 1 x n to predict a set of output values y 1 y n by using a model f x y and minimizing the sum of loss function j i 1 n l y i f x i by improving the model f x here the loss function is l x y x y 2 the model improvement algorithm is performed by first calculating the negative gradients of j with respect to f xi j f x i then a regression tree h was fit to negative gradients j f x i finally the new f xi will be f xi γh where γ is the step size in our algorithm to reach the estimated minimum of j and this iteration should be repeated until the desired accuracy is reached as a significant improvement over gradient boosting in the egb the process begins with a loss function l y i f x i h and minimize j i 1 n l y i f x i ω h where ω h γ t 1 2 λ w 2 here t is the number of leaves in the tree and w is the leaf weights the xgboost package written in r programming language was used for implementing the egb model fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of the gradient boosting method 3 2 2 deep neural network dnn the dnn method establishes empirical often nonlinear relationships between the set of independent input variables and corresponding dependent output variables a dnn is based on a series of connected neurons that are intended to replicate the functions of neurons in animal or human brains they pass information between each another a structure that enables dnns to be trained and learn hu et al 2018 compared to artificial neural networks anns which comprised of three layers of input hidden layer and output the deep neural network uses multiple hidden layers for feature transformation the adopted dnn method in this study is known as a multilayer perceptron mlp an mlp consists of units called a perceptron perceptrons have one or more inputs an activation function and an output an mlp model is built up by combining perceptrons in structured layers the perceptrons in a given layer are independent of one another but each connects to all other perceptrons in the following layer each layer is composed of a set of neurons and is trained with a backpropagation algorithm the backpropagation is one of the most extensively used algorithms for supervised training of multilayered neural networks hu et al 2018 backpropagation works by approximating the nonlinear relationship between the input and the output by altering the weight values internally the processes of the backpropagation can be divided into two stages of feedforward and backpropagation in the feedforward step a pattern is applied to the input layer and its effect propagates layer by layer through the network until the output is generated the network s sample of output value is then compared to the observed value and an error signal is estimated for each of the output neurons since all neurons within the hidden layer contributed to the signal errors in the output layer the output errors are transmitted backward from the output layer to each neuron within the hidden layer that contributed to the output layer this process is reiterated layer by layer until each neuron in the network has received an error signal that represents its relative contribution to the total error once the error signal for each neuron has been computed the errors are then applied by the neuron to adjust the values for each connection weights the goal is to minimize the value of the error function in weight space the weights with minimum error functions are then considered to be a solution to the learning problem in a dnn hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins and it controls the model structure e g number of layers number of hidden layers and number of epochs the output of a neuron in the hidden layer is obtained from the following equation 1 h j f i 1 n w j i x i b i where w j i and b i are the weights and biases of the hidden layer neurons and f is a nonlinear activation function also the network output is calculated by 2 y f j 1 m w k j h i b 0 where w k j and b 0 are the weights and biases of the output layer neuron and f is the output layer neuron activation function additional information about the theory behind dnn applications can be found in aggarwal 2018 the dnn model was created using the neuralnet package written in the r programming language fritsch et al 2019 as mentioned before a trial error method was applied to define the optimal structure of each model in the dnn model the number of hyperparameters was determined as the numbers were added gradually until the predicted and observed values start to match the evaluation in the model was carried out using the mean squared error mse performance function in this study the dnn consists of one input layer two hidden layers and one output layer the two hidden layers were made of 8 hidden neurons 5 neurons for the first hidden layer and 3 neurons for the second fig 4 the number of epochs is a hyperparameter that represents the number of complete passes through the training dataset the optimal number of epoch in this study was 135 3 2 3 multiple linear regression mlr the mlr or multiple linear regression model derives patterns in the data and establishes the best fitting linear relationships between two or more dependent variables and the target ec as described earlier a stepwise approach was used in which the selection of variables is carried out by addition to or subtraction from a set of input variables using pre specified coefficients such as the f test the t test and the coefficient of determination in an mlr model every value of the input variable x is associated with a value of the target variable y the regression line for n input variables x1 x2 xn can be explained as follows 3 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b n x n where y is the predicted value of the target variable dependent b0 is the value of y when the values of all input variables are equal to zero x1 xn are input independent variables and b1 through bn are the calculated regression coefficients alshehri et al 2020 sahour et al 2020 in a multiple linear regression model the target variable y ec in this study is assumed to be linearly related to a set of n predictors explanatory input variables x1 x2 xn and the input variables are not highly correlated with each other multicollinearity a condition in which two or more input variables are highly correlated with one another in the mlr model was addressed using the variance inflation factor vif multicollinearity makes it challenging to determine the effect of the individual predictors on the target variable and to identify the variables that should be included in the final model vif is one of the most widely used diagnostic indices for multicollinearity it determines how much the variance of a coefficient is inflated because of linear dependences with other input variables alin 2010 observations were selected independently and randomly from the dataset additionally residuals expected to be normally distributed with a mean value of zero the parameters are trained in such a way to achieve the highest agreement between the predicted and observed values in the training subset the ideal situation is a model in which a data point lies perfectly on the fitted regression line 3 3 performance evaluation of the models the performance evaluation of the adopted models was carried out by a comparison between the predicted values and observed values on the testing subset using statistical coefficients namely r squared normalized root mean squared deviation nrmsd and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as follows 3 rmsd i 1 n y o å p 2 n 4 nrmsd rmsd y oi 5 nse 1 i 1 n å p y o 2 i 1 n y o y oi 2 where y o is the observed ec value y p is the predicted ec value n is the number of observations and y oi is the mean of the observed ec values the strength of the relationship between input variables and target ec was analyzed using feature importance fi the measure of feature importance is based on how many times a given model selects a variable for splitting and how much it is improved because of the splitting friedman and meulman 2003 relative fi was calculated for each input variable and converted to a 0 to 1 scale 3 4 mapping the groundwater salinity the input variables are available for the entire study area in continuous raster formats but the ec is only available for the selected piezometric wells the optimum model for establishing the relationships between ec and input variables was identified in the previous step for generating the final map the optimum model was applied to the set of input variables and the values of ec were estimated across the entire mazandaran plain the generated ec layer in a raster format was entered into gis for the visualization and classification of area based on their salinity rates 4 results the measured ec from groundwater samples was ranging from 65 to 6400 μs cm average 1300 μs cm the performance of the three methods in the training stage was given in table 1 according to the statistical criteria r squared nse and nrmsd the egb performed better nse 0 99 nrmsd 0 01 r squared 0 99 compared to the other methods in the training stage table 1 the dnn was the second best method and the performance of the mlr method was the least among the three methods in the training stage table 1 fig 5 shows the comparison between the predicted and the recorded observed ec in the training and testing stage each model mlr egb and dnn was applied to the testing subset to compare the predicted ec with the observed values the performance evaluation of each method on the test subset was also presented in table 1 the results showed the egb method yielded the most favorable results on the testing subset given its highest r squared and nse values and the lowest nrmsd value among the three methods nse 0 87 nrmsd 0 45 r squared 0 89 table 1 the performance of the dnn was better than that of mlr however both the dnn nse 0 42 nrmsd 0 89 r squared 0 61 and mlr nse 0 09 nrmsd 0 98 r squared 0 48 showed a weak performance in the testing stage the feature importance fi analysis corroborated that aquifer transmissivity is the most influential variable in groundwater salinity of the coastal aquifers of the caspian sea with the relative contribution of 0 73 fig 6 precipitation is the second important variable with 0 18 of relative contribution in modeling ec the water table and distance from the sea are two other significant factors the least relative contribution was associated with the elevation evaporation and slope were removed from the set of final variables in the stepwise procedure in fact ignoring the evaporation and slope in the models particularly mlr it would not result in lower accuracy since the loss value would be minimal in tree nodes for egb and hidden layers for dnn the partial dependence plot pdp shows the marginal effect that features independent variables have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model fig 7 a partial dependence plot can show whether the relationship between the target and a feature is linear monotonic or more complex fig 7 indicates that in the egb model ec has a nonlinear relationship with the five independent variables presented in the model for transmissivity m2 day there is an entirely inverse relationship between the aquifer transmissivity and ec as transmissivity increases from 0 to 2000 m2 day the ec decreases harmonically roughly from 2500 to 1000 μs cm one plausible explanation could be related to the coarser grain size in formations with higher transmissivity that allow groundwater to move faster and dilute the aquifer with low salinity recharge there is a reciprocal relationship between ec and precipitation due to the lower salinity of rainwater so that as precipitation increases from 650 to 1400 mm the ec values decrease from 1850 to 1000 μs cm however for low precipitation areas 650 mm fig 7 ec increases with precipitation indicates that other controlling factors could offset the impacts of precipitation in those areas similar to transmissivity there is an almost everywhere inverse dependency between ec and water level in a sense that when depth to the water table increases from 0 to 15 m the ec values decrease from 1650 to 1200 μs cm and stays almost constant for water levels more than 15 m the aquifer is shallower near the sea therefore the interaction between groundwater and seawater is higher causing higher salinity for the areas with the shallower water table in the study area for elevation m with an increase from 27 to 20 m the ec decreases from 15 000 to 12 500 μs cm and after a 400 μs cm increase the ec value remains almost constant for elevations higher than 70 m the distance from the sea seems to have the most nonlinear relationship with ec where ec increases from 1250 to 1550 μs cm as distance increases from 4000 to 9500 m then after a drawdown on ec values to 1400 μs cm followed by a jump to 1450 μs cm the value of ec stays almost constant for all distances larger than 20000 m it reveals that to some extent other controlling factors such as transmissivity could offset the impact of the distance from the sea in the salination of groundwater using the optimum methodology the egb model the groundwater salinity for the entire area was estimated the fitted egb model was applied to a set of known input variables in continuous raster formats to assess the groundwater salinity ec for the entire study area the spatial distribution of the groundwater salinity was presented in fig 8 the final map was verified through a comparison between ec values of the 22 verification wells and the estimated values on the map fig 8 the verification wells were plotted on the generated map to compare the values from the verification wells with their estimated ec values on the map the calculated r squared nse and nrmsd for the final map were 0 82 0 81 and 0 42 respectively the verification wells and their predicted values were shown in fig 8 the hydrological setting of an aquifer plays an essential role in groundwater salinity various factors contribute to the spatial variation of ec the spatial distribution of ec and transmissivity shows that ec has an inverse relationship with transmissivity in general the formations with coarser grain size have higher transmissivity and therefore the salinity tends to be lower and vice versa the analysis of the ec and dwt shows that groundwater salinity has an inverse relationship with dwt it means that in the area with a higher groundwater level shallower groundwater the salinity is also higher compared to the area with a deeper groundwater level the evaporation and slope were not among the significant variables one explanation could be the high humidity of the study area and the low variations of evaporation 5 discussion the estimated values of ec in the final map was ranging from 50 to 7000 μs cm average 1299 μs cm the low ec areas in the western parts of the study area are associated with the area of high transmissivity high precipitation and groundwater recharge as well as more perennial rivers and less groundwater withdrawal for the agricultural lands since the transmissivity is the most important variables affecting the groundwater salinity the estimated ec values for the areas located in the same class of transmissivity are close together however the ec values could be higher or lower by the effects of precipitation as the second important variable and other variables for example in the northeastern parts where the highest ec values were estimated fig 8 both the transmissivity and precipitation values are at their lowest in the study area fig 2 the west east increasing pattern of the groundwater salinity is correlated with the decreasing values of annual precipitation that shows the role of precipitation in groundwater recharge one explanation could be diluting groundwater with low salinity precipitation in the recharge areas of the coastal aquifers that mostly occur in the western parts rather than the east the area of high salinity on the map is also consistent with the results of sensitivity analysis through feature importance fig 6 as it shows the aquifer transmissivity precipitation water table the distance from the sea and and elevation respectively are the most significant factors in groundwater salinity of the study area moreover the northern section of the mazandaran plain is also associated with the areas of low elevation the low elevation area was reported to be associated with the areas of shallow groundwater alshehri et al 2020 however the major parameters in higher groundwater salinity of the eastern mazandaran plain compared to the west are found to be the lower recharge rate lower precipitation and fewer perennial rivers and more extensive agricultural area and groundwater extraction the final map also revealed that the ground salinity of the area closer to the sea is higher due to three reasons first seawater intrusion and the mobility of the seawater groundwater interface due to water table dropdown second the presence of the fossil aquifer in the northwest section of the mazandaran plain and third the presence of the shallow groundwater and fine grained soil texture with inadequate drainage capabilities gholami et al 2010 the structure and characteristics of the data are an essential factor in adopting a specific methodology in machine learning the deep learning method is suitable for large datasets mao et al 2006 and the learning performance may not be accurate in small datasets as it was the case in our study dnn requires more training data than other machine learning or statistical models such as mlr and egb moreover the black box nature of the dnn model makes it complicated for further interpretations about the importance of the individual predictors e g transmissivity precipitation water table in the modeling process a problem that is not the case with mlr and egb the advantage of the mlr model was the ability to identify the contribution of the variables to predict the values of ec however given the weakness of the predictions it was no used for mapping the groundwater salinity since our dataset was not very large 162 observations machine learning algorithms especially egb are superior in performance indeed the structure of egb makes it more suitable for training a smaller subset of data also computational considerations and experimental cycle times convinced us to prefer egb on our work egb gave superior accuracy in our study however deep learning may outperform egb or any other machine learning algorithm when it is applied on a big dataset the performance evaluation of the models in the training and testing stages showed the high performance of the adopted methodology egb in groundwater salinity modeling especially in the prediction of the minimum and maximum values this is an applicable ability in the egb model since the maximum errors usually occur in the prediction of high and low values the accurate prediction of the extreme values is crucial in mapping the areas of high salinity because it shows the critical zones for groundwater treatment operations the comparison between the values on the verification wells and their associated estimated values showed that the final map accurately classified the different ranges of groundwater salinity including drinkable water ec 1500 μs cm brackish water 1500 ec 3000 μs cm and saline water ec greater than 3000 μs cm the zoning map of the salinity is also useful for proper management of groundwater resources for agricultural products with respect to the types of cultivation 6 conclusion assessment of the spatial variation of groundwater salinity is crucial for any water resources management practices however it is challenging to conduct groundwater sampling for all monitoring wells in a vast region moreover measurements of groundwater salinity in a regional scale require an extensive network of monitoring wells which is costly time consuming and is not applicable for many parts of the world in this study a methodology was proposed based on accurate measurements of ec from water samples in a portion of the study area and the use of machine learning techniques to estimate the ec for the rest of the study area factors controlling groundwater salinity were identified and quantified through field measurements hydroclimate data and processing a high resolution dem in gis the relationships between ec and the controlling factors were established using three machine learning approaches and the performance of each model was assessed by statistical criteria nse nrmsd and r squared the egb performed better and was selected as the optimum model the optimum model was used to estimate the groundwater salinity for the area of unknown ec values the results showed that the combination of field sampling and machine learning techniques is useful for modeling and mapping groundwater salinity the performance of machine learning techniques enhances significantly in a larger dataset sakr et al 2017 to avoid problems related to small datasets and to assess the real predictability power of the models the evaluation was performed on an out of sample testing subset that was not used for training the models the evaluation of the models in training testing and verification subsets showed high performance of the adopted methodology in groundwater salinity modeling especially for extremely high values therefore adopting the same methodology could be useful for modeling and mapping groundwater salinity or any other water quality parameters in similar settings elsewhere declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we would like to express our

5061,in the real time operation of a flood control system identifying effective reservoirs accurately and adaptively is the premise of establishing a multi reservoir real time flood control hybrid operation mrfcho model the existing effective reservoir intelligent reasoning erir method is based on the inference rules which causes the identification results to be greatly influenced by the training samples this paper establishes a random forest classification rfc model for identifying effective reservoirs to solve this problem the performance of the rfc model is evaluated in terms of model stability and model accuracy and compared with the erir model and other machine learning ml models first different flood samples are used to establish the models to verify the model stability then the expected total cost under cross validation is taken as the index to evaluate the classification accuracy finally the average increase of expected total cost with cross validation is proposed to evaluate the criteria importance and analyze the sensitive factors that affect the classification accuracy of the rfc model the proposed method is applied to a multi reservoir system in the huaihe river basin in china the results indicate that the rfc model has the characteristic of high classification accuracy low sensitivity to flood samples and high stability it displays more dominance in the dynamic identification of effective reservoirs compared to other models keywords multi reservoir system flood control operation effective reservoir identification classification algorithm random forest 1 introduction joint operation of multi reservoir systems is the main form of surface water resources allocation and plays a pivotal role in flood control seibert et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 labadie 2004 he et al 2019 the flood control operation of multi reservoir systems emphasizes real time and efficiency in real time flood control operation the flood control situation changes in space and time which leads to the change of flood control capacity and flood control effect of reservoirs the reservoir with a significant flood control effect is defined as effective reservoir on the contrary the reservoir with no significant flood control effect is defined as noneffective reservoir li et al 2019 established a multi reservoir real time flood control hybrid operation mrfcho model to improve flood control operation efficiency and alleviate the curse of dimensionality in the mrfcho model the effective reservoirs are operated jointly and the noneffective reservoir are operated separately therefore identifying effective reservoirs according to the real time information of rainfall flood and reservoir conditions accurately is the key step to establish the mrfcho model an effective reservoir intelligent reasoning erir method has been proposed to identify effective reservoirs li et al 2019 in this method a criteria system for identifying effective reservoirs was proposed and the criteria thresholds were determined according to the effective reservoirs in historical floods then the inference rules were determined by criteria thresholds for identifying effective reservoirs in real time flood operation the erir model can identify all effective reservoirs with high accuracy while the criteria thresholds are determined by a subset of effective reservoirs in historical flood samples as time goes by flood samples increase gradually so criteria thresholds should be checked and adjusted to update the rule base it leads to the uncertainty of effective reservoir identification results and further cause the uncertainty in operation schemes therefore avoiding the uncertainty caused by criteria thresholds plays an important role in multi reservoir flood control operation xu et al 2019 chen et al 2019 identifying effective reservoirs from the multi reservoir system is a typical classification problem using the machine learning ml method and extracting rules from assessment samples directly can overcome defects of the erir model ml is the main technology to realize artificial intelligence it provides a new way to solve complex hydrology problems by establishing data driven models chen et al 2020 lin et al 2019a b allawi et al 2018 see et al 2007 the application of ml algorithms in the field of reservoir operation is mainly concentrated in reservoir inflow forecasting and deriving operation rules for establishing a reservoir simulation model reservoir inflow is one of the main uncertainty factors of reservoir operation many scholars have applied the ml methods to rainfall runoff forecasting to improve forecasting accuracy various neural networks nn qi et al 2019 lin and wu 2011 support vector machine svm noori et al 2011 li et al 2010 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis dehghani et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 bae et al 2007 deep learning dl luo et al 2020 bai et al 2016 and hybrid models kumar et al 2015 toro et al 2013 are used for runoff forecasting in different time scales besides many ml algorithms have been applied to driving operation rules and establishing a data driven reservoir simulation model nn yang et al 2019 dariane and karami 2014 cancelliere et al 2002 decision tree dt wei and hsu 2008 cheng et al 2008 svm niu et al 2019 aboutalebi et al 2015 anfis hsu et al 2015 mousavi et al 2007 are more commonly used besides extreme learning machines niu et al 2019 gaussian process regression jia et al 2019 dl liu et al 2019 and other methods are also applied optimization algorithms are often adopted to obtain training samples for ml methods or combined with ml methods to develop optimum operating rules relevant studies show that these ml algorithms perform well in deriving operation rules ml methods have been widely used in the field of reservoir operation since effective reservoir is a new concept proposed to improve the efficiency of real time flood control of multi reservoirs no research has applied ml methods to identify effective reservoirs the ml method mainly consists of supervised learning unsupervised learning and semi supervised learning kotsiantis et al 2006 zhou et al 2017 identifying effective reservoirs belongs to the supervised classification the effective and noneffective reservoir attribute set in historical floods is used to train the classification model for identifying effective reservoirs in the real time flood control operation the supervised classification algorithm includes logistic regression lr dt nn svm k nearest neighbor knn bayes classifier dl and ensemble learning kotsiantis et al 2006 chen 2011 raghavendra and deka 2014 fytilis and rizzo 2013 ragettli et al 2017 ensemble learning is a multi classifier system that combines multiple classifiers and integrates prediction results with some combination strategy to obtain the final decision result gomes et al 2017 compared with a single classifier this method has significantly superior generalization ability and is often applied to small sample learning problems random forest is the most representative classification algorithm in ensemble learning which consisting of a collection of decision tree classifiers breiman 2001 this method not only has a strong classifying ability but also avoids overfitting problems because of the random selection of input samples and attributes in the identification of effective reservoirs the training samples are limited so this paper studies the intelligent identification of effect reservoirs based on the random forest algorithm this paper develops an effective reservoir identification model based on the random forest classification rfc method to avoid the uncertainty caused by criteria thresholds in the erir model the performance of the rfc model in effective reservoir identification is comprehensively evaluated from the aspect of model stability and model accuracy the stability of the rfc model erir model and other ml models are analyzed and compared by increasing the number of training flood samples the expected total cost with cross validation is employed to compare the accuracy of the rfc model and other ml models besides the average increase of expected total cost with cross validation is put forward to investigate the influence of criteria on the classification accuracy of the rfc model the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the proposed methodology section 3 and section 4 present a case study and discussion of the results respectively finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 methodology in this paper the rfc model is established for identifying effective reservoirs in real time flood control operation the stability of the rfc model is evaluated by changing the training samples l1 and it is compared with that of the erir model and other ml models then the accuracy of the rfc model and other ml models is evaluated via the expected total cost with cross validation finally the average increase of expected total cost with cross validation is proposed for assessing the criteria importance of the rfc model the framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 input conditions determining the input criteria and samples is the basis of establishing a classification model this section introduces the input conditions in detail 2 1 1 criteria system for identifying effective reservoirs li et al 2019 proposed a criteria system for identifying effective reservoirs based on the principles of independence and comprehensiveness it includes seven criteria denoted as c 1 forecasted runoff depth in reservoir region c 2 ratio of forecasted lateral inflow c 3 real time reservoir flood control pressure c 4 contribution ratio to flood volume in the flood peak stage c 5 contribution ratio to flood peak c 6 flood peak encounter degree at the point c 7 flood peak encounter degree between reservoirs in this system c 3 is a negative criterion and the others are positive criteria the criteria system displayed satisfactory results in effective reservoir identification therefore it is employed as the condition attributes of the classification models the definition of these criteria is shown in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 1 2 generation of the sample set assuming that the flood control system consists of m reservoirs and n criteria are used to evaluate whether the reservoir is an effective reservoir selecting l historical floods among which l1 floods are used for model training and l2 floods are used for verification the condition attributes of reservoirs namely the criteria values of reservoirs in each historical flood are calculated based on the formulas in table s1 in the supplementary material the real decision attribute of reservoirs namely the effective reservoir or noneffective reservoir in each historical flood is determined by the reservoir successively eliminated rse method li et al 2019 for each flood the rse method is implemented by the following steps 1 implement joint operation of all reservoirs and obtain the peak flow at the downstream control point which is denoted as q m 2 implement separate operation of the ith reservoir and joint operation of the other reservoirs obtain the peak flow at the downstream control point q m i 3 if q m i q m q m ε the ith reservoir has little influence on the flood control effect and is considered as a noneffective reservoir otherwise the ith reservoir is an effective reservoir where ε is a customizable threshold 4 repeat step 2 and 3 to determine the attribute of each reservoir in a flood 2 2 description of the erir model the essence of the erir model is to determine the inference rules according to criteria thresholds and the inference rules are adopted to identify effective reservoirs in real time operation following are the main steps 1 calculate the criteria values of effective reservoirs in l1 historical floods for the positive criteria take the minimum value as the threshold for the negative criteria take the maximum value as the threshold 2 generate inference rules based on the criteria thresholds which are expressed as if c j satisfies the threshold then the reservoir is an effective reservoir if c j doesn t satisfy the threshold then the reservoir is a noneffective reservoir where c j is the jth criterion j 1 n 3 in real time flood control operation calculate the criteria values of each reservoir and then judge the decision attribute of reservoirs according to the inference rules 2 3 establishment of the rfc model in the rfc algorithm each tree is generated based on the random selection of training set and the random selection of attributes then the final classification result is determined by the voting method breiman 2001 local optimization and overfitting issues caused by single classifier can be effectively overcome liu et al 2008 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the principle of training phase and decision phase of the rfc model is shown in fig 2 each step is described in the following subsections 2 3 1 the decision tree based on cart algorithm cart algorithm also known as classification and regression tree is a binary decision tree that deals with classification or regression problems kotsiantis 2013 gupta et al 2017 this paper builds a single classifier based on the cart algorithm gini impurity is a splitting criterion that represents the expected error rate the best cut at each node is selected by minimizing gini impurity pal 2005 kotsiantis 2013 jeung et al 2019 l1 historical floods are used to train the rfc model assuming that there are s samples in the training set s c d so s m l 1 where c is the condition attribute of the sample that is the criteria for identifying effective reservoirs d is the decision attribute that is whether the reservoir is effective or noneffective since the reservoir should be identified as effective reservoir denoted as 1 or noneffective reservoir denoted as 0 the decision attribute is divided into two classes denoted as d u u 0 1 criterion c j divides training set s into effective reservoir subset and noneffective reservoir subset there are s g samples in the subset s g g 0 1 the gini impurity of subset s g is defined as 1 gini s g 1 u 0 1 p ug 2 where p ug is the probability of class d u in subset s g the smaller the gini impurity is the higher the purity of the subset is and the greater the information gain is if all samples in the subset s g belong to the same class the value of gini impurity is taken as the minimum value of zero the gini impurity of training set s is defined as 2 gin i split s s 0 s g i n i s 0 s 1 s g i n i s 1 when the cart algorithm is used for node splitting the gini impurity of each criterion should be calculated and the minimum gini impurity is selected for splitting then the decision tree is constructed recursively to generate classification rules 2 3 2 generation of the training subset for each decision tree in the rfc model each decision tree has a corresponding training subset if there are z decision trees it is necessary to select z training subsets randomly from the original training set bagging bootstrap aggregating method a sampling method with replacement is used for sampling in the rfc model breiman 1996 sampling in the initial training set s to generate a series of training subset s the steps are as follows 1 selecting a sample from s randomly and put it in s 2 putting the sample back into s so that the sample may still be selected at the next sampling 3 repeat step 1 to 2 r times to get a subset s containing r samples s is a training set for a decision tree 4 repeat step 1 to 3 z times to get z subsets s for each decision tree which are denoted as s 1 s 2 s z 2 3 3 establishment of each decision tree and the random forest based on the random selection of the training set generating the condition attribute subset randomly for each decision tree is the next step the condition attributes in the subset are called random features the random features usually formed by random selection from the original condition attributes forest ri and random linear combinations of condition attributes forest rc breiman 2001 forest ri is used in this paper in the forest ri method z subsets of condition attributes are first selected randomly from the original condition attribute set which is denoted as c 1 c 2 c z the number of attributes in each subset is a for a decision tree each node is split according to a subset of condition attributes grow the decision tree using the cart method to maximum size and don t prune in the classification problem let a n a is an insensitive parameter that does not need to be adjusted the decision tree is expressed as 3 h x θ e where h x θ e is the eth decision tree x is input variables θ e is independent and identically distributed random variables which represents the set of parameters used in the decision tree a random forest containing z decision trees is established by the above two random selection processes which is denoted as h 1 x h 2 x h z x 2 3 4 decision phase of the rfc model l2 historical floods are used for model validation assuming that there are s samples in the training set s so s m l 2 in the rfc model the class of a reservoir is first classified by each decision tree which is denoted as y 1 y 2 y z then the results of each decision tree are combined by a kind of combination strategy to obtain the final classification result the most commonly used combination strategy is the voting method this method gets the final classification result via a majority vote among a series of classification results at the same time the probability that λ th sample belongs to class d u is obtained by the rfc model denoted as p λ u 2 4 evaluation of the classification accuracy in the effective reservoir identification different types of errors will cause varying degrees of consequence if the noneffective reservoir is misclassified as an effective reservoir it only increases the multi reservoir operation complexity this type of error is called type i error if the effective reservoir is misclassified as the noneffective reservoir the flood control effect will reduce dramatically and flood disaster even occurs at the downstream this type of error is called type ii error obviously the cost of type ii error is much greater than that of type i error for this reason type ii error is not allowed in effective reservoir identification the general evaluation indicators of classification accuracy such as roc curve auc value and kappa coefficient only take the least number of misjudgments as standard these indicators don t consider different costs caused by the two types of errors the expected total cost can measure varying degrees of costs caused by the two types of errors and assign unequal cost to errors drummond and holte 2006 therefore the expected total cost is used to evaluate the classification accuracy of effective reservoir identification models 2 4 1 expected total cost for the binary classification problem one class is usually defined as positive class and the other is negative class let the effective reservoir be positive class denoted as 1 and noneffective reservoir be negative class denoted as 0 let cost α β represent the cost that the sample of class α is misclassified as β the cost of the right classification is zero and that means cost 11 0 cost 00 0 the cost matrix is expressed in table 1 in the verification stage the reservoirs are classified for the l2 floods counting the number of reservoir samples of each class and the confusion matrix can be obtained which is shown in table 2 let pr h α represent the prior probability of an example being from class α and pr h β h α represent the conditional probability that an example being from class α is misclassified as β suppose that the probability of positive class is pr h 1 p and the probability of negative class is pr h 0 1 p the normalized probability cost of the positive class is expressed as 4 p cost cost 10 p cost 10 p cost 01 1 p the true positive rate is defined as 5 pr h 1 h 1 t p r tp tp f n the false positive rate is defined as 6 pr h 1 h 0 f p r fp fp t n the true negative rate is defined as 7 pr h 0 h 0 t n r tn fp t n the false negative rate is defined as 8 pr h 0 h 1 f n r fn tp f n the expected cost of the classifier is defined as 9 e cost α 0 1 β 0 1 cost α β pr h β h α pr h α according to conditions cost 11 0 cost 00 0 and eqs 5 9 can be simplified and normalized to 10 e cost norm cost 10 f n r p cost 01 f p r 1 p cost 10 p cost 01 1 p fig 3 is the diagram of the cost curve and expected total cost in fig 3 the horizontal axis is p c o s t and the vertical axis is the e c o s t norm if p 0 the corresponding point is 0 f p r if p 1 the corresponding point is 1 f n r when the value of p changes the corresponding point is on the line segment joining 0 f p r and 1 f n r which is called the cost line according to the classification results obtained by the classification model with different thresholds a series of cost lines can be obtained the lower envelope of several cost lines is the cost curve the steps to get a cost curve are as follows 1 calculating the probability that each sample belongs to positive class denoted as p λ 1 p λ 1 is sorted from large to small and it is used as a threshold in turn which denoted as θ η θ η means the probability that the η th sample belongs to positive class after sorting 2 the reservoirs are classified according to θ η if p λ 1 θ η the λ th sample belongs to positive class otherwise it belongs to negative class after all of the reservoirs are classified fpr and fnr are calculated to obtain a set of 0 f p r and 1 f n r coordinates and a cost line is obtained by jointing them 3 by analogy the reservoirs are classified according to different θ η and a series of cost lines can be obtained the cost curve is the lower envelope of several cost lines the area enclosed by the cost curve and the horizontal axis is the expected total cost of the classification model which is calculated as follows 11 e t c o s t 0 1 min c o s t 10 f n r θ η p c o s t 01 f p r θ η 1 p c o s t 10 p c o s t 01 1 p d p where e t c o s t is the expected total cost fn r θ η and fp r θ η are the false negative rate and false positive rate corresponding to the threshold θ η respectively p represents p c o s t 2 4 2 expected total cost with cross validation cross validation is widely used for assessing the generalization ability of ml models when the training samples are limited the commonly used methods include k fold cross validation leave one out cross validation leave p out cross validation and so on yang et al 2016 arlot and celisse 2010 k fold cross validation is employed to evaluate the classification accuracy in this paper k fold cross validation that is the initial sample set is divided into k subsets each subset is used as validation set successively the model accuracy is the average of the k verification results which is calculated as follows e t c o s t 1 k b 1 k e t c o s t b where e t c o s t b is the expected total cost of b fold of cross validation e t c o s t is the average expected total cost of k fold cross validation 2 5 evaluation of the criteria importance in real time flood control operation effective reservoir identification results are affected by some factors such as flood forecasting error monitoring errors etc assessing the criteria importance and identify sensitive factors that have a great impact on classification accuracy is conducive to avoiding classification mistakes mean decrease accuracy mda and mean decrease gini mdg are two commonly used criteria importance evaluation methods in random forest algorithm janitza et al 2013 nicodemus 2011 altmann et al 2010 mda measures the criteria importance by the average across the forest of the increase oob error rate after and before permuting the values of each variable mdg measures the criteria importance by the average across the forest of the gini impurity decline in order to consider the unequal cost this paper proposes a criteria importance evaluation method based on the average increase of expected total cost under the condition of cross validation in the b fold of cross validation j 1 n permuting the values of criteria c j and calculating the expected total cost e t c o s t j b influenced by c j the importance of criteria c j is calculated by the following formula δ e t c o s t j 1 k b 1 k e t c o s t j b e t c o s t b the greater the value δ e t c o s t j the greater the influence of the criteria c j on the classification results of the rfc model indicating that the variable c j is more important 3 case study 3 1 background and experiment design the proposed methodology is applied to the multi reservoir system located in the huaihe river basin in china the flood control system consists of 14 reservoirs lutaizi section is the public flood control point of this system the specific location of the system is shown in fig 4 thirteen basin wide floods are selected for the case study implementing one operation for the first twelve floods and implementing three operations for the last flood due to the long duration first the criteria values of each reservoir in the floods are calculated according to the formulas in table s1 in the supplementary material second the decision attribute of each reservoir in the floods is determined by the rse method the sample set is obtained through the above two steps as shown in table s2 in the supplementary material the effective reservoirs in each flood are extracted from table s2 as shown in table 3 experiment 1 and experiment 2 are designed to evaluate the performance of the rfc model from the aspects of model stability and model accuracy respectively experiment 3 is designed to evaluate the criteria importance some other ml models such as lr dt back propagation bp neural network svm knn and gaussian naive bayes gnb models are employed for comparison according to the principle of these ml models kotsiantis et al 2006 dt and gnb are probabilistic models which deal with the classification problem through the distribution of variables and conditional probability between variables so data normalization is not required however data normalization procedure is required in lr bp svm and knn models because these models are sensitive to data this paper adopts the z score normalization method santhakumaran and jayalakshmi 2011 experiment 1 the inference rules of the erir model are generated based on the criteria thresholds as the sample size increases over time the criteria thresholds will change leading to the change of inference rules therefore the identification results of the erir model is influenced by the sample size besides different sample sizes may also have an impact on the identification results of classification models to evaluate the impact of increasing sample size on the stability of model results the first six nine and twelve floods are used to establish the rfc model erir model and other ml models respectively the last flood is used for model validation the selection of flood samples is shown in fig 5 a experiment 2 expected total cost with cross validation is adopted to assess the accuracy of the rfc model and other ml models the flood samples are divided into 5 subsets for 5 fold cross validation as shown in fig 5 b experiment 3 to evaluate the criteria importance of the rfc model the average increase of the expected total cost under the condition of 5 fold cross validation are calculated the sample division is shown in fig 5 b 3 2 experiment 1 the stability of models the first six nine and twelve floods are used to establish the rfc model erir model and other ml models and the last flood is used for validation 3 2 1 the rfc model in the rfc model the number of decision trees is set as 100 the effective reservoir identification results are shown in table 4 according to the comparison of tables 4 and 3 in the rfc model established by six floods the noneffective reservoir foziling is misclassified as an effective reservoir in the 3 operation process so the type i error occurred the rfc model established by nine or twelve flood events doesn t make the two types of errors and the identification results are completely correct 3 2 2 the erir model establishing the erir model according to different floods the criteria thresholds obtained by different floods are shown in table 5 the effective reservoirs identified by the erir model of the thirteenth flood are shown in table 6 table 5 shows that the flood samples have an impact on criteria thresholds with the increase of flood samples the thresholds of positive criteria c 1 c 2 c 4 and c 5 decreases the threshold of negative criterion c 3 increases and the thresholds of positive criteria c 6 and c 7 remain at zero it can be seen from the comparison of tables 6 and 3 that the identification results of the erir model established by six floods are completely correct in the erir model established by nine floods the noneffective reservoir nanwan is misidentified as an effective reservoir in the 1 operation process in the erir model established by twelve floods the noneffective reservoir nanwan and suyahu are misidentified as an effective reservoir in the 1 and 2 operation process respectively as the flood samples increases the range of thresholds for most criteria increases and the probability of type i error increases accordingly 3 2 3 other ml models lr dt bp svm knn and gnb models are established using different flood samples for comparison because of the influence of parameters on the classification results the parameters with the highest classification accuracy are used in these models the number of different types of errors made by each model is counted as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the rfc model has the fewest errors and the classification results are stable with the increase of floods the number of type i errors of the erir model increases as the flood samples increase the rfc model and erir model don t have type ii error while type ii error occurs in other ml models with the increase of flood samples lr and knn have fewer errors and the results of other models don t show regularity 3 3 experiment 2 the accuracy of models 5 fold cross validation was implemented based on the data sets shown in fig 5 b to evaluate the classification accuracy the results of the expected total cost of each verification and the average expected total cost are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the expected total cost of the rfc model is zero in each validation other ml models have different degrees of cost in each validation but the average expected total costs of these models are not much different the average expected total cost of dt is slightly higher than others obviously the rfc model has a higher classification accuracy than other ml models in effective reservoir identification 3 4 experiment 3 criteria importance of the rfc model criteria importance based on the average increase of expected total cost under 5 fold cross validation was calculated the results of the criteria importance of each verification and the average criteria importance are shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the criteria c 4 and c 5 have higher criteria importance so they have a greater impact on the accuracy of the rfc model the importance of c 7 is zero in 5 fold cross validation other condition attributes have a small influence on the classification accuracy 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the model stability it can be seen from the identification results that although the rfc model is suitable for limited samples the number of samples still affects the classification results as the number of samples increases the classification accuracy of the model increases however when the rfc model reaches the maximum classification accuracy increasing flood samples continually doesn t affect the classification results the erir models established according to different flood samples obtain different results as the flood samples increases the range of thresholds for most criteria increases and the probability of type i error increases accordingly this proves that the criteria thresholds have a great influence on the identification results of erir model therefore the stability of the erir model is lower than that of the rfc model what s notable is that the thresholds of c 6 and c 7 are kept at zero due to the large scale of this flood control system the synchronicity between the reservoir inflow and flow at the public flood control point is weak if the reservoir is far from the public flood control section if two reservoirs are far apart the synchronicity of reservoir inflows is weak therefore the thresholds of c 6 and c 7 are zero it elucidates that c 6 and c 7 have no effect on the erir model for this flood control system as can be seen from fig 6 the impact of training sample size on the classification results is different for other ml models the number of errors of lr and knn model decreases as the training flood samples increases it not only shows that the accuracy of the two models is improved but also shows that the classification results are greatly influenced by the sample size and the two models are unstable as for dt bp svm and gnb there is no significant correlation between the classification results and the training flood samples with the increase of training flood samples the number of errors of these ml models chages more than that of the rfc model so the stability of these models is lower in this study the small training sample size leads to the under fitting issue of these ml models so these models have lower stability it is possible to improve the stability of these ml models by continually increasing training samples besides according to the results of 5 fold cross validation in fig 7 the results of the rfc model are consistent in each validation the results of other ml models are different in each validation which also indicate that the rfc model is more stable than other ml models 4 2 evaluation of the model accuracy fig 6 demonstrates that type i error occurs in both the rfc model and the erir model with the accumulation of flood samples the accuracy of the rfc model improves while the accuracy of the erir model is decreased due to the influence of thresholds although the rfc model and erir don t have type ii error the rfc model has higher identification accuracy fig 7 shows that in the 5 fold cross validation the average expected total cost of the rfc model is zero and the model has the highest classification accuracy the value of average expected total cost of these ml models is very close of which the value of dt is slightly higher than others the rfc model is a multi classifier composed of multiple decision trees and the classification accuracy is much higher than dt therefore the ensemble model rfc has an edge over other ml models for such small sample classification problem as can be seen from fig 6 type ii error occurs in these ml models type ii error is easier to cause flood risk at the downstream flood control point so these ml models are not applicable in the effective reservoir identification the rfc model has higher classification accuracy and better application effects than other ml models 4 3 evaluation of the criteria importance the results of criteria importance indicate that c 4 and c 5 have a greater influence on classification accuracy c 4 contribution ratio to flood volume in the flood peak stage and c 5 contribution ratio to flood peak represent the influence of the reservoir flood routing on the downstream flood control point it is reasonable that these two condition attributes have the greatest influence on identification accuracy in terms of meaning the two attributes are related to the flood peak and flood volume of the reservoir inflows and flow on the public flood control point obviously in the flood control operation of multi reservoirs the accuracy of flood forecasting is the main factor affecting the accuracy of effective reservoir identification the attribute c 7 which represents the flood peak encounter degree between reservoirs does not affect the classification accuracy therefore it has no effect on the rfc model for effective reservoir identification of huaihe river basin 5 conclusions in the real time flood control operation of multi reservoirs the intelligent identification of effective reservoirs is a prerequisite for establishing the mrfcho model to avoid the uncertainty caused by the erir method and improve the accuracy of effective reservoir identification this paper establishes an rfc model and compared it to the erir model and other ml models different floods are employed as training samples to explore the stability of these models the expected total cost with cross validation is used to evaluate the classification accuracy finally the main factors affecting the classification accuracy of the rfc model are assessed by calculating the criteria importance under cross validation a case study of a multi reservoir system in the huaihe river basin shows that 1 the rfc model can avoid the uncertainty of identification results caused by the criteria thresholds in the erir model the identification results of the rfc model training by different flood samples and the expected total cost under cross validation indicate that the rfc model is less sensitive to flood samples and has the highest stability 2 the rfc model has a higher classification accuracy than the erir model and other ml models other ml models are not applicable in the effective reservoir identification because the type ii error may occur 3 the contribution ratio to flood volume in the flood peak stage and contribution ratio to flood peak are the most important criteria affecting the classification accuracy of the rfc model the accuracy of flood forecasting in real time operation is the basis to ensure the accurate identification of effective reservoirs this paper demonstrates the superiority of the rfc model in effective reservoir identification from the aspect of model stability and model accuracy however the flood samples in this basin are limited whether increasing the flood samples will improve the accuracy of other ml models remains to be further studied besides whether the conclusion is universal or not needs to be verified in other flood control systems what s more it is necessary to further explore the complexity of the rfc model and its influencing factors credit authorship contribution statement jieyu li methodology software writing original draft ping an zhong

5061,in the real time operation of a flood control system identifying effective reservoirs accurately and adaptively is the premise of establishing a multi reservoir real time flood control hybrid operation mrfcho model the existing effective reservoir intelligent reasoning erir method is based on the inference rules which causes the identification results to be greatly influenced by the training samples this paper establishes a random forest classification rfc model for identifying effective reservoirs to solve this problem the performance of the rfc model is evaluated in terms of model stability and model accuracy and compared with the erir model and other machine learning ml models first different flood samples are used to establish the models to verify the model stability then the expected total cost under cross validation is taken as the index to evaluate the classification accuracy finally the average increase of expected total cost with cross validation is proposed to evaluate the criteria importance and analyze the sensitive factors that affect the classification accuracy of the rfc model the proposed method is applied to a multi reservoir system in the huaihe river basin in china the results indicate that the rfc model has the characteristic of high classification accuracy low sensitivity to flood samples and high stability it displays more dominance in the dynamic identification of effective reservoirs compared to other models keywords multi reservoir system flood control operation effective reservoir identification classification algorithm random forest 1 introduction joint operation of multi reservoir systems is the main form of surface water resources allocation and plays a pivotal role in flood control seibert et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 labadie 2004 he et al 2019 the flood control operation of multi reservoir systems emphasizes real time and efficiency in real time flood control operation the flood control situation changes in space and time which leads to the change of flood control capacity and flood control effect of reservoirs the reservoir with a significant flood control effect is defined as effective reservoir on the contrary the reservoir with no significant flood control effect is defined as noneffective reservoir li et al 2019 established a multi reservoir real time flood control hybrid operation mrfcho model to improve flood control operation efficiency and alleviate the curse of dimensionality in the mrfcho model the effective reservoirs are operated jointly and the noneffective reservoir are operated separately therefore identifying effective reservoirs according to the real time information of rainfall flood and reservoir conditions accurately is the key step to establish the mrfcho model an effective reservoir intelligent reasoning erir method has been proposed to identify effective reservoirs li et al 2019 in this method a criteria system for identifying effective reservoirs was proposed and the criteria thresholds were determined according to the effective reservoirs in historical floods then the inference rules were determined by criteria thresholds for identifying effective reservoirs in real time flood operation the erir model can identify all effective reservoirs with high accuracy while the criteria thresholds are determined by a subset of effective reservoirs in historical flood samples as time goes by flood samples increase gradually so criteria thresholds should be checked and adjusted to update the rule base it leads to the uncertainty of effective reservoir identification results and further cause the uncertainty in operation schemes therefore avoiding the uncertainty caused by criteria thresholds plays an important role in multi reservoir flood control operation xu et al 2019 chen et al 2019 identifying effective reservoirs from the multi reservoir system is a typical classification problem using the machine learning ml method and extracting rules from assessment samples directly can overcome defects of the erir model ml is the main technology to realize artificial intelligence it provides a new way to solve complex hydrology problems by establishing data driven models chen et al 2020 lin et al 2019a b allawi et al 2018 see et al 2007 the application of ml algorithms in the field of reservoir operation is mainly concentrated in reservoir inflow forecasting and deriving operation rules for establishing a reservoir simulation model reservoir inflow is one of the main uncertainty factors of reservoir operation many scholars have applied the ml methods to rainfall runoff forecasting to improve forecasting accuracy various neural networks nn qi et al 2019 lin and wu 2011 support vector machine svm noori et al 2011 li et al 2010 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis dehghani et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 bae et al 2007 deep learning dl luo et al 2020 bai et al 2016 and hybrid models kumar et al 2015 toro et al 2013 are used for runoff forecasting in different time scales besides many ml algorithms have been applied to driving operation rules and establishing a data driven reservoir simulation model nn yang et al 2019 dariane and karami 2014 cancelliere et al 2002 decision tree dt wei and hsu 2008 cheng et al 2008 svm niu et al 2019 aboutalebi et al 2015 anfis hsu et al 2015 mousavi et al 2007 are more commonly used besides extreme learning machines niu et al 2019 gaussian process regression jia et al 2019 dl liu et al 2019 and other methods are also applied optimization algorithms are often adopted to obtain training samples for ml methods or combined with ml methods to develop optimum operating rules relevant studies show that these ml algorithms perform well in deriving operation rules ml methods have been widely used in the field of reservoir operation since effective reservoir is a new concept proposed to improve the efficiency of real time flood control of multi reservoirs no research has applied ml methods to identify effective reservoirs the ml method mainly consists of supervised learning unsupervised learning and semi supervised learning kotsiantis et al 2006 zhou et al 2017 identifying effective reservoirs belongs to the supervised classification the effective and noneffective reservoir attribute set in historical floods is used to train the classification model for identifying effective reservoirs in the real time flood control operation the supervised classification algorithm includes logistic regression lr dt nn svm k nearest neighbor knn bayes classifier dl and ensemble learning kotsiantis et al 2006 chen 2011 raghavendra and deka 2014 fytilis and rizzo 2013 ragettli et al 2017 ensemble learning is a multi classifier system that combines multiple classifiers and integrates prediction results with some combination strategy to obtain the final decision result gomes et al 2017 compared with a single classifier this method has significantly superior generalization ability and is often applied to small sample learning problems random forest is the most representative classification algorithm in ensemble learning which consisting of a collection of decision tree classifiers breiman 2001 this method not only has a strong classifying ability but also avoids overfitting problems because of the random selection of input samples and attributes in the identification of effective reservoirs the training samples are limited so this paper studies the intelligent identification of effect reservoirs based on the random forest algorithm this paper develops an effective reservoir identification model based on the random forest classification rfc method to avoid the uncertainty caused by criteria thresholds in the erir model the performance of the rfc model in effective reservoir identification is comprehensively evaluated from the aspect of model stability and model accuracy the stability of the rfc model erir model and other ml models are analyzed and compared by increasing the number of training flood samples the expected total cost with cross validation is employed to compare the accuracy of the rfc model and other ml models besides the average increase of expected total cost with cross validation is put forward to investigate the influence of criteria on the classification accuracy of the rfc model the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the proposed methodology section 3 and section 4 present a case study and discussion of the results respectively finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 methodology in this paper the rfc model is established for identifying effective reservoirs in real time flood control operation the stability of the rfc model is evaluated by changing the training samples l1 and it is compared with that of the erir model and other ml models then the accuracy of the rfc model and other ml models is evaluated via the expected total cost with cross validation finally the average increase of expected total cost with cross validation is proposed for assessing the criteria importance of the rfc model the framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 input conditions determining the input criteria and samples is the basis of establishing a classification model this section introduces the input conditions in detail 2 1 1 criteria system for identifying effective reservoirs li et al 2019 proposed a criteria system for identifying effective reservoirs based on the principles of independence and comprehensiveness it includes seven criteria denoted as c 1 forecasted runoff depth in reservoir region c 2 ratio of forecasted lateral inflow c 3 real time reservoir flood control pressure c 4 contribution ratio to flood volume in the flood peak stage c 5 contribution ratio to flood peak c 6 flood peak encounter degree at the point c 7 flood peak encounter degree between reservoirs in this system c 3 is a negative criterion and the others are positive criteria the criteria system displayed satisfactory results in effective reservoir identification therefore it is employed as the condition attributes of the classification models the definition of these criteria is shown in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 1 2 generation of the sample set assuming that the flood control system consists of m reservoirs and n criteria are used to evaluate whether the reservoir is an effective reservoir selecting l historical floods among which l1 floods are used for model training and l2 floods are used for verification the condition attributes of reservoirs namely the criteria values of reservoirs in each historical flood are calculated based on the formulas in table s1 in the supplementary material the real decision attribute of reservoirs namely the effective reservoir or noneffective reservoir in each historical flood is determined by the reservoir successively eliminated rse method li et al 2019 for each flood the rse method is implemented by the following steps 1 implement joint operation of all reservoirs and obtain the peak flow at the downstream control point which is denoted as q m 2 implement separate operation of the ith reservoir and joint operation of the other reservoirs obtain the peak flow at the downstream control point q m i 3 if q m i q m q m ε the ith reservoir has little influence on the flood control effect and is considered as a noneffective reservoir otherwise the ith reservoir is an effective reservoir where ε is a customizable threshold 4 repeat step 2 and 3 to determine the attribute of each reservoir in a flood 2 2 description of the erir model the essence of the erir model is to determine the inference rules according to criteria thresholds and the inference rules are adopted to identify effective reservoirs in real time operation following are the main steps 1 calculate the criteria values of effective reservoirs in l1 historical floods for the positive criteria take the minimum value as the threshold for the negative criteria take the maximum value as the threshold 2 generate inference rules based on the criteria thresholds which are expressed as if c j satisfies the threshold then the reservoir is an effective reservoir if c j doesn t satisfy the threshold then the reservoir is a noneffective reservoir where c j is the jth criterion j 1 n 3 in real time flood control operation calculate the criteria values of each reservoir and then judge the decision attribute of reservoirs according to the inference rules 2 3 establishment of the rfc model in the rfc algorithm each tree is generated based on the random selection of training set and the random selection of attributes then the final classification result is determined by the voting method breiman 2001 local optimization and overfitting issues caused by single classifier can be effectively overcome liu et al 2008 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the principle of training phase and decision phase of the rfc model is shown in fig 2 each step is described in the following subsections 2 3 1 the decision tree based on cart algorithm cart algorithm also known as classification and regression tree is a binary decision tree that deals with classification or regression problems kotsiantis 2013 gupta et al 2017 this paper builds a single classifier based on the cart algorithm gini impurity is a splitting criterion that represents the expected error rate the best cut at each node is selected by minimizing gini impurity pal 2005 kotsiantis 2013 jeung et al 2019 l1 historical floods are used to train the rfc model assuming that there are s samples in the training set s c d so s m l 1 where c is the condition attribute of the sample that is the criteria for identifying effective reservoirs d is the decision attribute that is whether the reservoir is effective or noneffective since the reservoir should be identified as effective reservoir denoted as 1 or noneffective reservoir denoted as 0 the decision attribute is divided into two classes denoted as d u u 0 1 criterion c j divides training set s into effective reservoir subset and noneffective reservoir subset there are s g samples in the subset s g g 0 1 the gini impurity of subset s g is defined as 1 gini s g 1 u 0 1 p ug 2 where p ug is the probability of class d u in subset s g the smaller the gini impurity is the higher the purity of the subset is and the greater the information gain is if all samples in the subset s g belong to the same class the value of gini impurity is taken as the minimum value of zero the gini impurity of training set s is defined as 2 gin i split s s 0 s g i n i s 0 s 1 s g i n i s 1 when the cart algorithm is used for node splitting the gini impurity of each criterion should be calculated and the minimum gini impurity is selected for splitting then the decision tree is constructed recursively to generate classification rules 2 3 2 generation of the training subset for each decision tree in the rfc model each decision tree has a corresponding training subset if there are z decision trees it is necessary to select z training subsets randomly from the original training set bagging bootstrap aggregating method a sampling method with replacement is used for sampling in the rfc model breiman 1996 sampling in the initial training set s to generate a series of training subset s the steps are as follows 1 selecting a sample from s randomly and put it in s 2 putting the sample back into s so that the sample may still be selected at the next sampling 3 repeat step 1 to 2 r times to get a subset s containing r samples s is a training set for a decision tree 4 repeat step 1 to 3 z times to get z subsets s for each decision tree which are denoted as s 1 s 2 s z 2 3 3 establishment of each decision tree and the random forest based on the random selection of the training set generating the condition attribute subset randomly for each decision tree is the next step the condition attributes in the subset are called random features the random features usually formed by random selection from the original condition attributes forest ri and random linear combinations of condition attributes forest rc breiman 2001 forest ri is used in this paper in the forest ri method z subsets of condition attributes are first selected randomly from the original condition attribute set which is denoted as c 1 c 2 c z the number of attributes in each subset is a for a decision tree each node is split according to a subset of condition attributes grow the decision tree using the cart method to maximum size and don t prune in the classification problem let a n a is an insensitive parameter that does not need to be adjusted the decision tree is expressed as 3 h x θ e where h x θ e is the eth decision tree x is input variables θ e is independent and identically distributed random variables which represents the set of parameters used in the decision tree a random forest containing z decision trees is established by the above two random selection processes which is denoted as h 1 x h 2 x h z x 2 3 4 decision phase of the rfc model l2 historical floods are used for model validation assuming that there are s samples in the training set s so s m l 2 in the rfc model the class of a reservoir is first classified by each decision tree which is denoted as y 1 y 2 y z then the results of each decision tree are combined by a kind of combination strategy to obtain the final classification result the most commonly used combination strategy is the voting method this method gets the final classification result via a majority vote among a series of classification results at the same time the probability that λ th sample belongs to class d u is obtained by the rfc model denoted as p λ u 2 4 evaluation of the classification accuracy in the effective reservoir identification different types of errors will cause varying degrees of consequence if the noneffective reservoir is misclassified as an effective reservoir it only increases the multi reservoir operation complexity this type of error is called type i error if the effective reservoir is misclassified as the noneffective reservoir the flood control effect will reduce dramatically and flood disaster even occurs at the downstream this type of error is called type ii error obviously the cost of type ii error is much greater than that of type i error for this reason type ii error is not allowed in effective reservoir identification the general evaluation indicators of classification accuracy such as roc curve auc value and kappa coefficient only take the least number of misjudgments as standard these indicators don t consider different costs caused by the two types of errors the expected total cost can measure varying degrees of costs caused by the two types of errors and assign unequal cost to errors drummond and holte 2006 therefore the expected total cost is used to evaluate the classification accuracy of effective reservoir identification models 2 4 1 expected total cost for the binary classification problem one class is usually defined as positive class and the other is negative class let the effective reservoir be positive class denoted as 1 and noneffective reservoir be negative class denoted as 0 let cost α β represent the cost that the sample of class α is misclassified as β the cost of the right classification is zero and that means cost 11 0 cost 00 0 the cost matrix is expressed in table 1 in the verification stage the reservoirs are classified for the l2 floods counting the number of reservoir samples of each class and the confusion matrix can be obtained which is shown in table 2 let pr h α represent the prior probability of an example being from class α and pr h β h α represent the conditional probability that an example being from class α is misclassified as β suppose that the probability of positive class is pr h 1 p and the probability of negative class is pr h 0 1 p the normalized probability cost of the positive class is expressed as 4 p cost cost 10 p cost 10 p cost 01 1 p the true positive rate is defined as 5 pr h 1 h 1 t p r tp tp f n the false positive rate is defined as 6 pr h 1 h 0 f p r fp fp t n the true negative rate is defined as 7 pr h 0 h 0 t n r tn fp t n the false negative rate is defined as 8 pr h 0 h 1 f n r fn tp f n the expected cost of the classifier is defined as 9 e cost α 0 1 β 0 1 cost α β pr h β h α pr h α according to conditions cost 11 0 cost 00 0 and eqs 5 9 can be simplified and normalized to 10 e cost norm cost 10 f n r p cost 01 f p r 1 p cost 10 p cost 01 1 p fig 3 is the diagram of the cost curve and expected total cost in fig 3 the horizontal axis is p c o s t and the vertical axis is the e c o s t norm if p 0 the corresponding point is 0 f p r if p 1 the corresponding point is 1 f n r when the value of p changes the corresponding point is on the line segment joining 0 f p r and 1 f n r which is called the cost line according to the classification results obtained by the classification model with different thresholds a series of cost lines can be obtained the lower envelope of several cost lines is the cost curve the steps to get a cost curve are as follows 1 calculating the probability that each sample belongs to positive class denoted as p λ 1 p λ 1 is sorted from large to small and it is used as a threshold in turn which denoted as θ η θ η means the probability that the η th sample belongs to positive class after sorting 2 the reservoirs are classified according to θ η if p λ 1 θ η the λ th sample belongs to positive class otherwise it belongs to negative class after all of the reservoirs are classified fpr and fnr are calculated to obtain a set of 0 f p r and 1 f n r coordinates and a cost line is obtained by jointing them 3 by analogy the reservoirs are classified according to different θ η and a series of cost lines can be obtained the cost curve is the lower envelope of several cost lines the area enclosed by the cost curve and the horizontal axis is the expected total cost of the classification model which is calculated as follows 11 e t c o s t 0 1 min c o s t 10 f n r θ η p c o s t 01 f p r θ η 1 p c o s t 10 p c o s t 01 1 p d p where e t c o s t is the expected total cost fn r θ η and fp r θ η are the false negative rate and false positive rate corresponding to the threshold θ η respectively p represents p c o s t 2 4 2 expected total cost with cross validation cross validation is widely used for assessing the generalization ability of ml models when the training samples are limited the commonly used methods include k fold cross validation leave one out cross validation leave p out cross validation and so on yang et al 2016 arlot and celisse 2010 k fold cross validation is employed to evaluate the classification accuracy in this paper k fold cross validation that is the initial sample set is divided into k subsets each subset is used as validation set successively the model accuracy is the average of the k verification results which is calculated as follows e t c o s t 1 k b 1 k e t c o s t b where e t c o s t b is the expected total cost of b fold of cross validation e t c o s t is the average expected total cost of k fold cross validation 2 5 evaluation of the criteria importance in real time flood control operation effective reservoir identification results are affected by some factors such as flood forecasting error monitoring errors etc assessing the criteria importance and identify sensitive factors that have a great impact on classification accuracy is conducive to avoiding classification mistakes mean decrease accuracy mda and mean decrease gini mdg are two commonly used criteria importance evaluation methods in random forest algorithm janitza et al 2013 nicodemus 2011 altmann et al 2010 mda measures the criteria importance by the average across the forest of the increase oob error rate after and before permuting the values of each variable mdg measures the criteria importance by the average across the forest of the gini impurity decline in order to consider the unequal cost this paper proposes a criteria importance evaluation method based on the average increase of expected total cost under the condition of cross validation in the b fold of cross validation j 1 n permuting the values of criteria c j and calculating the expected total cost e t c o s t j b influenced by c j the importance of criteria c j is calculated by the following formula δ e t c o s t j 1 k b 1 k e t c o s t j b e t c o s t b the greater the value δ e t c o s t j the greater the influence of the criteria c j on the classification results of the rfc model indicating that the variable c j is more important 3 case study 3 1 background and experiment design the proposed methodology is applied to the multi reservoir system located in the huaihe river basin in china the flood control system consists of 14 reservoirs lutaizi section is the public flood control point of this system the specific location of the system is shown in fig 4 thirteen basin wide floods are selected for the case study implementing one operation for the first twelve floods and implementing three operations for the last flood due to the long duration first the criteria values of each reservoir in the floods are calculated according to the formulas in table s1 in the supplementary material second the decision attribute of each reservoir in the floods is determined by the rse method the sample set is obtained through the above two steps as shown in table s2 in the supplementary material the effective reservoirs in each flood are extracted from table s2 as shown in table 3 experiment 1 and experiment 2 are designed to evaluate the performance of the rfc model from the aspects of model stability and model accuracy respectively experiment 3 is designed to evaluate the criteria importance some other ml models such as lr dt back propagation bp neural network svm knn and gaussian naive bayes gnb models are employed for comparison according to the principle of these ml models kotsiantis et al 2006 dt and gnb are probabilistic models which deal with the classification problem through the distribution of variables and conditional probability between variables so data normalization is not required however data normalization procedure is required in lr bp svm and knn models because these models are sensitive to data this paper adopts the z score normalization method santhakumaran and jayalakshmi 2011 experiment 1 the inference rules of the erir model are generated based on the criteria thresholds as the sample size increases over time the criteria thresholds will change leading to the change of inference rules therefore the identification results of the erir model is influenced by the sample size besides different sample sizes may also have an impact on the identification results of classification models to evaluate the impact of increasing sample size on the stability of model results the first six nine and twelve floods are used to establish the rfc model erir model and other ml models respectively the last flood is used for model validation the selection of flood samples is shown in fig 5 a experiment 2 expected total cost with cross validation is adopted to assess the accuracy of the rfc model and other ml models the flood samples are divided into 5 subsets for 5 fold cross validation as shown in fig 5 b experiment 3 to evaluate the criteria importance of the rfc model the average increase of the expected total cost under the condition of 5 fold cross validation are calculated the sample division is shown in fig 5 b 3 2 experiment 1 the stability of models the first six nine and twelve floods are used to establish the rfc model erir model and other ml models and the last flood is used for validation 3 2 1 the rfc model in the rfc model the number of decision trees is set as 100 the effective reservoir identification results are shown in table 4 according to the comparison of tables 4 and 3 in the rfc model established by six floods the noneffective reservoir foziling is misclassified as an effective reservoir in the 3 operation process so the type i error occurred the rfc model established by nine or twelve flood events doesn t make the two types of errors and the identification results are completely correct 3 2 2 the erir model establishing the erir model according to different floods the criteria thresholds obtained by different floods are shown in table 5 the effective reservoirs identified by the erir model of the thirteenth flood are shown in table 6 table 5 shows that the flood samples have an impact on criteria thresholds with the increase of flood samples the thresholds of positive criteria c 1 c 2 c 4 and c 5 decreases the threshold of negative criterion c 3 increases and the thresholds of positive criteria c 6 and c 7 remain at zero it can be seen from the comparison of tables 6 and 3 that the identification results of the erir model established by six floods are completely correct in the erir model established by nine floods the noneffective reservoir nanwan is misidentified as an effective reservoir in the 1 operation process in the erir model established by twelve floods the noneffective reservoir nanwan and suyahu are misidentified as an effective reservoir in the 1 and 2 operation process respectively as the flood samples increases the range of thresholds for most criteria increases and the probability of type i error increases accordingly 3 2 3 other ml models lr dt bp svm knn and gnb models are established using different flood samples for comparison because of the influence of parameters on the classification results the parameters with the highest classification accuracy are used in these models the number of different types of errors made by each model is counted as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the rfc model has the fewest errors and the classification results are stable with the increase of floods the number of type i errors of the erir model increases as the flood samples increase the rfc model and erir model don t have type ii error while type ii error occurs in other ml models with the increase of flood samples lr and knn have fewer errors and the results of other models don t show regularity 3 3 experiment 2 the accuracy of models 5 fold cross validation was implemented based on the data sets shown in fig 5 b to evaluate the classification accuracy the results of the expected total cost of each verification and the average expected total cost are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the expected total cost of the rfc model is zero in each validation other ml models have different degrees of cost in each validation but the average expected total costs of these models are not much different the average expected total cost of dt is slightly higher than others obviously the rfc model has a higher classification accuracy than other ml models in effective reservoir identification 3 4 experiment 3 criteria importance of the rfc model criteria importance based on the average increase of expected total cost under 5 fold cross validation was calculated the results of the criteria importance of each verification and the average criteria importance are shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the criteria c 4 and c 5 have higher criteria importance so they have a greater impact on the accuracy of the rfc model the importance of c 7 is zero in 5 fold cross validation other condition attributes have a small influence on the classification accuracy 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the model stability it can be seen from the identification results that although the rfc model is suitable for limited samples the number of samples still affects the classification results as the number of samples increases the classification accuracy of the model increases however when the rfc model reaches the maximum classification accuracy increasing flood samples continually doesn t affect the classification results the erir models established according to different flood samples obtain different results as the flood samples increases the range of thresholds for most criteria increases and the probability of type i error increases accordingly this proves that the criteria thresholds have a great influence on the identification results of erir model therefore the stability of the erir model is lower than that of the rfc model what s notable is that the thresholds of c 6 and c 7 are kept at zero due to the large scale of this flood control system the synchronicity between the reservoir inflow and flow at the public flood control point is weak if the reservoir is far from the public flood control section if two reservoirs are far apart the synchronicity of reservoir inflows is weak therefore the thresholds of c 6 and c 7 are zero it elucidates that c 6 and c 7 have no effect on the erir model for this flood control system as can be seen from fig 6 the impact of training sample size on the classification results is different for other ml models the number of errors of lr and knn model decreases as the training flood samples increases it not only shows that the accuracy of the two models is improved but also shows that the classification results are greatly influenced by the sample size and the two models are unstable as for dt bp svm and gnb there is no significant correlation between the classification results and the training flood samples with the increase of training flood samples the number of errors of these ml models chages more than that of the rfc model so the stability of these models is lower in this study the small training sample size leads to the under fitting issue of these ml models so these models have lower stability it is possible to improve the stability of these ml models by continually increasing training samples besides according to the results of 5 fold cross validation in fig 7 the results of the rfc model are consistent in each validation the results of other ml models are different in each validation which also indicate that the rfc model is more stable than other ml models 4 2 evaluation of the model accuracy fig 6 demonstrates that type i error occurs in both the rfc model and the erir model with the accumulation of flood samples the accuracy of the rfc model improves while the accuracy of the erir model is decreased due to the influence of thresholds although the rfc model and erir don t have type ii error the rfc model has higher identification accuracy fig 7 shows that in the 5 fold cross validation the average expected total cost of the rfc model is zero and the model has the highest classification accuracy the value of average expected total cost of these ml models is very close of which the value of dt is slightly higher than others the rfc model is a multi classifier composed of multiple decision trees and the classification accuracy is much higher than dt therefore the ensemble model rfc has an edge over other ml models for such small sample classification problem as can be seen from fig 6 type ii error occurs in these ml models type ii error is easier to cause flood risk at the downstream flood control point so these ml models are not applicable in the effective reservoir identification the rfc model has higher classification accuracy and better application effects than other ml models 4 3 evaluation of the criteria importance the results of criteria importance indicate that c 4 and c 5 have a greater influence on classification accuracy c 4 contribution ratio to flood volume in the flood peak stage and c 5 contribution ratio to flood peak represent the influence of the reservoir flood routing on the downstream flood control point it is reasonable that these two condition attributes have the greatest influence on identification accuracy in terms of meaning the two attributes are related to the flood peak and flood volume of the reservoir inflows and flow on the public flood control point obviously in the flood control operation of multi reservoirs the accuracy of flood forecasting is the main factor affecting the accuracy of effective reservoir identification the attribute c 7 which represents the flood peak encounter degree between reservoirs does not affect the classification accuracy therefore it has no effect on the rfc model for effective reservoir identification of huaihe river basin 5 conclusions in the real time flood control operation of multi reservoirs the intelligent identification of effective reservoirs is a prerequisite for establishing the mrfcho model to avoid the uncertainty caused by the erir method and improve the accuracy of effective reservoir identification this paper establishes an rfc model and compared it to the erir model and other ml models different floods are employed as training samples to explore the stability of these models the expected total cost with cross validation is used to evaluate the classification accuracy finally the main factors affecting the classification accuracy of the rfc model are assessed by calculating the criteria importance under cross validation a case study of a multi reservoir system in the huaihe river basin shows that 1 the rfc model can avoid the uncertainty of identification results caused by the criteria thresholds in the erir model the identification results of the rfc model training by different flood samples and the expected total cost under cross validation indicate that the rfc model is less sensitive to flood samples and has the highest stability 2 the rfc model has a higher classification accuracy than the erir model and other ml models other ml models are not applicable in the effective reservoir identification because the type ii error may occur 3 the contribution ratio to flood volume in the flood peak stage and contribution ratio to flood peak are the most important criteria affecting the classification accuracy of the rfc model the accuracy of flood forecasting in real time operation is the basis to ensure the accurate identification of effective reservoirs this paper demonstrates the superiority of the rfc model in effective reservoir identification from the aspect of model stability and model accuracy however the flood samples in this basin are limited whether increasing the flood samples will improve the accuracy of other ml models remains to be further studied besides whether the conclusion is universal or not needs to be verified in other flood control systems what s more it is necessary to further explore the complexity of the rfc model and its influencing factors credit authorship contribution statement jieyu li methodology software writing original draft ping an zhong

5062,interaction between dissolved organic matter dom and heavy metals have been widely studied and the differences in dom properties have a great impact on the capacity of dom metals binding in this study the samples were collected from the upper lake and lower lake in nansi lake respectively according to the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of component to the total fluorescence intensity f max in the two areas obvious differences were found in the properties of dom the content of humic like substances showed a decreasing trend from the north to south in nansi lake on this basis samples from north and south ends of nansi lake were selected for fluorescence titration all components were quenched with the increasing of cu2 addition combining the results of synchronous fluorescence sf spectra with two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos fluorescent quenching near 275 nm was quicker than the changes that occurred at the wavelength that after 275 nm which suggested that the complexation occurred firstly for protein like components as compared with humic like components the modified stern volmer model suggested that protein like components had larger effective quenching constants logka 3 47 0 13 for component c5 in the upper lake and logka 3 57 0 19 for component c4 in the lower lake than humic like components and it is not affected by the region indicating that protein like substances might have a higher metal binding potential than humic like substances in nansi lake the binding constants and the binding sites suggested that humic like components also had a nonnegligible binding potential in nansi lake although the protein like components revealed a stronger binding ability in fluorescence quenching keywords dissolved organic matter dom cu2 2d cos parafac fluorescence quenching 1 introduction lake is the most important reservoir or sinks of pollutants from its basin by way of runoff and sediments transportation compared with the overlying water most of the contaminants were stored in the sediments sheykhi and moore 2013 siev et al 2018 as an active and extractable fraction in lake sediments dissolved organic matter dom is a key factor in the material and energy cycling in the aquatic ecosystem xu et al 2013 chen and hur 2015 with the rapid economic development many shallow freshwater lakes are suffering from severe eutrophication and heavy metal pollution as well as the abundance of contaminants is enhanced in lake sediments wen et al 2016 unlike other contaminants heavy metals accumulate in organisms and sediments over time which cannot be biodegraded li et al 2010 lynch et al 2016 as a typical heavy metal in the aquatic system the concentration of copper cu can largely reflect the impact of human activities such as agricultural runoff and industrial discharges cu2 in the aquatic environment passes through the food chain and accumulates in the organisms excessive cu2 will cause great harm to human health such as destroying the metabolic system and inducing cancers jarup and akesson 2009 lynch et al 2016 in addition cu2 can make a significant effect on most substances in dom and the interaction between dom and heavy metal can be characterized clearly xu et al 2013 he et al 2019 previous studies have shown that the mobility of organic pollutant was largely depended on organic ligands gu and karthikeyan 2008 for instance dom serves as a medium for the distribution and transport of heavy metals and interact with heavy metals to form dom metal complexes which strongly affect the form distribution and bioavailability of heavy metals guo et al 2012 therefore studies on the ability of dom cu binding are essential for further understanding the fate and ecotoxicity of cu2 in the aquatic system reports on the ability of dom and heavy metals binding are not uncommon he et al 2019 demonstrated that polysaccharide lignin and protein like substances in groundwater dom were effectively bound with organic pollutant in comparison xu et al 2019 found a more significant binding property for humic fulvic like components in sediment dom these inconsistent or reverse results usually due to different metal species and dom sources xu et al 2013 the distribution of heavy metals and source of dom was affected by many factors previous studies have considered the effects of aquatic vegetation and human activities such as pollutant emissions on the dom metal binding ability xu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 it is necessary to investigate the dom metals binding property in the complex hydrological environment caused by multiple factors especially those lakes with the unique shape and the existence of large water conservancy projects which might lead to significant differences in dom sources and structures thus affecting the ability of dom metal binding kinds of techniques have been used to study the reciprocities between contaminants and dom such as solid phase microextraction synchronous fluorescence quenching sf and dialysis equilibrium haftka et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 and sfhas been widely used due to its sensitivity non destructivity and simplicity meanwhile two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos was employed to further analyse the problem of peak overlap moreover the excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis eem parafac were applied to analyse the interaction of dom to the addition of metal bai et al 2017 we selected cu2 as the representative metal in this study and collected samples from the upper and the lower lake in nansi lake respectively fluorescence titration eem parafac uv vis spectra and 2d cos were applied to provide an in depth study of the heterogeneous binding properties of cu2 onto dom the main objectives of this work are as follows 1 to compare the differences in characteristics of dom from different lake regions 2 to compare different cu dom binding properties in different lake areas 3 to discuss possible reasons for the results in this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples from different areas in nansi lake nansi lake a long narrow lake with 125 km long from north to south and 6 25 km wide from east to west is the largest lake in shandong province china the lake was divided into an upper lake and a lower lake separated by a dam built in 1975 in addition this lake is a storage hub for the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project zhang et al 2020a b a total of 34 sampling sites were set in nansi lake 116 33 e 117 21 e 34 22 n 35 22 n there were 19 sites in the upper lake and 15 sites in the lower lake fig 1 a grab sampler was employed to collect surface sediments 0 5 cm in july of 2019 the samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve after freeze drying for further processing all of the samples were sifted and mixed with milli q water solid liquid ratio 1 10 on an oscillator at 25 c for 24 h the mixed liquid was centrifugated at 4500 g for 20 min and the suspension liquid was filtered with 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane to obtain the dom xu et al 2019 dom dialysis was performed for 24 h to remove ions and small molecules by dialysis bags with an aperture of 3500 da 2 2 fluorescence quenching titration a copper sino pharm chemical reagent co shanghai china stock solution was prepared with a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 different concentrations of cu2 stock solution was added into several 20 ml brown sealed bottles containing 10 ml of dom a certain amount of potassium chloride kcl ph of 6 5 solution as the background solution which can control the ion strength and ensure a better binding effect was added to ensure the eventual volume of 20 ml doc at 10 mg l 1 kcl at 10 mm and cu2 at 0 240 mg l 1 additionally the natural level of cu2 is generally lower than applied herein because a higher concentration of cu2 can better characterise the complexation reaction bai et al 2017 the ph values of the solutions were adjusted to avoid precipitation ohno et al 2008 eventually all samples were shaken in the dark for 24 h by using eem uv vis absorption and synchronous fluorescence sf spectra relevant information about the solutions were obtained yamashita and jaffé 2008 2 3 fluorescence and absorbance measurement fluorescence spectra eems and sf spectra were detected by a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies tokyo japan the scanning excitation ex and emission em are from 250 nm to 550 nm with 5 nm intervals for eems and the ex wavelength scope is from 200 nm to 450 nm with a constant offset 60 nm for sf spectra bai et al 2017 uv vis absorption spectra were measured from 200 to 800 nm with intervals at 1 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550 the absorption coefficient at 254 nm is usually used to represent the relative abundance of dom song et al 2015 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 2d cos analysis 2d cos was detected by sf spectroscopy to further analyse the information on dom cu complexation in the synchronous 2d correlation spectrum an autopeak intensity always appears at the diagonal position and is positive suggesting the overall extent of spectral intensity variation in contrast a positive crosspeak at λ1 λ2 indicate possible coupling or correlation at λ1 or λ2 and the negative peak at λ1 λ2 indicate an inconsistent trend at λ1 and λ2 noda 2016 in the asynchronous map if the wavelength pair of λ1 and λ2 changed synchronously then the positive crosspeak at λ1 λ2 indicated that the intensity changed at λ1 takes precedence over λ2 while the negative crosspeak at λ1 λ2 indicated that the intensity changed at λ1 took place later than λ2 noda 2016 2 4 2 parafac modelling parafac was used to analyse the different interaction between dom components and cu2 parafac can separate eems data into individual fluorescent components the basic properties of individual fluorophores are determined by the emission em and excitation ex of different components the dreem toolbox of matlab r2018b was used for parafac modelling more about the parafac model can be found elsewhere yamashita and jaffé 2008 stedmon and bro 2008 2 4 3 complexation modeling the modified stern volmer equation was applied to estimate the parameters related to the fluorescence quenching of different dom components hays et al 2004 guo et al 2012 the modified stern volmer equation is shown as eq 1 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k a c cu 1 f here f 0 and f represent the fluorescence intensities in the lack and existence of cu2 mol l 1 respectively ka and f signify the quenching constant and the initial spectral intensities respectively in order to further study the interaction between cu2 and dom fluorescence components the site binding equation was used to investigate the stability constant and the binding sites of dom components as eq 2 log f 0 f f log k b n log c cu kb and n represent the binding constant and the binding site number respectively 2 4 4 fluorescence index three fluorescence indices were used in the present study including fi fluorescence index bix biological index and hix humification index the fi bix and hix have defined as the ratios of fluorescence intensity at 470 to 520 nm both excited at 370 nm 380 to 430 nm both excited at 310 nm 435 480 to 300 345 nm both excited at 225 nm respectively the more description of the relevant content has been described elsewhere huguet et al 2009 3 results 3 1 characteristics of dom from nansi lake as shown in fig 2 a and b the distribution of the docextracted from sediments and a 254 were similar in nansi lake most of the high values were found in the upper lake especially at the northern end the mean value of doc in the upper lake was 31 59 1 94 mg l 1 in the upper lake and 26 65 3 47 mg l 1 in the lower lake meanwhile the mean value of a 254 in the upper lake was 15 27 1 18 higher than 10 54 1 45 in the lower lake these differences indicated that the relative abundance of dom in the upper lake is greater than that in the lower lake it should be noted that a high doc and a 254 value was also found near the island in the lower lake which might be related to pollution caused by human tourism the relative contribution of different sources to dom was analysed by combining fluorescence index fi bix and hix fig 2d e the values of fi bix and hix in the upper lake had ranges of 2 27 2 47 0 71 0 85 and 2 65 7 82 moreover ranges of the mean values were 2 35 0 01 0 77 0 01 and 5 38 0 31 respectively while the fi bix and hix in the lower lake were between 2 10 and 2 49 0 68 0 88 and 1 62 4 30 and the mean values were 2 37 0 03 0 81 0 02 and 3 13 0 28 respectively as a whole the fi value of each site in nansi lake was greater than 1 9 showing obvious endogenous characteristics jaffé et al 2004 the strong characteristics of endogeneity probably connected to the growth and decomposition of macrophyte in nansi lake with plenty of sunshine and precipitation in the summer previous studies have reported that a higher value of bix signifies that dom has a stronger endogenous characteristic zhou et al 2015 the values of bix in the lower lake were significantly higher than the values in the upper lake p 0 05 which suggested some differences in the degree of endogenous characteristics moreover the hix values were generally less than 6 in nansi lake indicating a low degree of humification however compared with the values of hix in the lower lake the hix values in the upper lake were significantly higher p 0 05 indicating a stronger degree of humification in the north of nansi lake eem is an important index to characterise the source and composition of dom eems of the upper lake and lower lake are shown in fig 3 there are generally five visible fluorescence peaks including peak t em ex 340 275 nm peak d em ex 340 225 nm peak m em ex 410 300 nm peak a em ex 420 250 nm and peak c em ex 445 350 nm generally peak t and peak d are supposed to be protein like substances in contrast peak m peak a and peak c are considered to be humic like substances it is generally believed that peak a peak c and peak m are mainly formed by fulvic and humic like fluorophores whereas peak t and peak d are composed of tyrosine and tryptophan like fluorophores respectively murphy et al 2008 conspicuous different spectral characteristics in eem were measured among samples collected from the two areas in nansi lake in the upper lake the fluorescence intensity of peak a is significantly higher than other peaks while peak d in the lower lake shows strong fluorescence intensity indicating that the properties of dom in the two areas might be different a total of five components were obtained by parafac model including three humic like components and two protein like components the ex and em of each component were shown in fig 4 the positions of components c2 ex em 260 320 400 nm and c3 ex em 230 430 nm were similar to humic like peak a and peak m yamashita and jaffé 2008 components c4 ex em 280 330 nm and c5 ex em 225 340 nm correspond to protein like peak t and peak d in eems lee et al 2003 murphy et al 2008 kowalczuk et al 2010 meanwhile the positions of components c1 ex em 260 350 450 nm was roughly the same as the peaks a and c which can be characterised as humic like components williams et al 2010 zhou et al 2016 as shown in fig 5 correlation analysis showed that humic like components c1 c2 and c3 have an extremely significant positive correlation p 0 01 which suggested that the material sources of these components are similar meanwhile the protein like components c4 and c5 also showed a significant positive correlation p 0 001 which indicated that the origins of c4 and c5 are also very similar and the significant correlation between humic like components c1 c2 and a 254 suggested that humic like substances may be the main substances that affect the relative abundance of dom p 0 05 the mean values of total fluorescence intensities in the upper lake and lower lake were 8 50 0 21 6 51 0 88 qsu respectively this result which was similar to the result of doc and a 254 further illustrated that the concentration of doms decreased from the upper lake to the lower lake in addition the content of humic like substances decreased from north to south in nansi lake fig 2c as another major substance of the dom the spatial variability of the content of protein like substance had an opposite trendto that of humic like substances the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of component to the total fluorescence intensity f max of the humic like components c1 c2 and c3 in the upper lake was obviously higher than in the lower lake p 0 01 all the results reflected the difference in the sources of the dom collected from different areas in nansi lake 3 2 fluorescence quenching 3 2 1 sf and uv vis absorption spectra the effect of cu2 on dom and display information about dom changes can indicate by sf spectra wei et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 a and b with the increasing of cu2 addition sf spectra changed significantly in all the dom the peaks at 275 nm and 350 nm in sf spectra were both significantly quenched in the upper lake and the lower lake which can be attributed to the variation in the electronic structure of the dom hur and lee 2011 as opposed to the fluorescence quenching at 275 nm and 350 nm the fluorescence intensities of the peaks at 230 nm had various degrees of increasing with the addition of cu2 the fluorescence enhancement might be caused by the interactions between high levels of cu2 and inorganic and other organic components yamashita and jaffé 2008 further research suggested that the behaviour of spectral changes in dom exhibited obvious differences the more significant quenching effect at 275 nm than that at 350 nm indicating that the contribution of protein like substances in corresponding regions to the overall fluorescence quenching effect was greater than that of humic like substances at 350 nm this result was also found in other studies which indicates that the binding sites between cu2 and dom might be uneven protein like substances were more sensitive to the change of cu2 concentration than humic like substances guo et al 2018 the changes of uv vis absorption spectra with the addition of cu2 were shown in fig 6c and d the absorbance of all the doms showed a trend of gradual increase with the addition of the metal titrant which might be caused by the changes in the microbial environment of dom bai et al 2008 similar results were also found in previous studies xu et al 2013 3 2 2 2d cos of sf spectra although the fluorescence quenching information can be obtained intuitively through the sf spectra the information such as detailed binding sites and the sequence of binding cannot be obtained cui et al 2020 for dom collected from the upper lake there were three positive autopeaks at 225 225 nm 275 275 nm and 350 350 nm along the diagonal line of the synchronous map fig 7 a meanwhile one positive crosspeak at 275 350 nm and two negative crosspeaks at 275 225 nm and 350 225 nm were found respectively the positive crosspeak at 275 350 nm suggested that the two positive autopeaks at 275 275 nm and 350 350 nm had the consistent direction of spectral changes decreased with cu2 addition while the two negative crosspeaks at 275 225 nm and 350 225 nm indicated that different direction of spectral changes between the positive autopeak at 225 225 nm with other two as shown in fig 7c autopeaks at 230 230 nm 275 275 nm 350 nm 350 nm and crosspeaks at 275 350 nm 275 230 nm 350 230 nm with similar patterns were also found in dom collected from the lower lake which was consistent with the change of sf spectra due to the changing trend of spectral at 230 nm was different from the quenching trend near 275 nm and 350 nm and the part related to fluorescence enhancement was not explained in the asynchronous map in fig 7b a negative crosspeaks at 350 280 nm was obtained under the diagonal line in dom collected from the upper lake and a negative crosspeaks at 320 280 nm was found in dom collected from the lower lake fig 7d all the results of 2d cos suggested that fluorescent quenching near 275 nm was quicker than the changes that occurred at the wavelength that after 275 nm in the sf spectra thus protein like substances were firstly binding to heavy metals as compared with humic like substances in nansi lake regardless of dom source 3 3 metal binding abilities of parafac components fig 8 a and b showed the alterations in fluorescent intensity scores of parafac derived components with increasing metal addition for dom collected from the upper lake and lower lake respectively the fluorescence intensity of all components showed a decreasing trend in the dom from nansi lake which indicating that each component was effectively bound to cu2 before cu2 added component c5 had the largest fluorescent intensity scores with the increase of cu2 concentration weak fluorescence enhancement occurred at a node of c5 after significant fluorescence quenching which might be due to the change of the molecular environment of fluorescent components with the increase of metal concentration yamashita and jaffé 2008 the most significant fluorescence quenching occurred when the concentration of cu2 was 40 mg l 1 with the increasing of cu2 addition the fluorescence quenching tended to be stable in order to study the mechanism of fluorescence quenching between different components the modified stern volmer equation shown in fig 8c and d were applied to fit the effective quenching constant the good linear relationships between f 0 f 0 f and 1 ccu for all the components in the upper lake and lower lake suggested that the equation described the fluorescence quenching well fig 8 and table 1 the mean logka values for components c1 c5 in dom collected from the upper lake were 3 35 0 06 3 23 0 10 3 36 0 09 3 45 0 09 and 3 47 0 13 respectively the values of logka of components followed the order c5 c4 c3 c1 c2 which suggested that protein like components had a higher binding ability than the humic like components this result was also found in previous studies he et al 2019 moreover the logka values of fluorescence components c1 c5 in dom collected from the lower lake were 3 41 0 04 3 37 0 11 3 49 0 05 3 57 0 19 and 3 47 0 17 respectively among the five components the logka value of protein like component c4 was the largest compared to the others which was similar to the result in the upper lake however the logka values of humic like components c3 were greater than protein like components c5 in dom collected from the lower lake which was different from dom collected from the upper lake this difference might be due to the heterogeneity of dom and different spectral properties chen et al 2020 as shown in fig 8e f and table 1 the good linear relationships between log f 0 f f and logc cu indicated that the site binding equation could also represent the interaction between dom and cu2 the mean logkb value of protein like components c4 logkb 1 30 0 17 and c5 logkb 0 23 0 12 were significantly lower than humic like components c1 logkb 2 09 0 22 c2 logkb 1 82 0 29 and c3 logkb 2 89 0 34 in dom collected from the upper lake a similar phenomenon was also found in dom collected from the lower lake compared with other components of dom collected from the upper lake the humic like component c3 had the largest binding constant logkb 2 89 0 34 while protein like component c5 had the smallest mean logkb value logkb 0 23 0 12 this result suggested that the complexes of protein like components and cu2 had slightly lower stability compared with humic like components all of the dom in this study had few effective binding sites n 1 however by comparing the binding sites of five components in the different areas of nansi lake it was found that the protein like component c4 in the lower lake and c5 in the upper lake had the smallest mean n value 0 36 0 06 and 0 14 0 04 respectively meanwhile the humic like component c3 had the largest mean n value in the upper lake n 0 87 0 10 and the largest mean n value of component c3 was also found in the lower lake n 0 79 0 08 this result further indicated that although protein like components played a more significant role in fluorescence quenching their stability was weaker than humic like components overall 4 discussion our results showed that the sources of dom from different areas in nansi lake might have some differences which might be related to the natural water environment and the water conservancy projects in nansi lake the degree of humification had some differences between the upper lake and the lower lake according to the previous studies we found that the difference was most likely due to the contaminants carried by the rivers into nansi lake zhang et al 2020a b there were 29 main rivers flowing into the upper lake which brought a large amount of contaminant furthermore the existence of the dam reduces the flow speed of the water in nansi lake thus affecting the distribution and mobility of pollutants in the water therefore compared with the lower lake the upper lake might be more seriously polluted it should benoted that all the dom in nansi lake showed strong characteristics of endogeneity except for the impact of the dam on nansi lake the lake was also responsible for the storage and adjustment of the eastern route of the east line project of water transfer from south to north in china wtsnc zhang et al 2020a b wtsnc changed the natural flow direction of nansi lake which improved the self purification capacity of water the flow of water from south to north might to some extent dilute the pollution in the upper lakes there is no denying these water conservancy projects also made the water environment of nansi lake more complicated and uncontrollable wang et al 2006 additionally this result might also be related to sampling time the high temperature and strong light in summer the rapid growth and decay of aquatic plants and the photodegradation of macromolecules liu et al 2019 apart from the different spectral properties between the upper lake and lower lake we also found the difference in the binding ability in the two areas all of the five components in dom collected from the two areas were quenched indicating that the interaction between dom and cu2 was significant this result was consistent with previous studies which can be ascribed that cu2 has a strongly bind ability with dom through the formation of relatively stable inner sphere complexes hernández et al 2006 xu et al 2013 however due to the heterogeneity of dom studies on dom often obtained inconsistent or even opposite conclusions xu et al 2019 previous studies found that humic like components in dom had a stronger binding ability with heavy metals than protein like components xu et al 2019 this indicated that there were some differences in the complexation between different kinds of dom and organic contaminants in this study protein like components in nansi lake were more sensitive to the addition of cu2 compared with humic like components and the values of logka further proved that the protein like component was more susceptive to cu2 than the humic like component nansi lake is a typical macrophyte dominated lake which is mainly distributed in northern china different from eutrophic algae dominated lakes located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river macrophyte dominated lakes are largely dominated by submerged plants such as potamogeton crispus l p crispus which produces high biomass and has shown potential to take up considerable amounts of heavy metals during its growing period sivaci et al 2008 deng et al 2016 however heavy metals were discharged back into the water due to the death and decomposition of submerged plants the study has been reported that the protein like components have a higher binding ability than humic like components in macrophyte dominated lake which suggested submerged plants have a great influence on the dom metal binding ability lü et al 2019 by comparing the logka values of components in nansi lake we found that the complexation constant of all the components in the upper lake was smaller than those in the lower lake indicating that dom collected from the lower lake had a higher cu2 binding ability this result might be caused by both the water conservancy projects and the different density of submerged plants in different lake areas in summary the water conservancy projects had a certaindegree impact on the sources and structures of dom in nansi lake partially due to the death and decomposition of submerged plants in summer the changes in water flow might be caused by wtsnc and other reasons all the dom in nansi lake showed strong characteristics of endogeneity and the protein like components in the two areas were more susceptive to the addition of cu2 than humic like components 5 conclusions eem parafac analysis showed different spectral properties of dom in the two areas separated by a large water hydraulic project a total of five fluorescent components were identified in the two areas of nansi lake including two protein like components c4 c5 and three humic like components c1 c2 and c3 the relative content of humic like components decreases from north to south in nansi lake the results of metal titration experiments showed that the components in different areas had different degrees of

5062,interaction between dissolved organic matter dom and heavy metals have been widely studied and the differences in dom properties have a great impact on the capacity of dom metals binding in this study the samples were collected from the upper lake and lower lake in nansi lake respectively according to the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of component to the total fluorescence intensity f max in the two areas obvious differences were found in the properties of dom the content of humic like substances showed a decreasing trend from the north to south in nansi lake on this basis samples from north and south ends of nansi lake were selected for fluorescence titration all components were quenched with the increasing of cu2 addition combining the results of synchronous fluorescence sf spectra with two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos fluorescent quenching near 275 nm was quicker than the changes that occurred at the wavelength that after 275 nm which suggested that the complexation occurred firstly for protein like components as compared with humic like components the modified stern volmer model suggested that protein like components had larger effective quenching constants logka 3 47 0 13 for component c5 in the upper lake and logka 3 57 0 19 for component c4 in the lower lake than humic like components and it is not affected by the region indicating that protein like substances might have a higher metal binding potential than humic like substances in nansi lake the binding constants and the binding sites suggested that humic like components also had a nonnegligible binding potential in nansi lake although the protein like components revealed a stronger binding ability in fluorescence quenching keywords dissolved organic matter dom cu2 2d cos parafac fluorescence quenching 1 introduction lake is the most important reservoir or sinks of pollutants from its basin by way of runoff and sediments transportation compared with the overlying water most of the contaminants were stored in the sediments sheykhi and moore 2013 siev et al 2018 as an active and extractable fraction in lake sediments dissolved organic matter dom is a key factor in the material and energy cycling in the aquatic ecosystem xu et al 2013 chen and hur 2015 with the rapid economic development many shallow freshwater lakes are suffering from severe eutrophication and heavy metal pollution as well as the abundance of contaminants is enhanced in lake sediments wen et al 2016 unlike other contaminants heavy metals accumulate in organisms and sediments over time which cannot be biodegraded li et al 2010 lynch et al 2016 as a typical heavy metal in the aquatic system the concentration of copper cu can largely reflect the impact of human activities such as agricultural runoff and industrial discharges cu2 in the aquatic environment passes through the food chain and accumulates in the organisms excessive cu2 will cause great harm to human health such as destroying the metabolic system and inducing cancers jarup and akesson 2009 lynch et al 2016 in addition cu2 can make a significant effect on most substances in dom and the interaction between dom and heavy metal can be characterized clearly xu et al 2013 he et al 2019 previous studies have shown that the mobility of organic pollutant was largely depended on organic ligands gu and karthikeyan 2008 for instance dom serves as a medium for the distribution and transport of heavy metals and interact with heavy metals to form dom metal complexes which strongly affect the form distribution and bioavailability of heavy metals guo et al 2012 therefore studies on the ability of dom cu binding are essential for further understanding the fate and ecotoxicity of cu2 in the aquatic system reports on the ability of dom and heavy metals binding are not uncommon he et al 2019 demonstrated that polysaccharide lignin and protein like substances in groundwater dom were effectively bound with organic pollutant in comparison xu et al 2019 found a more significant binding property for humic fulvic like components in sediment dom these inconsistent or reverse results usually due to different metal species and dom sources xu et al 2013 the distribution of heavy metals and source of dom was affected by many factors previous studies have considered the effects of aquatic vegetation and human activities such as pollutant emissions on the dom metal binding ability xu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 it is necessary to investigate the dom metals binding property in the complex hydrological environment caused by multiple factors especially those lakes with the unique shape and the existence of large water conservancy projects which might lead to significant differences in dom sources and structures thus affecting the ability of dom metal binding kinds of techniques have been used to study the reciprocities between contaminants and dom such as solid phase microextraction synchronous fluorescence quenching sf and dialysis equilibrium haftka et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 and sfhas been widely used due to its sensitivity non destructivity and simplicity meanwhile two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos was employed to further analyse the problem of peak overlap moreover the excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis eem parafac were applied to analyse the interaction of dom to the addition of metal bai et al 2017 we selected cu2 as the representative metal in this study and collected samples from the upper and the lower lake in nansi lake respectively fluorescence titration eem parafac uv vis spectra and 2d cos were applied to provide an in depth study of the heterogeneous binding properties of cu2 onto dom the main objectives of this work are as follows 1 to compare the differences in characteristics of dom from different lake regions 2 to compare different cu dom binding properties in different lake areas 3 to discuss possible reasons for the results in this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples from different areas in nansi lake nansi lake a long narrow lake with 125 km long from north to south and 6 25 km wide from east to west is the largest lake in shandong province china the lake was divided into an upper lake and a lower lake separated by a dam built in 1975 in addition this lake is a storage hub for the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project zhang et al 2020a b a total of 34 sampling sites were set in nansi lake 116 33 e 117 21 e 34 22 n 35 22 n there were 19 sites in the upper lake and 15 sites in the lower lake fig 1 a grab sampler was employed to collect surface sediments 0 5 cm in july of 2019 the samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve after freeze drying for further processing all of the samples were sifted and mixed with milli q water solid liquid ratio 1 10 on an oscillator at 25 c for 24 h the mixed liquid was centrifugated at 4500 g for 20 min and the suspension liquid was filtered with 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane to obtain the dom xu et al 2019 dom dialysis was performed for 24 h to remove ions and small molecules by dialysis bags with an aperture of 3500 da 2 2 fluorescence quenching titration a copper sino pharm chemical reagent co shanghai china stock solution was prepared with a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 different concentrations of cu2 stock solution was added into several 20 ml brown sealed bottles containing 10 ml of dom a certain amount of potassium chloride kcl ph of 6 5 solution as the background solution which can control the ion strength and ensure a better binding effect was added to ensure the eventual volume of 20 ml doc at 10 mg l 1 kcl at 10 mm and cu2 at 0 240 mg l 1 additionally the natural level of cu2 is generally lower than applied herein because a higher concentration of cu2 can better characterise the complexation reaction bai et al 2017 the ph values of the solutions were adjusted to avoid precipitation ohno et al 2008 eventually all samples were shaken in the dark for 24 h by using eem uv vis absorption and synchronous fluorescence sf spectra relevant information about the solutions were obtained yamashita and jaffé 2008 2 3 fluorescence and absorbance measurement fluorescence spectra eems and sf spectra were detected by a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies tokyo japan the scanning excitation ex and emission em are from 250 nm to 550 nm with 5 nm intervals for eems and the ex wavelength scope is from 200 nm to 450 nm with a constant offset 60 nm for sf spectra bai et al 2017 uv vis absorption spectra were measured from 200 to 800 nm with intervals at 1 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550 the absorption coefficient at 254 nm is usually used to represent the relative abundance of dom song et al 2015 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 2d cos analysis 2d cos was detected by sf spectroscopy to further analyse the information on dom cu complexation in the synchronous 2d correlation spectrum an autopeak intensity always appears at the diagonal position and is positive suggesting the overall extent of spectral intensity variation in contrast a positive crosspeak at λ1 λ2 indicate possible coupling or correlation at λ1 or λ2 and the negative peak at λ1 λ2 indicate an inconsistent trend at λ1 and λ2 noda 2016 in the asynchronous map if the wavelength pair of λ1 and λ2 changed synchronously then the positive crosspeak at λ1 λ2 indicated that the intensity changed at λ1 takes precedence over λ2 while the negative crosspeak at λ1 λ2 indicated that the intensity changed at λ1 took place later than λ2 noda 2016 2 4 2 parafac modelling parafac was used to analyse the different interaction between dom components and cu2 parafac can separate eems data into individual fluorescent components the basic properties of individual fluorophores are determined by the emission em and excitation ex of different components the dreem toolbox of matlab r2018b was used for parafac modelling more about the parafac model can be found elsewhere yamashita and jaffé 2008 stedmon and bro 2008 2 4 3 complexation modeling the modified stern volmer equation was applied to estimate the parameters related to the fluorescence quenching of different dom components hays et al 2004 guo et al 2012 the modified stern volmer equation is shown as eq 1 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k a c cu 1 f here f 0 and f represent the fluorescence intensities in the lack and existence of cu2 mol l 1 respectively ka and f signify the quenching constant and the initial spectral intensities respectively in order to further study the interaction between cu2 and dom fluorescence components the site binding equation was used to investigate the stability constant and the binding sites of dom components as eq 2 log f 0 f f log k b n log c cu kb and n represent the binding constant and the binding site number respectively 2 4 4 fluorescence index three fluorescence indices were used in the present study including fi fluorescence index bix biological index and hix humification index the fi bix and hix have defined as the ratios of fluorescence intensity at 470 to 520 nm both excited at 370 nm 380 to 430 nm both excited at 310 nm 435 480 to 300 345 nm both excited at 225 nm respectively the more description of the relevant content has been described elsewhere huguet et al 2009 3 results 3 1 characteristics of dom from nansi lake as shown in fig 2 a and b the distribution of the docextracted from sediments and a 254 were similar in nansi lake most of the high values were found in the upper lake especially at the northern end the mean value of doc in the upper lake was 31 59 1 94 mg l 1 in the upper lake and 26 65 3 47 mg l 1 in the lower lake meanwhile the mean value of a 254 in the upper lake was 15 27 1 18 higher than 10 54 1 45 in the lower lake these differences indicated that the relative abundance of dom in the upper lake is greater than that in the lower lake it should be noted that a high doc and a 254 value was also found near the island in the lower lake which might be related to pollution caused by human tourism the relative contribution of different sources to dom was analysed by combining fluorescence index fi bix and hix fig 2d e the values of fi bix and hix in the upper lake had ranges of 2 27 2 47 0 71 0 85 and 2 65 7 82 moreover ranges of the mean values were 2 35 0 01 0 77 0 01 and 5 38 0 31 respectively while the fi bix and hix in the lower lake were between 2 10 and 2 49 0 68 0 88 and 1 62 4 30 and the mean values were 2 37 0 03 0 81 0 02 and 3 13 0 28 respectively as a whole the fi value of each site in nansi lake was greater than 1 9 showing obvious endogenous characteristics jaffé et al 2004 the strong characteristics of endogeneity probably connected to the growth and decomposition of macrophyte in nansi lake with plenty of sunshine and precipitation in the summer previous studies have reported that a higher value of bix signifies that dom has a stronger endogenous characteristic zhou et al 2015 the values of bix in the lower lake were significantly higher than the values in the upper lake p 0 05 which suggested some differences in the degree of endogenous characteristics moreover the hix values were generally less than 6 in nansi lake indicating a low degree of humification however compared with the values of hix in the lower lake the hix values in the upper lake were significantly higher p 0 05 indicating a stronger degree of humification in the north of nansi lake eem is an important index to characterise the source and composition of dom eems of the upper lake and lower lake are shown in fig 3 there are generally five visible fluorescence peaks including peak t em ex 340 275 nm peak d em ex 340 225 nm peak m em ex 410 300 nm peak a em ex 420 250 nm and peak c em ex 445 350 nm generally peak t and peak d are supposed to be protein like substances in contrast peak m peak a and peak c are considered to be humic like substances it is generally believed that peak a peak c and peak m are mainly formed by fulvic and humic like fluorophores whereas peak t and peak d are composed of tyrosine and tryptophan like fluorophores respectively murphy et al 2008 conspicuous different spectral characteristics in eem were measured among samples collected from the two areas in nansi lake in the upper lake the fluorescence intensity of peak a is significantly higher than other peaks while peak d in the lower lake shows strong fluorescence intensity indicating that the properties of dom in the two areas might be different a total of five components were obtained by parafac model including three humic like components and two protein like components the ex and em of each component were shown in fig 4 the positions of components c2 ex em 260 320 400 nm and c3 ex em 230 430 nm were similar to humic like peak a and peak m yamashita and jaffé 2008 components c4 ex em 280 330 nm and c5 ex em 225 340 nm correspond to protein like peak t and peak d in eems lee et al 2003 murphy et al 2008 kowalczuk et al 2010 meanwhile the positions of components c1 ex em 260 350 450 nm was roughly the same as the peaks a and c which can be characterised as humic like components williams et al 2010 zhou et al 2016 as shown in fig 5 correlation analysis showed that humic like components c1 c2 and c3 have an extremely significant positive correlation p 0 01 which suggested that the material sources of these components are similar meanwhile the protein like components c4 and c5 also showed a significant positive correlation p 0 001 which indicated that the origins of c4 and c5 are also very similar and the significant correlation between humic like components c1 c2 and a 254 suggested that humic like substances may be the main substances that affect the relative abundance of dom p 0 05 the mean values of total fluorescence intensities in the upper lake and lower lake were 8 50 0 21 6 51 0 88 qsu respectively this result which was similar to the result of doc and a 254 further illustrated that the concentration of doms decreased from the upper lake to the lower lake in addition the content of humic like substances decreased from north to south in nansi lake fig 2c as another major substance of the dom the spatial variability of the content of protein like substance had an opposite trendto that of humic like substances the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of component to the total fluorescence intensity f max of the humic like components c1 c2 and c3 in the upper lake was obviously higher than in the lower lake p 0 01 all the results reflected the difference in the sources of the dom collected from different areas in nansi lake 3 2 fluorescence quenching 3 2 1 sf and uv vis absorption spectra the effect of cu2 on dom and display information about dom changes can indicate by sf spectra wei et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 a and b with the increasing of cu2 addition sf spectra changed significantly in all the dom the peaks at 275 nm and 350 nm in sf spectra were both significantly quenched in the upper lake and the lower lake which can be attributed to the variation in the electronic structure of the dom hur and lee 2011 as opposed to the fluorescence quenching at 275 nm and 350 nm the fluorescence intensities of the peaks at 230 nm had various degrees of increasing with the addition of cu2 the fluorescence enhancement might be caused by the interactions between high levels of cu2 and inorganic and other organic components yamashita and jaffé 2008 further research suggested that the behaviour of spectral changes in dom exhibited obvious differences the more significant quenching effect at 275 nm than that at 350 nm indicating that the contribution of protein like substances in corresponding regions to the overall fluorescence quenching effect was greater than that of humic like substances at 350 nm this result was also found in other studies which indicates that the binding sites between cu2 and dom might be uneven protein like substances were more sensitive to the change of cu2 concentration than humic like substances guo et al 2018 the changes of uv vis absorption spectra with the addition of cu2 were shown in fig 6c and d the absorbance of all the doms showed a trend of gradual increase with the addition of the metal titrant which might be caused by the changes in the microbial environment of dom bai et al 2008 similar results were also found in previous studies xu et al 2013 3 2 2 2d cos of sf spectra although the fluorescence quenching information can be obtained intuitively through the sf spectra the information such as detailed binding sites and the sequence of binding cannot be obtained cui et al 2020 for dom collected from the upper lake there were three positive autopeaks at 225 225 nm 275 275 nm and 350 350 nm along the diagonal line of the synchronous map fig 7 a meanwhile one positive crosspeak at 275 350 nm and two negative crosspeaks at 275 225 nm and 350 225 nm were found respectively the positive crosspeak at 275 350 nm suggested that the two positive autopeaks at 275 275 nm and 350 350 nm had the consistent direction of spectral changes decreased with cu2 addition while the two negative crosspeaks at 275 225 nm and 350 225 nm indicated that different direction of spectral changes between the positive autopeak at 225 225 nm with other two as shown in fig 7c autopeaks at 230 230 nm 275 275 nm 350 nm 350 nm and crosspeaks at 275 350 nm 275 230 nm 350 230 nm with similar patterns were also found in dom collected from the lower lake which was consistent with the change of sf spectra due to the changing trend of spectral at 230 nm was different from the quenching trend near 275 nm and 350 nm and the part related to fluorescence enhancement was not explained in the asynchronous map in fig 7b a negative crosspeaks at 350 280 nm was obtained under the diagonal line in dom collected from the upper lake and a negative crosspeaks at 320 280 nm was found in dom collected from the lower lake fig 7d all the results of 2d cos suggested that fluorescent quenching near 275 nm was quicker than the changes that occurred at the wavelength that after 275 nm in the sf spectra thus protein like substances were firstly binding to heavy metals as compared with humic like substances in nansi lake regardless of dom source 3 3 metal binding abilities of parafac components fig 8 a and b showed the alterations in fluorescent intensity scores of parafac derived components with increasing metal addition for dom collected from the upper lake and lower lake respectively the fluorescence intensity of all components showed a decreasing trend in the dom from nansi lake which indicating that each component was effectively bound to cu2 before cu2 added component c5 had the largest fluorescent intensity scores with the increase of cu2 concentration weak fluorescence enhancement occurred at a node of c5 after significant fluorescence quenching which might be due to the change of the molecular environment of fluorescent components with the increase of metal concentration yamashita and jaffé 2008 the most significant fluorescence quenching occurred when the concentration of cu2 was 40 mg l 1 with the increasing of cu2 addition the fluorescence quenching tended to be stable in order to study the mechanism of fluorescence quenching between different components the modified stern volmer equation shown in fig 8c and d were applied to fit the effective quenching constant the good linear relationships between f 0 f 0 f and 1 ccu for all the components in the upper lake and lower lake suggested that the equation described the fluorescence quenching well fig 8 and table 1 the mean logka values for components c1 c5 in dom collected from the upper lake were 3 35 0 06 3 23 0 10 3 36 0 09 3 45 0 09 and 3 47 0 13 respectively the values of logka of components followed the order c5 c4 c3 c1 c2 which suggested that protein like components had a higher binding ability than the humic like components this result was also found in previous studies he et al 2019 moreover the logka values of fluorescence components c1 c5 in dom collected from the lower lake were 3 41 0 04 3 37 0 11 3 49 0 05 3 57 0 19 and 3 47 0 17 respectively among the five components the logka value of protein like component c4 was the largest compared to the others which was similar to the result in the upper lake however the logka values of humic like components c3 were greater than protein like components c5 in dom collected from the lower lake which was different from dom collected from the upper lake this difference might be due to the heterogeneity of dom and different spectral properties chen et al 2020 as shown in fig 8e f and table 1 the good linear relationships between log f 0 f f and logc cu indicated that the site binding equation could also represent the interaction between dom and cu2 the mean logkb value of protein like components c4 logkb 1 30 0 17 and c5 logkb 0 23 0 12 were significantly lower than humic like components c1 logkb 2 09 0 22 c2 logkb 1 82 0 29 and c3 logkb 2 89 0 34 in dom collected from the upper lake a similar phenomenon was also found in dom collected from the lower lake compared with other components of dom collected from the upper lake the humic like component c3 had the largest binding constant logkb 2 89 0 34 while protein like component c5 had the smallest mean logkb value logkb 0 23 0 12 this result suggested that the complexes of protein like components and cu2 had slightly lower stability compared with humic like components all of the dom in this study had few effective binding sites n 1 however by comparing the binding sites of five components in the different areas of nansi lake it was found that the protein like component c4 in the lower lake and c5 in the upper lake had the smallest mean n value 0 36 0 06 and 0 14 0 04 respectively meanwhile the humic like component c3 had the largest mean n value in the upper lake n 0 87 0 10 and the largest mean n value of component c3 was also found in the lower lake n 0 79 0 08 this result further indicated that although protein like components played a more significant role in fluorescence quenching their stability was weaker than humic like components overall 4 discussion our results showed that the sources of dom from different areas in nansi lake might have some differences which might be related to the natural water environment and the water conservancy projects in nansi lake the degree of humification had some differences between the upper lake and the lower lake according to the previous studies we found that the difference was most likely due to the contaminants carried by the rivers into nansi lake zhang et al 2020a b there were 29 main rivers flowing into the upper lake which brought a large amount of contaminant furthermore the existence of the dam reduces the flow speed of the water in nansi lake thus affecting the distribution and mobility of pollutants in the water therefore compared with the lower lake the upper lake might be more seriously polluted it should benoted that all the dom in nansi lake showed strong characteristics of endogeneity except for the impact of the dam on nansi lake the lake was also responsible for the storage and adjustment of the eastern route of the east line project of water transfer from south to north in china wtsnc zhang et al 2020a b wtsnc changed the natural flow direction of nansi lake which improved the self purification capacity of water the flow of water from south to north might to some extent dilute the pollution in the upper lakes there is no denying these water conservancy projects also made the water environment of nansi lake more complicated and uncontrollable wang et al 2006 additionally this result might also be related to sampling time the high temperature and strong light in summer the rapid growth and decay of aquatic plants and the photodegradation of macromolecules liu et al 2019 apart from the different spectral properties between the upper lake and lower lake we also found the difference in the binding ability in the two areas all of the five components in dom collected from the two areas were quenched indicating that the interaction between dom and cu2 was significant this result was consistent with previous studies which can be ascribed that cu2 has a strongly bind ability with dom through the formation of relatively stable inner sphere complexes hernández et al 2006 xu et al 2013 however due to the heterogeneity of dom studies on dom often obtained inconsistent or even opposite conclusions xu et al 2019 previous studies found that humic like components in dom had a stronger binding ability with heavy metals than protein like components xu et al 2019 this indicated that there were some differences in the complexation between different kinds of dom and organic contaminants in this study protein like components in nansi lake were more sensitive to the addition of cu2 compared with humic like components and the values of logka further proved that the protein like component was more susceptive to cu2 than the humic like component nansi lake is a typical macrophyte dominated lake which is mainly distributed in northern china different from eutrophic algae dominated lakes located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river macrophyte dominated lakes are largely dominated by submerged plants such as potamogeton crispus l p crispus which produces high biomass and has shown potential to take up considerable amounts of heavy metals during its growing period sivaci et al 2008 deng et al 2016 however heavy metals were discharged back into the water due to the death and decomposition of submerged plants the study has been reported that the protein like components have a higher binding ability than humic like components in macrophyte dominated lake which suggested submerged plants have a great influence on the dom metal binding ability lü et al 2019 by comparing the logka values of components in nansi lake we found that the complexation constant of all the components in the upper lake was smaller than those in the lower lake indicating that dom collected from the lower lake had a higher cu2 binding ability this result might be caused by both the water conservancy projects and the different density of submerged plants in different lake areas in summary the water conservancy projects had a certaindegree impact on the sources and structures of dom in nansi lake partially due to the death and decomposition of submerged plants in summer the changes in water flow might be caused by wtsnc and other reasons all the dom in nansi lake showed strong characteristics of endogeneity and the protein like components in the two areas were more susceptive to the addition of cu2 than humic like components 5 conclusions eem parafac analysis showed different spectral properties of dom in the two areas separated by a large water hydraulic project a total of five fluorescent components were identified in the two areas of nansi lake including two protein like components c4 c5 and three humic like components c1 c2 and c3 the relative content of humic like components decreases from north to south in nansi lake the results of metal titration experiments showed that the components in different areas had different degrees of fluorescence quenching with cu2 the complexation constant suggested that the protein like components in the whole of nansi lake had a stronger binding ability with cu2 than humic like components and a higher cu2 binding ability of dom appeared in the lower lake credit authorship contribution statement haoyu ren writing original draft formal analysis investigation xin yao writing review editing

5063,in lakes of the northern great plains algae blooms are of great concern due to the recent increase of streamflow resulting in influx of nutrients particularly phosphorus p the cold sub humid climate and snowmelt hydrology exert strong controls on p concentration export and supply in the basin to date few studies have explored the impacts of hydroclimatic conditions on p concentration export and concentration to streamflow relationships in cold region agricultural basins and particularly in the headwater catchments of the devils lake basin this study gains a better understanding of the impacts of hydroclimatic variation on concentration to streamflow relationships between two headwater catchments mauvais coulee 1032 km2 and tributary 3 160 km2 draining to devils lake during the 2017 2018 period high resolution p observations during the first flush of snowmelt runoff are presented the controlling factors of p exports using both field observations and hydroclimatic variability detected by physically based hydrologic simulations are investigated total p is dominated by dissolved p with little contribution from particulate p which is presumed to be locked in an ice matrix in frozen soils the mauvais coulee basin expresses near chemostatic concentration to streamflow relationships in the rising limb of the hydrograph while concentration correlates positively to streamflow in the descending limb our study period has two contrasting water years a wet year 2016 17 and a dry year 2017 18 the wet year experienced high swe snowfall maximum frozen soil conditions and a thick basal ice layer resulting in high snowmelt streamflow while the dry year is characterized by lower swe and absence of frozen soil basal ice causing very little streamflow during the wet year lower mean p concentration are observed compared to the dry year due to the presence of frozen soil basal ice during melt period however the p export is much higher in wet year due to large snowmelt streamflow volume both chemostatic and flushing streamflow to concentration relationships are observed in both years thus the impacts of hydroclimatic conditions to the concentration to streamflow relationship are inconclusive field observations of more extended time periods will be useful to better understand the influence of hydroclimatic variability on the concentration to streamflow relationship keywords chemostatic concentration to streamflow relationships flushing frozen soil 1 introduction water quality is a critical indicator of the health of the overall environment and is

10th largest freshwater lake on earth by surface area 24 500 km2 lake winnipeg stewardship board 2006 mccullough et al 2012 schindler et al 2012 rybreg 2017 in addition to land management practices cold region hydrologic responses via snow accumulation and consequent streamflow with land surface conditions such as frozen soil influence nutrient exports to major channels and wetlands e g ryberg et al 2014 mahmood et al 2017 van hoy et al 2020 however our knowledge of the connections between hydroclimatic responses precipitation and streamflow and nutrient exports is quite limited and based on few field observations thus a comprehensive well coordinated and high resolution field based observation on cold region hydroclimatology and in stream phosphorus concentrations is needed to investigate the impacts of hydroclimatic responses on phosphorus concentration and export significant progress has been made in modeling p export from agricultural lands but it remains a major scientific challenge especially in cold regions with semiarid continental climates e g johnes 1996 johnes et al 1996 johnes and heathwaite 1997 mcgunkin et al 1999 determination of nutrient exports in cold region agricultural basins is particularly difficult using traditional models such as swat hspf mike she sparrow agnps and dwsm model failures are anticipated due to inadequate representation of cold region processes such as redistribution of snow and frozen soil infiltration poor understanding of the connection between streamflow and nutrient concentration at the basin scale and lack of information about the land management practices and their influence on hydrology and nutrient export in addition climatic extremes resulting in highly variable precipitation and subsequent streamflow fluctuations rain on snow events freeze and thaw cycling and the absence presence and extent of a basal ice layer exerts a strong impact on nutrient exports to the stream baulch et al 2019 in the ngp snowmelt is the major contributor to annual streamflow and often accounts for 80 of the annual runoff hansen et al 2000 liu et al 2013 dumanski et al 2015 ali et al 2017 snowmelt runoff is also a major exporter of nutrients and the mechanism of nutrient export is complex partly due to the frozen state of the soils dead or dormant vegetation and the low kinetic energy associated with snowmelt compared to falling rain flaten 2016 baulch et al 2019 initially the snowpack is the primary source of nutrients but soil and surface plant debris become more important as snowmelt progresses due to the thawing of soils and basal ice resulting in more direct contact between overland flow and soil matrix quinton and pomeroy 2006 koiter et al 2013 suggested three major sources topsoil streambanks and shale bedrock of in stream suspended sediments across the south tobacco creek stc watershed in southern manitoba canada based on geochemical and radionuclide fingerprinting while the topsoil contribution from the stc agricultural field is very high 64 85 at upstream headwater basins the suspended sediments at the basin outlet are coming from streambank 32 51 and shale bedrock 29 40 sources koiter et al 2013 to date there are no model or quantitative frameworks available to represent cold region processes and soil nutrient snowmelt water interactions adequately thus insights from a comprehensive study using high resolution concentration to streamflow relationships adequate hydro climatological data and cold region hydrologic simulation can assist in better understanding of p export and its dependence on climate and land management practices as will be shown below understanding the concentration to streamflow relationship is very useful to decipher the mechanism of p export the use of concentration to streamflow relationship is also convenient as both concentration and streamflow data are readily available via scientific agencies and can be measured in the field several studies have observed the different concentration to streamflow relationships and provided a mechanistic explanation of them stamm et al 1998 preedy et al 2001 sinaj et al 2002 three possible concentration to streamflow relationships identified during the spring snowmelt season are 1 dilution 2 flushing and 3 chemostatic dilution occurs when the p concentrations display a strong and negative correlation with the streamflow it is normally observed during rainfall events as water stored in a catchment is diluted by less concentrated atmospheric waters godsey et al 2009 herndon et al 2015 on the contrary flushing represents the enrichment of nutrients with streamflow a strong positive correlation that depends entirely on the streamflow mahmood et al 2015 in flushing there will be a constant increase of p concentration as the level of streamflow increases indicating continuous increment of p supply with streamflow johnson et al 1969 flushing and dilution produce dependent relationships between concentration and streamflow dependent concentration to streamflow relationships have sometimes been shown to differ cyclically between rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph resulting in hysteresis behavior evan and davies 1998 finally in a chemostatic response concentration remains invariant as streamflow fluctuates godsey et al 2009 basu et al 2010 hunsaker and jonhson 2017 chemostatic relationships may have a few different causes chemostatic relationships may arise from a steady state condition between the dissolution kinetics of nutrients in a homogeneous source such as soil and the stream water velocity haygarth et al 2004 in this case the very slow draining of soil water source water prevents the exchange of nutrient between soil and solution haygarth et al 2004 this relationship also can be attributed to the release and subsequent transport of nutrients due to low flow velocities chemostatic characteristics of catchments godsey et al 2009 basu et al 2010 with emergent biogeochemical stationarity at the annual scale basu et al 2010 are also reflected in independent relationships to date no studies identify the critical factors of nutrient export in cold regions using well coordinated high resolution field observations of p concentration and physically based numerical simulation moreover the impacts of extreme spring hydroclimatic responses on p export in the headwater catchments of the devils lake basin dlb are seldom investigated in addition the dlb is no longer a closed basin recent installation of two outlets connected the dlb with the greater rrb via the sheyenne river basin thus the water quality of the dlb is of special scientific and environmental interest across state and international boundaries the objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of the impacts of hydroclimatic variation on the mechanisms of phosphorus export from the headwaters of the dlb during the 2016 2018 period specifically the current study aims to identify the mechanism of p export by investigating hydrological processes such as snow accumulations and streamflow generation this study presents high quality p observations during summer low flow events and more importantly during the first flush of snowmelt runoff the most critical time for nutrient export han et al 2010 liu et al 2013 2 study area the study was conducted in two sub catchments in the headwaters of the devils lake basin north dakota located in the eastern part of the great plains of north america figs 1 and 2 devils lake basin is a sub basin of the red river of the north basin a transboundary watershed in the eastern part of the northern great plains the devils lake basin has been considered a closed basin however two artificial outlets have been recently installed todhunter and fietzek devries 2016 vecchia 2011 the substantial rise in water surface elevation in the 1990s and 2000s inundated millions of acres of farmland the installations of outlets were intended to prevent a catastrophic spill into the sheyenne river the sheyenne river is a tributary of the red river which flows into lake winnipeg in manitoba canada the devils lake basin has a cold dry continental climate following the thornthwaite climate classification system todhunter and fietzek devries 2016 van hoy et al 2020 the study area is at mid latitude is semiarid has low relief and endures cold winters for nutrient export hydrology is the most crucial element streamflow and precipitation are often but not always strongly correlated both fluctuate from year to year and both are highly seasonal mean annual precipitation varied greatly over the last few decades mean annual precipitation during 1951 1980 1981 2010 2010 2017 were 466 mm 579 mm and 518 mm respectively todhunter fietzek devries 2016 van hoy et al 2020 figs 3 and 4 present the fluctuation of streamflow for the last two decades average annual peak streamflow from the gage usgs id 05056100 is 27 m3 s and is usually dominated by spring snowmelt from late march to mid april base flow contribution is very small in this region due to the low permeability of the soils wiche and pusc 1994 vecchia 2002 2008 over the last two decades observed streamflow at usgs gages was highly variable from year to year in both basins figs 3 and 4 at mauvais coulee basin there have been eight years of peak discharge values 40 m3 s which are temporally consistent with peak discharge values 15 m3 s in tributary 3 figs 3 and 4 show three major hydrologic regimes 1998 2004 2005 2011 and 2012 16 based on streamflow fluctuations during the 1998 2004 period annual and peak streamflows were very low due to drought e g mahmood et al 2017 while streamflow volumes and peaks were very high during the 2005 2011 period due to an increase in precipitation mahmood et al 2017 van hoy et al 2020 however the streamflow amount recessed again during the 2012 2016 period due to lack of snowfall and high evaporation van hoy et al 2020 interestingly streamflow is not well correlated with annual precipitation instead the association is very high with annual snowfall while weak correlation exists with rainfall van hoy et al

and gently sloping the study sites lie entirely in the northern glaciated plains the modern landscape was formed by the wisconsinan glacier with contributions from other small streams carrying

includes a wide range of land cover types cultivated crops agricultural fields forest grasslands wetlands and developed land resolution land characteristic 2006 fig 2c grasslands and slightly wooded areas are primarily located in the low valleys of the basin surrounding channels and open water agricultural fields in the area produce a variety of crops including wheat barley canola sunflower corn beans and soybeans bryce et al 1998 natural resources conservation services 2007 van hoy et al 2020 throughout the study site small wetlands are surrounded by a mixture of grass and cattails and increased in size and number during the recent wet periods todhunter and rundquist 2008 in the northern great plains tillage practices vary due to differences in climate traditions and policy and are gradually changing with time recently in the canadian prairies direct seeding is increasingly replacing conventional tillage clearwater and ranjan 2016 conventional tillage practices occur in the fall of the year loosening soils and limiting stubble resulting in less snow accumulation and lowering the soil moisture clearwater and ranjan 2016 baulch et al 2019 however conservation tillage zero tillage is highly recommended in the ngp because it helps to protect the soils from wind and water erosion and supports the conservation of soil moisture and wildlife habitat baulch et al 2019 land cover and tillage practices are directly correlated with ecoregions the mauvais coulee basin occupies several ecoregions including the northern black prairie a glacial lake basin and turtle mountain ecoregions tributary 3 covers two ecoregions northern black prairie and a drift plain u s environmental protection agency 1998 bryce et al 1998 vandeberg et al 2015 fig 2d the northern black prairie covers most of the catchment extending just east of the turtle mountains nearly to the red river of the north this ecoregion consists of wooded areas grasslands sloughs and rolling hills u s environmental protection agency 1998 bryce et al 1998 the former basin of glacial lake cando extends north to south roughly in the center of towner county this ecoregion has a flat topography and

locations van hoy et al 2020 across the basin during the early winter months of the years 2016 17 and 2017 18 surveys were conducted three to four times a season with the final survey being conducted just before spring snowmelt and the start of streamflow march 26th for 2017 and march 29th for 2018 most sites were chosen at random to try to create a representative distribution over the entire basin van hoy et al 2020 in the turtle mountains area two sites were identified because it was believed that this area would have different snow accumulations due to the greater elevation differences fig 2b during each site visit a metric prairie snow sampler geo scientific ltd designed after the environment canada esc 30 was used to measure depth and a calibrated snow water equivalent swe scale was used to measure swe additionally to check swe scale accuracy swe was also calculated using a gravimetric approach sturm et al 2010 van hoy et al 2020 gravimetric swe was in good agreement with the scale so the more numerous scale measurements are used here the united states geological survey usgs stream gauging network provided stream discharge data for this study mauvais coulee id 05 056 100 and tributary 3 id 05056060 the usgs estimates streamflow using hydrometric gauging thomas personal communication 2017 the latitude and longitude coordinates for the mauvais coulee gage are 48 44 n and 99 09 w while tributary 3 s gage is located at 48 46 n and 99 22 w in cold regions the streamflow gauges are usually seasonal due to the presence of substantial amounts of ice in streams normally streamflow gauging commences when ice in the stream begins to melt and break up during the spring march or april and ceases in the late fall november when freezing of stream water starts having unknown amounts of ice and snow in the stream lead to significant uncertainties when the spring flow initially begins during times of high flow the discharge was measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler attached to a floating platform which measured the width depth and velocity across the channel simultaneously thomas personal communication 2017 throughout the year onsite discharge measurements were taken approximately every seven weeks for verification and calibration purposes thomas personal communication 2017 water sampling was conducted primarily at the outlets of the two watersheds mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 during the 2017 march 31st april 16th and 2018 april 24th may 7th spring snowmelt runoff events water samples were collected three times daily during low flow months may october water samples were collected twice a month each site was sampled for both forms of phosphorus p total p tp and total dissolved p tdp tdp is a portion obtained by filtration removing the particulate p in the lab particulate p is calculated by subtracting the amount of tdp from tp particulate p is absorbed in sediments plants and animals water samples were collected using a nasco swing sampler during each sampling time two samples of 250 ml of water were collected in hydrochloric acid washed polyethylene bottles fisher scientific samples for tdp measurement were filtered using a 0 45 µm water filter dispos a filter by geotech and peristaltic pump geopump peristaltic pump by geotech filtered water samples were preserved immediately using 2 ml per liter of concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 the collected samples were then stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of 4 c and preserved for a maximum of 28 days total phosphorus method 8190 hach company 2017 the actual load of p per unit watershed area transported through a river cross section during a time interval is calculated by eq 1 quilbé et al 2006 1 l 1 a t 1 t q t c t where l is annual load in kg km2 a is the watershed area and t is the hourly time step which starts when streamflow begins after melting of ice in the stream and t t when the stream froze again at the beginning of the winter season the q t is streamflow measurement at each time step while c t is concentration measurement at time t note that if c t is not available for any step c t 1 is considered for c t the collection of a representative and reliable soil sample for p analysis requires a predetermination of sampling depth sampling intensity and locations of representative nutrient applications in agricultural fields throughout the mauvais coulee basin soil cores were collected from the same locations where snow surveys were conducted during the spring seasons after snow survey of 2017 and 2018 these sites were selected because these areas were an adequate representation of the land cover uses of the basin in tributary 3 sites were selected based on the division of the ecoregions which also reflect the land cover uses little et al 2007 in a study in the canadian prairies showed strong correlations between p concentrations in runoff from agricultural lands and soil p concentration within 15 cm depth accordingly soil cores were collected using a soil core sampler grainer inc at a depth of 15 cm this occurred after harvest when fields were more accessible agvise laboratories once the soils were collected they were placed in an air limited soil sample bag provided by agvise laboratories and stored in a cooler until delivered to northwood north dakota agvise laboratory for analysis breker personal communication 2017 3 2 laboratory analyses tp and tdp were determined as orthophosphate using the total phosphorus hach method 8190 hach company 2017 this method uses a mixture of sulfuric acid and persulfate to convert organic phosphates to orthophosphates a 25 ml sample along with 2 ml of 5 25 n sulfuric acid and a powder pillow of potassium persulfate were loaded into a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask and the sample was then gently boiled for 30 min on a hot plate for digestion to occur immediately after 30 min the sample was removed from the hot plate and allowed to cool for at least 5 min the total phosphorus method 8190 was followed by the reactive phosphorus orthophosphates method 8190 to determine the phosphorus concentration within the sample 2 ml of 1 54 n sodium hydroxide was added to complete oxidation 10 ml of the sample along with a phosver 3 powder pillow was added to the measuring vial and stirred for at least 5 min to ensure oxidation hach company 2017 samples were then inserted into the spectrophotometer and results were determined three samples along with a blank to zero the spectrophotometer were analyzed at a time and all results were expressed as p in milligrams per liter mg l a 1 0 mg l phosphate standard solution was used to calibrate the instrument prior to analyzing multiple samples the instrument was zeroed and run with a reagent blank consisting of the deionized water in place of the sample soils were analyzed for olsen phosphorus by agvise laboratories in northwood north dakota using the olsen p test developed by dr sterling olsen in 1954 frank et al 2011 this method used 2 g of soil mixed with 40 ml of extracting solution 0 5 m nahco3 shaken at 200 epm excursions per minute for 30 min the sample was then filtered through no 2 filter paper once the solution cleared 5 ml was diluted with 15 ml of distilled water 5 ml of the diluted solution was mixed with an acid molybdate stock solution and was allowed 10 min to process for color development after the color stabilized for at least 2 h they were inserted into the spectrophotometer and results were presented in ppm of p olsen et al 1954 frank et al 2011 in cold regions especially in areas with sandy and loam soils olsen p is a good indicator of plant available phosphorus in surface soils olsen et al 1954 withers et al 2017 reported a strong correlation between soluble reactive phosphorus srp and tdp runoff with the changes of olsen p concentrations of srp reduced an average of 71 by lowering the soil olsen p withers et al 2017 another study conducted in the canadian prairies reported a positive correlation between concentrations of tdp and olsen p during both snowmelt and rainfall events liu et al 2019 3 3 statistical analyses we utilize coefficient of determination r 2 also known as square of the pearson correlation coefficient r pearson correlation coefficient r pearson 1895 mean x the slope of linear regression m significance of correlation p fisher 1958 to analyze concentration to streamflow relationships and student s t test helsel and hirsch 2002 concentration to streamflow relationships for dissolved phosphorus were interpreted to inform the impacts of hydro climatically different years on the concentration to streamflow relationship the r2 values range anywhere from 0 to 1 in the context of current study a higher r 2 value indicates that more of the variance in nutrients is explained by streamflow the r values were used to find the strength and direction of correlation between nutrient concentration and streamflow while the r values vary between 1 and 1 slope values from linear regression between c and q were used to describe the relationship observed in the rising limb a slope m of 1 would suggest that concentrations varied inversely with discharge and dilution being the dominant processes controlling concentrations hunsaker and jonhson 2017 slopes m of zero suggested chemostatic behavior in a watershed indicating invariable concentrations as discharge fluctuates godsey et al 2009 however limits of chemostatic behavior are defined as 0 1 m 0 by herndon et al 2015 note that the watersheds in godsey et al 2009 and herndon et al 2015 are located in mountainous landscapes whereas the current study dealt with catchments of flat and prairie landscape in addition to r r 2 and slopes m we also investigated the statistical significance of the concentration to streamflow relationship a p 0 05 indicates a significant correlation between streamflow and nutrient concentration the significance p and strength r 2 of the concentration to streamflow relationship varied considerably depending on the streamflow in addition we conducted student s t tests using minitab software arend 1993 to determine whether the mean of tdp of 2016 2017 water year is statistically different from the mean of the 2017 2018 water year concentration data 3 4 cold region hydrology model the cold region hydrology model crhm is a physically based model that was specifically designed to have the ability to represent cold region hydrological processes through physically based processes representations pomeroy et al 2007 mahmood et al 2017 crhm has a flexible modular design and is spatially distributed based on hydrological response units hrus allowing for fine scale resolution and parameterization a hru is a basin that is classified and or grouped together by a certain characteristic i e agricultural field prairie forested area wetland open water developed land etc and is a basic unit of calculation crhm has been tested in the canadian prairies in many recent studies to examine drought conditions fang and pomeroy 2007 2008 areas with a high concentration of wetlands fang et al 2010 van hoy et al 2020 and areas dominated by agricultural land corderiro et al 2017 mahmood et al 2017 table 1 presents a complete set of crhm modules used to build the mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 basin models van hoy et al 2020 built the mauvais coulee basin model for 2004 17 period using modules of table 1 in this study we used the climatic forcing file for 2017 18 with the model set up from van hoy et al s 2020 2016 17 model run to better understand the streamflow generation mechanism which ultimately hints at the possible nutrient export mechanism in this study we also compiled a tributary 3 model using the modules of table 1 and operated the model during 2016 2018 period the infiltration and soil modules are very important for the current study given their representations of soil conditions such as soil moisture and frozen soil status which ultimately affect soil melt water contact opportunity and influences nutrient export as explained in more detail in the results and discussion section the soil module approximates moisture balance slough storage overland flow and subsurface flow pomeroy et al 2007 dornes et al 2008 fang et al 2010 2013 van hoy et al 2020 this module used a three layered approach the top layer collects water from wetlands snowmelt and rainfall and outputs it to crops through transpiration the middle layer receives water from the overlying layer while allowing outputs through transpiration and or percolation to the underlying layer the third layer is a groundwater reservoir that outputs water to stream as base flow the soil module ensures that evapotranspiration et does not exceed the interception of wetland storage and soil withdrawal characteristics mahmood et al 2017 van hoy et al 2020 the infiltration module presents soil conditions year round during the non winter months this module interprets unfrozen soil infiltration rainfall based on soil thickness texture and agricultural tillage ayers 1959 during the winter months this module interprets soil conditions based on three types of infiltration into frozen soil restricted limited and unlimited the frozen soil restricted class is an impermeable layer having minimal infiltration resulting in meltwater going to et or runoff pomeroy et al 2007 if swe values are under 5 mm the model will use unfrozen soil parameters pomeroy et al 2007 van hoy et al 2020 limited infiltration depends highly on snow cover water equivalent and amounts of frozen water in the first 30 cm of soil gray et al 1986 pomeroy et al 2007 van hoy et al 2020 chrm only allows for six winter snowmelt events over 5 mm before changing to restricted infiltration and the melt becomes runoff pomeroy et al 2007 van hoy et al 2020 when melt amounts are 5 mm water infiltrates using unfrozen soil conditions after the occurrence of a large melt event if the temperature is 10 infiltration will automatically change to restricted because the model assumes ice lens formation will occur restricting infiltration unlimited soil infiltrations occur when the snow melts entirely resulting in infiltration of melt and rainfall water ayers 1959 pomeroy et al 2007 van hoy et al 2020 this module is necessary given it is designed to handle conditions that are specific to cold regions and it identifies the infiltration capacity during wet and dry years van hoy et al 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 cold region hydrology fig 5 presents the box plots of swe across all sampling sites prior to spring snowmelt during mar 26 2017 and mar 29 2018 note that a median swe observed prior to the onset of streamflow provides an estimate regarding the amount of streamflow the swe of 52 6 mm observed on march 26 2017 corresponds well to the 56 mm interpreted from snowmelt streamflow beginning on march 31 2017 this suggests that our spatially distributed swe observations were adequate considering the spatiotemporal uncertainty in both streamflow and swe measurements in 2016 2017 water year infiltration during spring snowmelt was restricted due to frozen soil conditions and the presence of a basal ice layer suggesting very little vertical percolation simulated in van hoy et al 2020 in contrast 2018 had 41 4 mm of median swe prior to spring snowmelt which resulted in only 4 mm snowmelt streamflow in the mauvais coulee basin low snowmelt streamflow can be attributed to large infiltration due to a lack of frozen soil area basal ice layer in addition the duration between the current study s final snow survey date march 29 2018 and commencement of streamflow april 24 was three weeks allowing some sublimation and subsequent snow erosion and bare soil exposures to occur in summary 2016 17 was a hydro climatologically wet year as it had high swe and snowmelt induced streamflow while 2017 18 was hydro climatologically dry year due to lack of snow accumulation and low snowmelt streamflow we believe such a pronounced difference in hydroclimatology between these years can influence nutrient concentration export and concentration to streamflow relationships daily discharge at each gage varied consistently among the years in the two study basins the mauvais coulee basin yields more discharge volume and subsequently contributes larger volumes of water to devils lake than tributary 3 typically the spring snowmelt period is associated with a peak flow in the hydrograph while the low flow characterizes summer and fall months figs 6 and 7 when streamflow is occasionally driven by rainfall events our study period 2016 2018 includes two different hydroclimatic extremes a hydro climatologically wet winter 2016 2017 with a dry summer 2017 fig 6 and a dry winter with a relatively wetter summer 2018 fig 7 snowmelt in 2016 2017 water year produced larger peak discharge in the mauvais coulee basin 73 m3 s and tributary 3 26 m3 s compared to long term mean peak discharge 22 16 m3 s and 11 m3 s for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 respectively high discharge is a result of the high mean snow water equivalent swe measured prior to the beginning of streamflow 52 6 cm after which streamflow declined and remained nearly constant base flow by groundwater for the rest of the hydrological year in 2017 2018 water year snowmelt produced 95 less discharge than in 2016 2017 water year in the mauvais coulee basin a relatively wet summer 2018 produced higher discharge peaks 12 12 m3 s than the dry 2017 2018 winter 2 66 m3 s in tributary 3 we also observed a wet summer 2018 producing a higher peak discharge 3 42 m3 s than that of the dry winter 1 06 m3 s however mean discharge rates were lower in the summer 0 37 m3 s and slightly higher in the winter 0 71 m3 s suggesting that in late summer and early fall streams are becoming disconnected upstream resulting in the limited water supply overall the water year 2016 2017 is hydrologically wet having larger volume and higher peak in both basins than that of 2017 2018 we believe such a difference in streamflow between hydrologically wet and dry influences nutrient concentration and load 4 2 water chemistry water chemistry showed considerable variation in p concentrations among the two rivers mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 and hydrological years 2016 17 and 2017 18 fig 8 in addition during a hydrological year p concentrations of spring season were noticeably different from those of summer exhibiting elevated concentration during the spring snowmelt event and low concentration throughout the summer season interestingly the results indicated a significant amount of dissolved p 95 5 and very little particulate p contribution to total p from the two basins in both spring and summer seasons the high dissolved p and very low particulate p contribution to total p in snowmelt streamflow indicate most dissolved p has an organic origin such as dead or dormant vegetation and crop residues of previous years jensen et al 2011 baulch et al 2019 this occurs because snowmelt water interacts more with organic matter when the amount of exposed soil is greatest conversely the p concentration is lower when the direct contact with soil is impeded by a basal ice layer in addition the lower streamflow velocity and kinetic energy due to lack of topography flat landscape in the study areas subdue the erosive power of snowmelt runoff resulting in very little erosion of particulate p jensen et al 2011 the sampling frequency of this study is higher three times daily during the spring snowmelt and twice monthly during low flow compared to other studies in the ngp which sampled more during rain events than snowmelt streamflow events corriveau et al 2013 also other studies only collected one sample daily e g corriveau et al 2013 in total we collected 84 samples total 168 for dissolved and particulate from mauvais coulee and 66 samples total 132 for dissolved and particulate from tributary 3 during the study period during snowmelt streamflow high flow the concentrations from same day samples often varied significantly particularly during streamflow recession for example the concentration dropped from 1 10 mg l to 0 84 mg l on apr 5 2017 in the mauvais coulee basin approximately 80 of our samples are from spring snowmelt streamflow events note that both watersheds experienced only one basin wide rainfall induced streamflow event july 4 20 2018 fig 7 the peak flows in both basins for this rainfall streamflow event are substantially lower than peak flows of snowmelt streamflow of 2016 2017 water year unfortunately we collected only three samples during this event and did not observe any spike in particulate contribution to total p nevertheless dissolved p contribution to total p was far greater than that of particulate p during the spring snowmelt event the importance of dissolved p becomes evident given 95 of the nutrient is in the dissolved form conversely other studies conducted in the prairie pothole region of southwestern manitoba showed a smaller dissolved p contribution 53 and more particulate p ali et al 2017 rattan et al 2019 this may be due to the impact of the steeper slope of the pembina escarpment known as manitoba escarpment in canada allowing sediments to be more easily eroded during the snowmelt runoff event since our samples had a very little particulate contribution we will describe only tdp in the following discussion student s t tests of differences between mean tdp concentrations in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 using minitab software arend 1993 resulted in statistically significant 0 05 significance level differences for both mauvais coulee and tributary 3 the tdp concentrations of both years had normal distributions mean tdp concentrations were typically higher for tributary 3 0 45 mg l and 0 61 mg l for 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 while having the maximum concentration of 0 85 mg l the maximum concentration for the mauvais coulee basin was 0 73 mg l the maximum concentration in both basins was detected from samples collected during 2018 fig 8 the maximum and mean values of mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 are consistent with other studies mean 0 35 0 6 mg l maximum 1 2 mg l in the northern great plains during the snowmelt event liu et al 2013 mean tdp concentration of the tributary 3 watershed agrees with the reported tdp of the stc similar size of tributary 3 in mahmood et al 2015 however the particulate p concentration was not comparable to the concentration of the current study suggesting the pembina escarpment has more of an impact than initially inferred mahmood et al 2015 there was a significant difference in mean concentrations for both basins among the hydrological years mean concentrations were considerably lower during the hydrologically wet year of 2016 2017 but increased dramatically during the hydrologically dry year of 2017 2018 21 and 52 for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 figs 8 and 9 suggesting nutrient sources availability and the permeability of the soils have a more significant effect on nutrient concentrations baulch et al 2019 low concentration during wet years can also be attributed to dilution due to high runoff volume while during dry years tdp concentration is not diluted due to limited runoff volume this can also be attributed to limited interactions between snowmelt waters and soil due to frozen soil basal ice during wet spring 2017 while more interaction was achieved between soil and snowmelt during the 2018 spring season the basal ice layer prevents direct contact between soil and snowmelt water resulting in slow tdp in contrast to spring snowmelt basins showed relatively low tdp concentrations with an occasional small tdp increase during the summer low flow season due to a rainfall event corriveau et al 2013 yates et al 2014 suggesting the source of major p during the low flow season is groundwater there is no significant difference in tdp mean concentrations supported by student s t test during the low flow months between two hydrological years and the range of tdp concentration is from 0 60 to 70 mg l in both basins total phosphorus concentrations mean 0 7 mg l are substantially higher than vandeberg et al 2015 whose study has reported tp mean concentrations 0 31 0 36 mg l during the low flow seasons 2007 2011 from the mauvais coulee basin table 2 shows the spatial mean maximum and minimum olsen p values for the mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 basin olsen p concentrations from johnston 2006 for north dakota soil samples collected during 2001 and 2005 have also been included to show our data compares with others estimates of the soil p concentration are within the range 5 200 ppm of other reported soil p concentration in other studies in the ngp barica 1987 johnston 2006 baulch et al 2019 and the ngp soil samples have naturally high concentrations in soil p barica 1987 johnston et al 2006 baulch et al 2019 olsen p concentrations exhibited uneven spatial distribution throughout two study basins with higher concentrations observed in downslope landscapes wilson et al 2016 highest concentrations 95 and 75 ppm were observed in the northwestern part of the mauvais coulee basin eastern slope of the turtle mountains the lowest concentrations 6 ppm were observed in the most eastern portion of the mauvais coulee basin where the landscape is flat and predominantly grasslands low median concentrations of p 10 and 11 ppm for 2001 and 2005 reported in johnston 2006 were compared to the current study 33 and 32 5 ppm for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 the difference in median concentration the data from our study is higher than johnston 2006 between two studies can be due to a large number of samples collected over a large area by johnston 2006 the number of samples are 38 450 and 66 887 for 2001 and 2005 respectively whereas this study analyzed only ten samples in the mauvais coulee basin and four in tributary 3 in addition spatial heterogeneity and site characteristics are also responsible for the difference in concentration to determine the atmospheric contribution of p snow samples were collected from various locations and analyzed for both 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 water year lab results showed a minor atmospheric contribution with a tdp mean concentration of 0 045 mg l thus based on p concentration in soil and accumulated snow the soil is the most likely source of p in the streamflow water as soil p concentration is three orders of magnitude greater than snow p concentration note that soil p in the top 15 cm is a mixture of soil particles and organic matter from crop residues jensen et al 2011 4 3 annual export the magnitude of the annual p export varied as a function of land management practices and hydrological conditions comparisons of the p load amongst both basins and the two hydrological years in general show high seasonality between or among the spring snowmelt and summer low flow season in 2016 2017 water year higher p export during the spring snowmelt event for both basins was associated with higher streamflow 13 97 kg km2 and 31 81 kg km2 for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 and contributed most 80 to the annual p load 16 41 kg km2 and 36 53 kg km2 for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 however during the 2017 2018 hydrological year the summer p load 4 34 kg km2 and 4 21 kg km2 for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 contributed most to the annual p load 4 88 kg km2 and 6 97 kg km2 for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 it is not uncommon to observe years when snowmelt delivered low portions of the total load e g corriveau et al 2013 to also have unusually high summer and fall precipitation however p load was usually higher during periods of high snowmelt discharge years e g corriveau et al 2013 similarly unusual years such as 2002 having higher summer rainfall runoff load than spring snowmelt load generally spring snowmelt load is much higher than summer rainfall runoff load as seen in this study as well was reported in mahmood et al 2015 the p export per unit area for tributary 3 36 53 kg km2 in 2016 2017 6 97 kg km2 in 2017 2018 was greater than the mauvais coulee basin 16 41 in 2016 2017 4 88 kg km2 in 2017 2018 in the ngp watersheds are mainly composed of agricultural fields with patches of forest cover and grasslands suggesting the possible release of p from plant tissues and soil sources p load in the mauvais coulee basin during the wet year 16 41 c9080kg km2 is consistent mauvais coulee basin is slightly higher with the load observed in the seine watershed in southern manitoba which exports 11 8 kg km2 p from 504 km2 watershed area corriveau et al 2013 however loads are much smaller than those measured in the la salle 62 8 kg km2 basin area 1800 km2 and little morris 62 kg km2 basin area 982 km2 watersheds corriveau et al 2013 such difference may be due to differences in hydrological variables such as streamflow depth between two study sites mahmood et al 2015 working in a smaller basin reported twice the amount of total p export than corriveau et al 2013 but similar to those found here in mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 respectively p load in the tributary 3 basin during the wet year is comparable to the load of the stc basin reported in corriveau et al 2013 considering the dynamics of the hydrology in the ngp the total p export resulted in seasonal variability between the headwaters load at upstream subbasin at relatively higher altitude and the floodplains region load downstream outlet for the entire basin however observations from previous studies e g mahmood et al 2015 indicated an increase in nutrients load across the ngp and may be attributable to recent climatic wetting baeumler and gupta 2020 and increased agricultural activities mccullough et al 2012 schindler et al 2012 rybreg 2017 our findings show dissolved p dominated nutrient loads from two streams in dlb during spring snowmelt season which differ from results in mahmood et al 2015 and in rattan et al 2019 rattan et al 2019 reported particulate dominated p load from seven streams in manitoba during 2013 very wet and 2014 spring season 4 4 concentration streamflow relationships fig 9 represents concentration to streamflow relationships for the two watersheds of the current study during the 2016 17 and 2017 18 water years with hourly streamflow measured in cubic meters per second m3 s top annual middle spring snowmelt streamflow and bottom summer season rows of fig 9 show concentration tdp to streamflow relationships overall during a water year top row moderate r and low p 0 05 were detected between tdp and streamflow indicating statistically significant correlation and the dominance of flushing in both water years and basins fig 9 the m value detected during 2017 18 is much higher than 2016 17 water year suggesting a higher intensity of flushing during 2018 in both basins fig 9 likewise in both watersheds the mean tdp concentration during 2017 18 water year is also 2016 17 water year we suspect that higher intensity of flushing during 2017 18 water year is due to the fact that the snowmelt runoff flows were allowed to have adequate direct contact with soil during 2017 18 water year jensen et al 2011 in the following we describe the concentration to streamflow relationships for the spring snowmelt streamflow shown in the middle row of fig 9 4 4 1 rising limbs in each rising limb the data show little change in concentration of dissolved p as streamflow increases sharply until peak discharge after which both concentrations and streamflow begin to decline in the mauvais coulee basin no significant relationship was found between dissolved p and streamflow as indicated by low r and m values of the regressions 0 30 during the 2016 2017 and 2017 18 period however at tributary 3 a high r 0 96 r 2 value 0 93 and slope 0 32 from linear regression during the 2017 18 snowmelt event showed a strong association between streamflow and dissolved p indicating intense flushing in the mauvais coulee basin slopes of the linear regressions in the rising limbs were close to zero for both years exhibiting nearly chemostatic behavior godsey et al 2009 fig 9 however regression slope in the mauvais coulee basin during 2016 2017 0 00001 were much closer to zero than that of 2017 2018 0 043 suggesting that mauvais coulee basin was less chemostatic in 2017 2018 godsey et al 2009 herndon et al 2015 due to basal ice layers restricting contact time between soil and meltwater affecting nutrient transport amarawansha et al 2015 baulch et al 2019 4 4 2 recession limbs in contrast to the rising limb after the onset of peak discharge the concentration of dissolved p began to decline among both the basins and in both hydrological years positive linear relationships were observed in the mauvais coulee basin both high r 0 6 in 2016 2017 and 0 85 in 2017 2018 and r 2 values 0 36 in 2016 2017 and 0 73 in 2017 2018 indicate strong flushing likewise tributary 3 also showed a positive and strong concentration to streamflow relationship during two water years although the slopes of linear regressions were steeper in 2017 18 water year m 0 17 indicating more strong soil flushing in 2016 2017 water year m 0 02 more subdued soil flushing occurred affecting nutrient transport the weak low r r2 and m values concentration to streamflow relationships were previously discussed at the catchment scale godsey et al 2009 mahmood et al 2015 and the field scale roste 2015 interestingly roste 2015 reported a regression slope of 0 03 suggesting chemostatic behavior for dissolved p in the tobacco creek basin like godsey et al 2009 a log log plot approach of the concentration to streamflow data was used by our study to verify the absence of a concentration to streamflow relationship through a small range of concentrations and a wide range of flows similar ranges of chemistry and flows were observed and suggested that chemistry varied nearly as much as the flows did roste 2015 however concentration to streamflow observations at the headwater mid basin and larger basin scale presented a clearer relationship with basin area while the invariant chemical supply becomes apparent mahmood et al 2015 in the current study two obvious relationships were observed one in the rising limb chemostatic and one in the recession limb flushing haygarth et al 2004 reported that a weak concentration to streamflow correlation for p may emerge from a steady state condition between the dissolution kinetics of p in a homogeneous source such as soil or snowpack and in stream water velocity haygarth et al 2004 in this scenario the sluggish draining of soil water source water inhibited any exchange of p between soil and solution haygarth et al 2004 the weaker concentration to streamflow relationship also could have been due to the release and subsequent export of nutrients driven by low flow velocities 4 5 impacts of hydroclimatic conditions the two water years during the current study showed contrasting hydroclimatological responses as noted previously in the hydrology section the water year 2016 17 is characterized by high snow accumulation subsequent snowmelt streamflow and very little summer streamflow in contrast during the 2017 18 water year very dry conditions during the winter season resulted in low snow accumulation and negligible amounts of spring snowmelt runoff however there was a rainfall runoff event during the 2018 summer which is uncommon in the study area in the mauvais coulee basin annual streamflow for 2016 17 was 64 mm while it was only 21 mm during the 2017 18 season likewise in tributary 3 annual streamflow during 2016 17 and 2017 18 were 121 mm and 23 mm respectively to gain further insight into hydroclimatological responses the two watersheds were simulated using a physically based cold region hydrologic model the simulations for both basins were simultaneously compared against swe observations and basin outlet streamflow table 3 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nses nash and sutcliffe 1970 between observed and simulated swe are 0 7 and 0 8 during 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 winters respectively indicating strong model performance note that the observation days of this study were limited to four 2016 2017 and three 2017 2018 days that included both peak swe and swe prior to snowmelt streamflow the basin averaged simulated swe and outlet annual streamflow volumes agreed well with observations in both basins table 3 fig 10 shows the frozen soil or basal ice layer status in the mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 during the spring streamflow period for each simulation year the y axis represents the ratio of frozen soil or basal ice area to the total basin area we believe these results have important implications for nutrient behavior in a changing climate our crhm model suggests that hydroclimatic conditions govern the streamflow and soil melt water contact opportunity which directly influences mechanism concentration and load of p being exported from the study area hence we can expect different consequences for the basins for devils lake and presumably for much of the ngp in general depending on how climate fluctuates in the future observations during both years exhibited peak maxima concentrations 2016 2017 0 52 mg l and 0 61 mg l 2017 2018 0 72 mg l and 0 84 mg l for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 respectively during the snowmelt discharge event fig 6 while minimal concentrations were recorded during the summer low flows 2016 2017 0 18 mg l and 0 26 mg l 2017 2018 0 18 mg l and 0 43 mg l for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 respectively such intra annual variability high concentration in spring snowmelt season and low concentration in summer season is consistent with the observations in other basins across the world aubert et al 2013 dupas et al 2016 fig 8 fig 8 shows the median concentration for a dry year 2017 2018 and is consistently higher than that of a wet year 2016 17 in both basins studied during the spring snowmelt seasons however annual tdp export per unit basin area for a wet year is also substantially higher than a dry as the annual streamflow volume for the wet year greatly exceeds that of a dry year fig 8 nutrient losses and concentrations in surface runoff depend on discharge contact with sources and transport mechanism e g dilution during 2016 2017 thick swe accumulations before the onset of discharge resulted in high volumes of streamflow and subsequently carried greater total loads of p while smaller snowmelt runoff exported little p during a dry year extreme p export during wet years is not uncommon in the case of the ngp generally during the first part of the 2000s 2000 2004 the annual load was low with invariant streamflow and nutrient contributions whereas nutrient exports were much higher in 2006 2007 and 2010 2011 during wet hydrologic years mahmood et al 2015 this study s results on the impacts of wet and dry years on p concentration and annual export also agree with a study recently conducted in broughton s creek manitoba that assessed the impacts of hydroclimatic conditions i e wet 2013 or dry 2014 on p concentrations of downstream water bodies haque et al 2018 haque et al 2018 also reported low p concentrations during the wet year 2013 and relatively higher p concentration during a dry year that is consistent with the findings of this study our study also agrees with baeumler and gupta 2020 which concludes that the recent increase in nitrogen load are predominantly driven by wet climate and minimally due to changes in land use and land management practice the following is an explanation involving snowmelt streamflow and soil meltwater contact opportunity for contrasting p concentration and export between wet and dry years 4 5 1 high snowmelt and subsequent streamflow lower mean and median concentration during wet years can be attributed to high swe accumulation and snowmelt runoff this study concludes that higher overland snowmelt water slightly dilutes the p concentration before being exported to the stream in the streams large volumes of streamflow from the melting of snow in agricultural fields and stream banks further dilutes the p concentration ultimately resulting in lower p concentration during wet years in contrast during dry years snow is thin and patchy during spring snowmelt contributing little runoff with which to dilute p 4 5 2 soil and snowmelt water contact opportunity fig 10 shows the crhm modeled frozen soil or basal ice layer status in the mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 during the spring streamflow period for each simulation year the y axis represents the ratio of frozen soil or basal ice area to the total basin area during the wet year in both basins the entire basin was frozen due to frozen soil or the presence of basal ice layer prior to the start of spring snowmelt runoff while both the soils of the basins were exposed well before the start of spring snowmelt runoff such contrasting frozen status between the wet and dry years is due to very high snow accumulation basin wide 52 2 mm prior to streamflow start and less erosion during the wet year while the dry year has little snow accumulation and relatively small snow erosion this study indicates that prior to discharge the completely frozen presence of basal ice layer limits the contact time and interaction opportunity between soils and meltwaters resulting in considerably higher total loads and medians concentrations quinton and pomeroy 2006 costa et al 2017 baulch et al 2019 however in 2018 due to the absence of a frozen soil basal ice layer fig 10 aided by small snow accumulation less swe and thinner snow cover gradual release of snowmelt water allowed plenty of contact time and interaction opportunity with soils resulting in a higher p concentration in stream water lilbaek and pomeroy 2010 the influence of contact time between snowmelt water and soil on stream water p concentration was also demonstrated in a field scale study conducted in alberta canada monitoring the relationship among soil test p stp with runoff tp from eight small watersheds over three years little et al 2007 the small watersheds were uniformly managed and had no farmland or agricultural influences soil samples were recovered during the fall and measured against spring snowmelt water chemistry while soil samples from the late spring were measured with water chemistry of the summer low flow a strong linear relationship was observed between stp and tp concluding the interaction of soil to runoff meltwaters little et al 2007 further soil conditions and relative swe cover throughout the study site showed a significant impact on the concentration to streamflow relationships during spring snowmelt in both hydrological years note that during spring snowmelt atmospheric temperatures fluctuated causing meltwater to flow during the day while slowing or ceasing in the evening when temperatures dropped below freezing this freeze thaw cycle created a pulsing effect no p was exported at night when the stream was frozen but p export increased throughout the day when thawing occurred the high volume snowmelt runoff and discharge observed in 2016 2017 and the low volume of 2017 2018 water year would lead one to think of either a flushing or dilution relationship to occur during spring snowmelt however the freeze thaw cycle of the soils affects water chemistry while limiting the cycling and exporting of nutrients groffman et al 2001 bechmann et al 2005 matzner and borken 2008 messiga et al 2010 based on the pulsing phenomenon previously described resulting in nearly chemostatic behavior the extent of chemostatic behavior can be explained by the frozen conditions of the soils fig 10 in mauvais coulee basin 2017 soils were completely frozen and presented a near chemostatic behavior which was stronger than that of 2018 where soils were partly thawed almost displaying a flushing relationship as seen in tributary 3 this suggested that soils frozen or thawed in fact were the dominant controllers of how nutrients were exported during spring snowmelt 5 conclusions the contribution of concentration to streamflow relationships to understanding nutrient export was previously discussed in other studies around the world however very few studies mention nutrient export in cold regions agricultural basins the objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the impacts of hydroclimatic variation on concentration to streamflow relationships in the headwaters of the dlb while identifying the controlling factors of p exports using both field based observations and hydroclimatic variability detected by physically based hydrologic simulations crhm data suggest that hydroclimatic variation has strong correlations with nutrient export concentrations and total loads but remains highly variable and inconclusive for concentration to streamflow relationships in stream mean water chemistry showed the considerable variation of tdp concentration between the mauvais coulee basin 0 28 and 0 35 mg l for 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and tributary 3 0 45 and 0 61 mg l for 2017 and 2017 these tdp concentrations are consistent with previously reported tdp concentrations in other studies corriveau et al 2013 across the mauvais coulee basin the snowpack presented a low mean concentration of dissolved p 0 045 mg l mean soil p concentration through the study sites was 38 07 mg l while the maximum and minimum concentration from the mauvais coulee basin were 95 mg l and 6 mg l respectively thus this study concludes that the soils are most likely the source of p observed in streamflow waters during major runoff events this study presents the impacts of two years having contrasting hydroclimatic responses on p concentration and subsequent export one year 2016 17 experienced high swe snowfall maximum frozen soil conditions and thick basal ice layer this wet year has low mean concentrations 0 0 28 and 0 45 mg l for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 however this wet year yields high total loads of p 36 53 and 16 41 kg km2 for tributary 3 and mauvais coulee basin during the spring snowmelt event in contrast a dry year 2017 18 had high concentrations 0 35 and 0 61 mg l for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 and low total export loads 6 97 and 4 88 kg km2 for tributary 3 and mauvais coulee basin this suggests that the volume of meltwater runoff influences nutrient loads while the contact and opportunity of interaction time between meltwaters and thawed soils are crucial for concentration values fig 11 the statistical significance of the difference in mean tdp concentrations between wet and dry years is confirmed using student s t test the impacts of hydroclimatic responses on concentration to streamflow relationships are inconclusive but are highly variable during the wet 2016 17 and dry 2017 18 year mauvais coulee basin shows a chemostatic relationship in rising limb and a strong soil flushing relationship in the recession limb however the intensity of flushing is stronger during the dry year than a wet year in the recession limb this study suggests that the concentration to streamflow relationships observed in the rising limbs are highly influenced by the state of the soil conditions frozen or thawed interestingly between both years 2016 17 and 2017 18 we observe the extent of chemostatic behavior where the dry year appeared to be less chemostatic than the wet year in tributary 3 a soil flushing relationship was observed in both the rising and recession limbs during a dry and wet year the p observations loads and their dependency on hydroclimatic variability are consistent with previous studies e g haque et al 2018 across the ngp our findings advance knowledge by providing a mechanistic explanation of p export using the insights from the crhm frozen soil status presence of basal ice layer inferred from the crhm are useful to explain the impacts of hydroclimatic variability on tdp concentration export and concentration to streamflow relationship the current findings have implications for understanding the impacts of hydroclimatic conditions on dissolved p concentration load its relationship with streamflow and mechanism of dissolved p export the findings from our study during both extremely dry and wet years are useful for decision making and nutrient management in the context of future climate change scenario as both extremely dry and wet years and spells are anticipated in future based on the projections of many studies e g rodell et al 2018 the dominance of dissolved p in stream water indicates a plant tissue origin for p which has important implications for agricultural and tillage practices across the dlb the p loads varied significantly between hydrologically wet and dry years which impose huge challenges for nutrient management and provides useful information for landowners

5063,in lakes of the northern great plains algae blooms are of great concern due to the recent increase of streamflow resulting in influx of nutrients particularly phosphorus p the cold sub humid climate and snowmelt hydrology exert strong controls on p concentration export and supply in the basin to date few studies have explored the impacts of hydroclimatic conditions on p concentration export and concentration to streamflow relationships in cold region agricultural basins and particularly in the headwater catchments of the devils lake basin this study gains a better understanding of the impacts of hydroclimatic variation on concentration to streamflow relationships between two headwater catchments mauvais coulee 1032 km2 and tributary 3 160 km2 draining to devils lake during the 2017 2018 period high resolution p observations during the first flush of snowmelt runoff are presented the controlling factors of p exports using both field observations and hydroclimatic variability detected by physically based hydrologic simulations are investigated total p is dominated by dissolved p with little contribution from particulate p which is presumed to be locked in an ice matrix in frozen soils the mauvais coulee basin expresses near chemostatic concentration to streamflow relationships in the rising limb of the hydrograph while concentration correlates positively to streamflow in the descending limb our study period has two contrasting water years a wet year 2016 17 and a dry year 2017 18 the wet year experienced high swe snowfall maximum frozen soil conditions and a thick basal ice layer resulting in high snowmelt streamflow while the dry year is characterized by lower swe and absence of frozen soil basal ice causing very little streamflow during the wet year lower mean p concentration are observed compared to the dry year due to the presence of frozen soil basal ice during melt period however the p export is much higher in wet year due to large snowmelt streamflow volume both chemostatic and flushing streamflow to concentration relationships are observed in both years thus the impacts of hydroclimatic conditions to the concentration to streamflow relationship are inconclusive field observations of more extended time periods will be useful to better understand the influence of hydroclimatic variability on the concentration to streamflow

of algae blooms over the last few decades in many lakes of the northern great plains ngp region can be attributed to elevated phosphorus concentrations partly due to intense land management practices in agricultural and livestock operations corderiro et al 2017 rybreg 2017 for example the red river basin rrb watershed has been identified as the major contributor of nutrients to lake winnipeg the 10th largest freshwater lake on earth by surface area 24 500 km2 lake winnipeg stewardship board 2006 mccullough et al 2012 schindler et al 2012 rybreg 2017 in addition to land management practices cold region hydrologic responses via snow accumulation and consequent streamflow with land surface conditions such as frozen soil influence nutrient exports to major channels and wetlands e g ryberg et al 2014 mahmood et al 2017 van hoy et al 2020 however our knowledge of the connections between hydroclimatic responses precipitation and streamflow and nutrient exports is quite limited and based on few field observations thus a comprehensive well coordinated and high resolution field based observation on cold region hydroclimatology and in stream phosphorus concentrations is needed to investigate the impacts of hydroclimatic responses on phosphorus concentration and export significant progress has been made in modeling p export from agricultural lands but it remains a major scientific challenge especially in cold regions with semiarid continental climates e g johnes 1996 johnes et al 1996 johnes and heathwaite 1997 mcgunkin et al 1999 determination of nutrient exports in cold region agricultural basins is particularly difficult using traditional models such as swat hspf mike she sparrow agnps and dwsm model failures are anticipated due to inadequate representation of cold region processes such as redistribution of snow and frozen soil infiltration poor understanding of the connection between streamflow and nutrient concentration at the basin scale and lack of information about the land management practices and their influence on hydrology and nutrient export in addition climatic extremes resulting in highly variable precipitation and subsequent streamflow fluctuations rain on snow events freeze and thaw cycling and the absence presence and extent of a basal ice layer exerts a strong impact on nutrient exports to the stream baulch et al 2019 in the ngp snowmelt is the major contributor to annual streamflow and often accounts for 80 of the annual runoff hansen et al 2000 liu et al 2013 dumanski et al 2015 ali et al 2017 snowmelt runoff is also a major exporter of nutrients and the mechanism of nutrient export is complex partly due to the frozen state of the soils dead or dormant vegetation and the low kinetic energy associated with snowmelt compared to falling rain flaten 2016 baulch et al 2019 initially the snowpack is the primary source of nutrients but soil and surface plant debris become more important as snowmelt progresses due to the thawing of soils and basal ice resulting in more direct contact between overland flow and soil matrix quinton and pomeroy 2006 koiter et al 2013 suggested three major sources topsoil streambanks and shale bedrock of in stream suspended sediments across the south tobacco creek stc watershed in southern manitoba canada based on geochemical and radionuclide fingerprinting while the topsoil contribution from the stc agricultural field is very high 64 85 at upstream headwater basins the suspended sediments at the basin outlet are coming from streambank 32 51 and shale bedrock 29 40 sources koiter et al 2013 to date there are no model or quantitative frameworks available to represent cold region processes and soil nutrient snowmelt water interactions adequately thus insights from a comprehensive study using high resolution concentration to streamflow relationships adequate hydro climatological data and cold region hydrologic simulation can assist in better understanding of p export and its dependence on climate and land management practices as will be shown below understanding the concentration to streamflow relationship is very useful to decipher the mechanism of p export the use of concentration to streamflow relationship is also convenient as both concentration and streamflow data are readily available via scientific agencies and can be measured in the field several studies have observed the different concentration to streamflow relationships and provided a mechanistic explanation of them stamm et al 1998 preedy et al 2001 sinaj et al 2002 three possible concentration to streamflow relationships identified during the spring snowmelt season are 1 dilution 2 flushing and 3 chemostatic dilution occurs when the p concentrations display a strong and negative correlation with the streamflow it is normally observed during rainfall events as water stored in a catchment is diluted by less concentrated atmospheric waters godsey et al 2009 herndon et al 2015 on the contrary flushing represents the enrichment of nutrients with streamflow a strong positive correlation that depends entirely on the streamflow mahmood et al 2015 in flushing there will be a constant increase of p concentration as the level of streamflow increases indicating continuous increment of p supply with streamflow johnson et al 1969 flushing and dilution produce dependent relationships between concentration and streamflow dependent concentration to streamflow relationships have sometimes been shown to differ cyclically between rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph resulting in hysteresis behavior evan and davies 1998 finally in a chemostatic response concentration remains invariant as streamflow fluctuates godsey et al 2009 basu et al 2010 hunsaker and jonhson 2017 chemostatic relationships may have a few different causes chemostatic relationships may arise from a steady state condition between the dissolution kinetics of nutrients in a homogeneous source such as soil and the stream water velocity haygarth et al 2004 in this case the very slow draining of soil water source water prevents the exchange of nutrient between soil and solution haygarth et al 2004 this relationship also can be attributed to the release and subsequent transport of nutrients due to low flow velocities chemostatic characteristics of catchments godsey et al 2009 basu et al 2010 with emergent biogeochemical stationarity at the annual scale basu et al 2010 are also reflected in independent relationships to date no studies identify the critical factors of nutrient export in cold regions using well coordinated high resolution field observations of p concentration and physically based numerical simulation moreover the impacts of extreme spring hydroclimatic responses on p export in the headwater catchments of the devils lake basin dlb are seldom investigated in addition the dlb is no longer a closed basin recent installation of two outlets connected the dlb with the greater rrb via the sheyenne river basin thus the water quality of the dlb is of special scientific and environmental interest across state and international boundaries the objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of the impacts of hydroclimatic variation on the mechanisms of phosphorus export from the headwaters of the dlb during the 2016 2018 period specifically the current study aims to identify the mechanism of p export by investigating hydrological processes such as snow accumulations and streamflow generation this study presents high quality p observations during summer low flow events and more importantly during the first flush of snowmelt runoff the most critical time for nutrient export han et al 2010 liu et al 2013 2 study area the study was conducted in two sub catchments in the headwaters of the devils lake basin north dakota located in the eastern part of the great plains of north america figs 1 and 2 devils lake basin is a sub basin of the red river of the north basin a transboundary watershed in the eastern part of the northern great plains the devils lake basin has been considered a closed basin however two artificial outlets have been recently installed todhunter and fietzek devries 2016 vecchia 2011 the substantial rise in water surface elevation in the 1990s and 2000s inundated millions of acres of farmland the installations of outlets were intended to prevent a catastrophic spill into the sheyenne river the sheyenne river is a tributary of the red river which flows into lake winnipeg in manitoba canada the devils lake basin has a cold dry continental climate following the thornthwaite climate classification system todhunter and fietzek devries 2016 van hoy et al 2020 the study area is at mid latitude is semiarid has low relief and endures cold winters for nutrient export hydrology is the most crucial element streamflow and precipitation are often but not always strongly correlated both fluctuate from year to year and both are highly seasonal mean annual precipitation varied greatly over the last few decades mean annual precipitation during 1951 1980 1981 2010 2010 2017 were 466 mm 579 mm and 518 mm respectively todhunter fietzek devries 2016 van hoy et al 2020 figs 3 and 4 present the fluctuation of streamflow for the last two decades average annual peak streamflow from the gage usgs id 05056100 is 27 m3 s and is usually dominated by spring snowmelt from late march to mid april base flow contribution is very small in this region due to the low permeability of the soils wiche and pusc 1994 vecchia 2002 2008 over the last two decades observed streamflow at usgs gages was highly variable from year to year in both basins figs 3 and 4 at mauvais coulee basin there have been eight years of peak discharge

fluctuations during the 1998 2004 period annual and peak streamflows were very low due to drought e g mahmood et al 2017 while streamflow volumes and peaks were very high during the 2005 2011 period due to an increase in precipitation mahmood et al 2017 van hoy et al 2020 however the streamflow amount recessed again during the 2012 2016 period due to lack of snowfall and high evaporation van hoy et al 2020 interestingly streamflow is not well correlated with annual precipitation instead the association is very high with annual snowfall while weak correlation exists with rainfall van hoy et al

and gently sloping the study sites lie entirely in the northern glaciated plains the modern landscape was formed by the wisconsinan glacier with contributions from other small streams carrying

areas are primarily located in the low valleys of the basin surrounding channels and open water agricultural fields in the area produce a variety of crops including wheat barley canola sunflower corn beans and soybeans bryce et al 1998 natural resources conservation services 2007 van hoy et al 2020 throughout the study site small wetlands are surrounded by a mixture of grass and cattails and increased in size and number during the recent wet periods todhunter and rundquist 2008 in the northern great plains tillage practices vary due to differences in climate traditions and policy and are gradually changing with time recently in the canadian prairies direct seeding is increasingly replacing conventional tillage clearwater and ranjan 2016 conventional tillage practices occur in the fall of the year loosening soils and limiting stubble resulting in less snow accumulation and lowering the soil moisture clearwater and ranjan 2016 baulch et al 2019 however conservation tillage zero tillage is highly recommended in the ngp because it helps to protect the soils from wind and water erosion and supports the conservation of soil moisture and wildlife habitat baulch et al 2019 land cover and tillage practices are directly correlated with ecoregions the mauvais coulee basin occupies several ecoregions including the northern black prairie a glacial lake basin and turtle mountain ecoregions tributary 3 covers two ecoregions northern black prairie and a drift plain u s environmental protection agency 1998 bryce et al 1998 vandeberg et al 2015 fig 2d the northern black prairie covers most of the catchment extending just east of the turtle mountains nearly to the red river of the north this ecoregion consists of wooded areas grasslands sloughs and rolling hills u s environmental protection agency 1998 bryce et al 1998 the former basin of glacial lake cando extends north to south roughly in the center of towner county this ecoregion has a flat topography and

tallgrass and shortgrass prairies bryce et al 1998 u s environmental protection agency 1998 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrology phosphorus and soil data collection snow surveys were conducted at ten locations van hoy et al 2020 across the basin during the early winter months of the years 2016 17 and 2017 18 surveys were conducted three to four times a season with the final survey being conducted just before spring snowmelt and the start of streamflow march 26th for 2017 and march 29th for 2018 most sites were chosen at random to try to create a representative distribution over the entire basin van hoy et al 2020 in the turtle mountains area two sites were identified because it was believed that this area would have different snow accumulations due to the greater elevation differences fig 2b during each site visit a metric prairie snow sampler geo scientific ltd designed after the environment canada esc 30 was used to measure depth and a calibrated snow water equivalent swe scale was used to measure swe additionally to check swe scale accuracy swe was also calculated using a gravimetric approach sturm et al 2010 van hoy et al 2020 gravimetric swe was in good agreement with the scale so the more numerous scale measurements are used here the united states geological survey usgs stream gauging network provided stream discharge data for this study mauvais coulee id 05 056 100 and tributary 3 id 05056060 the usgs estimates streamflow using hydrometric gauging thomas personal communication 2017 the latitude and longitude coordinates for the mauvais coulee gage are 48 44 n and 99 09 w while tributary 3 s gage is located at 48 46 n and 99 22 w in cold regions the streamflow gauges are usually seasonal due to the presence of substantial amounts of ice in streams normally streamflow gauging commences when ice in the stream begins to melt and break up during the spring march or april and ceases in the late fall november when freezing of stream water starts having unknown amounts of ice and snow in the stream lead to significant uncertainties when the spring flow initially begins during times of high flow the discharge was measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler attached to a floating platform which measured the width depth and velocity across the channel simultaneously thomas personal communication 2017 throughout the year onsite discharge measurements were taken approximately every seven weeks for verification and calibration purposes thomas personal communication 2017 water sampling was conducted primarily at the outlets of the two watersheds mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 during the 2017 march 31st april 16th and 2018 april 24th may 7th spring snowmelt runoff events water samples were collected three times daily during low flow months may october water samples were collected twice a month each site was sampled for both forms of phosphorus p total p tp and total dissolved p tdp tdp is a portion obtained by filtration removing the particulate p in the lab particulate p is calculated by subtracting the amount of tdp from tp particulate p is absorbed in sediments plants and animals water samples were collected using a nasco swing sampler during each sampling time two samples of 250 ml of water were collected in hydrochloric acid washed polyethylene bottles fisher scientific samples for tdp measurement were filtered using a 0 45 µm water filter dispos a filter by geotech and peristaltic pump geopump peristaltic pump by geotech filtered water samples were preserved immediately using 2 ml per liter of concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 the collected samples were then stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of 4 c and preserved for a maximum of 28 days total phosphorus method 8190 hach company 2017 the actual load of p per unit watershed area transported through a river cross section during a time interval is calculated by eq 1 quilbé et al 2006 1 l 1 a t 1 t q t c t where l is annual load in kg km2 a is the watershed area and t is the hourly time step which starts when streamflow begins after melting of ice in the stream and t t when the stream froze again at the beginning of the winter season the q t is streamflow measurement at each time step while c t is concentration measurement at time t note that if c t is not available for any step c t 1 is considered for c t the collection of a representative and reliable soil sample for p analysis requires a predetermination of sampling depth sampling intensity and locations of representative nutrient applications in agricultural fields throughout the mauvais coulee basin soil cores were collected from the same locations where snow surveys were conducted during the spring seasons after snow survey of 2017 and 2018 these sites were selected because these areas were an adequate representation of the land cover uses of the basin in tributary 3 sites were selected based on the division of the ecoregions which also reflect the land cover uses little et al 2007 in a study in the canadian prairies showed strong correlations between p concentrations in runoff from agricultural lands and soil p concentration within 15 cm depth accordingly soil cores were collected using a soil core sampler grainer inc at a depth of 15 cm this occurred after harvest when fields were more accessible agvise laboratories once the soils were collected they were placed in an air limited soil sample bag provided by agvise laboratories and stored in a cooler until delivered to northwood north dakota agvise laboratory for analysis breker personal communication 2017 3 2 laboratory analyses tp and tdp were determined as orthophosphate using the total phosphorus hach method 8190 hach company 2017 this method uses a mixture of sulfuric acid and persulfate to convert organic phosphates to orthophosphates a 25 ml sample along with 2 ml of 5 25 n sulfuric acid and a powder pillow of potassium persulfate were loaded into a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask and the sample was then gently boiled for 30 min on a hot plate for digestion to occur immediately after 30 min the sample was removed from the hot plate and allowed to cool for at least 5 min the total phosphorus method 8190 was followed by the reactive phosphorus orthophosphates method 8190 to determine the phosphorus concentration within the sample 2 ml of 1 54 n sodium hydroxide was added to complete oxidation 10 ml of the sample along with a phosver 3 powder pillow was added to the measuring vial and stirred for at least 5 min to ensure oxidation hach company 2017 samples were then inserted into the spectrophotometer and results were determined three samples along with a blank to zero the spectrophotometer were analyzed at a time and all results were expressed as p in milligrams per liter mg l a 1 0 mg l phosphate standard solution was used to calibrate the instrument prior to analyzing multiple samples the instrument was zeroed and run with a reagent blank consisting of the deionized water in place of the sample soils were analyzed for olsen phosphorus by agvise laboratories in northwood north dakota using the olsen p test developed by dr sterling olsen in 1954 frank et al 2011 this method used 2 g of soil mixed with 40 ml of extracting solution 0 5 m nahco3 shaken at 200 epm excursions per minute for 30 min the sample was then filtered through no 2 filter paper once the solution cleared 5 ml was diluted with 15 ml of distilled water 5 ml of the diluted solution was mixed with an acid molybdate stock solution and was allowed 10 min to process for color development after the color stabilized for at least 2 h they were inserted into the spectrophotometer and results were presented in ppm of p olsen et al 1954 frank et al 2011 in cold regions especially in areas with sandy and loam soils olsen p is a good indicator of plant available phosphorus in surface soils olsen et al 1954 withers et al 2017 reported a strong correlation between soluble reactive phosphorus srp and tdp runoff with the changes of olsen p concentrations of srp reduced an average of 71 by lowering the soil olsen p withers et al 2017 another study conducted in the canadian prairies reported a positive correlation between concentrations of tdp and olsen p during both snowmelt and rainfall events liu et al 2019 3 3 statistical analyses we utilize coefficient of determination r 2 also known as square of the pearson correlation coefficient r pearson correlation coefficient r pearson 1895 mean x the slope of linear regression m significance of correlation p fisher 1958 to analyze concentration to streamflow relationships and student s t test helsel and hirsch 2002 concentration to streamflow relationships for dissolved phosphorus were interpreted to inform the impacts of hydro climatically different years on the concentration to streamflow relationship the r2 values range anywhere from 0 to 1 in the context of current study a higher r 2 value indicates that more of the variance in nutrients is explained by streamflow the r values were used to find the strength and direction of correlation between nutrient concentration and streamflow while the r values vary between 1 and 1 slope values from linear regression between c and q were used to describe the relationship observed in the rising limb a slope m of 1 would suggest that concentrations varied inversely with discharge and dilution being the dominant processes controlling concentrations hunsaker and jonhson 2017 slopes m of zero suggested chemostatic behavior in a watershed indicating invariable concentrations as discharge fluctuates godsey et al 2009 however limits of chemostatic behavior are defined as 0 1 m 0 by herndon et al 2015 note that the watersheds in godsey et al 2009 and herndon et al 2015 are located in mountainous landscapes whereas the current study dealt with catchments of flat and prairie landscape in addition to r r 2 and slopes m we also investigated the statistical significance of the concentration to streamflow relationship a p 0 05 indicates a significant correlation between streamflow and nutrient concentration the significance p and strength r 2 of the concentration to streamflow relationship varied considerably depending on the streamflow in addition we conducted student s t tests using minitab software arend 1993 to determine whether the mean of tdp of 2016 2017 water year is statistically different from the mean of the 2017 2018 water year concentration data 3 4 cold region hydrology model the cold region hydrology model crhm is a physically based model that was specifically designed to have the ability to represent cold region hydrological processes through physically based processes representations pomeroy et al 2007 mahmood et al 2017 crhm has a flexible modular design and is spatially distributed based on hydrological response units hrus allowing for fine scale resolution and parameterization a hru is a basin that is classified and or grouped together by a certain characteristic i e agricultural field prairie forested area wetland open water developed land etc and is a basic unit of calculation crhm has been tested in the canadian prairies in many recent studies to examine drought conditions fang and pomeroy 2007 2008 areas with a high concentration of wetlands fang et al 2010 van hoy et al 2020 and areas dominated by agricultural land corderiro et al 2017 mahmood et al 2017 table 1 presents a complete set of crhm modules used to build the mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 basin models van hoy et al 2020 built the mauvais coulee basin model for 2004 17 period using modules of table 1 in this study we used the climatic forcing file for 2017 18 with the model set up from van hoy et al s 2020 2016 17 model run to better understand the streamflow generation mechanism which ultimately hints at the possible nutrient export mechanism in this study we also compiled a tributary 3 model using the modules of table 1 and operated the model during 2016 2018 period the infiltration and soil modules are very important for the current study given their representations of soil conditions such as soil moisture and frozen soil status which ultimately affect soil melt water contact opportunity and influences nutrient export as explained in more detail in the results and discussion section the soil module approximates moisture balance slough storage overland flow and subsurface flow pomeroy et al 2007 dornes et al 2008 fang et al 2010 2013 van hoy et al 2020 this module used a three layered approach the top layer collects water from wetlands snowmelt and rainfall and outputs it to crops through transpiration the middle layer receives water from the overlying layer while allowing outputs through transpiration and or percolation to the underlying layer the third layer is a groundwater reservoir that outputs water to stream as base flow the soil module ensures that evapotranspiration et does not exceed the interception of wetland storage and soil withdrawal characteristics mahmood et al 2017 van hoy et al 2020 the infiltration module presents soil conditions year round during the non winter months this module interprets unfrozen soil infiltration rainfall based on soil thickness texture and agricultural tillage ayers 1959 during the winter months this module interprets soil conditions based on three types of infiltration into frozen soil restricted limited and unlimited the frozen soil restricted class is an impermeable layer having minimal infiltration resulting in meltwater going to et or runoff pomeroy et al 2007 if swe values are under 5 mm the model will use unfrozen soil parameters pomeroy et al 2007 van hoy et al 2020 limited infiltration depends highly on snow cover water equivalent and amounts of frozen water in the first 30 cm of soil gray et al 1986 pomeroy et al 2007 van hoy et al 2020 chrm only allows for six winter snowmelt events over 5 mm before changing to restricted infiltration and the melt becomes runoff pomeroy et al 2007 van hoy et al 2020 when melt amounts are 5 mm water infiltrates using unfrozen soil conditions after the occurrence of a large melt event if the temperature is 10 infiltration will automatically change to restricted because the model assumes ice lens formation will occur restricting infiltration unlimited soil infiltrations occur when the snow melts entirely resulting in infiltration of melt and rainfall water ayers 1959 pomeroy et al 2007 van hoy et al 2020 this module is necessary given it is designed to handle conditions that are specific to cold regions and it identifies the infiltration capacity during wet and dry years van hoy et al 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 cold region hydrology fig 5 presents the box plots of swe across all sampling sites prior to spring snowmelt during mar 26 2017 and mar 29 2018 note that a median swe observed prior to the onset of streamflow provides an estimate regarding the amount of streamflow the swe of 52 6 mm observed on march 26 2017 corresponds well to the 56 mm interpreted from snowmelt streamflow beginning on march 31 2017 this suggests that our spatially distributed swe observations were adequate considering the spatiotemporal uncertainty in both streamflow and swe measurements in 2016 2017 water year infiltration during spring snowmelt was restricted due to frozen soil conditions and the presence of a basal ice layer suggesting very little vertical percolation simulated in van hoy et al 2020 in contrast 2018 had 41 4 mm of median swe prior to spring snowmelt which resulted in only 4 mm snowmelt streamflow in the mauvais coulee basin low snowmelt streamflow can be attributed to large infiltration due to a lack of frozen soil area basal ice layer in addition the duration between the current study s final snow survey date march 29 2018 and commencement of streamflow april 24 was three weeks allowing some sublimation and subsequent snow erosion and bare soil exposures to occur in summary 2016 17 was a hydro climatologically wet year as it had high swe and snowmelt induced streamflow while 2017 18 was hydro climatologically dry year due to lack of snow accumulation and low snowmelt streamflow we believe such a pronounced difference in hydroclimatology between these years can influence nutrient concentration export and concentration to streamflow relationships daily discharge at each gage varied consistently among the years in the two study basins the mauvais coulee basin yields more discharge volume and subsequently contributes larger volumes of water to devils lake than tributary 3 typically the spring snowmelt period is associated with a peak flow in the hydrograph while the low flow characterizes summer and fall months figs 6 and 7 when streamflow is occasionally driven by rainfall events our study period 2016 2018 includes two different hydroclimatic extremes a hydro climatologically wet winter 2016 2017 with a dry summer 2017 fig 6 and a dry winter with a relatively wetter summer 2018 fig 7 snowmelt in 2016 2017 water year produced larger peak discharge in the mauvais coulee basin 73 m3 s and tributary 3 26 m3 s compared to long term mean peak discharge 22 16 m3 s and 11 m3 s for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 respectively high discharge is a result of the high mean snow water equivalent swe measured prior to the beginning of streamflow 52 6 cm after which streamflow declined and remained nearly constant base flow by groundwater for the rest of the hydrological year in 2017 2018 water year snowmelt produced 95 less discharge than in 2016 2017 water year in the mauvais coulee basin a relatively wet summer 2018 produced higher discharge peaks 12 12 m3 s than the dry 2017 2018 winter 2 66 m3 s in tributary 3 we also observed a wet summer 2018 producing a higher peak discharge 3 42 m3 s than that of the dry winter 1 06 m3 s however mean discharge rates were lower in the summer 0 37 m3 s and slightly higher in the winter 0 71 m3 s suggesting that in late summer and early fall streams are becoming disconnected upstream resulting in the limited water supply overall the water year 2016 2017 is hydrologically wet having larger volume and higher peak in both basins than that of 2017 2018 we believe such a difference in streamflow between hydrologically wet and dry influences nutrient concentration and load 4 2 water chemistry water chemistry showed considerable variation in p concentrations among the two rivers mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 and hydrological years 2016 17 and 2017 18 fig 8 in addition during a hydrological year p concentrations of spring season were noticeably different from those of summer exhibiting elevated concentration during the spring snowmelt event and low concentration throughout the summer season interestingly the results indicated a significant amount of dissolved p 95 5 and very little particulate p contribution to total p from the two basins in both spring and summer seasons the high dissolved p and very low particulate p contribution to total p in snowmelt streamflow indicate most dissolved p has an organic origin such as dead or dormant vegetation and crop residues of previous years jensen et al 2011 baulch et al 2019 this occurs because snowmelt water interacts more with organic matter when the amount of exposed soil is greatest conversely the p concentration is lower when the direct contact with soil is impeded by a basal ice layer in addition the lower streamflow velocity and kinetic energy due to lack of topography flat landscape in the study areas subdue the erosive power of snowmelt runoff resulting in very little erosion of particulate p jensen et al 2011 the sampling frequency of this study is higher three times daily during the spring snowmelt and twice monthly during low flow compared to other studies in the ngp which sampled more during rain events than snowmelt streamflow events corriveau et al 2013 also other studies only collected one sample daily e g corriveau et al 2013 in total we collected 84 samples total 168 for dissolved and particulate from mauvais coulee and 66 samples total 132 for dissolved and particulate from tributary 3 during the study period during snowmelt streamflow high flow the concentrations from same day samples often varied significantly particularly during streamflow recession for example the concentration dropped from 1 10 mg l to 0 84 mg l on apr 5 2017 in the mauvais coulee basin approximately 80 of our samples are from spring snowmelt streamflow events note that both watersheds experienced only one basin wide rainfall induced streamflow event july 4 20 2018 fig 7 the peak flows in both basins for this rainfall streamflow event are substantially lower than peak flows of snowmelt streamflow of 2016 2017 water year unfortunately we collected only three samples during this event and did not observe any spike in particulate contribution to total p nevertheless dissolved p contribution to total p was far greater than that of particulate p during the spring snowmelt event the importance of dissolved p becomes evident given 95 of the nutrient is in the dissolved form conversely other studies conducted in the prairie pothole region of southwestern manitoba showed a smaller dissolved p contribution 53 and more particulate p ali et al 2017 rattan et al 2019 this may be due to the impact of the steeper slope of the pembina escarpment known as manitoba escarpment in canada allowing sediments to be more easily eroded during the snowmelt runoff event since our samples had a very little particulate contribution we will describe only tdp in the following discussion student s t tests of differences between mean tdp concentrations in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 using minitab software arend 1993 resulted in statistically significant 0 05 significance level differences for both mauvais coulee and tributary 3 the tdp concentrations of both years had normal distributions mean tdp concentrations were typically higher for tributary 3 0 45 mg l and 0 61 mg l for 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 while having the maximum concentration of 0 85 mg l the maximum concentration for the mauvais coulee basin was 0 73 mg l the maximum concentration in both basins was detected from samples collected during 2018 fig 8 the maximum and mean values of mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 are consistent with other studies mean 0 35 0 6 mg l maximum 1 2 mg l in the northern great plains during the snowmelt event liu et al 2013 mean tdp concentration of the tributary 3 watershed agrees with the reported tdp of the stc similar size of tributary 3 in mahmood et al 2015 however the particulate p concentration was not comparable to the concentration of the current study suggesting the pembina escarpment has more of an impact than initially inferred mahmood et al 2015 there was a significant difference in mean concentrations for both basins among the hydrological years mean concentrations were considerably lower during the hydrologically wet year of 2016 2017 but increased dramatically during the hydrologically dry year of 2017 2018 21 and 52 for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 figs 8 and 9 suggesting nutrient sources availability and the permeability of the soils have a more significant effect on nutrient concentrations baulch et al 2019 low concentration during wet years can also be attributed to dilution due to high runoff volume while during dry years tdp concentration is not diluted due to limited runoff volume this can also be attributed to limited interactions between snowmelt waters and soil due to frozen soil basal ice during wet spring 2017 while more interaction was achieved between soil and snowmelt during the 2018 spring season the basal ice layer prevents direct contact between soil and snowmelt water resulting in slow tdp in contrast to spring snowmelt basins showed relatively low tdp concentrations with an occasional small tdp increase during the summer low flow season due to a rainfall event corriveau et al 2013 yates et al 2014 suggesting the source of major p during the low flow season is groundwater there is no significant difference in tdp mean concentrations supported by student s t test during the low flow months between two hydrological years and the range of tdp concentration is from 0 60 to 70 mg l in both basins total phosphorus concentrations mean 0 7 mg l are substantially higher than vandeberg et al 2015 whose study has reported tp mean concentrations 0 31 0 36 mg l during the low flow seasons 2007 2011 from the mauvais coulee basin table 2 shows the spatial mean maximum and minimum olsen p values for the mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 basin olsen p concentrations from johnston 2006 for north dakota soil samples collected during 2001 and 2005 have also been included to show our data compares with others estimates of the soil p concentration are within the range 5 200 ppm of other reported soil p concentration in other studies in the ngp barica 1987 johnston 2006 baulch et al 2019 and the ngp soil samples have naturally high concentrations in soil p barica 1987 johnston et al 2006 baulch et al 2019 olsen p concentrations exhibited uneven spatial distribution throughout two study basins with higher concentrations observed in downslope landscapes wilson et al 2016 highest concentrations 95 and 75 ppm were observed in the northwestern part of the mauvais coulee basin eastern slope of the turtle mountains the lowest concentrations 6 ppm were observed in the most eastern portion of the mauvais coulee basin where the landscape is flat and predominantly grasslands low median concentrations of p 10 and 11 ppm for 2001 and 2005 reported in johnston 2006 were compared to the current study 33 and 32 5 ppm for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 the difference in median concentration the data from our study is higher than johnston 2006 between two studies can be due to a large number of samples collected over a large area by johnston 2006 the number of samples are 38 450 and 66 887 for 2001 and 2005 respectively whereas this study analyzed only ten samples in the mauvais coulee basin and four in tributary 3 in addition spatial heterogeneity and site characteristics are also responsible for the difference in concentration to determine the atmospheric contribution of p snow samples were collected from various locations and analyzed for both 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 water year lab results showed a minor atmospheric contribution with a tdp mean concentration of 0 045 mg l thus based on p concentration in soil and accumulated snow the soil is the most likely source of p in the streamflow water as soil p concentration is three orders of magnitude greater than snow p concentration note that soil p in the top 15 cm is a mixture of soil particles and organic matter from crop residues jensen et al 2011 4 3 annual export the magnitude of the annual p export varied as a function of land management practices and hydrological conditions comparisons of the p load amongst both basins and the two hydrological years in general show high seasonality between or among the spring snowmelt and summer low flow season in 2016 2017 water year higher p export during the spring snowmelt event for both basins was associated with higher streamflow 13 97 kg km2 and 31 81 kg km2 for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 and contributed most 80 to the annual p load 16 41 kg km2 and 36 53 kg km2 for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 however during the 2017 2018 hydrological year the summer p load 4 34 kg km2 and 4 21 kg km2 for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 contributed most to the annual p load 4 88 kg km2 and 6 97 kg km2 for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 it is not uncommon to observe years when snowmelt delivered low portions of the total load e g corriveau et al 2013 to also have unusually high summer and fall precipitation however p load was usually higher during periods of high snowmelt discharge years e g corriveau et al 2013 similarly unusual years such as 2002 having higher summer rainfall runoff load than spring snowmelt load generally spring snowmelt load is much higher than summer rainfall runoff load as seen in this study as well was reported in mahmood et al 2015 the p export per unit area for tributary 3 36 53 kg km2 in 2016 2017 6 97 kg km2 in 2017 2018 was greater than the mauvais coulee basin 16 41 in 2016 2017 4 88 kg km2 in 2017 2018 in the ngp watersheds are mainly composed of agricultural fields with patches of forest cover and grasslands suggesting the possible release of p from plant tissues and soil sources p load in the mauvais coulee basin during the wet year 16 41 c9080kg km2 is consistent mauvais coulee basin is slightly higher with the load observed in the seine watershed in southern manitoba which exports 11 8 kg km2 p from 504 km2 watershed area corriveau et al 2013 however loads are much smaller than those measured in the la salle 62 8 kg km2 basin area 1800 km2 and little morris 62 kg km2 basin area 982 km2 watersheds corriveau et al 2013 such difference may be due to differences in hydrological variables such as streamflow depth between two study sites mahmood et al 2015 working in a smaller basin reported twice the amount of total p export than corriveau et al 2013 but similar to those found here in mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 respectively p load in the tributary 3 basin during the wet year is comparable to the load of the stc basin reported in corriveau et al 2013 considering the dynamics of the hydrology in the ngp the total p export resulted in seasonal variability between the headwaters load at upstream subbasin at relatively higher altitude and the floodplains region load downstream outlet for the entire basin however observations from previous studies e g mahmood et al 2015 indicated an increase in nutrients load across the ngp and may be attributable to recent climatic wetting baeumler and gupta 2020 and increased agricultural activities mccullough et al 2012 schindler et al 2012 rybreg 2017 our findings show dissolved p dominated nutrient loads from two streams in dlb during spring snowmelt season which differ from results in mahmood et al 2015 and in rattan et al 2019 rattan et al 2019 reported particulate dominated p load from seven streams in manitoba during 2013 very wet and 2014 spring season 4 4 concentration streamflow relationships fig 9 represents concentration to streamflow relationships for the two watersheds of the current study during the 2016 17 and 2017 18 water years with hourly streamflow measured in cubic meters per second m3 s top annual middle spring snowmelt streamflow and bottom summer season rows of fig 9 show concentration tdp to streamflow relationships overall during a water year top row moderate r and low p 0 05 were detected between tdp and streamflow indicating statistically significant correlation and the dominance of flushing in both water years and basins fig 9 the m value detected during 2017 18 is much higher than 2016 17 water year suggesting a higher intensity of flushing during 2018 in both basins fig 9 likewise in both watersheds the mean tdp concentration during 2017 18 water year is also 2016 17 water year we suspect that higher intensity of flushing during 2017 18 water year is due to the fact that the snowmelt runoff flows were allowed to have adequate direct contact with soil during 2017 18 water year jensen et al 2011 in the following we describe the concentration to streamflow relationships for the spring snowmelt streamflow shown in the middle row of fig 9 4 4 1 rising limbs in each rising limb the data show little change in concentration of dissolved p as streamflow increases sharply until peak discharge after which both concentrations and streamflow begin to decline in the mauvais coulee basin no significant relationship was found between dissolved p and streamflow as indicated by low r and m values of the regressions 0 30 during the 2016 2017 and 2017 18 period however at tributary 3 a high r 0 96 r 2 value 0 93 and slope 0 32 from linear regression during the 2017 18 snowmelt event showed a strong association between streamflow and dissolved p indicating intense flushing in the mauvais coulee basin slopes of the linear regressions in the rising limbs were close to zero for both years exhibiting nearly chemostatic behavior godsey et al 2009 fig 9 however regression slope in the mauvais coulee basin during 2016 2017 0 00001 were much closer to zero than that of 2017 2018 0 043 suggesting that mauvais coulee basin was less chemostatic in 2017 2018 godsey et al 2009 herndon et al 2015 due to basal ice layers restricting contact time between soil and meltwater affecting nutrient transport amarawansha et al 2015 baulch et al 2019 4 4 2 recession limbs in contrast to the rising limb after the onset of peak discharge the concentration of dissolved p began to decline among both the basins and in both hydrological years positive linear relationships were observed in the mauvais coulee basin both high r 0 6 in 2016 2017 and 0 85 in 2017 2018 and r 2 values 0 36 in 2016 2017 and 0 73 in 2017 2018 indicate strong flushing likewise tributary 3 also showed a positive and strong concentration to streamflow relationship during two water years although the slopes of linear regressions were steeper in 2017 18 water year m 0 17 indicating more strong soil flushing in 2016 2017 water year m 0 02 more subdued soil flushing occurred affecting nutrient transport the weak low r r2 and m values concentration to streamflow relationships were previously discussed at the catchment scale godsey et al 2009 mahmood et al 2015 and the field scale roste 2015 interestingly roste 2015 reported a regression slope of 0 03 suggesting chemostatic behavior for dissolved p in the tobacco creek basin like godsey et al 2009 a log log plot approach of the concentration to streamflow data was used by our study to verify the absence of a concentration to streamflow relationship through a small range of concentrations and a wide range of flows similar ranges of chemistry and flows were observed and suggested that chemistry varied nearly as much as the flows did roste 2015 however concentration to streamflow observations at the headwater mid basin and larger basin scale presented a clearer relationship with basin area while the invariant chemical supply becomes apparent mahmood et al 2015 in the current study two obvious relationships were observed one in the rising limb chemostatic and one in the recession limb flushing haygarth et al 2004 reported that a weak concentration to streamflow correlation for p may emerge from a steady state condition between the dissolution kinetics of p in a homogeneous source such as soil or snowpack and in stream water velocity haygarth et al 2004 in this scenario the sluggish draining of soil water source water inhibited any exchange of p between soil and solution haygarth et al 2004 the weaker concentration to streamflow relationship also could have been due to the release and subsequent export of nutrients driven by low flow velocities 4 5 impacts of hydroclimatic conditions the two water years during the current study showed contrasting hydroclimatological responses as noted previously in the hydrology section the water year 2016 17 is characterized by high snow accumulation subsequent snowmelt streamflow and very little summer streamflow in contrast during the 2017 18 water year very dry conditions during the winter season resulted in low snow accumulation and negligible amounts of spring snowmelt runoff however there was a rainfall runoff event during the 2018 summer which is uncommon in the study area in the mauvais coulee basin annual streamflow for 2016 17 was 64 mm while it was only 21 mm during the 2017 18 season likewise in tributary 3 annual streamflow during 2016 17 and 2017 18 were 121 mm and 23 mm respectively to gain further insight into hydroclimatological responses the two watersheds were simulated using a physically based cold region hydrologic model the simulations for both basins were simultaneously compared against swe observations and basin outlet streamflow table 3 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nses nash and sutcliffe 1970 between observed and simulated swe are 0 7 and 0 8 during 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 winters respectively indicating strong model performance note that the observation days of this study were limited to four 2016 2017 and three 2017 2018 days that included both peak swe and swe prior to snowmelt streamflow the basin averaged simulated swe and outlet annual streamflow volumes agreed well with observations in both basins table 3 fig 10 shows the frozen soil or basal ice layer status in the mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 during the spring streamflow period for each simulation year the y axis represents the ratio of frozen soil or basal ice area to the total basin area we believe these results have important implications for nutrient behavior in a changing climate our crhm model suggests that hydroclimatic conditions govern the streamflow and soil melt water contact opportunity which directly influences mechanism concentration and load of p being exported from the study area hence we can expect different consequences for the basins for devils lake and presumably for much of the ngp in general depending on how climate fluctuates in the future observations during both years exhibited peak maxima concentrations 2016 2017 0 52 mg l and 0 61 mg l 2017 2018 0 72 mg l and 0 84 mg l for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 respectively during the snowmelt discharge event fig 6 while minimal concentrations were recorded during the summer low flows 2016 2017 0 18 mg l and 0 26 mg l 2017 2018 0 18 mg l and 0 43 mg l for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 respectively such intra annual variability high concentration in spring snowmelt season and low concentration in summer season is consistent with the observations in other basins across the world aubert et al 2013 dupas et al 2016 fig 8 fig 8 shows the median concentration for a dry year 2017 2018 and is consistently higher than that of a wet year 2016 17 in both basins studied during the spring snowmelt seasons however annual tdp export per unit basin area for a wet year is also substantially higher than a dry as the annual streamflow volume for the wet year greatly exceeds that of a dry year fig 8 nutrient losses and concentrations in surface runoff depend on discharge contact with sources and transport mechanism e g dilution during 2016 2017 thick swe accumulations before the onset of discharge resulted in high volumes of streamflow and subsequently carried greater total loads of p while smaller snowmelt runoff exported little p during a dry year extreme p export during wet years is not uncommon in the case of the ngp generally during the first part of the 2000s 2000 2004 the annual load was low with invariant streamflow and nutrient contributions whereas nutrient exports were much higher in 2006 2007 and 2010 2011 during wet hydrologic years mahmood et al 2015 this study s results on the impacts of wet and dry years on p concentration and annual export also agree with a study recently conducted in broughton s creek manitoba that assessed the impacts of hydroclimatic conditions i e wet 2013 or dry 2014 on p concentrations of downstream water bodies haque et al 2018 haque et al 2018 also reported low p concentrations during the wet year 2013 and relatively higher p concentration during a dry year that is consistent with the findings of this study our study also agrees with baeumler and gupta 2020 which concludes that the recent increase in nitrogen load are predominantly driven by wet climate and minimally due to changes in land use and land management practice the following is an explanation involving snowmelt streamflow and soil meltwater contact opportunity for contrasting p concentration and export between wet and dry years 4 5 1 high snowmelt and subsequent streamflow lower mean and median concentration during wet years can be attributed to high swe accumulation and snowmelt runoff this study concludes that higher overland snowmelt water slightly dilutes the p concentration before being exported to the stream in the streams large volumes of streamflow from the melting of snow in agricultural fields and stream banks further dilutes the p concentration ultimately resulting in lower p concentration during wet years in contrast during dry years snow is thin and patchy during spring snowmelt contributing little runoff with which to dilute p 4 5 2 soil and snowmelt water contact opportunity fig 10 shows the crhm modeled frozen soil or basal ice layer status in the mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 during the spring streamflow period for each simulation year the y axis represents the ratio of frozen soil or basal ice area to the total basin area during the wet year in both basins the entire basin was frozen due to frozen soil or the presence of basal ice layer prior to the start of spring snowmelt runoff while both the soils of the basins were exposed well before the start of spring snowmelt runoff such contrasting frozen status between the wet and dry years is due to very high snow accumulation basin wide 52 2 mm prior to streamflow start and less erosion during the wet year while the dry year has little snow accumulation and relatively small snow erosion this study indicates that prior to discharge the completely frozen presence of basal ice layer limits the contact time and interaction opportunity between soils and meltwaters resulting in considerably higher total loads and medians concentrations quinton and pomeroy 2006 costa et al 2017 baulch et al 2019 however in 2018 due to the absence of a frozen soil basal ice layer fig 10 aided by small snow accumulation less swe and thinner snow cover gradual release of snowmelt water allowed plenty of contact time and interaction opportunity with soils resulting in a higher p concentration in stream water lilbaek and pomeroy 2010 the influence of contact time between snowmelt water and soil on stream water p concentration was also demonstrated in a field scale study conducted in alberta canada monitoring the relationship among soil test p stp with runoff tp from eight small watersheds over three years little et al 2007 the small watersheds were uniformly managed and had no farmland or agricultural influences soil samples were recovered during the fall and measured against spring snowmelt water chemistry while soil samples from the late spring were measured with water chemistry of the summer low flow a strong linear relationship was observed between stp and tp concluding the interaction of soil to runoff meltwaters little et al 2007 further soil conditions and relative swe cover throughout the study site showed a significant impact on the concentration to streamflow relationships during spring snowmelt in both hydrological years note that during spring snowmelt atmospheric temperatures fluctuated causing meltwater to flow during the day while slowing or ceasing in the evening when temperatures dropped below freezing this freeze thaw cycle created a pulsing effect no p was exported at night when the stream was frozen but p export increased throughout the day when thawing occurred the high volume snowmelt runoff and discharge observed in 2016 2017 and the low volume of 2017 2018 water year would lead one to think of either a flushing or dilution relationship to occur during spring snowmelt however the freeze thaw cycle of the soils affects water chemistry while limiting the cycling and exporting of nutrients groffman et al 2001 bechmann et al 2005 matzner and borken 2008 messiga et al 2010 based on the pulsing phenomenon previously described resulting in nearly chemostatic behavior the extent of chemostatic behavior can be explained by the frozen conditions of the soils fig 10 in mauvais coulee basin 2017 soils were completely frozen and presented a near chemostatic behavior which was stronger than that of 2018 where soils were partly thawed almost displaying a flushing relationship as seen in tributary 3 this suggested that soils frozen or thawed in fact were the dominant controllers of how nutrients were exported during spring snowmelt 5 conclusions the contribution of concentration to streamflow relationships to understanding nutrient export was previously discussed in other studies around the world however very few studies mention nutrient export in cold regions agricultural basins the objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the impacts of hydroclimatic variation on concentration to streamflow relationships in the headwaters of the dlb while identifying the controlling factors of p exports using both field based observations and hydroclimatic variability detected by physically based hydrologic simulations crhm data suggest that hydroclimatic variation has strong correlations with nutrient export concentrations and total loads but remains highly variable and inconclusive for concentration to streamflow relationships in stream mean water chemistry showed the considerable variation of tdp concentration between the mauvais coulee basin 0 28 and 0 35 mg l for 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and tributary 3 0 45 and 0 61 mg l for 2017 and 2017 these tdp concentrations are consistent with previously reported tdp concentrations in other studies corriveau et al 2013 across the mauvais coulee basin the snowpack presented a low mean concentration of dissolved p 0 045 mg l mean soil p concentration through the study sites was 38 07 mg l while the maximum and minimum concentration from the mauvais coulee basin were 95 mg l and 6 mg l respectively thus this study concludes that the soils are most likely the source of p observed in streamflow waters during major runoff events this study presents the impacts of two years having contrasting hydroclimatic responses on p concentration and subsequent export one year 2016 17 experienced high swe snowfall maximum frozen soil conditions and thick basal ice layer this wet year has low mean concentrations 0 0 28 and 0 45 mg l for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 however this wet year yields high total loads of p 36 53 and 16 41 kg km2 for tributary 3 and mauvais coulee basin during the spring snowmelt event in contrast a dry year 2017 18 had high concentrations 0 35 and 0 61 mg l for mauvais coulee basin and tributary 3 and low total export loads 6 97 and 4 88 kg km2 for tributary 3 and mauvais coulee basin this suggests that the volume of meltwater runoff influences nutrient loads while the contact and opportunity of interaction time between meltwaters and thawed soils are crucial for concentration values fig 11 the statistical significance of the difference in mean tdp concentrations between wet and dry years is confirmed using student s t test the impacts of hydroclimatic responses on concentration to streamflow relationships are inconclusive but are highly variable during the wet 2016 17 and dry 2017 18 year mauvais coulee basin shows a chemostatic relationship in rising limb and a strong soil flushing relationship in the recession limb however the intensity of flushing is stronger during the dry year than a wet year in the recession limb this study suggests that the concentration to streamflow relationships observed in the rising limbs are highly influenced by the state of the soil conditions frozen or thawed interestingly between both years 2016 17 and 2017 18 we observe the extent of chemostatic behavior where the dry year appeared to be less chemostatic than the wet year in tributary 3 a soil flushing relationship was observed in both the rising and recession limbs during a dry and wet year the p observations loads and their dependency on hydroclimatic variability are consistent with previous studies e g haque et al 2018 across the ngp our findings advance knowledge by providing a mechanistic explanation of p export using the insights from the crhm frozen soil status presence of basal ice layer inferred from the crhm are useful to explain the impacts of hydroclimatic variability on tdp concentration export and concentration to streamflow relationship the current findings have implications for understanding the impacts of hydroclimatic conditions on dissolved p concentration load its relationship with streamflow and mechanism of dissolved p export the findings from our study during both extremely dry and wet years are useful for decision making and nutrient management in the context of future climate change scenario as both extremely dry and wet years and spells are anticipated in future based on the projections of many studies e g rodell et al 2018 the dominance of dissolved p in stream water indicates a plant tissue origin for p which has important implications for agricultural and tillage practices across the dlb the p loads varied significantly between hydrologically wet and dry years which impose huge challenges for nutrient management and provides useful information for landowners

5064,in this paper we introduce 2d profile analytical models describing advection solute transport induced by a recharge boundary condition in a catchment scale aquifer represented by a sediment or rock with permeability changing with depth the suggested mathematical formulation is based on the concept of transit time distribution ttd according to which the concentration trend can be derived directly from the cumulative travel time frequency or from the convolution of ttd considered as a transfer function with a solute input function this approach is shown to be applicable to water flow and solute transport in an aquifer characterized by a vertical hydraulic conductivity profile k z which can be described by either continuous e g massive rock exhibiting an exponential or power law dependence of k on depth or discrete a stratified aquifer analytical functions a special focus is on the problem related to advection solute transport in a rectangular anisotropic flow domain bounded by a shallow stream of finite width downflow converging area the suggested analytical models and solutions utilizing new transfer functions and accounting for different inflow and solute flux conditions can be involved in several applications including the assessment of the impacts of spatially variable nonpoint contamination sources on groundwater quality groundwater dating based on the observation of environmental tracers and the study of groundwater recharge itself the models were shown to be applicable not only to simulating the impact on groundwater due to the contaminated recharge but also to predicting aquifer contamination caused by a source located below the water table within the aquifer domain such source can be associated with a radioactive material leachate generated within a deep geological repository of nuclear waste a relevant modeling example is given keywords recharge nonpoint source pollution aquifer vertical heterogeneity and anisotropy ttd radioactive waste disposal radionuclide migration 1 introduction a number of watershed scale models either analytical or numerical with lumped or distributed parameters have been developed to predict groundwater ages and solute transport they have traditionally focused on estimating the impact on water resources due to nonpoint pollution sources within the analytical modeling framework watershed scale aquifers are often represented by simplified linear lumped models averaging the flow and transport properties of the aquifer material this framework traditionally captures the transit time distribution ttd concept according to which the concentration trends can be estimated directly from the cumulative travel time frequency model data or from ttd convolution with a solute input analytical function or a solute time series history by itself the ttd describes the integral effect of all flow pathways at the groundwater discharge location of a watershed aquifer area the development of analytical models of ttds is the subject of considerable research efforts having many implications in the hydrogeology geochemistry and groundwater quality forecasting many lumped parameter models have derived ttds and relevant analytical solutions exist to predict the concentrations of nonpoint source solutes such as industrial municipal and agricultural contaminants discharged to the environment or atmospheric tracers of age among the most popular models suggested by now one can distinguish a piston flow exponential gamma and advection dispersion małoszewski and zuber 1982 yurtsever 1995 amin and campana 1996 maloszewski 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 a detailed description of the model applicability accounting in some respect for the sampling conditions can be found in green et al 2014 gusyev et al 2014 leray et al 2016 generally these models are applicable to relatively homogeneous aquifers with simple geometry in which one dimensional flow dominates or at least to aquifers showing properly upscaled hydraulic conductivity and fickian macrodispersivity and exhibiting dupuit forchheimer behavior hence there is a certain limitation on using the lumped parameter approach to predict solute transport under the conditions where complex processes occur such as flow variable over space and time spatially variable hydraulic conductivity coupled vertical and lateral flow and preferential flow mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 in this context many attempts have been made to extend the ttd formalism to studying groundwater age and solute transport in more complex heterogeneous groundwater systems using the distributed parameter approach accounting for groundwater flow and aquifer geometry for example the earlier models for ttd prediction developed without considering the details of the aquifer geometry were later improved by taking into account a linear trend in the change in the dipping aquifer thickness or using a combination of the confined and unconfined parts of a groundwater system solomon et al 2006 etcheverry 2001 the effect of radial symmetry of dupuit forchheimer flow on the ttd was discussed in leray et al 2012 etcheverry 2001 also considered the case of a 1d aquifer under the conditions of linearly varying recharge rate recently analytical solutions for ttds have been derived accounting for two dimensional advection and scale dependent dispersion in heterogeneous media green et al 2014 as well as matrix diffusion in fractured porous systems gardner et al 2016 the effect of aquifer material heterogeneity on contaminant transport and ttd prediction has long been an important subject of interest of many earth science experts and a vast literature has been dedicated to this issue the application of 2d profile models utilizing a concept of variation of hydraulic conductivity k with depth d seems to be quite efficient and appropriate approach for understanding the solute transport phenomena in heterogeneous geological environments in the earlier works transport through perfectly stratified formations layering over large horizontal distances when k is a random function of the vertical coordinate z only has been studied with priority under an assumption of the absence of recharge r 0 gelhar et al 1979 matheron and de marsily 1980 gelhar 1993 fiori and dagan 2002 these studies have been focused primarily on evaluating the scale dependent and effective macrodispersion coefficients asymptotically approaching constant values over longer observation times in most such studies the flow quasi 1d flow is assumed to occur in an infinite medium parallel to the bedding driven by a constant and horizontal mean head gradient and k is modeled as a stationary random space function later stochastic analysis has been successfully used to assess the effect of uniformly distributed recharge r 0 on the transport of pollutants in a 2d in plane heterogeneous aquifer rubin and bellin 1994 it was shown that the recharge leads to nonstationary macrodispersion coefficients in both the longitudinal and transverse horizontal directions which in contrast to the case of r 0 do not approach constant values the spatial and temporal variability in the recharge field further enhances the spreading of the ensemble mean plume especially in the lateral direction increasing concentration field variances li and graham 1998 1999 swain and chin 2003 in the above cited works the flow is considered at the regional scale which justifies the shallow flow approximation assuming the vertical component of the flow induced by the recharge to be negligible such 2d analysis of flow and transport processes is appropriate for predicting changes in head caused by natural recharge applied to the entire aquifer and the spread and fate of a solute which is distributed all over the depth of the aquifer and is transported over an extended period of time dagan 1989 li and graham 1999 the effects of the recharge treated as a flux boundary condition on the vertical cross flow and transport between the formation layers have been studied based mostly on numerical technique both in 2d and 3d setup kim et al 2000 swain and chin 2003 the results showed that the vertical transverse dispersion can be significantly enhanced by transience in the flow field caused by fluctuations in recharge rates the majority of other results published to date deal with case studies providing solutions for ttds and concentration fields related to realistic regional scale nonpoint source pollutants in heterogeneous aquifer systems obtained within a stochastic modeling framework zhang et al 2006 henri and harter 2019 in particular it was shown that the regional scale vertical transport from the upper recharge boundary to the deeper parts of the aquifer across the main bedding plane of the aquifer system is a significant concern zhang et al 2006 however to our knowledge there are no enough research efforts have been made to develop analytical models that can be used as a deterministic alternative to the random approach for working with sufficient field data i e well discretized aquifer cross sections this was one of the reasons motivating the present study to reduce the significant additional analytical and computational efforts for solving 3d problems the effect of variation of k with d on transport under nonuniform flow and recharge specified boundary conditions will be examined in the framework of a simplified 2d in cross section analysis the conversion from stochastic the random change in k to deterministic models is justified if there are sufficient data on the real distribution of the hydraulic conductivity over depth the dependence of k on d has been investigated in many studies the observed data show a great variety of relations between the hydraulic conductivity and depth depending on many geological factors rock type its chemical alteration the tectonic history of a particular region pressure conditions etc a common view is that the hydraulic conductivity of most rocks decreases with depth at least this is true for fractured formations various empirical models have been proposed to describe the functional relationship between the permeability and depth for bedrock generally there are two major categories of models the models of the first category assume that k can decrease exponentially or logarithmically with d because the overburden pressure tends to decrease the apertures of joints or fractures and the size of pores thus reducing the permeability louis 1974 bredehoeft et al 1983 ma et al 2016 the second category includes power law models such models have finite values of permeability at the ground surface but these values decrease too fast sometimes leading to unrealistically low permeability values at large depth saar and manga 2004 kuang and jiao 2014 and hence as it will be shown later overestimation of the role of the shallow contaminant transport from a nonpoint source pollution unconsolidated sediments which are often stratified with alternating layers of different lithology may have a quite different trend in permeability profile indeed in regional scale reservoirs the heterogeneity associated with the layering can form permeability profile characterized by the inverse dependence of hydraulic conductivity on depth i e an increase in the hydraulic conductivity with depth a special focus of this paper is the influence of such stratification on the ttds and solute transport from a source area eriksson 1958 was probably among the first to draw attention to the fact that a decrease in permeability with depth can affect the travel times for groundwater originating near a water divide this conclusion is based on qualitative reasoning supported by general expert arguments a number of later studies have considered the impact of variations in hydraulic conductivity over depth and the profile anisotropy of the formation on the behavior of a regional groundwater flow system jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 it was shown that the depth decaying trend of hydraulic conductivity as well as formation anisotropy should not be ignored in studies related to the ttds in particular an exponential decrease in permeability enhances shallow circulation and subdues deep regional flows leading to longer residence times for a large part of the domain while the shallower portions pass solutes rapidly cardenas and jiang 2010 the majority of analytical models involve an assumption regarding a prescribed head boundary condition given head variation at the upper aquifer boundary which allows one to study the effect of periodic undulation in water table in the subsurface flow and the flow with the land surface interaction in real aquifer systems the groundwater flow is controlled by recharge rather than the configuration of water table the position of which depends on the groundwater flow regime and is a priori unknown therefore hydrodynamic conceptualization of the upper aquifer boundary as a recharge specified condition seems more reasonable for the prevailing class of hydrogeological problems compared to the above head specified approach in this study we use a ttd based approach to develop advection solute transport models for a watershed scale aquifer with permeability changing with depth based on the ttd concept we extend our previous analysis rumynin et al 2019 to deal with the transport phenomenon both in stratified and massive rocks according to that we consider the analytical models of ttds as transfer functions derived from closed form solutions of the 2d continuity equation coupled with transport characteristic equations to yield solutions for arbitrary input from nonpoint source pollution the findings are important for understanding the effect of aquifer heterogeneity of different nature and anisotropy on groundwater contamination from a non point pollution source and for determining the extent of the effect of the traditionally used ttd related functions for dupuit forchheimer flow on the accuracy of subsurface solute transport solutions such understanding is necessary to predict groundwater contamination due to the leakage from municipal industrial and agricultural deposits as well as to provide a basis for the assessment of waste management plans and for planning the design of groundwater quality monitoring systems the numerical technique widely used nowadays to simulate ttds under various field or test conditions luther and haitjema 1998 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 zlotnik et al 2011 leray et al 2012 engdahl et al 2016 is beyond the scope of this paper with this technique by solving the advection transport equations we only validate the analytical models in addition in practice a direct application of the above modeling concept purely advective solute transport may introduce certain errors in the groundwater contamination forecasts and groundwater dating since the effect of hydrodynamic dispersive mixing of dissolved species i e environmental tracers is ignored solomon and sudicky 1991 moreover in heterogeneous aquifer systems with a large hydraulic conductivity variance the ttd may itself deviate from the fickian model weissmann et al 2002 gotovac et al 2009 rumynin 2011 but this is also anissue beyond the scope of the present study 2 conceptual models and physical setup the present mathematical settings related to a non point source of groundwater contamination are chosen to assess the influence of the depth dependent hydraulic conductivity and in some particular cases aquifer anisotropy on the average concentration of the groundwater solute discharging from the outflow section of watershed aquifer with and without simplification of the output boundary x s 1 x x s 2 conditions fig 1 in both setups the aquifer has a constant thickness m in z direction the recharge is uniformly distributed over the top of the aquifer z 0 the bottom of the aquifer and the water divide act as no flow boundaries the recharge water contains dissolved species such chemical input contamination source can be uniformly distributed over the whole inflow boundary or only over a limited interval x s 1 x x s 2 also z 0 fig 1 some specific case x s 1 x x s 2 0 z m will be also considered section 4 the study starts with a relatively simple aquifer geometry the so called semi infinite aquifer with a no flow boundary and a hydraulic conductivity k z permitted to vary with depth arbitrarily continuously massive rock or in a step wise manner stratified aquifer fig 1a this simplification is applicable if an aquifer shows a thickness small relative to the distance between its lateral boundaries thus the flow in such aquifer exhibits dupuit forchheimer behavior with the horizontal velocity assumed uniform over depth haitjema 1995 then we will consider a case of a bounded aquifer which utilizes the concept of groundwater discharge into a stream of finite width under confined conditions through its bottom a discharge specified boundary on a restricted interval belonging to the x axis a no flow boundary x 0 can be associated with the line of symmetry dividing a v shape watershed into two equivalent planeshaving width l and therefore l 1 is the half stream width fig 1b area 0 x l 1 can be associated also with a lake wetland alluvial plain and coastal area the width of a stream or other water body has been shown to appreciably affect the transient time distribution if l 1 l 0 1 luther and haitjema 1998 abrams 2013 thus restricting the applicability of the simplified analytical models only to watersheds containing narrow river valleys the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the aquifer hydraulic characteristics make this criterion less reliable the mathematical formalization of the flow process is based on the continuity equation for a flow of a homogeneous fluid polubarinova kochina 1952 bear 1972 1 v x x v z z 0 where v x and v z are the horizontal and vertical components of the specific discharge 2 1 dupuit forchheimer flow in a semi infinite aquifer adjacent to a no flow boundary at the beginning of our analysis we introduce a dimensional form of the total groundwater flux q l2t 1 per unit aquifer width at any horizontal

aquifer with horizontal isochrones solomon et al 2006 and obeys the second characteristic eq 5 then the travel time of a solute from an arbitrary location z 0 to another arbitrary location z is

contaminated water in the total flow through any aquifer section x l as an example we consider an exponentially decreasing function 8 k z k 0 exp a z where k 0 is the hydraulic conductivity at the aquifer top z 0 a is the depth decay exponent l 1 the larger a the faster the hydraulic conductivity decreases with depth determining t η and t m 7b and substituting the result into integral solution

requires considerable computation efforts in practice the depth dependence of the permeability can be often described by a piecewise continuous function assuming the aquifer consisting of n elementary layers i 1 2 n with thicknesses m i porosities φ i and hydraulic conductivities k i fig 1a in stratified aquifers with step wise variation of k and φ the solution for the downward travel time t i z

2 non dupuit forchheimer flow in an aquifer with discharge specified outflow boundary condition the credibility range of the dupuit forchheimer assumption and simplified aquifer geometry used above in the prediction of steady state flow structure in heterogeneous systems can be studied based on more precise solutions unfortunately closed forms of such solutions are not always possible this is not the case for the exponential model for k z which has been chosen in this study due to mathematical convenience in order to derive the closed form solutions although this case is very specific and limited to what has been observed in the literature it can help to explore some aspects of the physical behavior of heterogeneous groundwater systems the transformation of the continuity eq 1 can be done through the darcy representation of the specific discharge components vx and vz 13 v x k x h x ψ z v z k z h z ψ x where h h x z is the hydraulic head l ψ ψ x z is the stream function l2t 1 in a case of vertical heterogeneity of the aquifer material k x k x z and k z k z z i e the hydraulic conductivity is a function of depth z below land surface or some reference level jiang et al 2011 yao et al 2017 in the case of an anisotropic aquifer the ratio of the hydraulic conductivities kx and kz remains constant in any point of the flow domain such that the aquifer shows a vertical anisotropy ratio ε k x k z in our analysis the aquifer is anisotropic and an exponentially decaying function is used to describe the decrease of hydraulic conductivity with depth jiang et al 2011 13a k x k x 0 exp a z k z k z 0 exp a z ε k x 0 k z 0 where kx 0 and kz 0 are the values of the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity at the aquifer top z 0 respectively a is the depth decay exponent as in eq 8 the decrease in the conductivity with depth is common in the majority of fractured geological formations due to the increasing closure of fractures with depth because of the increasing normal stress caused by the weight of the overlying rock earnest and boutt 2014 chen et al 2018 the anisotropy in permeability is also a fundamental property of fractured rock freeze and cherry 1979 zlotnik et al 2011 the vertical anisotropy of fractured hard rock aquifers may be due to the density of sub horizontal slightly sloping weathering induced fractures being higher than that of tectonic sub vertical steeply dipping fractures lachassagne et al 2014 in addition slightly sloping fractures have a higher hydraulic conductivity than steeply dipping fractures do resulting in the former fractures dominating in the flow field thus producing anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity earnest and boutt 2014 when speaking about the vertical anisotropy of porous media one refers mostly to layered systems where low permeability layers are sandwiched between permeable domains the substitution of eqs 13 and 13b into the continuity eq 1 results in laplace type equations for both the hydraulic head and the stream function thus the stream function ψ f x z is determined by solving the equation of this type chesnaux et al 2005 jiang et al 2011 14 x 1 k z 0 e az ψ x z 1 k x 0 e az ψ z

based on the series solution approach and the method of separation of variables rumynin et al 2019 the dimensionless form of the solution is as follows 16 ψ x z 2 π 2 l 1 e α z 2 n 1 sin n π x sin n π

analysis traditionally based on the dupuit forchheimer concept section 2 1 allowing the vertical resistance to groundwater flow to be neglected plots in fig 2 drawn using the solutions 16 and 17 illustrate the pattern of groundwater flow net in an anisotropic and heterogeneous aquifer in particular they show that an increase in the anisotropy and the rate of permeability attenuation leads to the concentration of streamlines flow discharge near aquifer top also as can be seen from fig 2b an inversion of the gradient of hydraulic head can occur in an aquifer with high ε values the same section x can show an increase in the head over depth in its upper part and its decrease in the lower part i e the plot of h z has an extremum the temporal aspects of water and solute behavior in a catchment scale aquifer under net recharge conditions can be described in terms of atransit time tt the formulas for the tt as a time characteristic of the motion of fluid particles along a fixed trajectory ψ x z in the absence of dispersion effects can be derived from kinematic expressions 5 for the principal components of flow velocity 13 where φ is porosity assumed to be constant separating variables in the first formula in eq 5 and integrating this expression with eq 13 taken into account we come to the following equation for the dimensionless tt from a recharge area to discharge into a stream rumynin et al 2019 18 τ t mtt x s x 1 ψ x z z d x where mtt φ m r is the mean transit time the lower integration limit x s is dimensionless flowline entrance coordinate the initial coordinate of the streamline the upper integration limit the abscissa of the exit of the stream line x in the interval of groundwater discharge 0 l 1 is determined by the water balance in the rectangular flow domain x ξ 1 x 0 ξ l 1 1 l 1 the derivative of ψ eq 18 with respect to z in a dimensionless form is 19 ψ x z z 2 π 2 l 1 e α z 2 n 1 sin n π x sin n π l 1 α 2 sh a n 1 z a n ch a n 1 z n 2 sh a n summarizing the above reasoning we can conclude that the key limitations of the model are as follows groundwater flow is confined which can be true if the relative change in the saturated thickness is small mathematical problem setup does not take into account dispersion and assumes that the porosity at different depths is the same 3 the transit time related definitions and basic concentration functions 3 1 a ttd concept for an aquifer having a constant ratio of φ m r haitjema 1995 introduced f τ a cumulative distribution function of the transit times ttcdf or simply ctd which determines the portion q τ of the total discharge q tot which has groundwater transit time less than or equal to τ i e 20 f τ q τ q tot statistically the relationships for f τ describe the frequency distribution of times that it takes water molecules to reach the aquifer outlet from all locations in the source aquifer catchment area mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 the dimensionless time τ as in eq 18 is the ratio of time t to the mean transit time mtt φ m r the other common term for the transit time is the derivative of f with respect to τ 21 f τ d f d τ which can be referred to as the transit time probability density function ttpdf or simply transit time distribution ttd which is the integrated response time of an aquifer to a unit concentration input functions f τ and f τ are fundamental characteristics for determining aquifer response to pollution event in the case of step wise conservative chemical input cin const over the entire groundwater reservoir with constant recharge f τ directly corresponds to the relative concentration c c c in for pure advection flow because the ratio q τ q tot is the proportion of mixing of the contaminated and pollution free groundwater for a pollution source of limited extension x s 2 x s x s 1 fig 1 the general analytical solution for the solute concentration can be also expressed through the cumulative distribution function 22 c τ 0 0 τ τ s 1 f τ f τ s 1 τ s 1 τ τ s 2 f τ s 2 f τ s 1 τ τ s 2 where τ s 1 and τ s 2 correspond to migration times from x s 1 and x s 2 along flowlines to the section x l fig 1a or the discharge area fig 1b introducing the ttd allows the solution for arbitrary input concentration c in τ to be represented in the well known form of convolution integral małoszewski and zuber 1982 haitjema 1995 solomon et al 2006 23 c τ 0 c in τ σ f σ exp λ σ d σ where the exponential term accounts for first order decay λ λ t λ is the decay constant σ is a dummy variable dimensionless the characteristic f τ serves as a weight function also f τ is the response concentration curve for an instantaneous unit pulse of a conservative tracer applied over the entire groundwater reservoir by convolving the ttd with a solute s input history the age of groundwater and the concentrations of nonpoint source solutes can be estimated green et al 2014 for an idealized semi infinite aquifer of constant thickness and recharge assuming steady state dupuit forchheimer flow the transit time characteristics ctd ttd reduce to the exponential lumped model małoszewski and zuber 1982 zuber 1986 solomon et al 2006 leray et al 2012 23a f τ 1 exp τ f τ exp τ although lumped parameter models of that type are still frequently requested by hydrological practice and have a potential for development the distributed parameter modeling approach considering realistic groundwater flow in aquifers with certain geometry and boundary conditions is nowadays preferably used in the ttd analysis that can be illustrated by examples below 3 2 arbitrary distribution of the hydraulic conductivity if the permeability is heterogeneous only in the vertical direction and the dupuit forchheimer assumption is true then the isochrones are horizontal and function f is determined by transmissivity ratio 24 f τ t z τ t m where t z τ is implicitly determined by the first eq 7b at η z which in turn can be found from the transcendent formula 7a for an exponential distribution of permeability over depth eq 8 t z τ and t m can be calculated by eq a1 see appendix a 25 f τ 1 e α z τ 1 e α substituting z τ from a4 see appendix a into 25 allows f τ to be represented in the explicit form 26 f τ 1 p τ 1 p τ e α p τ exp α τ e α 1 e α in the asymptotic case α a m 0 homogeneous aquifer we come to the exponential model 23a małoszewski and zuber 1982 zuber 1986 solomon et al 2006 the derivative of function f τ 26 determines the ttd 27 f τ α p τ e 2 α 1 e α 1 e α p τ 2 3 3 a stratified aquifer according to the above definition for a cumulative distribution function of the transit times 20 we can write for a stratified aquifer fig 1a 28 f t l x s t l where x s t is the current coordinate characterized by matter migration time t to the flow section x l considering eq 12 formula 28 can be rewritten as 29 f i t 1 a i k i z s t b i a 1 where z s t is flow depth in the section x l fig 1a the ttd for solute transport in a stratified semi infinite aquifer can be found by differentiation of eq 29 with respect to t 30 f i t k i a 1 d z s t dt k i r a 1 2 φ i a i k i z s t b i assuming x l and solving 12 we can determine the depth of flow z s in section x l and hence using the solution 10 the time t required for the pollutant to reach this depth in point zs a specific feature of the calculation algorithm is the need to find the number of the aquifer layer i that contains the flow line that crosses the section x l in point zs this number is not specified a priori it can be found with the use of a simple algorithm for determining the points x i where flow lines originating within the interval x s 2 x x s 1 cross the boundaries of the ith layers fig 1a 31 x i x s a 1 a i k i m i 3 4 an illustrative example this example was formulated so as to assess the convergence of two solutions one of which pertains to an aquifer characterized by hydraulic conductivity exponentially decreasing with depth eqs 26 27 the other solution eqs 29 30 refers to a stratified aquifer consisting of layers with hydraulic conductivity varying over depth following the same exponential tendency in other words in the second calculations the variation in hydraulic conductivity with depth was incorporated in a groundwater model with the use of multiple layers calculations fig 3 show that the exponential decrease in the hydraulic conductivity with depth can be successfully approximated by a step wise function with a rather low number of intervals acceptable results are obtained when the number of effective layers is equal to or more than 10 finally numerical test proves the effectiveness of the used algorithm for a stratified system 3 5 an exact solution for a bounded aquifer the focus of this section is to develop analytical models of ctd ttd for a rectangular aquifer areally recharged by precipitation assuming that all flow paths converge at discharge area represented by a shallow stream fig 1b we start with the definition of the cumulative distribution function for the transit times eq 20 in terms of the stream function entry coordinate ψ 1 x s τ through the linear relationships 32 f τ x s τ l 1 1 l 1 where x s τ x s τ l is a dimensionless coordinate specifying the point of entry l 1 x 1 for particles whose migration time to the discharge area 0 x l 1 along the flowline ψ τ is τ the function x s τ is a subject of the further analysis to define function f τ an identical eq 18 was used rewritten as follows 33 τ f 1 f l 1 1 f l 1 1 ψ x z z d x with this on the one hand function f τ defines the lower and upper limits of the integral 33 and on the other hand the kernel of this integral is also f dependent because the desirable streamline ψ x z eq 16 used to determine the differential d ψ d z eq 19 is ψ 1 l 1 1 f therefore technically calculations of f τ based on the integral 33 require some optimization and efforts examples of such calculations are presented in fig 4 where the influence of ε and α on f depending of the aquifer geometry ratio m l is illustrated since in the context of groundwater contamination the function f τ is identical to the concentration function c τ 22 the plots in fig 4 give an idea of the temporal behavior of a nonreactive component in the discharge area for the case of a nonpoint source pollution of unlimited extension as can be seen from fig 4 the effects of the coefficients ε and α on the character of the output curves are similar and the differences between them and the exponential model 23a are appreciable an increase in the values of ε and α leads to an increase in the concentration c τ therefore the greater the values of ε and α the greater are the values of calculated for any moment such behavior of function is explained in fig 5 where the colored domains correspond to the trajectories of the particles whose residence time in the bed is less than or equal to τ these domains correspond to the capture areas x l 1 which account for the matter flux with infiltration water q s c r r x 0 τ l 1 which is equal because of continuity to matter flux into the river in any moment τ clearly as x 0 τ is minimal in the case of water flow in a porous homogeneous medium the processes of solute transport in anisotropic and vertically heterogeneous media will always show a more pronounced concentration response further based on the haitjema s concept and eq 20 for the cumulative function f τ the general solution for a rectangular aquifer whose upper recharge boundary comprises a source of limited extent x s 1 x x s 2 fig 1b can be suggested in a form of eq 22 where τ s 1 and τ s 2 correspond to migration times from x s 1 and x s 2 along flow lines to the discharge area 0 x l 1 fig 6 shows an example of the temporal concentration breakthroughs c τ calculated using analytical model eq 22 related to a source of limited extent these results are compared with concentration breakthrough obtained with a finite difference technique mt3d modflow code zheng 2010 as can be seen the two approaches analytical and numerical result in very similar concentration outputs to determine the ttd f τ for flow in the aquifer under consideration one may transform eq 33 by differentiating the left and right sides of it with respect to x 34 d τ d x d d x a f 1 f l 1 1 ψ x 0 z d x d d x a 1 f l 1 1 ψ x 0 z d x a is an arbitrary constant using the rule of differentiation of integrals with variable upper limits accounting for that f f x we obtain 35 d τ d x 1 ψ f 1 f l 1 0 z l 1 1 l 1 ψ 1 f l 1 0 z as d x 1 l 1 d f the desired derivative df d τ takes the form 36 f τ df d τ 1 l 1 ψ f 1 f l 1 0 z l 1 ψ 1 f l 1 0 z 1 the differentials of the stream function ψ in the denominators in the right side of the formula are determined using the previously obtained solution 19 on the premise that f f τ is related with dimensionless time through integral 18 the analysis of ttd plots fig 7 along with the distributions f τ from the exponential model 23a for the dupuit forchheimer flow in a semi infinite homogeneous aquifer of constant thickness and recharge indicates that the output curves drawn from the distribution 23a more or less fit the derived tdd model of a rectangular bounded aquifer draining into a stream only in the case of an isotropic and homogeneous aquifer ε 1 and α 0 when the ratio m l is equal to 0 1 in all other cases the derived ttd model does not exhibit exponential ttds obviously due to the anisotropy and variability of flow properties of the aquifers as well as flowline deformation near the outflow boundary in general the observed tendency showing a pronounced power law relationship between f and τ becomes more vivid as the values of ε and α increase the obtained ttds may also belong to the family of gamma distributions kirchner 2016 such behavior of the ttds is consistent with numerical modeling results obtained for a heterogeneous aquifer with the same spatial trends in the hydraulic conductivity variations cardenas and jiang 2010 thus we agree with the conclusions reported in some recent publications that an exponential model may be not a good approximation for the ttd of a highly heterogeneous aquifer additionally the considered analytical model of ttd can be extended to account for groundwater contamination from a source of limited extent eqs 22 the dimensionless time for this type of ttcdf is 37 τ f 1 l 1 x s 1 ξ 1 x s 1 f l 1 1 ψ x z z d x in this case transformations similar tothose used to derive equation eq 36 yield 38 f τ df d τ 1 l 1 ψ x s 1 f 1 l 1 0 z l 1 ψ ξ 1 x s 1 f l 1 0 z 1 4 a case study this case study illustrates how the proposed ttd function and analytical modeling can contribute to the safety assessment for the disposal of radioactive waste in geological formations to be more specific we will address hydrogeological and environmental problems in conjunction with the nizhne kansky granitic gneiss massif the eastern siberia rf which has been considered as a promising site named yeniseisky for rw due to its isolation properties 4 1 location and hydrogeological setting the yeniseisky site is located within the southwestern margin of the east siberian plateau on the watershed of two rivers yenisei and kan fig 8 geologically this area of the earth s crust is a pre cambrian folded area within the western margin of the ancient siberian platform craton more specifically the site is locatedwithin the angaro kanskiy nose type fold of the yeniseiskiy ridge hereafter referred to as the angaro kanskiy terrain fig 8 archean and early proterozoic metamorphic and intrusive magmatic formations are common here rozov et al 2018 local depressions within this structure are filled with jurassic deposits figs 8 and 9 the deep rw disposal facility is located at the depth of 200 400 m within the nizhne kansky hydrogeological unit represented by fractured metamorphic rocks where two types of subsurface flows can be distinguished fig 9 1 a regional groundwater flow discharging to the valleys of the largest rivers the yenisei and the kan 2 shallow groundwater flows controlled along with runoff by the local topography the recharge zones for these watersare associated with rivers of the third and the second order we think that based on the water balance study for individual sub basins the two types of flows can be efficiently separated and the effective yeniseisky watershed aquifer recharge controlling the long term radionuclide migration can be evaluated within the discussed regional geological framework two study scales can be determined from the viewpoint of the long term safety assessment of radioactive waste disposal 1 the repository scale engineering scale or near field scale i e a radioactive waste disposal area associated with underground mines and 2 the scale of potential influence of the repository on the biosphere the so called far field scale the most recent survey was focused on the repository scale area and therefore in our analysis the data collected under near field conditions were extrapolated to the far field scale we have assumed that all trends established for the repository scale remain unchanged during the transition to the far field an area of potential concern for radionuclide migration this is a serious and somewhat controversial extrapolation approach which may result in a high degree of uncertainty and there is a risk of producing erroneous results however this 2d test case was selected mostly for illustrative purpose to show the capability of the analytical methodology to effectively capture the main features of solute transport in the specifically bounded heterogeneous flow domain the further site characterization studies will diminish the risk 4 2 field site analytical model development as has been mentioned the available hydrogeological data on the aquifer structure the flow net pattern and parameter distributions are based on local estimates and adjusted mostly to the upper part of the watershed where the underground facilities are supposed to be situated therefore the validity of 3d regional scale modeling under the lack of regional information seems to be questionable as can be seen from the results of preliminary assessments in the framework of modflow mt3d flopath analysis rumynin et al 2017 in these circumstances a conceptual 2d profile model for individual transport pathways where the main factor governing the water movement in the aquifer is the recharge might be more appropriate the dominant processes responsible for 2d geosphere radionuclide transport include advection through networks of fractures sorption reactions on mineral surfaces within the host rock and radionuclide decay they can be effectively incorporated into the modeling framework fig 10 shows the geometry of the flow domain and the boundary conditions used in our 2d far field conceptual analysis annual recharge and baseflow fluctuations estimated from water budget methods show that the flow system is minimally affected by seasonal variations in groundwater recharge and it is capable of providing a fairly constant source of discharge to the river sustained groundwater discharge such idealistic picture is fitted to the above mathematical formalism used to extend the traditional ttd approach to models with distributed

characterized in table 1 model parameters used for analytical calculations were chosen to be close to the average values from the engineering survey of the site and water balance data from the yeniseisky catchment analysis the depth trend for the hydraulic conductivity was studied using the borehole packer test data showing that the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured rock tends to decline rapidly with depth as an example data from borehole p13 is shown in fig 11 from which the range of the decay constant a can be evaluated in the following analysis the average value of a is

of calculations based on eq 46 shows that the output activity curves are of pulse type with a sharp rise followed by a long tail fig 12 as seen depending on the radionuclide sorption and decay characteristics as well as on the repository elevation the depth from the surface the plots differ in the initial radionuclide arrival time to the discharge area river yenisei as well as in the activity concentration peak values fig 12 and the pulse duration the general tendencies are as follows table 4 the transit time t min raises quickly as the depth to the rw repository source location increases due to the concentration of flowpaths running through the source in the lower part of the aquifer represented by low permeability rocks fig 12 in contrast as the depth increases the peaks of radionuclide activity c max decrease the latter tendency can be explained by the decrease in the vertical groundwater flux through the rw storage area over depth resulting in an increase in radionuclide dilution in the overflow recharge water thus the transit time of i 129 ranges from around 425 depth 200 m to 8250 depth 400 m years while the peak of activity decreases from 400 to 20 bq l table 4 the sorption considerably retards the radionuclide migration compared to the advective groundwater velocity and activity response curves shift toward later times relative to nonreactive species e g i 129 the magnitude of the shift is approximately proportional to the retardation factor calculations show that in the case of shallow location of the repository less than or equal to 300 m below the surface where the rocks are quite permeable the activity peaks of radionuclides i 129 se 79 and cs 135 are in excess of tens to hundreds bq l resulting in a high activity of the water discharged into the river the above analytical calculations were supplemented with flowpath simulation using modpath modflow pollock 2012 aquifer vertical cross section fig 13 was schematized as a 2d layered system consisting of 100 elemental layers the hydraulic conductivity of each layer was specified following the exponential relationship 1b with an exponent a 0 015 m 1 and k x 0 k z 0 0 07 m d at the depth of the source location the hydraulic conductivity varies from 3 9 10 3 m d 200 m to 1 8 10 4 m d 400 m despite the model s simplicity and conceptual background the simulation allowed the main features of the site hydrogeology to be represented fairly well the obtained head distribution shows a drop in the head from about 370 m the elevated part of the watershed area to around 120 m the river valley which is close to the observed values the model shows also a reasonable vertical hydraulic gradient distribution the imposed boundary conditions including areal recharge 300 m l 4500 m and discharge to the river of finite width 0 l 300 m lead to a change in the sign of the hydraulic gradient from plus the elevated part of the watershed area to minus the discharge area streamline calculation with modpath modflow fig 13 illustrates the age distribution a conservative tracer in the aquifers for different source elevations the travel time along the shortest streamline characterizing the beginning of contamination of the outflow area is in a good agreement with the analytical assessments fig 12a in all cases withhydraulic conductivity rapidly decayingwith depth shallow flow dominates in the aquifer this results in that all streamlines passing through the source concentrate in a very narrow zone near the left no flow boundary of the model domain such flownet geometry complicates the numerical simulation of the solute transport as it is difficult to control the numerical grid effects 5 conclusions a ttd based watershed scale groundwater transport modeling is a widely accepted framework underlying the development of the theory of groundwater contamination and isotope data interpretation this conceptual framework for a long time has been an analytical tool allowing the researcher to create a range of lamped parameter models widely used in the hydrogeological practice however these models are often based on simplified assumptions regarding aquifer geometry and uniform hydraulic conductivity distributions the focus of this study is the potential effect of the vertical heterogeneity of rock permeability on evaluated contaminant travel time in an aquifer and concentration curve response the developed models assume two types of flow domain geometry a semi infinite aquifer and a bounded aquifer in the first setup we derived analytical solutions for the ttd and concentration functions by directly applying the dupuit forchheimer approximation these solutions are applicable to the advection transport of a solute in an aquifer characterized by a vertical hydraulic conductivity profile k z which can be described by either a continuous e g massive rock exhibiting an exponential or power law dependence of k on depth or a discrete a stratified aquifer analytical function a model of a bounded aquifer as a closed form solution is suggested for 1 the explicit incorporation of aquifer characteristics such as the profile aquifer anisotropy in the mathematical problem setting avoiding the dupuit forchheimer assumption 2 the specification of inflow conditions as groundwater recharge 3 the implementation of specific outflow conditions for an aquifer drained by a shallow stream of a finite width however the obtained solution is limited to the case of depth dependent hydraulic conductivity approximated by an exponential decay model the ctds f τ in the form of explicit expressions the case of a semi infinite aquifer or in the form of implicitly integrated functions the case of a bounded aquifer determine the aquifer response to pollution events in a case of step wise chemical input according to the ttd based approach we consider the analytical models of ttds f τ as transfer functions to convolve it with an arbitrary solute input function the developed analytical models of f τ and f τ describing the transport of solutes entering the water table over the whole catchment were extended to account for groundwater contamination from a source of limited extent located on the water table or at some depth f τ and f τ were found to be sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity contrast between layers in stratified systems and hydraulic conductivity decay coefficient and anisotropy ratio in massive rocks it was also shown that the formation anisotropy and the decrease in the hydraulic conductivity with depth can have a significant effect on the vulnerability of the shallow part of groundwater system to contamination from nonpoint pollution sources all analytical solutions were tested by comparing them with those obtained numerically the comparison showed a good agreement between the two approaches to solving the advection transport problem the applicability of the proposed model was examined by predicting the radionuclide transport under conditions of radionuclide release from a high level rw repository which is planned to construct within a gneiss formation yeniseisky site eastern siberia rf the radionuclide source was schematized to have a pulse type on the geological time scale for the forecast period the tests showed that despite the model s simplicity and conceptual background the results of its calculations were qualitatively reasonable and quantitatively accurate the obtained results suggest that repository elevation the depth from land surface within a watershed bedrock aquifer with hydraulic conductivity exponentially decreasing over depth is a factor playing an important role in the safety of radioactive waste disposal author contributions all authors contributed extensively to

5064,in this paper we introduce 2d profile analytical models describing advection solute transport induced by a recharge boundary condition in a catchment scale aquifer represented by a sediment or rock with permeability changing with depth the suggested mathematical formulation is based on the concept of transit time distribution ttd according to which the concentration trend can be derived directly from the cumulative travel time frequency or from the convolution of ttd considered as a transfer function with a solute input function this approach is shown to be applicable to water flow and solute transport in an aquifer characterized by a vertical hydraulic conductivity profile k z which can be described by either continuous e g massive rock exhibiting an exponential or power law dependence of k on depth or discrete a stratified aquifer analytical functions a special focus is on the problem related to advection solute transport in a rectangular anisotropic flow domain bounded by a shallow stream of finite width downflow converging area the suggested analytical models and solutions utilizing new transfer functions and accounting for different inflow and solute flux conditions can be involved in several applications including the assessment of the impacts of spatially variable nonpoint contamination sources on groundwater quality groundwater dating based on the observation of environmental tracers and the study of groundwater recharge itself the models were shown to be applicable not only to simulating the impact on groundwater due to the contaminated recharge but also to predicting aquifer contamination caused by a source located below the water table within the aquifer domain such source can be associated with a radioactive material leachate generated within a deep geological repository of nuclear waste a relevant modeling example is given keywords recharge nonpoint source pollution aquifer vertical heterogeneity and anisotropy ttd radioactive waste disposal radionuclide migration 1 introduction a number of watershed scale models either analytical or numerical with lumped or distributed parameters have been developed to predict groundwater ages and solute transport they have traditionally focused on estimating the impact on water resources due to nonpoint pollution sources within the analytical modeling framework watershed scale aquifers are often represented by simplified linear lumped models averaging the flow and transport properties of the aquifer material this framework traditionally captures the transit time distribution ttd concept according to which the concentration trends can be estimated directly from the cumulative travel time frequency model data or from ttd convolution with a solute input analytical function or a solute time series history by itself the ttd describes the integral effect of all flow pathways at the groundwater discharge location of a watershed aquifer area the development of analytical models of ttds is the subject of considerable research efforts having many implications in the hydrogeology geochemistry and groundwater quality forecasting many lumped parameter models have derived ttds and relevant analytical solutions exist to predict the concentrations of nonpoint source solutes such as industrial municipal and agricultural contaminants discharged to the environment or atmospheric tracers of age among the most popular models suggested by now one can distinguish a piston flow exponential gamma and advection dispersion małoszewski and zuber 1982 yurtsever 1995 amin and campana 1996 maloszewski 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 a detailed description of the model applicability accounting in some respect for the sampling conditions can be found in green et al 2014 gusyev et al 2014 leray et al 2016 generally these models are applicable to relatively homogeneous aquifers with simple geometry in which one dimensional flow dominates or at least to aquifers showing properly upscaled hydraulic conductivity and fickian macrodispersivity and exhibiting dupuit forchheimer behavior hence there is a certain limitation on using the lumped parameter approach to predict solute transport under the conditions where complex processes occur such as flow variable over space and time spatially variable hydraulic conductivity coupled vertical and lateral flow and preferential flow mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 in this context many attempts have been made to extend the ttd formalism to studying groundwater age and solute transport in more complex heterogeneous groundwater systems using the distributed parameter approach accounting for groundwater flow and aquifer geometry for example the earlier models for ttd prediction developed without considering the details of the aquifer geometry were later improved by taking into account a linear trend in the change in the dipping aquifer thickness or using a combination of the confined and unconfined parts of a groundwater system solomon et al 2006 etcheverry 2001 the effect of radial symmetry of dupuit forchheimer flow on the ttd was discussed in leray et al 2012 etcheverry 2001 also considered the case of a 1d aquifer under the conditions of linearly varying recharge rate recently analytical solutions for ttds have been derived accounting for two dimensional advection and scale dependent dispersion in heterogeneous media green et al 2014 as well as matrix diffusion in fractured porous systems gardner et al 2016 the effect of aquifer material heterogeneity on contaminant transport and ttd prediction has long been an important subject of interest of many earth science experts and a vast literature has been dedicated to this issue the application of 2d profile models utilizing a concept of variation of hydraulic conductivity k with depth d seems to be quite efficient and appropriate approach for understanding the solute transport phenomena in heterogeneous geological environments in the earlier works transport through perfectly stratified formations layering over large horizontal distances when k is a random function of the vertical coordinate z only has been studied with priority under an assumption of the absence of recharge r 0 gelhar et al 1979 matheron and de marsily 1980 gelhar 1993 fiori and dagan 2002 these studies have been focused primarily on evaluating the scale dependent and effective macrodispersion coefficients asymptotically approaching constant values over longer observation times in most such studies the flow quasi 1d flow is assumed to occur in an infinite medium parallel to the bedding driven by a constant and horizontal mean head gradient and k is modeled as a stationary random space function later stochastic analysis has been successfully used to assess the effect of uniformly distributed recharge r 0 on the transport of pollutants in a 2d in plane heterogeneous aquifer rubin and bellin 1994 it was shown that the recharge leads to nonstationary macrodispersion coefficients in both the longitudinal and transverse horizontal directions which in contrast to the case of r 0 do not approach constant values the spatial and temporal variability in the recharge field further enhances the spreading of the ensemble mean plume especially in the lateral direction increasing concentration field variances li and graham 1998 1999 swain and chin 2003 in the above cited works the flow is considered at the regional scale which justifies the shallow flow approximation assuming the vertical component of the flow induced by the recharge to be negligible such 2d analysis of flow and transport processes is appropriate for predicting changes in head caused by natural recharge applied to the entire aquifer and the spread and fate of a solute which is distributed all over the depth of the aquifer and is transported over an extended period of time dagan 1989 li and graham 1999 the effects of the recharge treated as a flux boundary condition on the vertical cross flow and transport between the formation layers have been studied based mostly on numerical technique both in 2d and 3d setup kim et al 2000 swain and chin 2003 the results showed that the vertical transverse dispersion can be significantly enhanced by transience in the flow field caused by fluctuations in recharge rates the majority of other results published to date deal with case studies providing solutions for ttds and concentration fields related to realistic regional scale nonpoint source pollutants in heterogeneous aquifer systems obtained within a stochastic modeling framework zhang et al 2006 henri and harter 2019 in particular it was shown that the regional scale vertical transport from the upper recharge boundary to the deeper parts of the aquifer across the main bedding plane of the aquifer system is a significant concern zhang et al 2006 however to our knowledge there are no enough research efforts have been made to develop analytical models that can be used as a deterministic alternative to the random approach for working with sufficient field data i e well discretized aquifer cross sections this was one of the reasons motivating the present study to reduce the significant additional analytical and computational efforts for solving 3d problems the effect of variation of k with d on transport under nonuniform flow and recharge specified boundary conditions will be examined in the framework of a simplified 2d in cross section analysis the conversion from stochastic the random change in k to deterministic models is justified if there are sufficient data on the real distribution of the hydraulic conductivity over depth the dependence of k on d has been investigated in many studies the observed data show a great variety of relations between the hydraulic conductivity and depth depending on many geological factors rock type its chemical alteration the tectonic history of a particular region pressure conditions etc a common view is that the hydraulic conductivity of most rocks decreases with depth at least this is true for fractured formations various empirical models have been proposed to describe the functional relationship between the permeability and depth for bedrock generally there are two major categories of models the models of the first category assume that k can decrease exponentially or logarithmically with d because the overburden pressure tends to decrease the apertures of joints or fractures and the size of pores thus reducing the permeability louis 1974 bredehoeft et al 1983 ma et al 2016 the second category includes power law models such models have finite values of permeability at the ground surface but these values decrease too fast sometimes leading to unrealistically low permeability values at large depth saar and manga 2004 kuang and jiao 2014 and hence as it will be shown later overestimation of the role of the shallow contaminant transport from a nonpoint source pollution unconsolidated sediments which are often stratified with alternating layers of different lithology may have a quite different trend in permeability profile indeed in regional scale reservoirs the heterogeneity associated with the layering can form permeability profile characterized by the inverse dependence of hydraulic conductivity on depth i e an increase in the hydraulic conductivity with depth a special focus of this paper is the influence of such stratification on the ttds and solute transport from a source area eriksson 1958 was probably among the first to draw attention to the fact that a decrease in permeability with depth can affect the travel times for groundwater originating near a water divide this conclusion is based on qualitative reasoning supported by general expert arguments a number of later studies have considered the impact of variations in hydraulic conductivity over depth and the profile anisotropy of the formation on the behavior of a regional groundwater flow system jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 it was shown that the depth decaying trend of hydraulic conductivity as well as formation anisotropy should not be ignored in studies related to the ttds in particular an exponential decrease in permeability enhances shallow circulation and subdues deep regional flows leading to longer residence times for a large part of the domain while the shallower portions pass solutes rapidly cardenas and jiang 2010 the majority of analytical models involve an assumption regarding a prescribed head boundary condition given head variation at the upper aquifer boundary which allows one to study the effect of periodic undulation in water table in the subsurface flow and the flow with the land surface interaction in real aquifer systems the groundwater flow is controlled by recharge rather than the configuration of water table the position of which depends on the groundwater flow regime and is a priori unknown therefore hydrodynamic conceptualization of the upper aquifer boundary as a recharge specified condition seems more reasonable for the prevailing class of hydrogeological problems compared to the above head specified approach in this study we use a ttd based approach to develop advection solute transport models for a watershed scale aquifer with permeability changing with depth based on the ttd concept we extend our previous analysis rumynin et al 2019 to deal with the transport phenomenon both in stratified and massive rocks according to that we consider the analytical models of ttds as transfer functions derived from closed form solutions of the 2d continuity equation coupled with transport characteristic equations to yield solutions for arbitrary input from nonpoint source pollution the findings are important for understanding the effect of aquifer heterogeneity of different nature and anisotropy on groundwater contamination from a non point pollution source and for determining the extent of the effect of the traditionally used ttd related functions for dupuit forchheimer flow on the accuracy of subsurface solute transport solutions such understanding is necessary to predict groundwater contamination due to the leakage from municipal industrial and agricultural deposits as well as to provide a basis for the assessment of waste management plans and for planning the design of groundwater quality monitoring systems the numerical technique widely used nowadays to simulate ttds under various field or test conditions luther and haitjema 1998 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 zlotnik et al 2011 leray et al 2012 engdahl et al 2016 is beyond the scope of this paper with this technique by solving the advection transport equations we only validate the analytical models in addition in practice a direct application of the above modeling concept purely advective solute transport may introduce certain errors in the groundwater contamination forecasts and groundwater dating since the effect of hydrodynamic dispersive mixing of dissolved species i e environmental tracers is ignored solomon and sudicky 1991 moreover in heterogeneous aquifer systems with a large hydraulic conductivity variance the ttd may itself deviate from the fickian model weissmann et al 2002 gotovac et al 2009 rumynin 2011 but this is also anissue beyond the scope of the present study 2 conceptual models and physical setup the present mathematical settings related to a non point source of groundwater contamination are chosen to assess the influence of the depth dependent hydraulic conductivity and in some particular cases aquifer anisotropy on the average concentration of the groundwater solute discharging from the outflow section of watershed aquifer with and without simplification of the output boundary x s 1 x x s 2 conditions fig 1 in both setups the aquifer has a constant thickness m in z direction the recharge is uniformly distributed over the top of the aquifer z 0 the bottom of the aquifer and the water divide act as no flow boundaries the recharge water contains dissolved species such chemical input contamination source can be uniformly distributed over the whole inflow boundary or only over a limited interval x s 1 x x s 2 also z 0 fig 1 some specific case x s 1 x x s 2 0 z m will be also considered section 4 the study starts with a relatively simple aquifer geometry the so called semi infinite aquifer with a no flow boundary and a hydraulic conductivity k z permitted to vary with depth arbitrarily continuously massive rock or in a step wise manner stratified aquifer fig 1a this simplification is applicable if an aquifer shows a thickness small relative to the distance between its lateral boundaries thus the flow in such aquifer exhibits dupuit forchheimer behavior with the horizontal velocity assumed uniform over depth haitjema 1995 then we will consider a case of a bounded aquifer which utilizes the concept of groundwater discharge into a stream of finite width under confined conditions through its bottom a discharge specified boundary on a restricted interval belonging to the x axis a no flow boundary x 0 can be associated with the line of symmetry dividing a v shape watershed into two equivalent planeshaving width l and therefore l 1 is the half stream width fig 1b area 0 x l 1 can be associated also with a lake wetland alluvial plain and coastal area the width of a stream or other water body has been shown to appreciably affect the transient time distribution if l 1 l 0 1 luther and haitjema 1998 abrams 2013 thus restricting the applicability of the simplified analytical models only to watersheds containing narrow river valleys the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the aquifer hydraulic characteristics make this criterion less reliable the mathematical formalization of the flow process is based on the continuity equation for a flow of a homogeneous fluid polubarinova kochina 1952 bear 1972 1 v x x v z z 0 where v x and v z are the horizontal and vertical components of the specific discharge 2 1 dupuit forchheimer flow in a

2 non dupuit forchheimer flow in an aquifer with discharge specified outflow boundary condition the credibility range of the dupuit forchheimer assumption and simplified aquifer geometry used above in the prediction of steady state flow structure in heterogeneous systems can be studied based on more precise solutions unfortunately closed forms of such solutions are not always possible this is not the case for the exponential model for k z which has been chosen in this study due to mathematical convenience in order to derive the closed form solutions although this case is very specific and limited to what has been observed in the literature it can help to explore some aspects of the physical behavior of heterogeneous groundwater systems the transformation of the continuity eq 1 can be done through the darcy representation of the specific discharge components vx and vz 13 v x k x h x ψ z v z k z h z ψ x where h h x z is the hydraulic head l ψ ψ x z is the stream function l2t 1 in a case of vertical heterogeneity of the aquifer material k x k x z and k z k z z i e the hydraulic conductivity is a function of depth z below land surface or some reference level jiang et al 2011 yao et al 2017 in the case of an anisotropic aquifer the ratio of the hydraulic conductivities kx and kz remains constant in any point of the flow domain such that the aquifer shows a vertical anisotropy ratio ε k x k z in our analysis the aquifer is anisotropic and an exponentially decaying function is used to describe the decrease of hydraulic conductivity with depth jiang et al 2011 13a k x k x 0 exp a z k z k z 0 exp a z ε k x 0 k z 0 where kx 0 and kz 0 are the values of the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity at the aquifer top z 0 respectively a is the depth decay exponent as in eq 8 the decrease in the conductivity with depth is common in the majority of fractured geological formations due to the increasing closure of fractures with depth because of the increasing normal stress caused by the weight of the overlying rock earnest and boutt 2014 chen et al 2018 the anisotropy in permeability is also a fundamental property of fractured rock freeze and cherry 1979 zlotnik et al 2011 the vertical anisotropy of fractured hard rock aquifers may be due to the density of sub horizontal slightly sloping weathering induced fractures being higher than that of tectonic sub vertical steeply dipping fractures lachassagne et al 2014 in addition slightly sloping fractures have a higher hydraulic conductivity than steeply dipping fractures do resulting in the former fractures dominating in the flow field thus producing anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity earnest and boutt 2014 when speaking about the vertical anisotropy of porous media one refers mostly to layered systems where low permeability layers are sandwiched between permeable domains the substitution of eqs 13 and 13b into the continuity eq 1 results in laplace type equations for both the hydraulic head and the stream function thus the stream function ψ f x z is determined by solving the equation of this type chesnaux et al 2005 jiang et al 2011 14 x 1 k z 0 e az ψ x z 1 k x 0 e az ψ z

analysis traditionally based on the dupuit forchheimer concept section 2 1 allowing the vertical resistance to groundwater flow to be neglected plots in fig 2 drawn using the solutions 16 and 17 illustrate the pattern of groundwater flow net in an anisotropic and heterogeneous aquifer in particular they show that an increase in the anisotropy and the rate of permeability attenuation leads to the concentration of streamlines flow discharge near aquifer top also as can be seen from fig 2b an inversion of the gradient of hydraulic head can occur in an aquifer with high ε values the same section x can show an increase in the head over depth in its upper part and its decrease in the lower part i e the plot of h z has an extremum the temporal aspects of water and solute behavior in a catchment scale aquifer under net recharge conditions can be described in terms of atransit time tt the formulas for the tt as a time characteristic of the motion of fluid particles along a fixed trajectory ψ x z in the absence of dispersion effects can be derived from kinematic expressions 5 for the principal components of flow velocity 13 where φ is porosity assumed to be constant separating variables in the first formula in eq 5 and integrating this expression with eq 13 taken into account we come to the following equation for the dimensionless tt from a recharge area to discharge into a stream rumynin et al 2019 18 τ t mtt x s x 1 ψ x z z d x where mtt φ m r is the mean transit time the lower integration limit x s is dimensionless flowline entrance coordinate the initial coordinate

summarizing the above reasoning we can conclude that the key limitations of the model are as follows groundwater flow is confined which can be true if the relative change in the saturated thickness is small mathematical problem setup does not take into account dispersion and assumes that the porosity at different depths is the same 3 the transit time related definitions and basic concentration functions 3 1 a ttd concept for an aquifer having a constant ratio of φ m r haitjema 1995 introduced f τ a cumulative distribution function of the transit times ttcdf or simply ctd which determines the portion q τ of the total discharge q tot which has groundwater transit time less than or equal to τ i e 20 f τ q τ q tot statistically the relationships for f τ describe the frequency distribution of times that it takes water molecules to reach the aquifer outlet from all locations in the source aquifer catchment area mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 the dimensionless time τ as in eq 18 is the ratio of time t to the mean transit time mtt φ m r the other common term for the transit time is the derivative of f with respect to τ 21 f τ d f d τ which can be referred to as the transit time probability density function ttpdf or simply transit time distribution ttd which is the integrated response time of an aquifer to a unit concentration input functions f τ and f τ are fundamental characteristics for determining aquifer response to pollution event in the case of step wise conservative chemical input cin const over the entire groundwater reservoir with constant recharge f τ directly corresponds to the relative concentration c c c in for pure advection flow because the ratio q τ q tot is the proportion of mixing of the contaminated and pollution free groundwater for a pollution source of limited extension x s 2 x s x s 1 fig 1 the general analytical solution for the solute concentration can be also expressed through the cumulative distribution function 22 c τ 0 0 τ τ s 1 f τ f τ s 1 τ s 1 τ τ s 2 f τ s 2 f τ s 1 τ τ s 2 where τ s 1 and τ s 2 correspond to migration times from x s 1 and x s 2 along flowlines to the section x l fig 1a or the discharge area fig 1b introducing the ttd allows the solution for arbitrary input concentration c in τ to be represented in the well known form of convolution integral małoszewski and zuber 1982 haitjema 1995 solomon et al 2006 23 c τ 0 c in τ σ f σ exp λ σ d σ where the exponential term accounts for first order decay λ λ t λ is the decay constant σ is a dummy variable dimensionless the characteristic f τ serves as a weight function also f τ is the response concentration curve for an instantaneous unit pulse of a conservative tracer applied over the entire groundwater reservoir by convolving the ttd with a solute s input history the age of groundwater and the concentrations of nonpoint source solutes can be estimated green et al 2014 for an idealized semi infinite aquifer of constant thickness and recharge assuming steady state dupuit forchheimer flow the transit time characteristics ctd ttd reduce to the exponential lumped model małoszewski and zuber 1982 zuber 1986 solomon et al 2006 leray et al 2012 23a f τ 1 exp τ f τ exp τ although lumped parameter models of that type are still frequently requested by hydrological practice and have a potential for development the distributed parameter modeling approach considering realistic groundwater flow in aquifers with certain geometry and boundary conditions is nowadays preferably used in the ttd analysis that can be illustrated by examples below 3 2 arbitrary distribution of the hydraulic conductivity if the permeability is heterogeneous only in the vertical direction and the dupuit forchheimer assumption is true then the isochrones are horizontal and function f is determined by transmissivity ratio 24 f τ t z τ t m where t z τ is implicitly determined by the first eq 7b at η z which in turn can be found from the transcendent formula 7a for an exponential distribution of permeability over depth eq 8 t z τ and t m can be calculated by eq a1 see appendix a 25 f τ 1 e α z τ 1 e α substituting z τ from a4 see appendix a into 25 allows f τ to be represented in the explicit form 26 f τ 1 p τ 1 p τ e α p τ exp α τ e α 1 e α in the asymptotic case α a m 0 homogeneous aquifer we come to the exponential model 23a małoszewski and zuber 1982 zuber 1986 solomon et al 2006 the derivative of function f τ 26 determines the ttd 27 f τ α p τ e 2 α 1 e α 1 e α p τ 2 3 3 a stratified aquifer according to the above definition for a cumulative distribution function of the transit times 20 we can write for a stratified aquifer fig 1a 28 f t l x s t l where x s t is the current coordinate characterized by matter migration time t to the flow section x l considering eq 12 formula 28 can be rewritten as 29 f i t 1 a i k i z s t b i a 1 where z s t is flow depth in the section x l fig 1a the ttd for solute transport in a stratified semi infinite aquifer can be found by differentiation of eq 29 with respect to t 30 f i t k i a 1 d z s t dt k i r a 1 2 φ i a i k i z s t b i assuming x l and solving 12 we can determine the depth of flow z s in section x l and hence using the solution 10 the time t required for the pollutant to reach this depth in point zs a specific feature of the calculation algorithm is the need to find the number of the aquifer layer i that contains the flow line that crosses the section x l in point zs this number is not specified a priori it can be found with the use of a simple algorithm for determining the points x i where flow lines originating within the interval x s 2 x x s 1 cross the boundaries of the ith layers fig 1a 31 x i x s a 1 a i k i m i 3 4 an illustrative example this example was formulated so as to assess the convergence of two solutions one of which pertains to an aquifer characterized by hydraulic conductivity exponentially decreasing with depth eqs 26 27 the other solution eqs 29 30 refers to a stratified aquifer consisting of layers with hydraulic conductivity varying over depth following the same exponential tendency in other words in the second calculations the variation in hydraulic conductivity with depth was incorporated in a groundwater model with the use of multiple layers calculations fig 3 show that the exponential decrease in the hydraulic conductivity with depth can be successfully approximated by a step wise function with a rather low number of intervals acceptable results are obtained when the number of effective layers is equal to or more than 10 finally numerical test proves the effectiveness of the used algorithm for a stratified system 3 5 an exact solution for a bounded aquifer the focus of this section is to develop analytical models of ctd ttd for a rectangular aquifer areally recharged by precipitation assuming that all flow paths converge at discharge area represented by a shallow stream fig 1b we start with the definition of the cumulative distribution function for the transit times eq 20 in terms of the stream function entry coordinate ψ 1 x s τ through the linear relationships 32 f τ x s τ l 1 1 l 1 where x s τ x s τ l is a dimensionless coordinate specifying the point of entry l 1 x 1 for particles whose migration time to the discharge area 0 x l 1 along the flowline ψ τ is τ the function x s τ is a subject of the further analysis to define function f τ an identical eq 18 was used rewritten as follows 33 τ f 1 f l 1 1 f l 1 1 ψ x z z d x with this on the one hand function f τ defines the lower and upper limits of the integral 33 and on the other hand the kernel of this integral is also f dependent because the desirable streamline ψ x z eq 16 used to determine the differential d ψ d z eq 19 is ψ 1 l 1 1 f therefore technically calculations of f τ based on the integral 33 require some optimization and efforts examples of such calculations are presented in fig 4 where the influence of ε and α on f depending of the aquifer geometry ratio m l is illustrated since in the context of groundwater contamination the function f τ is identical to the concentration function c τ 22 the plots in fig 4 give an idea of the temporal behavior of a nonreactive component in the discharge area for the case of a nonpoint source pollution of unlimited extension as can be seen from fig 4 the effects of the coefficients ε and α on the character of the output curves are similar and the differences between them and the exponential model 23a are appreciable an increase in the values of ε and α leads to an increase in the concentration c τ therefore the greater the values of ε and α the greater are the values of calculated for any moment such behavior of function is explained in fig 5 where the colored domains correspond to the trajectories of the particles whose residence time in the bed is less than or equal to τ these domains correspond to the capture areas x l 1 which account for the matter flux with infiltration water q s c r r x 0 τ l 1 which is equal because of continuity to matter flux into the river in any moment τ clearly as x 0 τ is minimal in the case of water flow in a porous homogeneous medium the processes of solute transport in anisotropic and vertically heterogeneous media will always show a more pronounced concentration response further based on the haitjema s concept and eq 20 for the cumulative function f τ the general solution for a rectangular aquifer whose upper recharge boundary comprises a source of limited extent x s 1 x x s 2 fig 1b can be suggested in a form of eq 22 where τ s 1 and τ s 2 correspond to migration times from x s 1 and x s 2 along flow lines to the discharge area 0 x l 1 fig 6 shows an example of the temporal concentration breakthroughs c τ calculated using analytical model eq 22 related to a source of limited extent these results are compared with concentration breakthrough obtained with a finite difference technique mt3d modflow code zheng 2010 as can be seen the two approaches analytical and numerical result in very similar concentration outputs to determine the ttd f τ for flow in the aquifer under consideration one may transform eq 33 by differentiating the left and right sides of it with respect to x 34 d τ d x d d x a f 1 f l 1 1 ψ x 0 z d x d d x a 1 f l 1 1 ψ x 0 z d x a is an arbitrary constant using the rule of differentiation of integrals with variable upper limits accounting for that f f x we obtain 35 d τ d x 1 ψ f 1 f l 1 0 z l 1 1 l 1 ψ 1 f l 1 0 z as d x 1 l 1 d f the desired derivative df d τ takes the form 36 f τ df d τ 1 l 1 ψ f 1 f l 1 0 z l 1 ψ 1 f l 1 0 z 1 the differentials of the stream function ψ in the denominators in the right side of the formula are determined using the previously obtained solution 19 on the premise that f f τ is related with dimensionless time through integral 18 the analysis of ttd plots fig 7 along with the distributions f τ from the exponential model 23a for the dupuit forchheimer flow in a semi infinite homogeneous aquifer of constant thickness and recharge indicates that the output curves drawn from the distribution 23a more or less fit the derived tdd model of a rectangular bounded aquifer draining into a stream only in the case of an isotropic and homogeneous aquifer ε 1 and α 0 when the ratio m l is equal to 0 1 in all other cases the derived ttd model does not exhibit exponential ttds obviously due to the anisotropy and variability of flow properties of the aquifers as well as flowline deformation near the outflow boundary in general the observed tendency showing a pronounced power law relationship between f and τ becomes more vivid as the values of ε and α increase the obtained ttds may also belong to the family of gamma distributions kirchner 2016 such behavior of the ttds is consistent with numerical modeling results obtained for a heterogeneous aquifer with the same spatial trends in the hydraulic conductivity variations cardenas and jiang 2010 thus we agree with the conclusions reported in some recent publications that an exponential model may be not a good approximation for the ttd of a highly heterogeneous aquifer additionally the considered analytical model of ttd can be extended to account for groundwater contamination from a source of limited extent eqs 22 the dimensionless time for this type of ttcdf is 37 τ f 1 l 1 x s 1 ξ 1 x s 1 f l 1 1 ψ x z z d x in this case transformations similar tothose used to derive equation eq 36 yield 38 f τ df d τ 1 l 1 ψ x s 1 f 1 l 1 0 z l 1 ψ ξ 1 x s 1 f l 1 0 z 1 4 a case study this case study illustrates how the proposed ttd function and analytical modeling can contribute to the safety assessment for the disposal of radioactive waste in geological formations to be more specific we will address hydrogeological and environmental problems in conjunction with the nizhne kansky granitic gneiss massif the eastern siberia rf which has been considered as a promising site named yeniseisky for rw due to its isolation properties 4 1 location and hydrogeological setting the yeniseisky site is located within the southwestern margin of the east siberian plateau on the watershed of two rivers yenisei and kan fig 8 geologically this area of the earth s crust is a pre cambrian folded area within the western margin of the ancient siberian platform craton more specifically the site is locatedwithin the angaro kanskiy nose type fold of the yeniseiskiy ridge hereafter referred to as the angaro kanskiy terrain fig 8 archean and early proterozoic metamorphic and intrusive magmatic formations are common here rozov et al 2018 local depressions within this structure are filled with jurassic deposits figs 8 and 9 the deep rw disposal facility is located at the depth of 200 400 m within the nizhne kansky hydrogeological unit represented by fractured metamorphic rocks where two types of subsurface flows can be distinguished fig 9 1 a regional groundwater flow discharging to the valleys of the largest rivers the yenisei and the kan 2 shallow groundwater flows controlled along with runoff by the local topography the recharge zones for these watersare associated with rivers of the third and the second order we think that based on the water balance study for individual sub basins the two types of flows can be efficiently separated and the effective yeniseisky watershed aquifer recharge controlling the long term radionuclide migration can be evaluated within the discussed regional geological framework two study scales can be determined from the viewpoint of the long term safety assessment of radioactive waste disposal 1 the repository scale engineering scale or near field scale i e a radioactive waste disposal area associated with underground mines and 2 the scale of potential influence of the repository on the biosphere the so called far field scale the most recent survey was focused on the repository scale area and therefore in our analysis the data collected under near field conditions were extrapolated to the far field scale we have assumed that all trends established for the repository scale remain unchanged during the transition to the far field an area of potential concern for radionuclide migration this is a serious and somewhat controversial extrapolation approach which may result in a high degree of uncertainty and there is a risk of producing erroneous results however this 2d test case was selected mostly for illustrative purpose to show the capability of the analytical methodology to effectively capture the main features of solute transport in the specifically bounded heterogeneous flow domain the further site characterization studies will diminish the risk 4 2 field site analytical model development as has been mentioned the available hydrogeological data on the aquifer structure the flow net pattern and parameter distributions are based on local estimates and adjusted mostly to the upper part of the watershed where the underground facilities are supposed to be situated therefore the validity of 3d regional scale modeling under the lack of regional information seems to be questionable as can be seen from the results of preliminary assessments in the framework of modflow mt3d flopath analysis rumynin et al 2017 in these circumstances a conceptual 2d profile model for individual transport pathways where the main factor governing the water movement in the aquifer is the recharge might be more appropriate the dominant processes responsible for 2d geosphere radionuclide transport include advection through networks of fractures sorption reactions on mineral surfaces within the host rock and radionuclide decay they can be effectively incorporated into the modeling framework fig 10 shows the geometry of the flow domain and the boundary conditions used in our 2d far field conceptual analysis annual recharge and baseflow fluctuations estimated from water budget methods show that the flow system is minimally affected by seasonal variations in groundwater recharge and it is capable of providing a fairly constant source of discharge to the river sustained groundwater discharge such idealistic picture is fitted to the above mathematical formalism used to extend the traditional ttd approach to models with distributed parameters the only difference is the location of the concentration source placed on the watershed no flow boundary in the middle part of the aquifer the input concentration at the subsurface source associated with the underground rw disposal facility located at depth z z 0 is of a pulse type determined by the dirac delta function 39 c in t p r z δ t where rz is the water flux to the plane z z 0 the fraction of the recharge that reaches the depth z z 0 39a r z t m t z t m r tm is the total transmissivity tz is the transmissivity in the interval 0 z z 0 39b t m 0 m k η d η t z 0 z k η d η if the hydraulic conductivity exponentially decreases with depth then 39c r z exp α z 0 exp α 1 exp α r and eq 39 can be rewritten as 40 c in τ pr m φ r z k δ τ τ t t t m φ k r where p is the radionuclide activity per unit surface area of the mine ml 2 k is a retardation factor for porous rock k 1 k d ρ b φ dimensionless now taking into account eq 40 the convolution integral eq 23 can be transformed as follows 41 c τ 0 δ τ σ f σ exp λ σ d σ f τ exp λ τ where c τ c τ m φ k p λ λ t thus the ttd function f τ multiplied by the decay rate factor is a solution of the problem 42 c τ pr m φ r z k f τ exp λ τ the algorithm of ttd calculations includes three steps 1 identifying a particular stream function ψ x s 1 z 0 delineating the subsurface concentration source fig 10 2 determining from eq 16 the coordinate x s 1 1 ψ x s 1 z 0 as a starting point for calculating the current values x 1 ψ x z 0 x s 1 x 1 allowing the ctd to be termed 43 f τ x x s 1 1 l 1 x s 1 x 1 where x is related

τ eq 46 takes into account the dilution of the primary impulse with recharge water 4 3 set up of model parameters and a source term the model domain is a rectangle fig 10 with shape geometry characterized in table 1 model parameters used for analytical calculations were chosen to be close to the average values from the engineering survey of the site and water balance data from the yeniseisky catchment analysis the depth trend for the hydraulic conductivity was studied using the borehole packer test data showing that the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured rock tends to decline rapidly with depth as an example data from borehole p13 is shown in fig 11 from which the range of the decay constant a can be evaluated in the following analysis the average value of a is used table 2 the average value of the fracture porosity about 0 3 is a result of the borehole core examination and geophysical loggings the matrix porosity in this analysis was assumed negligible finally the effective groundwater recharge rate r the portion of the infiltration drained by the fractured bedrock corresponds to 7 of the annual precipitation 660 mm which was evaluated via water balance and hydrology for the yeniseisky catchment table 2 the safety in the context of the activity of radionuclides in the discharge area was assessed in the form of breakthrough curves for three depth intervals associated with the rw storage 200 300 and 400 m below the surface four long lived radionuclides among those that are relevant for the safety assessment have been chosen for further modeling analysis table 3 they are major dose contributors and typical representatives of species that differ in half life t 1 2 correspondingly decay constants λ and in sorption capacity characterized by the retardation factor k the presented values of k are commonly used to describe the behavior of nonreactive radionuclides e g i 129 weakly sorbable radionuclides e g se 79 medium sorbable radionuclides e g cs 135 and highly sorbable radionuclides e g pu 239 rozov et al 2018 the disposal project information on the total activity m of radionuclides accumulated in the underground repository with known area s before its closure was used to assess the density of radionuclide contamination p distributed over the whole mine table 3 4 4 calculation results a graphical presentation of calculations based on eq 46 shows that the output activity curves are of pulse type with a sharp rise followed by a long tail fig 12 as seen depending on the radionuclide sorption and decay characteristics as well as on the repository elevation the depth from the surface the plots differ in the initial radionuclide arrival time to the discharge area river yenisei as well as in the activity concentration peak values fig 12 and the pulse duration the general tendencies are as follows table 4 the transit time t min raises quickly as the depth to the rw repository source location increases due to the concentration of flowpaths running through the source in the lower part of the aquifer represented by low permeability rocks fig 12 in contrast as the depth increases the peaks of radionuclide activity c max decrease the latter tendency can be explained by the decrease in the vertical groundwater flux through the rw storage area over depth resulting in an increase in radionuclide dilution in the overflow recharge water thus the transit time of i 129 ranges from around 425 depth 200 m to 8250 depth 400 m years while the peak of activity decreases from 400 to 20 bq l table 4 the sorption considerably retards the radionuclide migration compared to the advective groundwater velocity and activity response curves shift toward later times relative to nonreactive species e g i 129 the magnitude of the shift is approximately proportional to the retardation factor calculations show that in the case of shallow location of the repository less than or equal to 300 m below the surface where the rocks are quite permeable the activity peaks of radionuclides i 129 se 79 and cs 135 are in excess of tens to hundreds bq l resulting in a high activity of the water discharged into the river the above analytical calculations were supplemented with flowpath simulation using modpath modflow pollock 2012 aquifer vertical cross section fig 13 was schematized as a 2d layered system consisting of 100 elemental layers the hydraulic conductivity of each layer was specified following the exponential relationship 1b with an exponent a 0 015 m 1 and k x 0 k z 0 0 07 m d at the depth of the source location the hydraulic conductivity varies from 3 9 10 3 m d 200 m to 1 8 10 4 m d 400 m despite the model s simplicity and conceptual background the simulation allowed the main features of the site hydrogeology to be represented fairly well the obtained head distribution shows a drop in the head from about 370 m the elevated part of the watershed area to around 120 m the river valley which is close to the observed values the model shows also a reasonable vertical hydraulic gradient distribution the imposed boundary conditions including areal recharge 300 m l 4500 m and discharge to the river of finite width 0 l 300 m lead to a change in the sign of the hydraulic gradient from plus the elevated part of the watershed area to minus the discharge area streamline calculation with modpath modflow fig 13 illustrates the age distribution a conservative tracer in the aquifers for different source elevations the travel time along the shortest streamline characterizing the beginning of contamination of the outflow area is in a good agreement with the analytical assessments fig 12a in all cases withhydraulic conductivity rapidly decayingwith depth shallow flow dominates in the aquifer this results in that all streamlines passing through the source concentrate in a very narrow zone near the left no flow boundary of the model domain such flownet geometry complicates the numerical simulation of the solute transport as it is difficult to control the numerical grid effects 5 conclusions a ttd based watershed scale groundwater transport modeling is a widely accepted framework underlying the development of the theory of groundwater contamination and isotope data interpretation this conceptual framework for a long time has been an analytical tool allowing the researcher to create a range of lamped parameter models widely used in the hydrogeological practice however these models are often based on simplified assumptions regarding aquifer geometry and uniform hydraulic conductivity distributions the focus of this study is the potential effect of the vertical heterogeneity of rock permeability on evaluated contaminant travel time in an aquifer and concentration curve response the developed models assume two types of flow domain geometry a semi infinite aquifer and a bounded aquifer in the first setup we derived analytical solutions for the ttd and concentration functions by directly applying the dupuit forchheimer approximation these solutions are applicable to the advection transport of a solute in an aquifer characterized by a vertical hydraulic conductivity profile k z which can be described by either a continuous e g massive rock exhibiting an exponential or power law dependence of k on depth or a discrete a stratified aquifer analytical function a model of a bounded aquifer as a closed form solution is suggested for 1 the explicit incorporation of aquifer characteristics such as the profile aquifer anisotropy in the mathematical problem setting avoiding the dupuit forchheimer assumption 2 the specification of inflow conditions as groundwater recharge 3 the implementation of specific outflow conditions for an aquifer drained by a shallow stream of a finite width however the obtained solution is limited to the case of depth dependent hydraulic conductivity approximated by an exponential decay model the ctds f τ in the form of explicit expressions the case of a semi infinite aquifer or in the form of implicitly integrated functions the case of a bounded aquifer determine the aquifer response to pollution events in a case of step wise chemical input according to the ttd based approach we consider the analytical models of ttds f τ as transfer functions to convolve it with an arbitrary solute input function the developed analytical models of f τ and f τ describing the transport of solutes entering the water table over the whole catchment were extended to account for groundwater contamination from a source of limited extent located on the water table or at some depth f τ and f τ were found to be sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity contrast between layers in stratified systems and hydraulic conductivity decay coefficient and anisotropy ratio in massive rocks it was also shown that the formation anisotropy and the decrease in the hydraulic conductivity with depth can have a significant effect on the vulnerability of the shallow part of groundwater system to contamination from nonpoint pollution sources all analytical solutions were tested by comparing them with those obtained numerically the comparison showed a good agreement between the two approaches to solving the advection transport problem the applicability of the proposed model was examined by predicting the radionuclide transport under conditions of radionuclide release from a high level rw repository which is planned to construct within a gneiss formation yeniseisky site eastern siberia rf the radionuclide source was schematized to have a pulse type on the geological time scale for the forecast period the tests showed that despite the model s simplicity and conceptual background the results of its calculations were qualitatively reasonable and quantitatively accurate the obtained results suggest that repository elevation the depth from land surface within a watershed bedrock aquifer with hydraulic conductivity exponentially decreasing over depth is a factor playing an important role in the safety of radioactive waste disposal author contributions all authors contributed extensively to

exponentially decaying with depth for an exponentially decaying hydraulic conductivity k z 8 the dimensionless travel time τ t m t t versus dimensionless vertical coordinate z z m can be determined from eq 7a where according to 7b a1 t η t η k 0 m 1 α 1 e α η t m t m k 0 m 1 α 1 e α α a m then the integral 7a takes the form a2 τ 1 e α 0 z d η e α η e α the integration of a2 results in a3 τ 1 e α
