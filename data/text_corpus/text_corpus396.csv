1980,identifying critical soil erosion areas and sediment sources are essential for sediment control and water resources management in the watershed especially in the severely eroded northern loess plateau china in this study we collected suspended sediment samples at the hydrological stations to identify the sediment source dynamics during flood events in a highly erodible basin the huangfu river basin in the northern loess plateau a total of 6 flood events were sampled during 2016 and 2018 for investigation the flow discharge was featured by a rapid rising limb and a slow falling limb compared with the sediment sources the silt fraction in the suspended sediments was enriched and the sand fraction in the suspended sediment was depleted the dominant particle grain size of suspended sediments was coarse sand 56 89 higher than silt 41 81 and clay 1 3 the sediment sources were estimated using the fingerpro unmixing model based on the conservativeness index ci and consensus ranking cr methods the results of the unmixing model reveal that the bare land was the predominant source of suspended sediments ranging from 40 to 57 which was much higher than farmland 27 31 and grassland 16 25 our findings imply that the bare land weathered sandstone area is the critical region for soil loss control in the huangfu river basin a combination of vegetation restoration measures and engineering measures are proposed to improve the sustainable development of ecological environment in the basin keywords flood events conservativeness and consensus method fingerpro sediment source huangfu river basin data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction intense soil erosion is a serious threat to ecosystem security and services such as biodiversity protection land degradation food production and water resource management feng et al 2010 brevik et al 2015 smith et al 2015 exploring complex soil erosion and sediment transport process is an ongoing challenge accordingly identifying the critical soil erosion areas and sediment sources would be of great significance in terms of environmental protection which would provide a scientific basis for a better understanding of soil erosion processes and sediment delivery and a good reference for the implementation of appropriate strategies for soil loss in recent decades a growing body of study has focused on expanding and improving different approaches for soil erosion monitoring and sediment source tracing collins and walling 2002 sukhija et al 1998 walling et al 1999 grousset and biscaye 2005 zhang et al 2006 haddadchi et al 2013 although several traditional techniques have been successively applied to obtain soil erosion rates and the critical area of sediment sources i e erosion pins runoff plots and unmanned aerial vehicle measurement wang et al 2011 xu et al 2007 ma et al 2011 wei 2003 many deficiencies and problems still exist such as representativeness of study area error of experimental operation spatial sampling constraints peart and walling 1986 peart and walling 1988 lizaga et al 2019 consequently the sediment fingerprinting technique that relies on modern high precision testing techniques and analytical tools was developed to identify sediment source the sediment fingerprinting approach employs mathematical or statistical methodologies to allocate sediment provenance using specific source and sediment properties the most widely used fingerprints include soil properties e g grain size and color wang 2001 krein et al 2003 magnetism venturae et al 2002 and radioactive nuclide 137cs 210pb rare earth element ree gaspar et al 2019a b recently biomarkers and stable isotope have been used as fingerprinting tracers wang et al 2018 mabit et al 2018 sherriff et al 2018 amorim et al 2021 pulley and collins 2021 evrard et al 2020 lizaga et al 2021 and a variety of studies have proved that fingerprinting techniques offer an efficient method to identify sediment sources and track sediment movement across the landscape at various temporal and spatial scales guzman et al 2013 laceby et al 2017 despite the growing application of the fingerprinting technique it was still difficult to accurately distinguish sediment source and quantify the contribution of the individual source using single property fingerprint because of the diversity of sediment sources and the complex sediment transport process collins and walling 2002 xu et al 2007 subsequently fingerprinting techniques have been improved from single property fingerprints to multi property composite fingerprinting techniques with a higher source discrimination however the tracer selection method is under development for both single property fingerprints and multi property composite fingerprints pulley et al 2015 palaz√≥n et al 2015 laceby et al 2017 smith et al 2015 collins et al 2013 different tracer selection methods would present different fingerprinting results and substantially induce erroneous into the frequentists and bayesian models lizaga et al 2020a lizaga et al 2021 to date the most widespread methods include the range test the mixing polygon the kruskal wallis test and the discriminant function analysis walling et al 1999 gellis and walling 2011 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 vale et al 2020 more recently lizaga et al 2020a illustrated that the procedure of classical tracer selection methods ignored some non conservative tracers and did not incorporate the information of the sediment mixtures thereby to estimate sediment contribution accurately and consider the information of sediment mixture a novel methodology was proposed by lizaga et al 2020a to identify the conservativeness and consistency of individual tracer which has been validated that the identification ability was superior to current tracer selection methods the huangfu river basin is a severely eroded region on the northern loess plateau of china numerous researches mostly identified the sediment sources relying on historical deposition information of sediment in the dam controlled watersheds 10 km2 using the traditional fingerprinting technique zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a b however few researchers focused on sediment tracing of flood events and revealing dynamic variations of source contribution during the flood processes in a larger scale basin accordingly a novel method for tracer selection and the fingerpro unmixing model were employed to discriminate the dominant sediment source and quantify source apportions during several flood events in the basin the results could provide useful insights for soil erosion control and consequently improve ecological services of the highly erodible regions in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin 2 study area the huangfu river basin 39 12 n to 39 54 n 110 18 e to 111 12 e is in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin and covers an area of 3 246 km2 fig 1 a and 1b in this basin the topography is relatively complex and is characterized by a hilly and gully landscape and the main soil types include aeolian loess and sandy soil the basin is widely concerned at home and abroad because of the so called pisha sandstone which is a general appellation in china for some type of fluvial clastic deposition sandstone formed in the jurassic triassic and cretaceous period zhen et al 2016 liang et al 2019 the erosion products from the pisha sandstone weathered sandstone mostly distributed on steep slopes and is more prone to erosion than aeolian loess and sandy soil because of its coarser particles strong water permeability and poor resistance li et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a b c liang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017a b affected by the temperate semi arid continental climate the basin has an average annual temperature ranging from 6 to 9 an average annual pan evaporation of 2000 mm and an annual rainfall between 380 420 mm of which 80 occurred from july to september tian et al 2019 in addition the western and northern of the basin is covered by the hobq desert therefore this basin is subjected to the interaction of wind and water erosion the huangfu river is an intermittent river and the river channel remains dry for more than 70 days in a year approximately 80 of the annual runoff and sediment load come from several flood events during the rainy season july september due to the large scale of reforestation and afforestation on the slope as well as the construction of many check dams in the gullies and river channels soil erosion process has been slowed down and the check dam substantially trapped streamflow and sediment load in the watershed consequently the average annual runoff and sediment loads had reduced from 149 million m3 and 48 million tons during 1955 1999 to 34 million m3 and 7 5 million tons during 2000 2015 respectively with the decrease rates of 77 and 84 fig 1 c and 1d it was reported that the area of dam controlled in the basin was greater than 2000 km2 by 2010 accounting for nearly two third of the whole basin tian et al 2013 for land use in this basin forest land and farmland accounts for about 6 and 12 respectively and grassland and bare land are widely distributed 3 materials and methods 3 1 soil samples 3 1 1 samples collection in this study we collected the suspended sediment samples of flood events using a plastic container with a volume of 1l at the huangfu gauging station the station was set up by the yellow river commission committee in 1953 to regularly monitor flood processes and record hydrological data fig 1 b to depict the flooding process as accurately as possible suspended sediments were sampled intensively and the sampling interval was generally 6 of 12 min but after flood release the time interval increased to several hours timing and sampling began when the water flow through the monitoring section at the outlet station and ended when no flow is monitored at the outlet section a total of 66 suspended sediment samples were collected manually within six flood events in 2016 and 2018 named flood a f respectively meanwhile the water level was recorded by an automatic recorder to compute runoff using calibrated water level curves suspended sediment concentration ssc was obtained by analyzing the suspended sediment samples other featured indices of flood events also were recorded such as flood duration t rising limb time t1 falling limb time t2 and peak flow q p table 1 all measurements were carried out according to the national standards issued by the ministry of water conservancy the people s republic of china after considering the sediment connectivity and land use types in this basin three primary potential sediment sources in the whole basin were identified farmland grassland and bare land fig 2 since most of the bare land is covered by weathered sandstone and distributes on the steep slope all source samples collected from the bare land are weathered sandstone the farmland is mainly distributed on both sides of the main river channel and gentle slopes and a portion of the farmland belongs to the silted farmland given the sediment connectivity most farmland source samples were collected on sloping farmland in total 106 representative surface soil samples were collected with a plastic spatula in the whole basin and stored in a plastic bag to avoid measurement errors of the magnetic susceptibility indices 22 of which were from farmland 41 were from bare land and the remaining 43 were from grassland fig 1 b shows the distribution of sediment source sampling sites each source sample was a composite sample of five topsoil samples collected from one sampling grid 5 5 m depth 0 10 cm 3 1 2 samples treatment and measurements all sediment source samples and filtered suspended sediment samples were naturally air dried in a well ventilated room until reaching a constant weight and then screened by a 2 mm sieve to remove root litter and other coarse fragments subsamples for measurement of particle size were prepared based on the coning and quartering method which means that each sample was firstly spread out and mixed thoroughly into a conical heap then divided into four quarters by a cross and two opposite corners were taken as the sample and the other two set aside then repeat quartering until a suitable volume or weight obtained the grain size of subsamples for examination of magnetic susceptibility needed to be 1 mm the soil particle size analysis was conducted using a laser particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 england and soil magnetic susceptibility œáfd frequency dependent susceptibility was calculated by low frequency volume susceptibility œálf and high frequency volume susceptibility œáhf measured with a dual frequency magnetic susceptibility instrument bartington ms2 table 2 the remained 1 mm sieved samples were screened using a 63 Œºm sieve again and 0 25 g were taken for measurement of macro and micro properties see table 2 which were measured at the bureau veritas mineral laboratory bvml former acme analytical laboratories vancouver canada using the four acid digestion and the ultra trace icp ms ma 250 method detection limit see table s1 each subsample was digested to complete dryness with an acid solution of 2 2 1 1 h2o hf hclo4 hno3 50 hcl is added to the residue and heats using a mixing hot block after cooling the solution is transferred to test tubes and brought to volume using dilute hcl cecconi et al 2019 it is worth noting that the analytical uncertainty is not limited to the measurement precision of the instrument in addition particle size properties are considered non conservative thereby they were excluded from fingerprints finally a total of 58 fingerprints were selected as tracers in this study table 2 3 2 conservative index and consensus ranking the conservativeness index ci and consensus ranking cr methods a novel procedure proposed by liziga et al 2020a and 2020b were applied in this research to select optimal tracer sets unlike traditional method neglected sedimentation information after the mass conservation test ci and cr methods consider the information of both sources and sediment mixtures and avoid the depletion enrichment of the selected tracers it has been evidenced by lizaga et al 2020a and 2020b that the capability of this method to identify non conservative tracers beyond the capability of currently used selection methods and the method has been successfully used for sediment sources identification in some catchments lizaga et al 2021 navas et al 2022 defined by the single tracer model the ci method identifies non conservative tracers using the predictions of single tracer models with a conservative ranking sorted according to the euclidian distance to the perfectly balanced mix where all contributions are equal to 1 d i j 1 n w i j 1 n 2 a percentile of the sorted solutions is chosen to compute the ci as the root mean square error rmse of the non conservative part nc of the apportionments from the selected solution 2 ci j 1 n n c w i j 2 n c x x 0 x 1 i f x 0 0 x 1 x 1 where di represents the euclidian distance n represents the number of sources wi j is the vector apportionment of the tracer i in the source j i 1 to m j 1 to n implemented combining the predictions of single tracer model in several random debates the cr method discarded the preventing consensus tracers with a low consensus by a scoring function based on several random debates between tracers 3 consensus 100 1 lostdebates totaldebates where consensus ranges from 0 to 100 to unmix the suspended sediment with the fingerpro model in this research the tracers were selected with ci values 0 3 and cr scores greater than 80 table 3 tracers below these values were identified as non conservative and thereby discarded 3 3 unmixing model the fingerpro unmixing model published as open source r packages assesses the variability of source using a classical frequentist inference and is designed to sample the entire parameter space which descripts the optimal solution by monte carlo method helton 1994 lizaga et al 2020b the model uses a standard linear multivariate mixing model to determine the relative

evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the discrimination result in sediment sources which is frequently assessed using the relative mean error rme walling 2005 haddadchi et al 2013 motha et al 2003

characteristics of sampled flood events as depicted in fig 3 the magnitude of different floods significantly varied among the six flood events the q p and ssc max had a wide range of 31 3 2250 0 m3 s 1 and 44 1 295 0 kg m 3 respectively table 4 in which both the magnitude and suspended sediment in flood d were the largest value q p 2250 0 m3 s 1 ssc mean 295 0 kg m 3 and the flood a showed the least q p 31 3 m3 s 1 ssc mean 44 1 kg m 3 the flood process was characterized by a rapid increase of flow at the beginning and a slower decrease after flow peak t1 t2 for instance flood b took 7 7 hrs to reach q p and took 47 1 hrs for recession fig 3 b furthermore the q p occurred before ssc max such as flood b f fig 3 b 3f however the flood a showed an exception that the q p lagged the ssc max about 10 5 hrs fig 3 a as the largest magnitude of flood event flood d had two flow peaks during the event fig 3 d while other five events only had one flow peak which indicated that the flow discharge in flood d had considerable power for sediment transportation throughout the river channel and had the potential to flush the deposited sediment into the river bed in addition there were four types of hysteresis loops within six flood events the counter clockwise hysteresis loops appeared in flood c and e and the figure eight loops appeared in flood b and f the ssc in these four flood events was lower in the rising limb than in the falling limb of the hydrograph implying that sediment was transported to the river from remote areas after the q p meanwhile during the falling limb the runoff reduced rapidly and had not enough power to transport sediments thereby suspended sediment was deposited in the falling limb of the flood events in contrast flood a showed a clockwise ssc q hysteresis loop the ssc max arrived within a short time and runoff had enough power to transport sediments during the entire flood process of the six floods although the magnitude of flood a was the lowest within six flood events this result reveals that the rainfall area was close to the outlet of the river during the process of flood a considering the flood d the relations between q and ssc showed a complex hysteresis loop consisting of one clockwise loop and one figure eight loop the above results indicate a high heterogeneous distribution of storms and various potential sediment sources in the huangfu river basin 4 2 sediment particle sorting during transport the distribution characteristics of particle size can reflect the particle sorting effects of river flow on soil erosion and sediment transport table 5 shows the composition of soil particle size and their distribution in sediment sources and suspended sediments in the huangfu river basin obviously there were little difference in the particle size distributions in the different sediment sources as well as in the suspended sediments nevertheless it showed a significant difference between sediment sources and suspended sediments the mean sand content in the sediment sources 87 79 was higher than that in the suspended sediments 56 89 while the content of silt in the sediment sources 8 81 was much lower than that in suspended sediments 41 81 it implied that the silt fraction enriched and the sand fraction depleted in the suspended sediments during the flood processes as for the clay particles the mean content of clay in suspended sediment samples 1 30 on average in table 5 was far lower than sand and silt besides the mean value of median particle size d50 in bare land 209 58 Œºm significantly differed from that in farmland 122 24 Œºm grassland 125 82 Œºm and flood events 25 35 Œºm p 0 01 accordingly it can be inferred that the dominant component of the surface materials of bare land was coarse sand in the huangfu river basin 4 3 optimal tracers set after applying the ci and cr methods a total of 12 conservative tracers were retained from the initial 58 fingerprints fig 4 and the optimal set of tracers varied in different flood events table 6 as it can be seen from fig 4 the concentration of as pr and nb was more abundant compared with the other nine tracers in both sediment sources mean value greater than 6 94 Œºg g and suspended sediments mean value greater than 5 79 Œºg g whereas there was no significant difference for the concentration of ti eu ho lu and ta considering the sediment sources the bare land had a significantly higher mean value of pr gd and nb than farmland and grassland while it was depleted in œá fd as w and cs the tracers selected for introduction into the unmixing model were considered to have ci values greater than 0 3 and cr values greater than 80 table 3 for each flood event the optimal set of tracers varied and the maximum number of tracers selected for the unmixing model in flood d was six as cs and w were the most frequently selected tracers 4 4 sediment source apportionment the results of the unmixing model showed that in the huangfu river basin the contribution of the three potential sources to the suspended sediments varied largely ranging from 16 to 57 and the dispersions ranged from between 7 and 26 table 7 as depicted in fig 5 significant differences were found when comparing the source apportionments across different flood events the bare land was discriminated as the largest sediment source for all flood events with contributions varying from 40 of flood d to 57 of flood c and with dispersion values between 7 and 13 the second largest contributions came from the farmland with a percentage between 27 of flood c and 31 of flood a whereas the grassland contributed the least to all suspended sediments among six flood events varying from 16 of flood c to 25 of flood a and d for flood events with high magnitude and sediment load sediment contributions of the bare land and farmland differed slightly for instance the bare land and farmland contributed 40 and 35 to the total sediment load for flood d respectively 5 discussions 5 1 particle size selectivity during sediment transport during the flood processes water flow rose rapidly at the beginning and fell slowly after q p and so did ssc fig 3 implying that the sediment transport capacity rapidly increased with the flow rising and began to slowly decrease after the peak flow xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a b c the difference is that q p arrived earlier than ssc max except for flood a consistent with the results from zhao et al 2017 this difference can be attributed to the rainfall intensity unsteadiness of flow and complexity of topography along the flow routing which significantly affected flow velocity and energy thereby changing sediment transport capacity and inducing sediment particles deposition or river bed erosion during the flooding process karimaee tabarestani and zarrati 2015 liang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a b c our results showed that the silt content in the suspended sediments was much larger than it in the sediment sources denoting that the silt fraction enriched in the suspended sediments and its enrichment varied among the six flood events table 5 the enrichment of silt fraction was higher in the flood events with lower flow magnitude such as flood e and f which had 47 13 and 49 00 silt content respectively on the contrary the enrichment of silt fraction was lower in the flood events with higher flow magnitude i e flood d silt content 37 19 table 5 same conclusions also addressed by many researchers stone et al 1997 xu et al 2008 asadi et al 2011 laceby et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 nevertheless the sand content in the suspended sediments was less than it in the sediment sources which implied that the sand fraction depleted throughout the flooding processes of six flood events and its content fluctuated and decreased with the extension of the flood process while the silt content changed in the opposite direction like flood e fig 6 grain size selection during flooding process could affected the conservativeness and consistence of fingerprints and it may account for the relatively small number of tracers selected 12 in all initial fingerprints 58 table 6 laceby et al 2017 chen et al 2016a b vale et al 2020 among the six sampled events the mean sand and silt concentration in the suspended sediment samples of flood d 61 66 and 37 19 were significantly different from those in flood e 51 67 and 47 13 and flood f 49 50 and 49 00 p 0 05 furthermore suspended sediment showed a lower proportion of clay ranging from 1 45 5 70 flood e and 1 15 1 50 flood f it indicated that the flow energy of flood e and f was lower than flood d and more silt fraction of flood e and f was transported downstream table 7 for the changing process of particle size the content of sand in suspended sediment increased because of the rapidly rising at the beginning of the flood with higher stream power and sediment transport capacity such as flood e fig 6 simultaneously coarse sand began to deposit while the silt fraction was continually extracted and transported due to the decrease of sediment transport capacity after the peak like flood d and flood f overall there were significant differences in the particle composition for the six flood events due to differences in flow magnitude zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 vale et al 2020 this may have an impact on fingerprint content and ultimately led to different source provenance apportions for the six flood events sediment particle sorting mechanism during different flood processes revealed the sediment transport law that a lower stream power leads to the sorting of sediment particles that the coarse sediment particles deposit first and the fine sediment particles are transported stone and walling 1997 shi et al 2021 in addition to the hydraulic condition of the flood itself check dams with drainage buildings had a huge impact on sediment particle sorting by trapping coarse particles and transporting fine particles through runoff abedini et al 2012 verstraeten and poesen 2000 vaezi et al 2017 except for extreme flood events the dam would not be destroyed during the general flood process and only fine sediment would be delivered downstream tian et al 2013 channel morphological characteristics also affects the particle size sorting high gradient of the river bed in the upper and middle reaches of the huangfu river could result in high flow velocity wide and flat river channel in the downstream could reduce flow velocity and sediment capacity causing sediment deposition shi et al 2021 hu and zhang 2012 moreover land use types and vegetation covering in basin significantly affect sediment connectivity and consequently affect sediment yield and transport liu et al 2022 5 2 uncertainties of sediment apportion prediction uncertainty about the sediment apportion prediction is affected by many factors such as the identification of sediment sources the procedure of trace selection and the sediment contribution assessment beuselinck et al 2000 zhao et al 2017a b lizaga et al 2019 vale et al 2020 the sampling processes may produce uncertainties not only because of various sediment sources and the complex topography of hilly and gully in the huangfu river basin but also due to the size sorting of different particles in the flood events during the sediment transport processes along the river channel zhao et al 2017a b zhang et al 2020 considering the land use types and sediment connectivity in the huangfu river basin each source sample was a composite sample of five topsoil samples collected from one sampling grid 5 5 m depth 0 10 cm in this study also the enrichment and depletion of fingerprints in some grain sizes range resulting by size sorting was a critical factor influencing the sediment tracing results stone and walling 1997 beuselinck et al 2000 kiani et al 2018 xu et al 2021 thus a narrower and finer particle range 63 Œºm of sediment source and suspended sediment was adopted for the measurement of fingerprint properties concentration koiter et al 2013 collins et al 2017 laceby et al 2017 lizaga et al 2019 the uncertainty may also come from the tracer selection methods lizaga et al 2020 the classical methodologies only rely on the information of the sources to determine the tracers ability to differentiate sediment sources and ignore the sedimentation information moreover the information about the sediment mixture is not incorporated palaz√≥n et al 2015 collins and walling 2002 lizaga et al 2020a b erroneous from tracers selection subsequently introduced uncertainty into any unmixing model which led to poor adscription for sediment sources pulley et al 2015 lizaga et al 2019 a novel procedure for trace selection was adopted to ensure the consistency and conservativeness of tracers inputted into the unmixing model which combines the sediment source and individual sedimentation information rajakoviƒá et al 2012 lizaga et al 2020b latorre et al 2021 and the relative high dispersion in the sediment contribution of farmland and grassland could be likely related to the poor adscription of three sources table 7 5 3 results comparison with other studies according to the historical precipitation records the huangfu river basin is one of the storm centers during summer in the loess plateau leading to a high sediment yield wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017a b though the uneven distribution of rainfall and the ssc q hysteresis loops implied that the potential sediment sources varied in time and space during different flood processes the outputs of the unmixing model showed that the bare land weathered sandstone was the predominant sediment source for the six flood events that may be due to the relatively large area of bare ground in the basin and the overlying weathered sandstone compared with the loess soil the weathered sandstone was easier to lose because of its physical and chemical characteristics li et al 2015 liang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a b c previous researches have been conducted in the dam controlled watersheds of the huangfu river basin the explanation of dam controlled watershed is shown in figure s1 and the results also confirmed that more than 60 of impounded sediment behind check dams was contributed by the weathered sandstone ma et al 2011 zhao et al 2017a b zhang et al 2017 tian et al 2019 however our results indicated that the bare land contributed less proportion to the total sediment load mean value 47 than previous studies greater than60 a potential cause is that our research focused on a larger scale basin and the topography in the basin is more complicated and varied than those dam controlled watersheds wang et al 2011 li et al 2016 vaezi et al 2017 in a larger scale basin the sediment contribution area during different flood events may vary greatly due to the rainfall distribution sediment transport pathway is much longer and more changeable and the coarse sediment may deposit in the river channel during the sediment transport process tuset et al 2016 additionally the constructions of check dam systems blocked the sediment connectivity and reduced the erosion power of runoff further led to the sediment discharge reduction in the basin castillo et al 2014 mekonnen et al 2015 zhao et al 2017a b wang et al 2018 the check dams without a drainage channel intercepted almost all the sediments while the check dams with a drainage channel would intercept coarse particles and transport the fine particles by flow through the river channel vaezi et al 2017 shi et al 2019 by 2017 more than 900 check dams have been constructed in the huangfu river basin and had retained up to 364 million tons of sediment fig 1 mi et al 2015 wei et al 2017 6 conclusion in the huangfu river basin due to the uneven distribution of precipitation during the year soil erosion occurs and concentrates in the flood season during several rainstorm events sediment transported downstream during the flood processes accounts for almost 90 or more of the total annual sediment yield of the basin hydrological behavior differences between flood events induced the enrichment and depletion of the sediment particles the enrichment of silt fraction was higher in a flood event with a small flow magnitude than in a flood event with a large flow magnitude an opposite change occurred in sand fraction a higher enrichment of sand fraction with a large flow magnitude this difference may be likely to modify element concentration and reduce the conservativeness and consistency of fingerprints in each flood event the method of ci and cr provided a good procedure for tracer selection inputted into the unmixing model due to the variation of element concentration between the sediment source and suspended sediment the conservativeness and consistency of tracers among the six flood events were significantly different therefore only 12 tracers were finally selected from the initial 58 tracers to introduce into the unmixing model the results from the model indicated dynamic changes in sediment source apportionments during six flood events in the basin the bare land is illustrated to be an important environmental problem with hot plots that are worth controlling in this basin meanwhile measures to conserve soil and water should be taken as far as possible in agricultural activities in the current state in contrast the insignificant sediment apportionment from grassland underlines the benefits of vegetation cover to prevent soil loss thus a combination of engineering measures such as the construction of check dam and terrace and vegetation restoration measures such as afforestation and grass planting is proposed to improve the ecological environment in the study area which can effectively reduce soil erosion and sediment load overall our results provide evidence of the severe erosion produced during flood events and reveal the dynamic variation of the sediment source apportion with flow magnitude the findings of this study could potentially provide good insights for soil

1980,identifying critical soil erosion areas and sediment sources are essential for sediment control and water resources management in the watershed especially in the severely eroded northern loess plateau china in this study we collected suspended sediment samples at the hydrological stations to identify the sediment source dynamics during flood events in a highly erodible basin the huangfu river basin in the northern loess plateau a total of 6 flood events were sampled during 2016 and 2018 for investigation the flow discharge was featured by a rapid rising limb and a slow falling limb compared with the sediment sources the silt fraction in the suspended sediments was enriched and the sand fraction in the suspended sediment was depleted the dominant particle grain size of suspended sediments was coarse sand 56 89 higher than silt 41 81 and clay 1 3 the sediment sources were estimated using the fingerpro unmixing model based on the conservativeness index ci and consensus ranking cr methods the results of the unmixing model reveal that the bare land was the predominant source of suspended sediments ranging from 40 to 57 which was much higher than farmland 27 31 and grassland 16 25 our findings imply that the bare land weathered sandstone area is the critical region for soil loss control in the huangfu river basin a combination of vegetation restoration measures and engineering measures are proposed to improve the sustainable development of ecological environment in the basin keywords flood events conservativeness and consensus method fingerpro sediment source huangfu river basin data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction intense soil erosion is a serious threat to ecosystem security and services such as biodiversity protection land degradation food production and water resource management feng et al 2010 brevik et al 2015 smith et al 2015 exploring complex soil erosion and sediment transport process is an ongoing challenge accordingly identifying the critical soil erosion areas and sediment sources would be of great significance in terms of environmental protection which would provide a scientific basis for a better understanding of soil erosion processes and sediment delivery and a good reference for the implementation of appropriate strategies for soil loss in recent decades a growing body of study has focused on expanding and improving different approaches for soil erosion monitoring and sediment source tracing collins and walling 2002 sukhija et al 1998 walling et al 1999 grousset and biscaye 2005 zhang et al 2006 haddadchi et al 2013 although several traditional techniques have been successively applied to obtain soil erosion rates and the critical area of sediment sources i e erosion pins runoff plots and unmanned aerial vehicle measurement wang et al 2011 xu et al 2007 ma et al 2011 wei 2003 many deficiencies and problems still exist such as representativeness of study area error of experimental operation spatial sampling constraints peart and walling 1986 peart and walling 1988 lizaga et al 2019 consequently the sediment fingerprinting technique that relies on modern high precision testing techniques and analytical tools was developed to identify sediment source the sediment fingerprinting approach employs mathematical or statistical methodologies to allocate sediment provenance using specific source and sediment properties the most widely used fingerprints include soil properties e g grain size and color wang 2001 krein et al 2003 magnetism venturae et al 2002 and radioactive nuclide 137cs 210pb rare earth element ree gaspar et al 2019a b recently biomarkers and stable isotope have been used as fingerprinting tracers wang et al 2018 mabit et al 2018 sherriff et al 2018 amorim et al 2021 pulley and collins 2021 evrard et al 2020 lizaga et al 2021 and a variety of studies have proved that fingerprinting techniques offer an efficient method to identify sediment sources and track sediment movement across the landscape at various temporal and spatial scales guzman et al 2013 laceby et al 2017 despite the growing application of the fingerprinting technique it was still difficult to accurately distinguish sediment source and quantify the contribution of the individual source using single property fingerprint because of the diversity of sediment sources and the complex sediment transport process collins and walling 2002 xu et al 2007 subsequently fingerprinting techniques have been improved from single property fingerprints to multi property composite fingerprinting techniques with a higher source discrimination however the tracer selection method is under development for both single property fingerprints and multi property composite fingerprints pulley et al 2015 palaz√≥n et al 2015 laceby et al 2017 smith et al 2015 collins et al 2013 different tracer selection methods would present different fingerprinting results and substantially induce erroneous into the frequentists and bayesian models lizaga et al 2020a lizaga et al 2021 to date the most widespread methods include the range test the mixing polygon the kruskal wallis test and the discriminant function analysis walling et al 1999 gellis and walling 2011 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 vale et al 2020 more recently lizaga et al 2020a illustrated that the procedure of classical tracer selection methods ignored some non conservative tracers and did not incorporate the information of the sediment mixtures thereby to estimate sediment contribution accurately and consider the information of sediment mixture a novel methodology was proposed by lizaga et al 2020a to identify the conservativeness and consistency of individual tracer which has been validated that the identification ability was superior to current tracer selection methods the huangfu river basin is a severely eroded region on the northern loess plateau of china numerous researches mostly identified the sediment sources relying on historical deposition information of sediment in the dam controlled watersheds 10 km2 using the traditional fingerprinting technique zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a b however few researchers focused on sediment tracing of flood events and revealing dynamic variations of source contribution during the flood processes in a larger scale basin accordingly a novel method for tracer selection and the fingerpro unmixing model were employed to discriminate the dominant sediment source and quantify source apportions during several flood events in the basin the results could provide useful insights for soil erosion control and consequently improve ecological services of the highly erodible regions in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin 2 study area the huangfu river basin 39 12 n to 39 54 n 110 18 e to 111 12 e is in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin and covers an area of 3 246 km2 fig 1 a and 1b in this basin the topography is relatively complex and is characterized by a hilly and gully landscape and the main soil types include aeolian loess and sandy soil the basin is widely concerned at home and abroad because of the so called pisha sandstone which is a general appellation in china for some type of fluvial clastic deposition sandstone formed in the jurassic triassic and cretaceous period zhen et al 2016 liang et al 2019 the erosion products from the pisha sandstone weathered sandstone mostly distributed on steep slopes and is more prone to erosion than aeolian loess and sandy soil because of its coarser particles strong water permeability and poor resistance li et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a b c liang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017a b affected by the temperate semi arid continental climate the basin has an average annual temperature ranging from 6 to 9 an average annual pan evaporation of 2000 mm and an annual rainfall between 380 420 mm of which 80 occurred from july to september tian et al 2019 in addition the western and northern of the basin is covered by the hobq desert therefore this basin is subjected to the interaction of wind and water erosion the huangfu river is an intermittent river and the river channel remains dry for more than 70 days in a year approximately 80 of the annual runoff and sediment load come from several flood events during the rainy season july september due to the large scale of reforestation and afforestation on the slope as well as the construction of many check dams in the gullies and river channels soil erosion process has been slowed down and the check dam substantially trapped streamflow and sediment load in the watershed consequently the average annual runoff and sediment loads had reduced from 149 million m3 and 48 million tons during 1955 1999 to 34 million m3 and 7 5 million tons during 2000 2015 respectively with the decrease rates of 77 and 84 fig 1 c and 1d it was reported that the area of dam controlled in the basin was greater than 2000 km2 by 2010 accounting for nearly two third of the whole basin tian et al 2013 for land use in this basin forest land and farmland accounts for about 6 and 12 respectively and grassland and bare land are widely distributed 3 materials and methods 3 1 soil samples 3 1 1 samples collection in this study we collected the suspended sediment samples of flood events using a plastic container with a volume of 1l at the huangfu gauging station the station was set up by the yellow river commission committee in 1953 to regularly monitor flood processes and record hydrological data fig 1 b to depict the flooding process as accurately as possible suspended sediments were sampled intensively and the sampling interval was generally 6 of 12 min but after flood release the time interval increased to several hours timing and sampling began when the water flow through the monitoring section at the outlet station and ended when no flow is monitored at the outlet section a total of 66 suspended sediment samples were collected manually within six flood events in 2016 and 2018 named flood a f respectively meanwhile the water level was recorded by an automatic recorder to compute runoff using calibrated water level curves suspended sediment concentration ssc was obtained by analyzing the suspended sediment samples other featured indices of flood events also were recorded such as flood duration t rising limb time t1 falling limb time t2 and peak flow q p table 1 all measurements were carried out according to the national standards issued by the ministry of water conservancy the people s republic of china after considering the sediment connectivity and land use types in this basin three primary potential sediment sources in the whole basin were identified farmland grassland and bare land fig 2 since most of the bare land is covered by weathered sandstone and distributes on the steep slope all source samples collected from the bare land are weathered sandstone the farmland is mainly distributed on both sides of the main river channel and gentle slopes and a portion of the farmland belongs to the silted farmland given the sediment connectivity most farmland source samples were collected on sloping farmland in total 106 representative surface soil samples were collected with a plastic spatula in the whole basin and stored in a plastic bag to avoid measurement errors of the magnetic susceptibility indices 22 of which were from farmland 41 were from bare land and the remaining 43 were from grassland fig 1 b shows the distribution of sediment source sampling sites each source sample was a composite sample of five topsoil samples collected from one sampling grid 5 5 m depth 0 10 cm 3 1 2 samples treatment and measurements all sediment source samples and filtered suspended sediment samples were naturally air dried in a well ventilated room until reaching a constant weight and then screened by a 2 mm sieve to remove root litter and other coarse fragments subsamples for measurement of particle size were prepared based on the coning and quartering method which means that each sample was firstly spread out and mixed thoroughly into a conical heap then divided into four quarters by a cross and two opposite corners were taken as the sample and the other two set aside then repeat quartering until a suitable volume or weight obtained the grain size of subsamples for examination of magnetic susceptibility needed to be 1 mm the soil particle size analysis was conducted using a laser particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 england and soil magnetic susceptibility œáfd frequency dependent susceptibility was calculated by low frequency volume susceptibility œálf and high frequency volume susceptibility œáhf measured with a dual frequency magnetic susceptibility instrument bartington ms2 table 2 the remained 1 mm sieved samples were screened using a 63 Œºm sieve again and 0 25 g were taken for measurement of macro and micro properties see table 2 which were measured at the bureau veritas mineral laboratory bvml former acme analytical laboratories vancouver canada using the four acid digestion and the ultra trace icp ms ma 250 method detection limit see table s1 each subsample was digested to complete dryness with an acid solution of 2 2 1 1 h2o hf hclo4 hno3 50 hcl is added to the residue and heats using a mixing hot block after cooling the solution is transferred to test tubes and brought to volume using dilute hcl cecconi et al 2019 it is worth noting that the analytical uncertainty is not limited to the measurement precision of the instrument in addition particle size properties are considered non conservative thereby they were excluded from fingerprints finally a total of 58 fingerprints were selected as tracers in this study table 2 3 2 conservative index and consensus ranking the conservativeness index ci and consensus ranking cr methods a novel procedure proposed by liziga et al 2020a and 2020b were applied in this research to select optimal tracer sets unlike traditional method neglected sedimentation information after the mass conservation test ci and cr methods consider the information of both sources and sediment mixtures and avoid the depletion enrichment of the selected tracers it has been evidenced by lizaga et al 2020a and 2020b that the capability of this method to identify non conservative tracers beyond the capability of currently used selection methods and the method has been successfully used for sediment sources identification in some catchments lizaga et al 2021 navas et al 2022 defined by the single tracer model the ci method identifies non conservative tracers using the predictions of single tracer models with a conservative ranking sorted according to the euclidian distance to the perfectly balanced mix where all contributions are equal to 1 d i j 1 n w i j 1 n 2 a percentile of the sorted solutions is chosen to compute the ci as the root mean square error rmse of the non conservative part nc of the apportionments from the selected solution 2 ci j 1 n n c w i j 2 n c x x 0 x 1 i f x 0 0 x 1 x 1 where di represents the euclidian distance n represents the number of sources wi j is the vector apportionment of the tracer i in the source j i 1 to m j 1 to n implemented combining the predictions of single tracer model in several random debates the cr method discarded the preventing consensus tracers with a low consensus by a scoring function based on several random debates between tracers 3 consensus 100 1 lostdebates totaldebates where consensus ranges from 0 to 100 to unmix the suspended sediment with the fingerpro model in this research the tracers were selected with ci values 0 3 and cr scores greater than 80 table 3 tracers below these values were identified as non conservative and thereby discarded 3 3 unmixing model the fingerpro unmixing model published as open source r packages assesses the variability of source using a classical frequentist inference and is designed to sample the entire parameter space which descripts the optimal solution by monte carlo method helton 1994 lizaga et al 2020b the model uses a standard linear multivariate mixing model to determine the relative

evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the discrimination result in sediment sources which is frequently assessed using the relative mean error rme walling 2005 haddadchi et al 2013 motha et al 2003

characteristics of sampled flood events as depicted in fig 3 the magnitude of different floods significantly varied among the six flood events the q p and ssc max had a wide range of 31 3 2250 0 m3 s 1 and 44 1 295 0 kg m 3 respectively table 4 in which both the magnitude and suspended sediment in flood d were the largest value q p 2250 0 m3 s 1 ssc mean 295 0 kg m 3 and the flood a showed the least q p 31 3 m3 s 1 ssc mean 44 1 kg m 3 the flood process was characterized by a rapid increase of flow at the beginning and a slower decrease after flow peak t1 t2 for instance flood b took 7 7 hrs to reach q p and took 47 1 hrs for recession fig 3 b furthermore the q p occurred before ssc max such as flood b f fig 3 b 3f however the flood a showed an exception that the q p lagged the ssc max about 10 5 hrs fig 3 a as the largest magnitude of flood event flood d had two flow peaks during the event fig 3 d while other five events only had one flow peak which indicated that the flow discharge in flood d had considerable power for sediment transportation throughout the river channel and had the potential to flush the deposited sediment into the river bed in addition there were four types of hysteresis loops within six flood events the counter clockwise hysteresis loops appeared in flood c and e and the figure eight loops appeared in flood b and f the ssc in these four flood events was lower in the rising limb than in the falling limb of the hydrograph implying that sediment was transported to the river from remote areas after the q p meanwhile during the falling limb the runoff reduced rapidly and had not enough power to transport sediments thereby suspended sediment was deposited in the falling limb of the flood events in contrast flood a showed a clockwise ssc q hysteresis loop the ssc max arrived within a short time and runoff had enough power to transport sediments during the entire flood process of the six floods although the magnitude of flood a was the lowest within six flood events this result reveals that the rainfall area was close to the outlet of the river during the process of flood a considering the flood d the relations between q and ssc showed a complex hysteresis loop consisting of one clockwise loop and one figure eight loop the above results indicate a high heterogeneous distribution of storms and various potential sediment sources in the huangfu river basin 4 2 sediment particle sorting during transport the distribution characteristics of particle size can reflect the particle sorting effects of river flow on soil erosion and sediment transport table 5 shows the composition of soil particle size and their distribution in sediment sources and suspended sediments in the huangfu river basin obviously there were little difference in the particle size distributions in the different sediment sources as well as in the suspended sediments nevertheless it showed a significant difference between sediment sources and suspended sediments the mean sand content in the sediment sources 87 79 was higher than that in the suspended sediments 56 89 while the content of silt in the sediment sources 8 81 was much lower than that in suspended sediments 41 81 it implied that the silt fraction enriched and the sand fraction depleted in the suspended sediments during the flood processes as for the clay particles the mean content of clay in suspended sediment samples 1 30 on average in table 5 was far lower than sand and silt besides the mean value of median particle size d50 in bare land 209 58 Œºm significantly differed from that in farmland 122 24 Œºm grassland 125 82 Œºm and flood events 25 35 Œºm p 0 01 accordingly it can be inferred that the dominant component of the surface materials of bare land was coarse sand in the huangfu river basin 4 3 optimal tracers set after applying the ci and cr methods a total of 12 conservative tracers were retained from the initial 58 fingerprints fig 4 and the optimal set of tracers varied in different flood events table 6 as it can be seen from fig 4 the concentration of as pr and nb was more abundant compared with the other nine tracers in both sediment sources mean value greater than 6 94 Œºg g and suspended sediments mean value greater than 5 79 Œºg g whereas there was no significant difference for the concentration of ti eu ho lu and ta considering the sediment sources the bare land had a significantly higher mean value of pr gd and nb than farmland and grassland while it was depleted in œá fd as w and cs the tracers selected for introduction into the unmixing model were considered to have ci values greater than 0 3 and cr values greater than 80 table 3 for each flood event the optimal set of tracers varied and the maximum number of tracers selected for the unmixing model in flood d was six as cs and w were the most frequently selected tracers 4 4 sediment source apportionment the results of the unmixing model showed that in the huangfu river basin the contribution of the three potential sources to the suspended sediments varied largely ranging from 16 to 57 and the dispersions ranged from between 7 and 26 table 7 as depicted in fig 5 significant differences were found when comparing the source apportionments across different flood events the bare land was discriminated as the largest sediment source for all flood events with contributions varying from 40 of flood d to 57 of flood c and with dispersion values between 7 and 13 the second largest contributions came from the farmland with a percentage between 27 of flood c and 31 of flood a whereas the grassland contributed the least to all suspended sediments among six flood events varying from 16 of flood c to 25 of flood a and d for flood events with high magnitude and sediment load sediment contributions of the bare land and farmland differed slightly for instance the bare land and farmland contributed 40 and 35 to the total sediment load for flood d respectively 5 discussions 5 1 particle size selectivity during sediment transport during the flood processes water flow rose rapidly at the beginning and fell slowly after q p and so did ssc fig 3 implying that the sediment transport capacity rapidly increased with the flow rising and began to slowly decrease after the peak flow xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a b c the difference is that q p arrived earlier than ssc max except for flood a consistent with the results from zhao et al 2017 this difference can be attributed to the rainfall intensity unsteadiness of flow and complexity of topography along the flow routing which significantly affected flow velocity and energy thereby changing sediment transport capacity and inducing sediment particles deposition or river bed erosion during the flooding process karimaee tabarestani and zarrati 2015 liang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a b c our results showed that the silt content in the suspended sediments was much larger than it in the sediment sources denoting that the silt fraction enriched in the suspended sediments and its enrichment varied among the six flood events table 5 the enrichment of silt fraction was higher in the flood events with lower flow magnitude such as flood e and f which had 47 13 and 49 00 silt content respectively on the contrary the enrichment of silt fraction was lower in the flood events with higher flow magnitude i e flood d silt content 37 19 table 5 same conclusions also addressed by many researchers stone et al 1997 xu et al 2008 asadi et al 2011 laceby et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 nevertheless the sand content in the suspended sediments was less than it in the sediment sources which implied that the sand fraction depleted throughout the flooding processes of six flood events and its content fluctuated and decreased with the extension of the flood process while the silt content changed in the opposite direction like flood e fig 6 grain size selection during flooding process could affected the conservativeness and consistence of fingerprints and it may account for the relatively small number of tracers selected 12 in all initial fingerprints 58 table 6 laceby et al 2017 chen et al 2016a b vale et al 2020 among the six sampled events the mean sand and silt concentration in the suspended sediment samples of flood d 61 66 and 37 19 were significantly different from those in flood e 51 67 and 47 13 and flood f 49 50 and 49 00 p 0 05 furthermore suspended sediment showed a lower proportion of clay ranging from 1 45 5 70 flood e and 1 15 1 50 flood f it indicated that the flow energy of flood e and f was lower than flood d and more silt fraction of flood e and f was transported downstream table 7 for the changing process of particle size the content of sand in suspended sediment increased because of the rapidly rising at the beginning of the flood with higher stream power and sediment transport capacity such as flood e fig 6 simultaneously coarse sand began to deposit while the silt fraction was continually extracted and transported due to the decrease of sediment transport capacity after the peak like flood d and flood f overall there were significant differences in the particle composition for the six flood events due to differences in flow magnitude zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 vale et al 2020 this may have an impact on fingerprint content and ultimately led to different source provenance apportions for the six flood events sediment particle sorting mechanism during different flood processes revealed the sediment transport law that a lower stream power leads to the sorting of sediment particles that the coarse sediment particles deposit first and the fine sediment particles are transported stone and walling 1997 shi et al 2021 in addition to the hydraulic condition of the flood itself check dams with drainage buildings had a huge impact on sediment particle sorting by trapping coarse particles and transporting fine particles through runoff abedini et al 2012 verstraeten and poesen 2000 vaezi et al 2017 except for extreme flood events the dam would not be destroyed during the general flood process and only fine sediment would be delivered downstream tian et al 2013 channel morphological characteristics also affects the particle size sorting high gradient of the river bed in the upper and middle reaches of the huangfu river could result in high flow velocity wide and flat river channel in the downstream could reduce flow velocity and sediment capacity causing sediment deposition shi et al 2021 hu and zhang 2012 moreover land use types and vegetation covering in basin significantly affect sediment connectivity and consequently affect sediment yield and transport liu et al 2022 5 2 uncertainties of sediment apportion prediction uncertainty about the sediment apportion prediction is affected by many factors such as the identification of sediment sources the procedure of trace selection and the sediment contribution assessment beuselinck et al 2000 zhao et al 2017a b lizaga et al 2019 vale et al 2020 the sampling processes may produce uncertainties not only because of various sediment sources and the complex topography of hilly and gully in the huangfu river basin but also due to the size sorting of different particles in the flood events during the sediment transport processes along the river channel zhao et al 2017a b zhang et al 2020 considering the land use types and sediment connectivity in the huangfu river basin each source sample was a composite sample of five topsoil samples collected from one sampling grid 5 5 m depth 0 10 cm in this study also the enrichment and depletion of fingerprints in some grain sizes range resulting by size sorting was a critical factor influencing the sediment tracing results stone and walling 1997 beuselinck et al 2000 kiani et al 2018 xu et al 2021 thus a narrower and finer particle range 63 Œºm of sediment source and suspended sediment was adopted for the measurement of fingerprint properties concentration koiter et al 2013 collins et al 2017 laceby et al 2017 lizaga et al 2019 the uncertainty may also come from the tracer selection methods lizaga et al 2020 the classical methodologies only rely on the information of the sources to determine the tracers ability to differentiate sediment sources and ignore the sedimentation information moreover the information about the sediment mixture is not incorporated palaz√≥n et al 2015 collins and walling 2002 lizaga et al 2020a b erroneous from tracers selection subsequently introduced uncertainty into any unmixing model which led to poor adscription for sediment sources pulley et al 2015 lizaga et al 2019 a novel procedure for trace selection was adopted to ensure the consistency and conservativeness of tracers inputted into the unmixing model which combines the sediment source and individual sedimentation information rajakoviƒá et al 2012 lizaga et al 2020b latorre et al 2021 and the relative high dispersion in the sediment contribution of farmland and grassland could be likely related to the poor adscription of three sources table 7 5 3 results comparison with other studies according to the historical precipitation records the huangfu river basin is one of the storm centers during summer in the loess plateau leading to a high sediment yield wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017a b though the uneven distribution of rainfall and the ssc q hysteresis loops implied that the potential sediment sources varied in time and space during different flood processes the outputs of the unmixing model showed that the bare land weathered sandstone was the predominant sediment source for the six flood events that may be due to the relatively large area of bare ground in the basin and the overlying weathered sandstone compared with the loess soil the weathered sandstone was easier to lose because of its physical and chemical characteristics li et al 2015 liang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a b c previous researches have been conducted in the dam controlled watersheds of the huangfu river basin the explanation of dam controlled watershed is shown in figure s1 and the results also confirmed that more than 60 of impounded sediment behind check dams was contributed by the weathered sandstone ma et al 2011 zhao et al 2017a b zhang et al 2017 tian et al 2019 however our results indicated that the bare land contributed less proportion to the total sediment load mean value 47 than previous studies greater than60 a potential cause is that our research focused on a larger scale basin and the topography in the basin is more complicated and varied than those dam controlled watersheds wang et al 2011 li et al 2016 vaezi et al 2017 in a larger scale basin the sediment contribution area during different flood events may vary greatly due to the rainfall distribution sediment transport pathway is much longer and more changeable and the coarse sediment may deposit in the river channel during the sediment transport process tuset et al 2016 additionally the constructions of check dam systems blocked the sediment connectivity and reduced the erosion power of runoff further led to the sediment discharge reduction in the basin castillo et al 2014 mekonnen et al 2015 zhao et al 2017a b wang et al 2018 the check dams without a drainage channel intercepted almost all the sediments while the check dams with a drainage channel would intercept coarse particles and transport the fine particles by flow through the river channel vaezi et al 2017 shi et al 2019 by 2017 more than 900 check dams have been constructed in the huangfu river basin and had retained up to 364 million tons of sediment fig 1 mi et al 2015 wei et al 2017 6 conclusion in the huangfu river basin due to the uneven distribution of precipitation during the year soil erosion occurs and concentrates in the flood season during several rainstorm events sediment transported downstream during the flood processes accounts for almost 90 or more of the total annual sediment yield of the basin hydrological behavior differences between flood events induced the enrichment and depletion of the sediment particles the enrichment of silt fraction was higher in a flood event with a small flow magnitude than in a flood event with a large flow magnitude an opposite change occurred in sand fraction a higher enrichment of sand fraction with a large flow magnitude this difference may be likely to modify element concentration and reduce the conservativeness and consistency of fingerprints in each flood event the method of ci and cr provided a good procedure for tracer selection inputted into the unmixing model due to the variation of element concentration between the sediment source and suspended sediment the conservativeness and consistency of tracers among the six flood events were significantly different therefore only 12 tracers were finally selected from the initial 58 tracers to introduce into the unmixing model the results from the model indicated dynamic changes in sediment source apportionments during six flood events in the basin the bare land is illustrated to be an important environmental problem with hot plots that are worth controlling in this basin meanwhile measures to conserve soil and water should be taken as far as possible in agricultural activities in the current state in contrast the insignificant sediment apportionment from grassland underlines the benefits of vegetation cover to prevent soil loss thus a combination of engineering measures such as the construction of check dam and terrace and vegetation restoration measures such as afforestation and grass planting is proposed to improve the ecological environment in the study area which can effectively reduce soil erosion and sediment load overall our results provide evidence of the severe erosion produced during flood events and reveal the dynamic variation of the sediment source apportion with flow magnitude the findings of this study could potentially provide good insights for soil erosion control and ecological restoration in the highly erodible area of the loess plateau and other similar regions in the world declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

1981,although residence time distributions rtds are frequently used in wetland studies there is no consensus about the analysis method generally two types of methods can be used to analyze rtd data the method of moments and the rtd modeling method rtd curves are obtained by tracer tests the real rtd curves are usually imperfect due to the presence of random measurement errors the unreasonable sampling intervals and the premature termination of the tracer test this study aims to find a better rtd analysis method providing robust results under these unfavorable factors which includes i evaluating the existing rtd analysis methods ii improving the existing rtd analysis method using the rational model the influence of measurement error sampling interval and ending time in tracer tests on rtd analysis methods was first simulated the results showed that effective volume ratio was a preferable indicator compared with the variance of rtd the stability of the moment method decreased with the increase of the measurement error and sampling interval and the accuracy of the moment method decreased with the decrease of the test time although the rtd modeling method showed better stability and accuracy the implicit premise is that the rtd model adequately describes the observed data further 36 observed rtd data sets were used to test the tanks in series tis model and the empirical rational model the results showed that the widely used tis model was only effective in partial cases while the newly proposed rational model showed broader applicability both the moment method and the tis modeling method were proven to be inadequate finally the moment method was improved by using rational models to pre process rtd data although the improved method is still affected

in wastewater management because they are cost effective and environmentally conscious kadlec and wallace 2009 vymazal 2011 the cw is essentially a biological reactor and its output depends on the input type kinetics and mode of contact levenspiel 1972 rodrigues 2021 if unfavorable hydraulic phenomena such as short circuits and hydraulic dead zones exist the wetland area will not be used effectively and its performance will be impaired a distribution of times that parcels of water spend in a wetland is known as a residence time distribution rtd werner and kadlec 2000 the rtd analysis represents one of the most often used hydrodynamic tests sarkar et al 2019 allowing a rapid experimental quantification of hydrodynamic anomalies has in reactors however it is noted that the rtd analysis does not provide the precise location of has additional method such as computational fluid dynamic cfd analysis is necessary to investigate the local features of has collivignarelli et al 2020 manenti et al 2018 this study focuses on the evaluation and improvement of existing rtd analysis methods generally two types of methods can be used to analyze rtd data the method of moments and the rtd modeling method bodin et al 2013 2012 haas et al 1997 wang and jawitz 2006 the moment method calculates hydraulic efficiency indexes directly for example the first order moment of rtd reflects the mean residence time and the second order moment of rtd reflects the mixing level the rtd modeling method fits the rtd data based on a specific model and the hydraulic efficiency is reflected by model s parameters the results of the two rtd analysis methods show significant differences bodin et al 2013 2012 haas et al 1997 wang and jawitz 2006 rtd curves are obtained by tracer tests some factors in tracer tests are detrimental to rtd analysis such as measurement errors in tracer concentration brooks and wise 2005 unreasonable sampling intervals headley and kadlec 2007 and premature termination of the tracer test jawitz 2004 wahl et al 2010 measurement errors are unavoidable and depend on the instrument s accuracy and operating condition in many cases such as when bromide or lithium is used as the tracer tracer concentrations have to be analyzed artificially in the laboratory making it impossible to sample frequently in practice it is difficult to know precisely when the tracer concentration returns to the background concentration in addition some tracer tests take too long and have to end prematurely the real rtd curves are usually imperfect due to these unfavorable factors in tracer tests a successful rtd analysis method should avoid the influence of the above factors in this study simulation scenarios were set up to evaluate the effect of these factors on rtd analysis methods many researchers have made improvements to the moment method the approaches include proposing new hydraulic efficiency indicators or finding better indicators from existing ones farjood et al 2015 guo et al 2015 teixeira and siqueira 2008 guo et al 2015 evaluated the influence of the ending time of the tracer test on existing hydraulic efficiency indexes and screened out relatively best short circuit and mixing indicators wahl et al 2010 divided the rtd into pre nominal and post nominal components and the modified moment index was calculated using the pre nominal rtd alternatively an exponential function can be used to extend the tail of the rtd when the tracer test ends prematurely jawitz 2004 in summary the problem that the moment method is susceptible to the ending time of tracer tests has been partly solved however the moment method is still susceptible to measurement error and sampling interval the inherent drawback of the moment method is its over reliance on the rtd data and its accuracy depends on the rtd data s quality the disadvantages of the moment method can be overcome by improving the measurement accuracy shortening the sampling interval and extending the test time but the test cost will increase therefore it is necessary to continue the improvement of the moment method the moment method calculates hydraulic efficiency indexes directly and there are no preconditions in contrast for the rtd modeling method the hydraulic efficiency is reflected by model s parameters consequently it is an implicit premise that the rtd model adequately describe the observed data wang and jawitz 2006 werner and kadlec 2000 different rtd models have been proposed to describe rtd curves the two types of models most often used are plug flow with dispersion and networks of ideal reactors werner and kadlec 2000 many rtd models are site specific the plug flow with dispersion pfd model was shown to be inadequate in describing wetland flow when bypassing or extended retention of tracer occurs kadlec 1994 levenspiel 1972 developed an extensive set of network models using various combinations of plug flow stages and fully mixed stages the most common model for analyzing wetland tracer data is the tanks in series tis model bodin et al 2013 kadlec and wallace 2009 which is a gamma distribution of detention times although the assumptions of the tis model are consistent with the characteristics of most wetlands the tis model fails to describe either the early peak concentration or long tail resulting from retardation kadlec and wallace 2009 in this study multi factorial orthogonal tracer tests were performed to obtain sufficiently diverse rtd curves the accuracy and applicability of rtd models were examined by these observed data a rational function is the ratio of two polynomials rational functions are alternative models for approximating a wide range of data sets in which previous experience or theoretical considerations have not put forward mechanistic models dimitrov and kamenski 1991 nakatsukasa et al 2018 in many cases rational functions provide a better fit to data than a simple polynomial dimitrov and kamenski 1991 hoxha and meklachi 2022 king and queen 1979 rational functions are widely used for modeling frequency domain and time domain effects in power system components ba√±uelos cabral et al 2015 gustavsen 2002 moon and cangellaris 2006 rational functions have also been applied in simulating other physicochemical processes novak and miks 2005 sideridou et al 2002 or social phenomena tjorve 2003 in contrast to existing rtd models the rational model is empirical and its parameters cannot reflect the hydraulic efficiency this may be why the rational model has not previously been used in rtd analysis although the rational model cannot be used directly for rtd analysis it can be a tool for pre processing rtd data this study is designed to investigate whether existing rtd analysis methods could be improved using the rational model this study aims to find a better rtd analysis method providing robust results under the influence of unfavorable factors in tracer tests random measurement error sampling interval and test duration which includes i evaluating the existing rtd analysis methods ii improving the existing rtd analysis method using the rational model 2 materials and methods 2 1 methods of residence time distribution analysis 2 1 1 definition of residence time distribution the tracer response curve illustrates the entire range of residence times observed in the wetland this range of residence times is termed the residence time distribution rtd for pulse injecting tracer tests the rtd can be defined as eq 1 kadlec and wallace 2009 the analysis methods of continuous injecting tracer tests are different and are not the topic of this study 1 f t q t c t 0 q t c t d t where f t is the rtd function d 1 q t is the volumetric outflow rate of water at time t m3 d c t is the outlet tracer concentration g m3 and t is the time of sampling d if the flow rate is constant eq 1 can be simplified the tracer data need to be normalized to facilitate the comparison of rtd data between different wetlands this normalization process is also necessary when the wetland system is variable headley and kadlec 2007 werner and kadlec 1996 the dimensionless flow weighted time œÜ to account for unsteady flow with changing wetland volume is described as eq 2 the dimensionless concentration is described as eq 3 2 œÜ 0 t q t v t d t 3 c œÜ c œÜ v œÜ m where œÜ is the normalized time dimensionless t represents a dummy variable of integration d q t is the variable outflow rate m3 d v t is the changing wetland volume m3 c œÜ is the normalized tracer concentration dimensionless and m is the total mass of tracer g when the flow rate and volume of the wetland system are constant eq 2 can be simplified the normalized time and concentration can be re substituted into eq 1 to calculate the rtd function the tracer tests in this study were conducted in multiple cws with different outflow rates and wetland volumes therefore all tracer data were normalized in this study the existing rtd analysis methods are divided into two categories the moment method and the rtd modeling method the primary difference between these two types of methods is the dependency on the observed data the moment method calculates hydraulic efficiency indexes directly the rtd modeling method fits the original data according to a specific model and is relatively less dependent on the observed data than the moment method 2 1 2 method of moments the moments of the rtd define the key parameters that characterize the wetland the two most important being the mean residence time and the variance of the pulse the n th moment is defined as kadlec and wallace 2009 4 m n 0 t n f t d t the first moment is the mean residence time t m d this value defines the centroid of the rtd and represents the average time that a tracer particle has resided in the wetland 5 t m 0 t f t d t for comparisons between different wetlands the mean residence time needs to be converted to a dimensionless variable as shown in eq 6 6 e t m t n where e is the effective volume ratio t m is the mean residence time d and t n is the nominal residence time d which is defined as the wetland volume divided by the outflow rate the second moment is the variance œÉ m 2 d2 which characterizes the spread of the rtd curve about the mean of the distribution 7 œÉ m 2 0 t t m 2 f t d t the variance may be rendered dimensionless by dividing by the square of the mean residence time 8 œÉ 2 œÉ m 2 t m 2 where œÉ 2 is the dimensionless variance of the tracer pulse in this study the trapezoid rule was used to calculate the n th moment achieved by the trapz function in matlab r2020b 2 1 3 residence time distribution modeling 1 the tis gamma model the most common model for analyzing wetland tracer data is the tanks in series tis model which is a gamma distribution of detention times bodin et al 2013 kadlec and wallace 2009 in addition the parameters of the tis model correspond to the indexes of the moment method and the results of the two methods can be compared consequently the tis model was chosen in this study the tis model is defined as 9 f t n n t n 1 t m n Œ≥ n e x p n t t m 10 Œ≥ n 0 e x p x x n 1 d x where t is the time of sampling f t is the rtd function t m is the mean residence time n is the number of tanks in the tis model x represents a dummy variable of integration and Œ≥ n represents the gamma function there are two parameters in the tis model t m and n the relationship between n and œÉ 2 is shown in eq 11 buffham and mason 1993 11 n 1 œÉ 2 both the moment method and the tis model can be used to calculate the effective volume ratio e and the variance œÉ 2 in this study the differences between these two methods were compared the objective function is required to fit the observed data using rtd models in this study the least squares method was used to minimize the sum of squares of errors between the observed data and the fitted results which is achieved by the nonlinear curve fitting function lsqcurvefit in matlab r2020b 2 the rational model the rational model was selected as an attempt to fit the observed rtd data and improve the existing rtd analysis methods the rational model is empirical and its parameters are not associated with hydraulic efficiency in this study the rational model was used to pre process rtd data the rational model is defined as a ratio of two polynomials 12 f t p 1 t i p 2 t i 1 p 3 t i 2 p i 1 t i i t j q 1 t j 1 q 2 t j 2 q j t j j where t is the time of sampling f t is the rtd function p 1 to p i 1 are the coefficients of the polynomials in the numerator q 1 to q j are the coefficients of the polynomials in the denominator i is the highest number of terms in the numerator and j is the highest number of terms in the denominator the values of i and j need to be specified for example the rational model with i 1 and j 5 is termed rat15 which is defined as 13 f t p 1 t p 2 t 5 q 1 t 4 q 2 t 3 q 3 t 2 q 4 t q 5 the rational model fitting was implemented by the fit function in matlab r2020b and the fitting criterion was also the least squares method a random parameter starting point was used in the fitting process to ensure the objectivity of the results 2 2 the observed rtd data in order to test the accuracy and applicability of rtd models it is necessary to obtain sufficiently diverse observed rtd data according to guo et al 2017 2019 water depth inlet and outlet arrangement flow rate aspect ratio and plants are the main factors affecting the hydraulic performance of free water surface fws constructed wetlands cws in this study orthogonal tests were carried out focusing on these factors the test site is located in the hubei province center station of irrigation experiment in the zhanghe irrigation system zis of hubei province china the layout of the test site is shown in fig 1 the tracer tests were conducted in two types of fws cws in june and july 2022 the first type of wetlands was converted from drainage ditches characterized by relatively large aspect ratio shallow water depth and shallow water plants the second type of wetlands was converted from water storage ponds characterized by relatively small aspect ratio deep water depth and deep water plants the design parameters of each wetland are shown in table 1 the orthogonal test l18 21 37 choi and choe 2010 was conducted in each type of wetlands and 36 sets of observed rtd data were obtained numbered from rtd1 to rtd36 the orthogonal test l18 21 37 is composed of one factor with two levels and seven factors each having three levels the settings of factors and levels are listed in table 2 the complete list of the orthogonal design is shown in the appendix the plant and aspect ratio of each wetland were determined after construction and other parameters could be adjusted according to table 2 the evenly distributed inlet was achieved by the temporary pipe across the width direction the water depth was controlled by the outlet structure the inflow rate and concentration were controlled by a water supply device designed by ourselves the details of the device are described in zhang et al 2023 the flow rate and water depth were kept steady during each tracer test rhodamine wt rwt was selected as the tracer because it is non toxic and easy to be detected in situ headley and kadlec 2007 holland et al 2004 stern et al 2001 wahl et al 2010 rwt is suitable in relatively small wetlands less than 1 week residence time lin et al 2003 and wetlands in this study satisfy the criterion the tracer was instantaneously introduced into the inlet rwt concentrations were measured with a ysi 600oms v2 sonde equipped with a rhodamine probe temperature sensor and data recorder data were collected every 1 2 minutes to ensure adequate sample points for subsequent analysis most of the tracer tests ended after the tracer concentration returned to the background concentration and a few ended early because of the long nominal residence time 2 3 simulation scenarios a relatively perfect rtd curve rtd27 fig 2 a was selected as the basis for generating simulation scenarios this rtd curve has minimal measurement error intensive sampling points and sufficient test time different measurement errors sampling intervals and test ending time were simulated according to simulation scenarios in table 3 scenarios s1 s4 were designed to analyze the effect of measurement error scenarios s5 s8 to analyze the effect of sampling interval and scenarios s9 s12 to analyze the effect of the test ending time the random measurement error was assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0 bodin et al 2013 brooks and wise 2005 haas et al 1997 and the error was generated using the normrnd function in matlab r2020b keller and bays 2002 recommended a minimum initial sampling frequency of 0 1tn werner and kadlec 2000 headley and kadlec 2007 and kadlec and wallace 2009 recommend ending the tracer test at 3tn or 4tn in order to reduce the impact of truncation on hydraulic efficiency indexes the levels of sampling interval and test end time were set according to these recommended values because the simulated measurement errors were random each scenario ran 100 times haas et al 1997 to obtain detailed results the effective volume ratio e and the variance œÉ 2 were calculated using both the moment method and the tis modeling method in each run 2 4 methods for evaluating rtd analysis results a successful rtd analysis method should be able to avoid the influence of unfavorable factors in the tracer test and provide stable and accurate results the coefficient of variation cv was used to evaluate the degree of variation in rtd analysis results 14 cv s u where s is the standard deviation of the result the effective volume ratio e or the variance œÉ 2 for each simulation scenario with 100 runs per scenario u is the mean value of the result for each simulation scenario the relative difference re was used to evaluate the difference between the results of the moment method and the results of the tis modeling method 15 re y moment y tis 1 100 where y moment represents the result of the moment method average of 100 runs y tis represents the result of the tis modeling method average of 100 runs the results calculated using the original rtd data were considered as true values and the results calculated using the simulated rtd data were considered as estimated values the relative error re t was used to evaluate the influence of the factors in table 3 on rtd analysis methods 16 re t estimate truevalue 1 100 where estimate represents the result in each simulation scenario average of 100 runs truevalue represents the result based on the original rtd data the precondition for the rtd modeling method is that the model is accurate the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to evaluate the fitting accuracy of rtd models 17 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n x i y i x and y represent the number of points in data series observed value predicted value and mean values of x and y data series respectively 3 results 3 1 influence of unfavorable factors in tracer tests on rtd analysis methods for all figures showing rtd curves in this study the horizontal axis t is the normalized time and the vertical axis f t is the rtd function calculated using the normalized data fig 2 is an example to illustrate how the simulation scenarios in table 3 were generated rtd27 fig 2 a was selected from the 36 sets of observed data because this curve has minimal measurement error intensive sampling points and sufficient test time fig 2 b shows one run of the simulation scenario s2 the simulated rtd data were generated by adding random measurement error increasing sampling interval and truncating in advance based on rtd27 fig 3 and table 4 are presented to illustrate the analysis process for each simulation scenario the results of different rtd analysis methods for the simulation scenario s2 are shown in fig 3 table 4 shows the summary of evaluation indicators for the simulation scenario s2 there were significant fluctuations in the variance œÉ 2 using the moment method with a coefficient of variation cv as high as 0 2562 there were also fluctuations in the effective volume ratio e using the moment method but cv was relatively small only 0 0311 in contrast the e and œÉ 2 using the tis modeling method were stable with cv s of e and œÉ 2 being 0 0110 and 0 0687 respectively the above results indicated that the moment method was more susceptible to measurement errors than the rtd modeling method in addition the œÉ 2 was more susceptible to measurement error than e the results of the two rtd analysis methods were different with a relative deviation re of 10 95 for e and 9 74 for œÉ 2 in the simulation scenario the values of hydraulic efficiency indexes deviated from their true value the œÉ 2 using the moment method showed an average deviation of 31 89 from its true value indicating that œÉ 2 using the moment method was not only unstable but also inaccurate fig 4 shows the evaluation indicators of the two rtd analysis methods for different simulation scenarios as shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b the cv of e and œÉ 2 using the moment method increased with the increase of measurement error and sampling interval and decreased with the reduction of test time however as shown in fig 4 c and fig 4 d the accuracy of the moment method was severely decreased with reduced test time the tis modeling method was almost unaffected by these factors the stability and accuracy of œÉ 2 were lower than that of e whether using the moment method or the tis modeling method the cv and re t of œÉ 2 were nearly an order of magnitude higher than those of e the difference between the average results of the two methods is shown in fig 4 e the moment method overestimated e compared with the tis modeling method bodin et al 2013 kadlec and wallace 2009 in addition the moment method overestimated œÉ 2 compared with the tis modeling method when the tracer test was long enough but underestimated œÉ 2 when the test ended prematurely 3 2 testing of rtd models using observed data the rtd modeling method showed better stability and accuracy however it is a precondition that the rtd model adequately describes the observed data wang and jawitz 2006 werner and kadlec 2000 the tis model was widely used and according to bodin et al 2013 more than half of the investigated studies used this model the rational model is empirical and has not previously been applied to rtd analysis the two models were tested using 36 sets of observed rtd data and the fitting accuracy is summarized in table 5 all corresponding figures are presented in the appendix due to the large quantity as shown in table 5 the fitting accuracy of the tis model was high in most cases however the tis model also showed poor accuracy for 15 data sets with r 2 less than 0 85 the rtd curves in these cases usually shows a sharp shape an early concentration peak or a slowly decreasing tail the experimental conditions corresponding to these rtd curves were examined it was found that rtd curves rtd1 rtd12 rtd14 and rtd18 tended to become sharp when both the hydraulic loading rate and aspect ratio were large these rtd curves only occurred in first type wetlands aspect ratio 33 early concentration peaks were observed more frequently in wetlands planted with zizania latifolia rtd13 rtd16 rtd20 and rtd30 the large planting spacing of zizania latifolia increased the possibility of short circuits rtd curves tended to show a slowly decreasing tail rtd26 rtd28 rtd30 and rtd31 when the conditions of small hydraulic loading rate and large water depth were satisfied simultaneously the rational model showed excellent fitting accuracy for all cases and the r 2 of the rational model was higher than that of the tis model except for rtd3 eight typical data sets in fig 5 were selected to further illustrate the limitations of the tis model and the superiority of the rational model fig 5 a 1 and 5 a 2 represent the cases where both models were accurate for rtd5 and rtd27 although the r 2 of the tis model was high 0 96 the description of the tails showed noticeable deviations the deviations were more evident in fig 5 b 1 and fig 5 b 2 there were long tails for rtd19 and rtd31 implying that it took longer for the tracer concentration to return to the background concentration the long tail is induced by hydraulic dead zones and is common in wetlands kadlec and wallace 2009 it is revealed from fig 5 b 1 and fig 5 b 2 that the tis model could not precisely describe the long tail the long tail of fig 5 b 1 was significant and in this case the tis model not only failed to describe the tail accurately but also gave a poor description of the peak fig 5 c 1 and 5 c 2 represent the cases where the rtd shows a sharp shape in which case the simulated peak of the tis model was too low the quality of the rtd data in fig 5 d 1 and fig 5 d 2 was poor there were large fluctuations in tracer concentrations for rtd23 and many missing data for rtd35 the rational model provided excellent results in all cases the tanks plus a delay have been utilized as a model for dealing with the early peak concentration and long tail evidenced in most tracer response curves kadlec and wallace 2009 the detention time t d is added to the tis delay model compared with the tis model the tis delay model is defined as 18 f t n n t t d n 1 t m n Œ≥ n exp n t t d t m t t d 0 t t d the comparison of the three rtd models is shown in fig 6 rtd19 and rtd31 were still selected as examples the fitting accuracy was improved by modifying the tis model to the tis delay model however the drawbacks of the tis model still existed and the rational model provided the best results 3 3 improvement of rtd analysis methods the rational model was proved to be an excellent tool for fitting rtd data however the empirical model cannot be used directly for rtd analysis like the tis model therefore an improved rtd analysis method was proposed as shown in fig 7 the imperfect rtd data should be pre processed using the rational model before subsequent analysis two requirements need to be satisfied to prove the effectiveness of the improved method i the rational model can fit most rtd curves which has been proven in section 3 2 ii the improved method is robust under the influence of unfavorable factors in tracer tests the second requirement needs to be evaluated according to the approaches in section 3 1 rtd27 was still selected to generate simulated rtd data the process and results of one simulation are presented in fig 8 a and the results of 100 simulations are presented in fig 8 b the evaluation indicators are summarized in table 6 fig 8 a demonstrates that the rational model was able to complement the imperfect rtd data making the results of the effective volume ratio e and the variance œÉ 2 closer to the true values although it is found from fig 8 b that the improved method was also susceptible to random measurement errors the results of the improved method were more accurate compared with the original moment method table 6 indicates again that the stability and accuracy of œÉ 2 were lower than e the improved method slightly increased the accuracy of e re t changed from 11 79 to 3 71 and significantly increased the accuracy of œÉ 2 re t changed from 73 43 to 16 78 terms selection is the most crucial stage in using rational functions and this stage is a case dependent problem king and queen 1979 valadan zoej et al 2007 intelligent algorithms were used to solve this problem gholinejad et al 2020 mezouar et al 2022 valadan zoej et al 2007 when there were a very large number of terms such as 100 terms in rtd analysis this problem is relatively simple the rational model in the form of rat15 was effective in most cases but there are exceptions fig 9 and table 7 were presented to illustrate this point rtd19 in fig 9 shows a more apparent long tail compared with rtd27 in fig 8 in which case the original moment method showed worse accuracy the excessive parameters of rat15 7 parameters increased the dependence of the rational model on the quantity of sampling points there were only 8 sampling points for the simulated data in fig 9 and in this case rat15 failed to precisely complete the rtd data the improved method based on rat15 did not provide satisfactory results but the accuracy was still higher than the original moment method for the tracer response curve with a long tail such as rtd19 the four parameter model rat12 provided better results than rat15 therefore the rational model with fewer parameters was preferred on the premise of adequate accuracy the improved method based on rat12 significantly increased the accuracy of e re t changed from 36 07 to 5 78 and the accuracy of œÉ 2 re t changed from 86 81 to 22 89 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of the improved method in calculating other hydraulic efficiency indexes in addition to the most used effective volume ratio e and variance œÉ 2 there are many other hydraulic efficiency indicators farjood et al 2015 guo et al 2015 teixeira and siqueira 2008 such as t 10 10 arrival time t 90 90 arrival time t p maximum concentration arrival time and mdi morril index mdi t 90 t 10 these indexes are calculated without using rtd models from this perspective these indexes are essentially the same as e and œÉ 2 the stability and accuracy of these indexes are also dependent on the quality of the tracer data for example when the sampling interval is too large to miss peak concentrations it is not possible to obtain an accurate t p the premature end of the tracer test leads to inaccurate t 10 t 90 and mdi the evaluation of the improved method when calculating other hydraulic efficiency indexes is shown in the appendix the accuracy of these indexes can be improved with different degrees by using the rational model to pre process the defective rtd data the improvement effect is related to the imperfection level of the rtd data in conclusion the method proposed in this study is a general data pre processing approach for rtd analysis 4 2 the application conditions of the improved method the essence of the improved method proposed in this study is to pre process rtd data using the rational model making the defective rtd data more perfect it is noted that a certain amount of fundamental data is required for the rational model the turning points of the rtd curve are essential for the rational model such as the starting point of the rise the peak point and the starting point of the decline when partial key points of the rtd curve were missing the improved method was still effective however when too many key points were missing the improved method was powerless but the improved method still provided more reliable results than the original method even in these extreme cases the corresponding results are presented in the appendix therefore it is critical to follow a reasonable sampling strategy in the tracer test 5 conclusion the stability and accuracy of the moment method were unsatisfactory the stability of the moment method decreased with the increase of the measurement error and sampling interval and the accuracy of the moment method decreased with the decrease of the test time the rtd modeling method showed better stability and accuracy the effective volume ratio was proven to be a preferable indicator compared with the variance of rtd the widely used tis model was only effective in partial cases while the newly proposed rational model showed broader applicability the moment method was improved by using rational models to pre process rtd data although the improved method is still affected by random measurement errors it can significantly increase the accuracy of the moment method when sampling points are small or the test ends prematurely credit authorship contribution statement bochao zhang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft writing

1981,although residence time distributions rtds are frequently used in wetland studies there is no consensus about the analysis method generally two types of methods can be used to analyze rtd data the method of moments and the rtd modeling method rtd curves are obtained by tracer tests the real rtd curves are usually imperfect due to the presence of random measurement errors the unreasonable sampling intervals and the premature termination of the tracer test this study aims to find a better rtd analysis method providing robust results under these unfavorable factors which includes i evaluating the existing rtd analysis methods ii improving the existing rtd analysis method using the rational model the influence of measurement error sampling interval and ending time in tracer tests on rtd analysis methods was first simulated the results showed that effective volume ratio was a preferable indicator compared with the variance of rtd the stability of the moment method decreased with the increase of the measurement error and sampling interval and the accuracy of the moment method decreased with the decrease of the test time although the rtd modeling method showed better stability and accuracy the implicit premise is that the rtd model adequately describes the observed data further 36 observed rtd data sets were used to test the tanks in series tis model and the

the rtd modeling method bodin et al 2013 2012 haas et al 1997 wang and jawitz 2006 the moment method calculates hydraulic efficiency indexes directly for example the first order moment of rtd reflects the mean residence time and the second order moment of rtd reflects the mixing level the rtd modeling method fits the rtd data based on a specific model and the hydraulic efficiency is reflected by model s parameters the results of the two rtd analysis methods show significant differences bodin et al 2013 2012 haas et al 1997 wang and jawitz 2006 rtd curves are obtained by tracer tests some factors in tracer tests are detrimental to rtd analysis such as measurement errors in tracer concentration brooks and wise 2005 unreasonable sampling intervals headley and kadlec 2007 and premature termination of the tracer test jawitz 2004 wahl et al 2010 measurement errors are unavoidable and depend on the instrument s accuracy and operating condition in many cases such as when bromide or lithium is used as the tracer tracer concentrations have to be analyzed artificially in the laboratory making it impossible to sample frequently in practice it is difficult to know precisely when the tracer concentration returns to the background concentration in addition some tracer tests take too long and have to end prematurely the real rtd curves are usually imperfect due to these unfavorable factors in tracer tests a successful rtd analysis method should avoid the influence of the above factors in this study simulation scenarios were set up to evaluate the effect of these factors on rtd analysis methods many researchers have made improvements to the moment method the approaches include proposing new hydraulic efficiency indicators or finding better indicators from existing ones farjood et al 2015 guo et al 2015 teixeira and siqueira 2008 guo et al 2015 evaluated the influence of the ending time of the tracer test on existing hydraulic efficiency indexes and screened out relatively best short circuit and mixing indicators wahl et al 2010 divided the rtd into pre nominal and post nominal components and the modified moment index was calculated using the pre nominal rtd alternatively an exponential function can be used to extend the tail of the rtd when the tracer test ends prematurely jawitz 2004 in summary the problem that the moment method is susceptible to the ending time of tracer tests has been partly solved however the moment method is still susceptible to measurement error and sampling interval the inherent drawback of the moment method is its over reliance on the rtd data and its accuracy depends on the rtd data s quality the disadvantages of the moment method can be overcome by improving the measurement accuracy shortening the sampling interval and extending the test time but the test cost will increase therefore it is necessary to continue the improvement of the moment method the moment method calculates hydraulic efficiency indexes directly and there are no preconditions in contrast for the rtd modeling method the hydraulic efficiency is reflected by model s parameters consequently it is an implicit premise that the rtd model adequately describe the observed data wang and jawitz 2006 werner and kadlec 2000 different rtd models have been proposed to describe rtd curves the two types of models most often used are plug flow with dispersion and networks of ideal reactors werner and kadlec 2000 many rtd models are site specific the plug flow with dispersion pfd model was shown to be inadequate in describing wetland flow when bypassing or extended retention of tracer occurs kadlec 1994 levenspiel 1972 developed an extensive set of network models using various combinations of plug flow stages and fully mixed stages the most common model for analyzing wetland tracer data is the tanks in series tis model bodin et al 2013 kadlec and wallace 2009 which is a gamma distribution of detention times although the assumptions of the tis model are consistent with the characteristics of most wetlands the tis model fails to describe either the early peak concentration or long tail resulting from retardation kadlec and wallace 2009 in this study multi factorial orthogonal tracer tests were performed to obtain sufficiently diverse rtd curves the accuracy and applicability of rtd models were examined by these observed data a rational function is the ratio of two polynomials rational functions are alternative models for approximating a wide range of data sets in which previous experience or theoretical considerations have not put forward mechanistic models dimitrov and kamenski 1991 nakatsukasa et al 2018 in many cases rational functions provide a better fit to data than a simple polynomial dimitrov and kamenski 1991 hoxha and meklachi 2022 king and queen 1979 rational functions are widely used for modeling frequency domain and time domain effects in power system components ba√±uelos cabral et al 2015 gustavsen 2002 moon and cangellaris 2006 rational functions have also been applied in simulating other physicochemical processes novak and miks 2005 sideridou et al 2002 or social phenomena tjorve 2003 in contrast to existing rtd models the rational model is empirical and its parameters cannot reflect the hydraulic efficiency this may be why the rational model has not previously been used in rtd analysis although the rational model cannot be used directly for rtd analysis it can be a tool for pre processing rtd data this study is designed to investigate whether existing rtd analysis methods could be improved using the rational model this study aims to find a better rtd analysis method providing robust results under the influence of unfavorable factors in tracer tests random measurement error sampling interval and test duration which includes i evaluating the existing rtd analysis methods ii improving the existing rtd analysis method using the rational model 2 materials and methods 2 1 methods of residence time distribution analysis 2 1 1 definition of residence time distribution the tracer response curve illustrates the entire range of residence times observed in the wetland this range of residence times is termed the residence time distribution rtd for pulse injecting tracer tests the rtd can be defined as eq 1 kadlec and wallace 2009 the analysis methods of continuous injecting tracer tests are different and are not the topic of this study 1 f t q t c t 0 q t c t d t where f t is the rtd function d 1 q t is the volumetric outflow rate of water at time t m3 d c t is the outlet tracer concentration g m3 and t is the time of sampling d if the flow rate is constant eq 1 can be simplified the tracer data need to be normalized to facilitate the comparison of rtd data between different wetlands this normalization process is also necessary when the wetland system is variable headley and kadlec 2007 werner and kadlec 1996 the dimensionless flow weighted time œÜ to account for unsteady flow with changing wetland volume is described as eq 2 the dimensionless concentration is described as eq 3 2 œÜ 0 t q t v t d t 3 c œÜ c œÜ v œÜ m where œÜ is the normalized time dimensionless t represents a dummy variable of integration d q t is the variable outflow rate m3 d v t is the changing wetland volume m3 c œÜ is the normalized tracer concentration dimensionless and m is the total mass of tracer g when the flow rate and volume of the wetland system are constant eq 2 can be simplified the normalized time and concentration can be re substituted into eq 1 to calculate the rtd function the tracer tests in this study were conducted in multiple cws with different outflow rates and wetland volumes therefore all tracer data were normalized in this study the existing rtd analysis methods are divided into two categories the moment method and the rtd modeling method the primary difference between these two types of methods is the dependency on the observed data the moment method calculates hydraulic efficiency indexes directly the rtd modeling method fits the original data according to a specific model and is relatively less dependent on the observed data than the moment method 2 1 2 method of moments the moments of the rtd define the key parameters that characterize the wetland the two most important being the mean residence time and the variance of the pulse the n th moment is defined as kadlec and wallace 2009 4 m n 0 t n f t d t the first moment is the mean residence time t m d this value defines the centroid of the rtd and represents the average time that a tracer particle has resided in the wetland 5 t m 0 t f t d t for comparisons between different wetlands the mean residence time needs to be converted to a dimensionless variable as shown in eq 6 6 e t m t n where e is the effective volume ratio t m is the mean residence time d and t n is the nominal residence time d which is defined as the wetland volume divided by the outflow rate the second moment is the variance œÉ m 2 d2 which characterizes the spread of the rtd curve about the mean of the distribution 7 œÉ m 2 0 t t m 2 f t d t the variance may be rendered dimensionless by dividing by the square of the mean residence time 8 œÉ 2 œÉ m 2 t m 2 where œÉ 2 is the dimensionless variance of the tracer pulse in this study the trapezoid rule was used to calculate the n th moment achieved by the trapz function in matlab r2020b 2 1 3 residence time distribution modeling 1 the tis gamma model the most common model for analyzing wetland tracer data is the tanks in series tis model which is a gamma distribution of detention times bodin et al 2013 kadlec and wallace 2009 in addition the parameters of the tis model correspond to the indexes of the moment method and the results of the two methods can be compared consequently the tis model was chosen in this study the tis model is defined as 9 f t n n t n 1 t m n Œ≥ n e x p n t t m 10 Œ≥ n 0 e x p x x n 1 d x where t is the time of sampling f t is the rtd function t m is the mean residence time n is the number of tanks in the tis model x represents a dummy variable of integration and Œ≥ n represents the gamma function there are two parameters in the tis model t m and n the relationship between n and œÉ 2 is shown in eq 11 buffham and mason 1993 11 n 1 œÉ 2 both the moment method and the tis model can be used to calculate the effective volume ratio e and the variance œÉ 2 in this study the differences between these two methods were compared the objective function is required to fit the observed data using rtd models in this study the least squares method was used to minimize the sum of squares of errors between the observed data and the fitted results which is achieved by the nonlinear curve fitting function lsqcurvefit in matlab r2020b 2 the rational model the rational model was selected as an attempt to fit the observed rtd data and improve the existing rtd analysis methods the rational model is empirical and its parameters are not associated with hydraulic efficiency in this study the rational model was used to pre process rtd data the rational model is defined as a ratio of two polynomials 12 f t p 1 t i p 2 t i 1 p 3 t i 2 p i 1 t i i t j q 1 t j 1 q 2 t j 2 q j t j j where t is the time of sampling f t is the rtd function p 1 to p i 1 are the coefficients of the polynomials in the numerator q 1 to q j are the coefficients of the polynomials in the denominator i is the highest number of terms in the numerator and j is the highest number of terms in the denominator the values of i and j need to be specified for example the rational model with i 1 and j 5 is termed rat15 which is defined as 13 f t p 1 t p 2 t 5 q 1 t 4 q 2 t 3 q 3 t 2 q 4 t q 5 the rational model fitting was implemented by the fit function in matlab r2020b and the fitting criterion was also the least squares method a random parameter starting point was used in the fitting process to ensure the objectivity of the results 2 2 the observed rtd data in order to test the accuracy and applicability of rtd models it is necessary to obtain sufficiently diverse observed rtd data according to guo et al 2017 2019 water depth inlet and outlet arrangement flow rate aspect ratio and plants are the main factors affecting the hydraulic performance of free water surface fws constructed wetlands cws in this study orthogonal tests were carried out focusing on these factors the test site is located in the hubei province center station of irrigation experiment in the zhanghe irrigation system zis of hubei province china the layout of the test site is shown in fig 1 the tracer tests were conducted in two types of fws cws in june and july 2022 the first type of wetlands was converted from drainage ditches characterized by relatively large aspect ratio shallow water depth and shallow water plants the second type of wetlands was converted from water storage ponds characterized by relatively small aspect ratio deep water depth and deep water plants the design parameters of each wetland are shown in table 1 the orthogonal test l18 21 37 choi and choe 2010 was conducted in each type of wetlands and 36 sets of observed rtd data were obtained numbered from rtd1 to rtd36 the orthogonal test l18 21 37 is composed of one factor with two levels and seven factors each having three levels the settings of factors and levels are listed in table 2 the complete list of the orthogonal design is shown in the appendix the plant and aspect ratio of each wetland were determined after construction and other parameters could be adjusted according to table 2 the evenly distributed inlet was achieved by the temporary pipe across the width direction the water depth was controlled by the outlet structure the inflow rate and concentration were controlled by a water supply device designed by ourselves the details of the device are described in zhang et al 2023 the flow rate and water depth were kept steady during each tracer test rhodamine wt rwt was selected as the tracer because it is non toxic and easy to be detected in situ headley and kadlec 2007 holland et al 2004 stern et al 2001 wahl et al 2010 rwt is suitable in relatively small wetlands less than 1 week residence time lin et al 2003 and wetlands in this study satisfy the criterion the tracer was instantaneously introduced into the inlet rwt concentrations were measured with a ysi 600oms v2 sonde equipped with a rhodamine probe temperature sensor and data recorder data were collected every 1 2 minutes to ensure adequate sample points for subsequent analysis most of the tracer tests ended after the tracer concentration returned to the background concentration and a few ended early because of the long nominal residence time 2 3 simulation scenarios a relatively perfect rtd curve rtd27 fig 2 a was selected as the basis for generating simulation scenarios this rtd curve has minimal measurement error intensive sampling points and sufficient test time different measurement errors sampling intervals and test ending time were simulated according to simulation scenarios in table 3 scenarios s1 s4 were designed to analyze the effect of measurement error scenarios s5 s8 to analyze the effect of sampling interval and scenarios s9 s12 to analyze the effect of the test ending time the random measurement error was assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0 bodin et al 2013 brooks and wise 2005 haas et al 1997 and the error was generated using the normrnd function in matlab r2020b keller and bays 2002 recommended a minimum initial sampling frequency of 0 1tn werner and kadlec 2000 headley and kadlec 2007 and kadlec and wallace 2009 recommend ending the tracer test at 3tn or 4tn in order to reduce the impact of truncation on hydraulic efficiency indexes the levels of sampling interval and test end time were set according to these recommended values because the simulated measurement errors were random each scenario ran 100 times haas et al 1997 to obtain detailed results the effective volume ratio e and the variance œÉ 2 were calculated using both the moment method and the tis modeling method in each run 2 4 methods for evaluating rtd analysis results a successful rtd analysis method should be able to avoid the influence of unfavorable factors in the tracer test and provide stable and accurate results the coefficient of variation cv was used to evaluate the degree of variation in rtd analysis results 14 cv s u where s is the standard deviation of the result the effective volume ratio e or the variance œÉ 2 for each simulation scenario with 100 runs per scenario u is the mean value of the result for each simulation scenario the relative difference re was used to evaluate the difference between the results of the moment method and the results of the tis modeling method 15 re y moment y tis 1 100 where y moment represents the result of the moment method average of 100 runs y tis represents the result of the tis modeling method average of 100 runs the results calculated using the original rtd data were considered as true values and the results calculated using the simulated rtd data were considered as estimated values the relative error re t was used to evaluate the influence of the factors in table 3 on rtd analysis methods 16 re t estimate truevalue 1 100 where estimate represents the result in each simulation scenario average of 100 runs truevalue represents the result based on the original rtd data the precondition for the rtd modeling method is that the model is accurate the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to evaluate the fitting accuracy of rtd models 17 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n x i y i x and y represent the number of points in data series observed value predicted value and mean values of x and y data series respectively 3 results 3 1 influence of unfavorable factors in tracer tests on rtd analysis methods for all figures showing rtd curves in this study the horizontal axis t is the normalized time and the vertical axis f t is the rtd function calculated using the normalized data fig 2 is an example to illustrate how the simulation scenarios in table 3 were generated rtd27 fig 2 a was selected from the 36 sets of observed data because this curve has minimal measurement error intensive sampling points and sufficient test time fig 2 b shows one run of the simulation scenario s2 the simulated rtd data were generated by adding random measurement error increasing sampling interval and truncating in advance based on rtd27 fig 3 and table 4 are presented to illustrate the analysis process for each simulation scenario the results of different rtd analysis methods for the simulation scenario s2 are shown in fig 3 table 4 shows the summary of evaluation indicators for the simulation scenario s2 there were significant fluctuations in the variance œÉ 2 using the moment method with a coefficient of variation cv as high as 0 2562 there were also fluctuations in the effective volume ratio e using the moment method but cv was relatively small only 0 0311 in contrast the e and œÉ 2 using the tis modeling method were stable with cv s of e and œÉ 2 being 0 0110 and 0 0687 respectively the above results indicated that the moment method was more susceptible to measurement errors than the rtd modeling method in addition the œÉ 2 was more susceptible to measurement error than e the results of the two rtd analysis methods were different with a relative deviation re of 10 95 for e and 9 74 for œÉ 2 in the simulation scenario the values of hydraulic efficiency indexes deviated from their true value the œÉ 2 using the moment method showed an average deviation of 31 89 from its true value indicating that œÉ 2 using the moment method was not only unstable but also inaccurate fig 4 shows the evaluation indicators of the two rtd analysis methods for different simulation scenarios as shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b the cv of e and œÉ 2 using the moment method increased with the increase of measurement error and sampling interval and decreased with the reduction of test time however as shown in fig 4 c and fig 4 d the accuracy of the moment method was severely decreased with reduced test time the tis modeling method was almost unaffected by these factors the stability and accuracy of œÉ 2 were lower than that of e whether using the moment method or the tis modeling method the cv and re t of œÉ 2 were nearly an order of magnitude higher than those of e the difference between the average results of the two methods is shown in fig 4 e the moment method overestimated e compared with the tis modeling method bodin et al 2013 kadlec and wallace 2009 in addition the moment method overestimated œÉ 2 compared with the tis modeling method when the tracer test was long enough but underestimated œÉ 2 when the test ended prematurely 3 2 testing of rtd models using observed data the rtd modeling method showed better stability and accuracy however it is a precondition that the rtd model adequately describes the observed data wang and jawitz 2006 werner and kadlec 2000 the tis model was widely used and according to bodin et al 2013 more than half of the investigated studies used this model the rational model is empirical and has not previously been applied to rtd analysis the two models were tested using 36 sets of observed rtd data and the fitting accuracy is summarized in table 5 all corresponding figures are presented in the appendix due to the large quantity as shown in table 5 the fitting accuracy of the tis model was high in most cases however the tis model also showed poor accuracy for 15 data sets with r 2 less than 0 85 the rtd curves in these cases usually shows a sharp shape an early concentration peak or a slowly decreasing tail the experimental conditions corresponding to these rtd curves were examined it was found that rtd curves rtd1 rtd12 rtd14 and rtd18 tended to become sharp when both the hydraulic loading rate and aspect ratio were large these rtd curves only occurred in first type wetlands aspect ratio 33 early concentration peaks were observed more frequently in wetlands planted with zizania latifolia rtd13 rtd16 rtd20 and rtd30 the large planting spacing of zizania latifolia increased the possibility of short circuits rtd curves tended to show a slowly decreasing tail rtd26 rtd28 rtd30 and rtd31 when the conditions of small hydraulic loading rate and large water depth were satisfied simultaneously the rational model showed excellent fitting accuracy for all cases and the r 2 of the rational model was higher than that of the tis model except for rtd3 eight typical data sets in fig 5 were selected to further illustrate the limitations of the tis model and the superiority of the rational model fig 5 a 1 and 5 a 2 represent the cases where both models were accurate for rtd5 and rtd27 although the r 2 of the tis model was high 0 96 the description of the tails showed noticeable deviations the deviations were more evident in fig 5 b 1 and fig 5 b 2 there were long tails for rtd19 and rtd31 implying that it took longer for the tracer concentration to return to the background concentration the long tail is induced by hydraulic dead zones and is common in wetlands kadlec and wallace 2009 it is revealed from fig 5 b 1 and fig 5 b 2 that the tis model could not precisely describe the long tail the long tail of fig 5 b 1 was significant and in this case the tis model not only failed to describe the tail accurately but also gave a poor description of the peak fig 5 c 1 and 5 c 2 represent the cases where the rtd shows a sharp shape in which case the simulated peak of the tis model was too low the quality of the rtd data in fig 5 d 1 and fig 5 d 2 was poor there were large fluctuations in tracer concentrations for rtd23 and many missing data for rtd35 the rational model provided excellent results in all cases the tanks plus a delay have been utilized as a model for dealing with the early peak concentration and long tail evidenced in most tracer response curves kadlec and wallace 2009 the detention time t d is added to the tis delay model compared with the tis model the tis delay model is defined as 18 f t n n t t d n 1 t m n Œ≥ n exp n t t d t m t t d 0 t t d the comparison of the three rtd models is shown in fig 6 rtd19 and rtd31 were still selected as examples the fitting accuracy was improved by modifying the tis model to the tis delay model however the drawbacks of the tis model still existed and the rational model provided the best results 3 3 improvement of rtd analysis methods the rational model was proved to be an excellent tool for fitting rtd data however the empirical model cannot be used directly for rtd analysis like the tis model therefore an improved rtd analysis method was proposed as shown in fig 7 the imperfect rtd data should be pre processed using the rational model before subsequent analysis two requirements need to be satisfied to prove the effectiveness of the improved method i the rational model can fit most rtd curves which has been proven in section 3 2 ii the improved method is robust under the influence of unfavorable factors in tracer tests the second requirement needs to be evaluated according to the approaches in section 3 1 rtd27 was still selected to generate simulated rtd data the process and results of one simulation are presented in fig 8 a and the results of 100 simulations are presented in fig 8 b the evaluation indicators are summarized in table 6 fig 8 a demonstrates that the rational model was able to complement the imperfect rtd data making the results of the effective volume ratio e and the variance œÉ 2 closer to the true values although it is found from fig 8 b that the improved method was also susceptible to random measurement errors the results of the improved method were more accurate compared with the original moment method table 6 indicates again that the stability and accuracy of œÉ 2 were lower than e the improved method slightly increased the accuracy of e re t changed from 11 79 to 3 71 and significantly increased the accuracy of œÉ 2 re t changed from 73 43 to 16 78 terms selection is the most crucial stage in using rational functions and this stage is a case dependent problem king and queen 1979 valadan zoej et al 2007 intelligent algorithms were used to solve this problem gholinejad et al 2020 mezouar et al 2022 valadan zoej et al 2007 when there were a very large number of terms such as 100 terms in rtd analysis this problem is relatively simple the rational model in the form of rat15 was effective in most cases but there are exceptions fig 9 and table 7 were presented to illustrate this point rtd19 in fig 9 shows a more apparent long tail compared with rtd27 in fig 8 in which case the original moment method showed worse accuracy the excessive parameters of rat15 7 parameters increased the dependence of the rational model on the quantity of sampling points there were only 8 sampling points for the simulated data in fig 9 and in this case rat15 failed to precisely complete the rtd data the improved method based on rat15 did not provide satisfactory results but the accuracy was still higher than the original moment method for the tracer response curve with a long tail such as rtd19 the four parameter model rat12 provided better results than rat15 therefore the rational model with fewer parameters was preferred on the premise of adequate accuracy the improved method based on rat12 significantly increased the accuracy of e re t changed from 36 07 to 5 78 and the accuracy of œÉ 2 re t changed from 86 81 to 22 89 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of the improved method in calculating other hydraulic efficiency indexes in addition to the most used effective volume ratio e and variance œÉ 2 there are many other hydraulic efficiency indicators farjood et al 2015 guo et al 2015 teixeira and siqueira 2008 such as t 10 10 arrival time t 90 90 arrival time t p maximum concentration arrival time and mdi morril index mdi t 90 t 10 these indexes are calculated without using rtd models from this perspective these indexes are essentially the same as e and œÉ 2 the stability and accuracy of these indexes are also dependent on the quality of the tracer data for example when the sampling interval is too large to miss peak concentrations it is not possible to obtain an accurate t p the premature end of the tracer test leads to inaccurate t 10 t 90 and mdi the evaluation of the improved method when calculating other hydraulic efficiency indexes is shown in the appendix the accuracy of these indexes can be improved with different degrees by using the rational model to pre process the defective rtd data the improvement effect is related to the imperfection level of the rtd data in conclusion the method proposed in this study is a general data pre processing approach for rtd analysis 4 2 the application conditions of the improved method the essence of the improved method proposed in this study is to pre process rtd data using the rational model making the defective rtd data more perfect it is noted that a certain amount of fundamental data is required for the rational model the turning points of the rtd curve are essential for the rational model such as the starting point of the rise the peak point and the starting point of the decline when partial key points of the rtd curve were missing the improved method was still effective however when too many key points were missing the improved method was powerless but the improved method still provided more reliable results than the original method even in these extreme cases the corresponding results are presented in the appendix therefore it is critical to follow a reasonable sampling strategy in the tracer test 5 conclusion the stability and accuracy of the moment method were unsatisfactory the stability of the moment method decreased with the increase of the measurement error and sampling interval and the accuracy of the moment method decreased with the decrease of the test time the rtd modeling method showed better stability and accuracy the effective volume ratio was proven to be a preferable indicator compared with the variance of rtd the widely used tis model was only effective in partial cases while the newly proposed rational model showed broader applicability the moment method was improved by using rational models to pre process rtd data although the improved method is still affected by random measurement errors it can significantly increase the accuracy of the moment method when sampling points are small or the test ends prematurely credit authorship contribution statement bochao zhang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft writing

1982,runoff generation thresholds and pathways are critical to understanding catchment scale hydrological processes the variability in catchment storage soil moisture dynamics and rainfall characteristics influence the spatial and temporal variability of runoff thresholds and pathways this study used six years of hourly hydro meteorological datasets of two independent p301 and p303 and one nested p300 headwater catchments located in the southern sierra nevada region of california usa to understand the spatial variability in runoff thresholds and runoff pathways further we identified the spatio temporal variability in preferential flow pathways changes in soil moisture and vertical wetting front velocity along with their controlling factors from the analysis of 129 rainfall runoff events it was found that the catchment runoff was activated when the catchment wetness i e storage plus rainfall was greater than 212 mm 238 mm and 250 mm in p301 p303 and p300 respectively the catchment storage was higher at the lower slope resulting in higher runoff thresholds compared to upslope locations inside p301 and p303 further we observed dominance of preferential flow 60 at 60 cm and 90 cm depth at the lower and upper slope locations respectively indicating a domination of subsurface runoff generation mechanism in these catchments the preferential flows were more frequent during the drought years 2012 2015 than those in the normal years 2010 2011 furthermore we observed higher vertical wetting front velocity at deeper depths but no consistent pattern was observed in the change in soil moisture along the soil profile this study will be useful for field hydrologists and modelers to design an experimental setup and to develop a more realistic hydrological model considering the spatio temporal variation in runoff thresholds and preferential flow pathways in forested montane headwater catchments of the mediterranean region keywords runoff thresholds preferential flow soil moisture headwater catchments rainfall runoff data availability we have shared the data link in the main manuscript under data availability section 1 introduction runoff generation processes are non linear as some amount of storage needs to be filled before the occurrence of runoff regardless of dominant flow pathways mcdonnell et al 2021 this non linearity is scale dependent which adds more complexity to our understanding of runoff processes for example small surface or sub surface depressions need to be filled before the triggering of runoff from plot and hillslope scales tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 whereas multiple storages need to be filled before the beginning of catchment scale runoff spence and woo 2003 for example subsurface runoff generated from an upslope location needs to fill the lower slope storage before reaching the catchment outlet mcdonnell et al 2021 another fill and spill example is from the canadian shield watershed where a series of segments with variable storage need to be filled until its storage thresholds for runoff is exceeded to start runoff at the valley spence and woo 2003 in other words runoff generation at any scale is reflected as a failure of system storage ward et al 2018 the infiltration excess or hortonian runoff takes place when rainfall intensity exceeds soil infiltration capacity horton 1933 the infiltration capacity tends to decrease as the system storage especially in soil layers starts filling accelerating the infiltration excess runoff process by establishing connectivity among landscapes nanda et al 2019 the subsurface runoff occurs due to rapid infiltration which triggers lateral subsurface flow after filling the subsurface storage hewlett and hibbert 1967 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 further in saturation excess runoff the system storage fails when saturation from the bottom of the soil layer reaches the surface layer to activate the runoff dunne and black 1970 overall the runoff initiation threshold depends on system storage normally explained by soil moisture storage and groundwater table fluctuations and rainfall characteristics sarkar et al 2015 saffarpour et al 2016 nanda and sen 2021 the runoff connectivity and thresholds are related to each other saffarpour et al 2016 nanda and sen 2021 the spatial variation in infiltration characteristics and antecedent moisture storage influence the runoff connectivity at the hillslope and catchment scale western et al 1998 nanda et al 2019 due to this spatial variability patch scale runoff is connected to a catchment outlet only above a particular soil moisture storage and rainfall thresholds penna et al 2011 nanda et al 2019 wang et al 2022 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 measured sub surface pipe and matrix flow threshold in the panola mountain research watershed and stated that rainfall depth greater than 55 mm during high soil moisture conditions could generate 1 mm pipe flow threshold analysis using the 50 years dataset of hj andrews experimental watershed showed that stormflow response was related to the inter storm period which is an indicator of antecedent soil moisture storage prior to the rainfall event graham et al 2010 studies conducted in the tarrawarra catchment in south eastern australia western et al 1998 and in an alpine headwater catchment in italian dolomites penna et al 2011 found a significant increase in the runoff after crossing certain soil moisture thresholds besides these specific studies the relationship between soil moisture thresholds and runoff has been widely investigated in various catchments mcnamara et al 2005 zehe et al 2005 radatz et al 2013 song and wang 2019 however many research findings stated that antecedent soil moisture storage alone could not explain the triggering point of catchment runoff generation detty and mcguire 2010 penna et al 2011 farrick and branfireun 2014 saffarpour et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 thus those studies used the antecedent soil moisture storage and rainfall depth as catchment wetness to explain catchment runoff characteristics scaife and band 2017 used 15 years of dataset from the coweeta hydrologic laboratory and showed that thresholds behavior is not solely determined by climate and catchment geophysical properties but it can also be governed by the seasonal and interannual response of forest evapotranspiration moreover the relationship between connectivity and thresholds is dependent on topographic location i e depth and slope positions of soil moisture measurements for example in the case if infiltration excess the shallow depth soil moisture sensors may show quick connectivity than the sensors at deeper depths similarly the slope positions i e upslope mid slope and lower slope of soil moisture sensors exhibit non linear behavior of thresholds due to variations in atmospheric forcing storage soil properties and vegetation cover many previous hillslope scale studies observed that spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture is influenced by precipitation vertical and lateral redistribution of water variation in soil hydraulic properties and preferential flow pathways tymchak and torres 2007 detty and mcguire 2010 nanda et al 2019 singh et al 2021 the runoff generation thresholds have been studied widely at hillslope scale tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 penna et al 2011 sarkar et al 2015 nanda and sen 2021 and at catchment scale mart√≠nez mena et al 1998 latron and gallart 2008 ali et al 2015 saffarpour et al 2016 gutierrez jurado et al 2021 under a wide range of climatic and geological conditions however only a few studies have been reported for granitic catchments fu et al 2013 studied threshold behavior of 1 km2 granitic catchment situated in southern china which has subtropical monsoon climate and weathered and fractured granitic underlying bedrock in a similar climatic zone katsuyama et al 2010 studied the relationship between stream water residence time and groundwater recharge discharge at a watershed 5 99 ha and a hillslope 0 024 ha scale the underlying bedrock of their studied location has characteristics of saprolite and is homogeneously weathered and permeable however no study on runoff generation thresholds has been reported in the granitic sierra nevada region of mediterranean climate experiencing wet and cold winters and dry and hot summers liu et al 2013 studied streamflow controls using endmember mixing analysis and observed the dominance of subsurface flow in the kings river experimental watersheds krew many studies have been carried out related to the spatial pattern of streamflow safeeq and hunsaker 2016 soil moisture oroza et al 2018 and sediment hunsaker and neary 2012 safeeq et al 2022 yang et al 2022 in the krew in the changing climatic conditions this region is more likely to experience a shift in precipitation regime from snow to rain affecting the dynamic of catchment runoff and streamflow safeeq and hunsaker 2016 hence a comprehensive study on runoff thresholds will be useful for comparing runoff generation processes and associated storage characteristics among various forested montane catchments of the sierra nevada understanding runoff generation thresholds are known to improve hydrological model calibration and validation as they simplify the complex behavior of catchment scale hydrological responses by categorizing them into similar response groups graham and mcdonnell 2010 ali et al 2015 in this study we investigated runoff generation thresholds and the spatial analysis of soil moisture indices i e wetting front velocities and initial response time in three different mediterranean catchments of the southern sierra nevada our goal was to answer the following research questions i how the soil moisture and rainfall influence the runoff thresholds in mediterranean headwater catchments ii how variable are these runoff thresholds within a catchment and iii how do soil moisture indices and preferential flow occurrence vary spatially and temporally 2 methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in the kings river experimental watershed krew located in the southern part of the sierra nevada california fig 1 the krew comprises ten headwater catchments grouped into two regions lower elevation 1782 1979 m above sea level providence and high elevation 2122 2373 m above sea level bull the current study selected three catchments p301 0 99 km2 p303 1 32 km2 and p300 4 6 km2 of providence catchment among these independent catchments p301 and p303 are nested within p300 fig 1 the mean catchment elevation slope of p301 p303 and p300 are 1979 m 19 1905 m 20 and 1883 m 21 respectively these catchments are covered with mixed coniferous forest 82 in p301 94 in p303 and 92 p300 predominantly sugar pine p lambertiana ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa incense cedar libocedrus decurrens and white fir abies concolor p301 is dominated by gerle cagwin soil whereas the dominance of shaver soil is found in p303 and p300 johnson et al 2011 the soil of this region is dominated by sandy and loamy sand textural classes having variation in saturated hydraulic conductivity from 1 to 21 cm h the dry bulk density at 15 cm 30 cm 60 cm and 90 cm soil depth was 1 0 g cm3 1 25 1 35 g cm3 and 1 35 1 45 g cm3 respectively bales et al 2011 the climate of the studied area is mediterranean with dry summer and cold winter the annual average daily temperature and precipitation of this region are in the range of 8 10 c and 1026 1234 mm respectively safeeq et al 2022 2 2 hydro meteorological data the catchments were instrumented with wireless based soil moisture sensor networks to capture the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture o geen et al 2018 the soil moisture was measured at 10 30 60 and 90 cm depths using echo tm meter group pullman wa usa sensor starting on 1 october 2009 we used upslope us and lower slope ls soil moisture locations of p301 and p303 catchments in our analysis fig 1 at p301 soil moisture sensors were installed in three clusters covering 23 nodes i e five sensors at us three at mid slope five at mid slope meadow six at ls and four at meadow boundary of ls locations we have used the cluster of five soil moisture sensors of the us and six sensors of the ls locations of p301 for this study fig 1 in p303 soil moisture was measured in two clusters 17 nodes at us and 10 nodes at ls locations at depths of 10 30 60 and 90 cm fig 1 the ls site was just outside the p303 outlet but we used it as a surrogate for the ls soil moisture for this catchment one large throat width 61 cm and one small throat width 7 6 cm fiberglass parshall flumes were used for measuring high and low streamflow at 15 min temporal frequency in p301 and p303 whereas a v notch weir was used at p300 for gauging stream discharge all the hydraulic structures were instrumented with the 730 air bubbler teledyne isco lincoln nebraska and submersible pressure transducers trimble water inc rochester ny usa either in the stilling well of small and large flumes respectively or directly in the stream for recording the stage more details about the hydro meteorological instrumentations can be found in o geen et al 2018 and safeeq and hunsaker 2016 we have used the hydro meteorological datasets for the water year wy 2010 2015 at an hourly temporal resolution for this analysis 2 3 event identification the precipitation discharge and temperature data were analyzed to identify rainfall runoff events the baseflow was separated from the hourly discharge time series using the recursive digital filter method eckhardt 2005 1 b t 1 bfi max Œ± b t 1 1 Œ± bfi max y t 1 Œ± bfi max the term bt and bt 1 stand for baseflow at timestep t and t 1 y t is the total streamflow at timestep t and bfimax and Œ± represents baseflow index i e baseflow streamflow and filter parameter respectively in the current study bfimax and Œ± are considered as 0 80 and 0 985 respectively the analysis was carried out in web based hydrograph analysis tool kyoung et al 2005 the baseflow was subtracted from the total discharge for quantifying the direct event runoff the following conditions were applied for identifying the rainfall runoff events i an event was identified as the beginning of the rainfall to the end of the runoff ii the beginning of the event was identified from the beginning of rainfall followed by starting of the runoff along with the no rain 6 h before commencement of the hydrological event iii total event rainfall must be greater than 5 mm hydraulic conductivity of these catchments is between 10 and 210 mm h so we decided 5 mm rainfall bar for the event selection iv the end of an event was defined as the end of runoff events with no further rainfall in the next 6 h v snowfall events were separated from rainfall events when the air temperature fell below 0 c for more than 40 of the total event duration the selected events were used to identify the runoff generation thresholds we plotted runoff characteristics i e runoff depth and runoff coefficient with multiple precipitation and storage characteristics i e rainfall depth peak rainfall intensity antecedent soil moisture storage ams and rainfall ams to identify the controlling factor of runoff generation the presence or absence of the runoff generation threshold was visually assessed we also used k means clustering to identify the runoff generation groups in each catchment and among various landscape positions 2 4 soil moisture analyses the ams can be defined as the soil moisture storage in the top 1 meter of soil layer at the beginning of the rainfall runoff event the soil moisture storage was calculated from the volumetric water content using the following equation safeeq et al 2021 2 moisture s t o r a g e m m Œ∏ 10 0 20 Œ∏ 30 0 25 Œ∏ 60 0 3 Œ∏ 90 0 25 1000 Œ∏ 10 Œ∏ 30 Œ∏ 60 Œ∏ 90 represents volumetric water content at depths of 10 30 60 and 90 cm respectively and 1000 was multiplied in the above equation for converting m3 m3 to mm we also calculated the various components of soil moisture for all rainfall runoff events to understand the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture patterns the change in soil moisture Œ¥sm m3 m3 was computed for each event by subtracting the minimum soil moisture value from the maximum value the initial response time of each soil moisture location was used to calculate the vertical wetting front velocity and preferential flow occurrence initial response time was estimated as the time of commencement of soil moisture rise from the beginning of each event tymchak and torres 2007 singh et al 2021 to remove the noise we set the threshold of soil moisture rise to 0 001 m3 m3 which is the precision of the decagon 5tm soil moisture sensor resolution 0 0008 0 001 m3 m3 lin and zhou 2008 used the resolution of the cr 10x datalogger campbell scientific inc i e 0 002 m3 m3 as a threshold to identify the initial soil moisture response further the preferential flow was estimated using the order of initial response time lin and zhou 2008 wiekenkamp et al 2016 singh et al 2021 the preferential flow was identified when any soil moisture sensor from a greater depth showed an earlier response than the corresponding sensor at a shallower depth we estimated the preferential flow response and flagged it as 0 no response and 1 response for all the soil moisture measurement points the frequency of preferential flow occurrence was calculated by dividing the total number of flagged events by the total number of preferential flow events the rainfall and soil moisture characteristics were sorted into the preferential flow and non preferential flow groups and then the difference in the means were statistically tested using a t test to analyze the influence of hydro meteorological variables on preferential flows liu and lin 2015 the vertical wetting front velocity vwf mm h from ground surface to any particular soil layer were estimated as the ratio of soil moisture sensor depth to initial response time tymchak and torres 2007 singh et al 2021 vwf explains the speed at which rainwater reaches a particular soil layer 3 v wf depth of soil moisture sensor m m intial response time h 3 results 3 1 overview of rainfall runoff event characteristics we identified and analyzed 129 rainfall runoff events across p301 p303 and p300 catchments tables s1 s2 and s3 the total event rainfall varied between 5 05 mm and 255 4 mm coefficient of variation 1 37 whereas the peak hourly rainfall intensity ranged from 0 24 mm h to 16 26 mm h coefficient of variation 1 07 the event duration ranged from 21 h to 168 h the antecedent soil moisture storage ams for p301 p303 and p300 varied between 81 and 261 mm 92 to 324 mm and 91 to 298 mm respectively the highest value of rainfall triggered runoff coefficients rc defined as runoff divided by the rainfall were limited up to 18 12 and 14 in p301 p303 and p300 respectively further we have highlighted four different rainfall runoff events to illustrate the effect of different wetness conditions on the rainfall runoff relationships fig 2 table 1 these four events were selected from the 2011 water year as follows i at the beginning of the water year event 1 10 2 2010 ii at the beginning of the winter season event 2 12 14 2010 iii at the beginning of spring season event 3 3 16 2011 and iv during mid of summer event 4 6 28 2011 the drier soil moisture condition resulted in a lower rc and greater infiltration over the landscape which can be seen from the larger increase in soil moisture at all the depths fig 2 a 138 mm rainfall during the event 1 converted 1 08 0 28 and 0 89 rainfall into runoff in p301 p303 and p300 respectively the lower runoff conversion was associated with the lower ams condition table 1 further patterns in soil moisture profile showed no indication of preferential flow across the three catchments the lesser rainfall amount during the event 2 15 mm generated higher rc compared to the event 1 due to higher ams table 1 the rc during the event 2 was 3 32 in p301 2 11 in p303 and 3 72 in p300 for the corresponding ams of 241 mm 294 mm and 276 mm respectively further the subsurface flow was observed as the increase in soil moisture at deeper depths was higher than those at shallower depths fig 2 the variation in soil moisture between the different depths were quite small especially in p303 and p300 however in p303 and p300 soil moisture did not follow the expected trend with depth a 26 mm rainfall during the event 3 converted 10 35 7 87 and 10 11 rainfall into runoff in p301 p303 and p300 respectively this was primarily driven by the higher ams conditions across the three catchments we found soil moisture patterns during the event 3 very similar to those during the event 2 with higher water content at deeper depths in p303 and p300 in p303 average soil moisture at 90 cm depth during the event 0 366 m3 m3 was similar to the saturated water content Œ∏ s of 0 366 reported for coarse textured subsoil nemes et al 2001 at shallower depths the event average soil moisture was 0 288 0 311 and 0 34 m3 m3 at 10 30 and 60 cm depth respectively this subsurface saturation was only evident in p303 during the event 3 catchment storage decreased during the event 4 as the snowmelt season comes to an end however the catchment wetness during the event 4 was still maintained compared to fall event 1 due to prolonged snowmelt season thus the ams of 211 240 and 229 mm and rainfall of 38 mm during the event 4 resulted in runoff conversion of 5 56 3 79 and 5 46 in p301 p303 and p300 respectively soil moisture patterns remained similar to those in the previous two events but no sign of saturation 3 2 runoff thresholds the total event rainfall alone could not differentiate the runoff generation behavior fig 3 the relationship between rainfall and runoff is non linear with strong variability in the magnitude of runoff under similar rainfall events this weak correlation can also be verified through pearson s correlation coefficient r which is 0 48 0 26 and 0 64 in p301 p303 and p300 respectively similarly ams as the catchment wetness could not explain the catchment runoff fig 3b e and h the rainfall events occur across all the ranges of catchment wetness the high intensity events occurred in low ams conditions however in high ams conditions greater than200 mm the peak rainfall intensity is limited to 7 5 mm h it is visible that the 10 13 2009 event in p303 produced a significant amount of runoff rc 1 2 under a low ams 91 mm and high intensity rainfall 8 76 mm h conditions at the same time the 10 01 2010 event resulted in rc of 0 3 for a peak rainfall intensity of 16 26 mm h and ams of 99 mm in p303 further the peak rainfall intensity does not drive the catchment runoff as the saturated hydraulic conductivity of these catchments is very high bales et al 2011 the rc was separated into two groups more distinctly while using ams rainfall as a combined metrics of catchment wetness compared to ams or event rainfall individually fig 3c f and i for example the events on 10 01 2010 and 10 13 2009 in p303 discussed previously were separated more distinctly using ams rainfall as the catchment wetness these two events behaved differently i e the rc value of 10 01 2010 and 10 13 2009 events are 0 28 and 1 22 for high rainfall intensity and low ams conditions due to variation in rainfall depth but this variation was well explained by ams rainfall in p303 fig 3f we also used the k means clustering for defining the runoff thresholds and found that a significant amount of runoff rc 0 5 was generated when the ams rainfall is greater than 212 mm 238 mm 243 mm threshold values in p301 p303 and p300 respectively fig s1 rainfall runoff events were divided into two groups i e i group i when ams rainfall was less than the threshold and ii group ii when ams rainfall was greater than the threshold value table 2 the average ams of group i events was in the range of 110 134 mm whereas it was between 212 and 248 mm for group ii similarly the mean ams rainfall was in the range of 268 305 mm and 127 154 mm for group ii and group i events respectively the infiltration potential of p303 was higher than the p301 which was reflected in higher soil moisture storage and lower rc the runoff of these catchments was mainly driven by subsurface wetness however the rc of rainfall driven events was limited up to 15 in p303 and p300 and 18 in p301 catchment the difference in landscape wise variability in threshold was more prominent in p303 catchment due to larger difference in catchment storage between us and ls soil moisture locations fig 4 for p301 the runoff generation was triggered when the ams rainfall exceeded the value of 183 mm and 191 mm at the us and ls locations whereas the variation was 200 mm and 250 mm for p303 respectively the ams varied significantly among landscape positions in p303 wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 which is not true for p301 3 3 variability in soil moisture the occurrence of preferential flow estimated using initial response time varied in different catchments depths and slope positions table 3 fig 5 the preferential flow was observed in most of the rainfall events in p301 preferential flow occurred more frequently at lower slope ls 72 followed by upslope us 69 locations the incidence of preferential flow is more often at 90 cm depth of us and 60 cm depth of ls locations similarly in p303 the occurrence of preferential flow was 68 and 67 at us and ls locations respectively the highest preferential flow occurrence was at 90 cm 53 at us and 48 at ls compared to 60 cm and 30 cm depths the preferential flow was more frequent during the drought years 2012 2015 than those during the normal years 2010 2011 especially in p301 catchment which could have been caused by hydrophobicity fig s2 however for p303 the same phenomena were observed at depths of 30 and 90 cm at the us and 90 cm at ls locations we also noticed the control of catchment wetness in terms of ams and ams rainfall on preferential flow occurrence at most of the landscape locations of p301 and p303 table s6 the higher variability in the vertical wetting front velocity vwf was observed in different soil depth ranged from 1 5 mm h to 900 mm h fig 7 the mean vwf of p303 126 5 mm h was greater than the p301 76 75 mm h the highest value of mean vwf was observed at 90 cm depth at all landscape positions except for ls 60 cm in p301 overall the mean vwf at different landscape positions was significantly and directly associated with the soil depth i e 0 91 p 0 05 for p301 and 0 93 p 0 05 for p303 further we observed a significantly different wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 vertical pattern of vwf but no significantly different lateral pattern wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 was observed along the catchments 3 4 relationship between soil moisture and streamflow while looking into the relationship between soil moisture storage and streamflow fig 8 it can be inferred that the catchment discharge was low during dry soil moisture conditions and increased with an increase in catchment wetness a sharp rise in catchment discharge occurred when the soil moisture storage crossed the pre identified threshold value of 212 238 and 243 mm in p301 p303 and p300 catchments a significant correlation p 0 05 between 0 52 and 0 62 was observed between soil moisture storage and streamflow an increase in mean discharge from 3 2 to 34 l s 3 15 to 25 l s and 20 to 200 l s was observed due to a 106 mm 141 mm and 113 mm increase in mean soil moisture storage in p301 p303 and p300 respectively further we analyzed the variation in discharge and soil moisture for group ii threshold value and group i threshold value runoff generating events during drought years 2012 2015 and normal years 2010 2011 table 5 in group ii the mean discharge was reduced by 72 78 and 53 during drought years whereas 6 7 and 3 drop in soil moisture storage was recorded for p301 p303 and p300 respectively however the drop in soil moisture storage was higher for group i events than for group ii indicating that the dry period became drier than the wet period during the drought years 4 discussions 4 1 catchment wise variability in runoff thresholds event scale rainfall runoff and soil moisture analysis of three different mediterranean headwater forested catchments revealed that the runoff was primarily driven by catchment wetness i e ams rainfall depth rather than rainfall intensity fu et al 2013 zuecco et al 2019 the catchment wetness in terms of antecedent soil moisture storage ams could not segregate the runoff generation groups but the ams and rainfall depth together drive the runoff response the saturated hydraulic conductivity 10 210 mm h of these catchments is higher than the observed peak rainfall intensity 16 mm h which reduces the chance of infiltration excess runoff further saturation was not found in shallow soil layers but observed in deeper soil layers event 3 fig 2 which attributed to the absence of saturation excess runoff but the chances of subsurface runoff during rain events liu et al 2013 conducted endmember experiments in the krew and reported that the average contribution of subsurface flow to streamflow was 63 and 61 in p301 and p303 respectively further they stated that the subsurface flow and catchment discharge were highly correlated in the krew catchment similar observations are also found in the casper creek catchment of northern california where sand dominates the soil resulting in rapid infiltration and percolation of rainwater into the soil layers dymond et al 2021 the subsurface saturation triggered the subsurface flow of the catchment which is driven by the fill and spill mechanism tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 while comparing our results to other forested montane catchments we noticed that the threshold values are different for different catchments due to variations in the installation depth of soil moisture sensors soil properties catchment area and climatic conditions however the governing factors for various runoff generation processes are the same antecedent soil moisture storage and rainfall depth are two important controlling factors for runoff generation in sub surface and saturation excess runoff dominated catchments or hillslopes penna et al 2011 saffarpour et al 2016 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 stated precipitation depth 55 mm as the control of sub surface stormflow in a 10 ha hillslope of the panola mountain research watershed saffarpour et al 2016 observed control of ams 0 60 cm rainfall 250 mm on humid catchment stormflow which is dominated by saturation and sub surface flow similar observations were also reported by penna et al 2011 for alpine headwater catchments i e ams 0 30 cm above 45 triggered the streamflow and water table rise they also mentioned the control of rainfall intensity on hortonian overland flow which was also observed in lesser himalayan hillslopes of india sarkar et al 2015 nanda and sen 2021 catchment runoff was triggered when the ams rainfall was above 212 mm 238 mm and 250 mm in p301 1 km2 p303 1 3 km2 and p300 4 6 km2 respectively we also observed a clear threshold relationship between soil moisture storage and streamflow for all the catchments where the threshold value increased with an increase in the catchment area mcdonnell et al 2021 stated that the runoff threshold developed for larger scale might not be meaningful for the smaller scale due to variations in topography depth to bedrock catchment storage and soil properties the area average depth to bedrock is greater for p303 than p301 bales et al 2011 which supports the argument for the higher catchment storage capacity of p303 in p301 the depth to bedrock was greater than 75 cm at upslope us soil moisture location and surrounding areas however for p303 most of the catchment area is dominated by the deeper bedrock 75 cm and higher root density than p301 bales et al 2011 catchment having higher root density facilitates more infiltration and percolation and higher root water uptake in the system toohey et al 2018 and due to the same reason a higher runoff threshold was observed in p303 than in the p301 catchments in a nested catchment larger storage is attributed to a larger catchment area resulting in higher infiltration and percolation in larger catchments compared to smaller ones thus the catchment storage of p301 and p303 needed to be filled to generate streamflow at the outlet of p300 therefore the threshold value of p300 was higher than the p301 and p303 catchments we also observed the difference in mean discharge between group ii threshold value and group i threshold value during normal years 2010 11 and drought years 2012 15 the difference in mean discharge was higher during the normal water year i e 33 30 and 120 l s for p300 p301 and p300 respectively but the difference was 10 l s for p301 and p303 which was attributed to the dominance of baseflow during drought years the rainfall triggered runoff gradually decreased with the progression of drought years from 2012 to 2015 table s5 the decrease in runoff was associated with the gradual decrease in precipitation amount from 1020 mm 2012 to 558 mm 2015 4 2 spatial variability in runoff thresholds in the catchment scale fill and spill refers to filling several heterogeneous storage spaces to produce a significant amount of runoff at the outlet spence and woo 2003 and this heterogeneity increases with an increase in catchment size fig 4 we also observed the spatial heterogeneity in runoff generation thresholds at us and ls locations of p301 and p303 catchments fig 4 the difference in soil moisture storage at us and ls locations was clearly reflected in their runoff threshold values i e the threshold at the us threshold at ls further it was observed that the difference in threshold value between us and ls locations was larger for p303 50 mm than for p301 14 mm which was also reflected in their preferential flow frequencies table 3 the difference in ams between us and ls locations was statistically significant in p303 but not in p301 similar to the discussion of mcdonnell et al 2021 in the current study the subsurface flow might be initiated at us locations with lesser storage capacity and further spilled to ls locations to fill the storage and finally delivered to the catchment outlet this spatial variability in catchment scale soil moisture is mainly controlled by the aspect and slope position of the landscape mcmillan and srinivasan 2015 which directly influences the runoff generation thresholds however micro scale variability is mainly controlled soil hydraulic properties and surface resistance nanda et al 2019 many previous studies discussed storage variability and discharge relationship using hysteresis index at catchment haught and van meerveld 2011 pavlin et al 2021 and hillslope scale fovet et al 2015 scheliga et al 2018 further we observed more than 60 preferential flow frequency at all the landscape locations of p303 whereas the frequency was more than 50 for p301 similar to our observations vertical mcintosh et al n d and lateral preferential flow mcdonnell et al 1998 were observed in the subsurface flow dominated panola watershed liu et al 2013 also stated that the presence of preferential flow pathways in the shallow soil bedrock interface was a major route for subsurface flow in krew and these phenomena are consistent for the other mediterranean and humid catchments tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 graham and lin 2011 penna et al 2011 singh et al 2021 4 3 preferential flow pathways catchment wetness either in the form of soil moisture or precipitation influences the temporal variability of preferential flow occurrence tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 liu et al 2013 we observed significant control of ams rainfall on preferential flow occurrence in all the landscape positions table s6 rainfall depth and intensity did not significantly impact preferential flow occurrence in most landscape positions except for ls of p303 the same phenomena were observed for catchment runoff this highlighted the dependence of preferential flow and catchment runoff on catchment wetness similarly liu et al 2013 stated that the subsurface flow governed by the preferential flow pathways was activated during rainfall and snow melting events in krew catchments wiekenkamp et al 2016 stated that preferential flow increased with an increase in antecedent moisture conditions in their conceptual model but they did not observe any clear relationship among them in field conditions however singh et al 2021 revealed the role of higher antecedent soil moisture conditions in triggering the preferential flow at coweeta catchment north carolina usa they also observed a weak but significant relationship between rainfall depth and preferential flow wiekenkamp et al 2016 reported a positive effect of rainfall characteristics i e depth and intensity on preferential flow in the forested catchment for p301 and p303 except ls location the insignificant control of rainfall depth on preferential flow occurrence was apparent the rainfall depth did not entirely drive the preferential flow or the runoff of the subsurface flow dominated catchments further preferential flow occurrence was more consistent at us 90 and ls 60 cm depth in p301 and p303 catchments table 3 other studies also reported dominance of preferential flow occurrence at the specific horizon and in their interfaces during storms for a long period without any natural or artificial disturbances de rooij 2000 liu and lin 2015 singh et al 2021 we also revealed that the preferential flow was more frequent in drought years in comparison to normal water years fig s2 this phenomenon was more prominent in all soil depths and landscape positions in p301 drier than in p303 the infiltration pattern and hydraulic properties of the soil changed during drought years due to the formation of shrinkage cracks and soil water repellency this resulted in quick rainwater infiltration to the deeper soil horizon bypassing the upper soil horizon thus the preferential flow reported during drought years fig s2 occurred mainly through vertical pathways rather than lateral ways gimbel et al 2016 also reported similar observations and stated that water repellency was the reason for the finger flow in sandy soil during drought periods thus the influence of drought on infiltration patterns should be considered in hydrological models for realistic predictions of water balance components 4 4 soil moisture variability soil moisture variability analysis from 16 landscape positions and soil depths two slope positions two catchments four depths revealed that temporal variability in Œ¥sm was greater at deeper soil layers during rainfall events table 4 however the temporal variability in vertical wetting front velocity i e vwf did not show any consistent pattern along with the depth further we did not observe any clear trend in soil moisture response along the soil depth and this indicated the dominance of preferential flow pathways in these landscape positions table 4 singh et al 2021 soil properties govern the moisture distribution and its spatial heterogeneity due to variations in hydraulic properties soil depth and texture the soil moisture response indices were inconsistent along with the soil depth during different rainfall events figs 6 7 we observed positive and negative correlations between Œ¥sm and soil depth during multiple rainfall events due to subsurface flow thus soil moisture observation at a single depth especially in a subsurface flow dominated system may misinterpret the catchment scale soil moisture dynamic similarly while looking into different landscape positions we observed a significant difference in ams between us and ls locations wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 reflected in runoff threshold values many past studies also reported the linkage between spatial soil moisture variability and runoff generation processes at different scales blume and van meerveld 2015 van meerveld et al 2015 zuecco et al 2019 nanda et al 2019 nanda and sen 2021 the drier antecedent condition facilitated higher infiltration in various soil layers thus we observed higher mean Œ¥sm in near surface soil than in the deeper layers further singh et al 2021 stated that lower near surface soil bulk density indicates higher soil moisture storage at shallow depth than at deeper depth similarly as reported by bales et al 2011 the dry bulk density of p300 was extremely low at 15 cm depth 1 0 g cm 3 and increased with an increase in depth to 30 cm 1 25 1 35 g cm 3 and 60 cm 1 35 1 45 g cm 3 which reflected in the decrease in Œ¥sm along with the depth the shallow soil depth was more exposed to the atmospheric forcing thus the near surface soil pores were disconnected dry and non conducting compared to deeper soil this is attributed to the lower vertical wetting front velocity at the shallow soil layer rosenbaum et al 2012 demand et al 2019 singh et al 2021 while looking into rainfall characteristics larger rainfall depth yielded higher Œ¥sm response table s4 but no influence on wetting front velocity was observed these results expand our knowledge from previous research that attributed the influence of rainfall characteristics soil properties and antecedent moisture conditions on soil moisture penna et al 2011 nanda and sen 2021 singh et al 2021 the current study provides comprehensive results on runoff generation thresholds spatio temporal variability of preferential pathways and soil moisture indices in 16 different landscape positions and depths in three different mediterranean headwater catchments in southern sierra nevada california however we would like to highlight some of the limitations of the current study no soil moisture sensors were installed in the southern part of the p300 catchment this might have affected the runoff generation threshold value of p300 further for p303 the ls sensors were situated outside the catchment outlet but we used it as the surrogate for p303 ls soil moisture likewise for p301 ls soil moisture sensors were located near the stream at the upper part of the catchment fig 1 resulting in less soil moisture variability between us and ls soil moisture it could have captured broader spatial moisture variability if installed near the catchment outlet further we did not consider runoff due to snowmelt in the current study as the snow pillow was located only at the upper part of the catchment bales et al 2018 5 conclusions this study focused on runoff generation thresholds and spatio temporal variability of preferential flow soil moisture changes and vertical wetting front velocity in lateral and vertical directions during different rainfall events analyzing 129 rainfall runoff events we found that the catchment runoff triggered when the catchment wetness was above 212 mm 238 mm and 250 mm in p301 p303 and p300 respectively the spatial variation in runoff generation threshold was also observed between upslope us and lower slope ls landscape positions the runoff generation threshold was larger at ls due to its higher storage capacity than at the us location these catchments were dominated by subsurface flow runoff generation as we observed more than 60 frequency of preferential flow occurrence at us and ls locations of p301 and p303 the preferential flow was dominated at 60 cm and 90 cm depth at ls and us locations respectively further we observed a higher frequency of preferential flow during the drought period than the normal water years due to hydrophobicity furthermore we found higher variability of change in soil moisture at a deeper depth and no consistent pattern was observed at different landscape positions and catchments similarly a higher wetting front velocity was observed at deeper depth overall this study showed spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture indices and preferential flow in vertical and lateral directions this study will be useful for modelers trying to develop a more realistic hydrological model for headwater forested catchments considering the horizon of preferential flow pathways and runoff triggering thresholds credit authorship contribution statement aliva

1982,runoff generation thresholds and pathways are critical to understanding catchment scale hydrological processes the variability in catchment storage soil moisture dynamics and rainfall characteristics influence the spatial and temporal variability of runoff thresholds and pathways this study used six years of hourly hydro meteorological datasets of two independent p301 and p303 and one nested p300 headwater catchments located in the southern sierra nevada region of california usa to understand the spatial variability in runoff thresholds and runoff pathways further we identified the spatio temporal variability in preferential flow pathways changes in soil moisture and vertical wetting front velocity along with their controlling factors from the analysis of 129 rainfall runoff events it was found that the catchment runoff was activated when the catchment wetness i e storage plus rainfall was greater than 212 mm 238 mm and 250 mm in p301 p303 and p300 respectively the catchment storage was higher at the lower slope resulting in higher runoff thresholds compared to upslope locations inside p301 and p303 further we observed dominance of preferential flow 60 at 60 cm and 90 cm depth at the lower and upper slope locations respectively indicating a domination of subsurface runoff generation mechanism in these catchments the preferential flows were more frequent during the drought years 2012 2015 than those in the normal years 2010 2011 furthermore we observed higher vertical wetting front velocity at deeper depths but no consistent pattern was observed in the change in soil moisture along the soil profile this study will be useful for field hydrologists and modelers to design an experimental setup and to develop a more realistic hydrological model considering the spatio temporal variation in runoff thresholds and preferential flow pathways in forested montane headwater catchments of the mediterranean region keywords runoff thresholds preferential flow soil moisture headwater catchments rainfall runoff data availability we have shared the data link in the main manuscript under data availability section 1 introduction runoff generation processes are non linear as some amount of storage needs to be filled before the occurrence of runoff regardless of dominant flow pathways mcdonnell et al 2021 this non linearity is scale dependent which adds more complexity to our understanding of runoff processes for example small surface or sub surface depressions need to be filled before the triggering of runoff from plot and hillslope scales tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 whereas multiple storages need to be filled before the beginning of catchment scale runoff spence and woo 2003 for example subsurface runoff generated from an upslope location needs to fill the lower slope storage before reaching the catchment outlet mcdonnell et al 2021 another fill and spill example is from the canadian shield watershed where a series of segments with variable storage need to be filled until its storage thresholds for runoff is exceeded to start runoff at the valley spence and woo 2003 in other words runoff generation at any scale is reflected as a failure of system storage ward et al 2018 the infiltration excess or hortonian runoff takes place when rainfall intensity exceeds soil infiltration capacity horton 1933 the infiltration capacity tends to decrease as the system storage especially in soil layers starts filling accelerating the infiltration excess runoff process by establishing connectivity among landscapes nanda et al 2019 the subsurface runoff occurs due to rapid infiltration which triggers lateral subsurface flow after filling the subsurface storage hewlett and hibbert 1967 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 further in saturation excess runoff the system storage fails when saturation from the bottom of the soil layer reaches the surface layer to activate the runoff dunne and black 1970 overall the runoff initiation threshold depends on system storage normally explained by soil moisture storage and groundwater table fluctuations and rainfall characteristics sarkar et al 2015 saffarpour et al 2016 nanda and sen 2021 the runoff connectivity and thresholds are related to each other saffarpour et al 2016 nanda and sen 2021 the spatial variation in infiltration characteristics and antecedent moisture storage influence the runoff connectivity at the hillslope and catchment scale western et al 1998 nanda et al 2019 due to this spatial variability patch scale runoff is connected to a catchment outlet only above a particular soil moisture storage and rainfall thresholds penna et al 2011 nanda et al 2019 wang et al 2022 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 measured sub surface pipe and matrix flow threshold in the panola mountain research watershed and stated that rainfall depth greater than 55 mm during high soil moisture conditions could generate 1 mm pipe flow threshold analysis using the 50 years dataset of hj andrews experimental watershed showed that stormflow response was related to the inter storm period which is an indicator of antecedent soil moisture storage prior to the rainfall event graham et al 2010 studies conducted in the tarrawarra catchment in south eastern australia western et al 1998 and in an alpine headwater catchment in italian dolomites penna et al 2011 found a significant increase in the runoff after crossing certain soil moisture thresholds besides these specific studies the relationship between soil moisture thresholds and runoff has been widely investigated in various catchments mcnamara et al 2005 zehe et al 2005 radatz et al 2013 song and wang 2019 however many research findings stated that antecedent soil moisture storage alone could not explain the triggering point of catchment runoff generation detty and mcguire 2010 penna et al 2011 farrick and branfireun 2014 saffarpour et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 thus those studies used the antecedent soil moisture storage and rainfall depth as catchment wetness to explain catchment runoff characteristics scaife and band 2017 used 15 years of dataset from the coweeta hydrologic laboratory and showed that thresholds behavior is not solely determined by climate and catchment geophysical properties but it can also be governed by the seasonal and interannual response of forest evapotranspiration moreover the relationship between connectivity and thresholds is dependent on topographic location i e depth and slope positions of soil moisture measurements for example in the case if infiltration excess the shallow depth soil moisture sensors may show quick connectivity than the sensors at deeper depths similarly the slope positions i e upslope mid slope and lower slope of soil moisture sensors exhibit non linear behavior of thresholds due to variations in atmospheric forcing storage soil properties and vegetation cover many previous hillslope scale studies observed that spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture is influenced by precipitation vertical and lateral redistribution of water variation in soil hydraulic properties and preferential flow pathways tymchak and torres 2007 detty and mcguire 2010 nanda et al 2019 singh et al 2021 the runoff generation thresholds have been studied widely at hillslope scale tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 penna et al 2011 sarkar et al 2015 nanda and sen 2021 and at catchment scale mart√≠nez mena et al 1998 latron and gallart 2008 ali et al 2015 saffarpour et al 2016 gutierrez jurado et al 2021 under a wide range of climatic and geological conditions however only a few studies have been reported for granitic catchments fu et al 2013 studied threshold behavior of 1 km2 granitic catchment situated in southern china which has subtropical monsoon climate and weathered and fractured granitic underlying bedrock in a similar climatic zone katsuyama et al 2010 studied the relationship between stream water residence time and groundwater recharge discharge at a watershed 5 99 ha and a hillslope 0 024 ha scale the underlying bedrock of their studied location has characteristics of saprolite and is homogeneously weathered and permeable however no study on runoff generation thresholds has been reported in the granitic sierra nevada region of mediterranean climate experiencing wet and cold winters and dry and hot summers liu et al 2013 studied streamflow controls using endmember mixing analysis and observed the dominance of subsurface flow in the kings river experimental watersheds krew many studies have been carried out related to the spatial pattern of streamflow safeeq and hunsaker 2016 soil moisture oroza et al 2018 and sediment hunsaker and neary 2012 safeeq et al 2022 yang et al 2022 in the krew in the changing climatic conditions this region is more likely to experience a shift in precipitation regime from snow to rain affecting the dynamic of catchment runoff and streamflow safeeq and hunsaker 2016 hence a comprehensive study on runoff thresholds will be useful for comparing runoff generation processes and associated storage characteristics among various forested montane catchments of the sierra nevada understanding runoff generation thresholds are known to improve hydrological model calibration and validation as they simplify the complex behavior of catchment scale hydrological responses by categorizing them into similar response groups graham and mcdonnell 2010 ali et al 2015 in this study we investigated runoff generation thresholds and the spatial analysis of soil moisture indices i e wetting front velocities and initial response time in three different mediterranean catchments of the southern sierra nevada our goal was to answer the following research questions i how the soil moisture and rainfall influence the runoff thresholds in mediterranean headwater catchments ii how variable are these runoff thresholds within a catchment and iii how do soil moisture indices and preferential flow occurrence vary spatially and temporally 2 methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in the kings river experimental watershed krew located in the southern part of the sierra nevada california fig 1 the krew comprises ten headwater catchments grouped into two regions lower elevation 1782 1979 m above sea level providence and high elevation 2122 2373 m above sea level bull the current study selected three catchments p301 0 99 km2 p303 1 32 km2 and p300 4 6 km2 of providence catchment among these independent catchments p301 and p303 are nested within p300 fig 1 the mean catchment elevation slope of p301 p303 and p300 are 1979 m 19 1905 m 20 and 1883 m 21 respectively these catchments are covered with mixed coniferous forest 82 in p301 94 in p303 and 92 p300 predominantly sugar pine p lambertiana ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa incense cedar libocedrus decurrens and white fir abies concolor p301 is dominated by gerle cagwin soil whereas the dominance of shaver soil is found in p303 and p300 johnson et al 2011 the soil of this region is dominated by sandy and loamy sand textural classes having variation in saturated hydraulic conductivity from 1 to 21 cm h the dry bulk density at 15 cm 30 cm 60 cm and 90 cm soil depth was 1 0 g cm3 1 25 1 35 g cm3 and 1 35 1 45 g cm3 respectively bales et al 2011 the climate of the studied area is mediterranean with dry summer and cold winter the annual average daily temperature and precipitation of this region are in the range of 8 10 c and 1026 1234 mm respectively safeeq et al 2022 2 2 hydro meteorological data the catchments were instrumented with wireless based soil moisture sensor networks to capture the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture o geen et al 2018 the soil moisture was measured at 10 30 60 and 90 cm depths using echo tm meter group pullman wa usa sensor starting on 1 october 2009 we used upslope us and lower slope ls soil moisture locations of p301 and p303 catchments in our analysis fig 1 at p301 soil moisture sensors were installed in three clusters covering 23 nodes i e five sensors at us three at mid slope five at mid slope meadow six at ls and four at meadow boundary of ls locations we have used the cluster of five soil moisture sensors of the us and six sensors of the ls locations of p301 for this study fig 1 in p303 soil moisture was measured in two clusters 17 nodes at us and 10 nodes at ls locations at depths of 10 30 60 and 90 cm fig 1 the ls site was just outside the p303 outlet but we used it as a surrogate for the ls soil moisture for this catchment one large throat width 61 cm and one small throat width 7 6 cm fiberglass parshall flumes were used for measuring high and low streamflow at 15 min temporal frequency in p301 and p303 whereas a v notch weir was used at p300 for gauging stream discharge all the hydraulic structures were instrumented with the 730 air bubbler teledyne isco lincoln nebraska and submersible pressure transducers trimble water inc rochester ny usa either in the stilling well of small and large flumes respectively or directly in the stream for recording the stage more details about the hydro meteorological instrumentations can be found in o geen et al 2018 and safeeq and hunsaker 2016 we have used the hydro meteorological datasets for the water year wy 2010 2015 at an hourly temporal resolution for this analysis 2 3 event identification the precipitation discharge and temperature data were analyzed to identify rainfall runoff events the baseflow was separated from the hourly discharge time series using the recursive digital filter method eckhardt 2005 1 b t 1 bfi max Œ± b t 1 1 Œ± bfi max y t 1 Œ± bfi max the term bt and bt 1 stand for baseflow at timestep t and t 1 y t is the total streamflow at timestep t and bfimax and Œ± represents baseflow index i e baseflow streamflow and filter parameter respectively in the current study bfimax and Œ± are considered as 0 80 and 0 985 respectively the analysis was carried out in web based hydrograph analysis tool kyoung et al 2005 the baseflow was subtracted from the total discharge for quantifying the direct event runoff the following conditions were applied for identifying the rainfall runoff events i an event was identified as the beginning of the rainfall to the end of the runoff ii the beginning of the event was identified from the beginning of rainfall followed by starting of the runoff along with the no rain 6 h before commencement of the hydrological event iii total event rainfall must be greater than 5 mm hydraulic conductivity of these catchments is between 10 and 210 mm h so we decided 5 mm rainfall bar for the event selection iv the end of an event was defined as the end of runoff events with no further rainfall in the next 6 h v snowfall events were separated from rainfall events when the air temperature fell below 0 c for more than 40 of the total event duration the selected events were used to identify the runoff generation thresholds we plotted runoff characteristics i e runoff depth and runoff coefficient with multiple precipitation and storage characteristics i e rainfall depth peak rainfall intensity antecedent soil moisture storage ams and rainfall ams to identify the controlling factor of runoff generation the presence or absence of the runoff generation threshold was visually assessed we also used k means clustering to identify the runoff generation groups in each catchment and among various landscape positions 2 4 soil moisture analyses the ams can be defined as the soil moisture storage in the top 1 meter of soil layer at the beginning of the rainfall runoff event the soil moisture storage was calculated from the volumetric water content using the following equation safeeq et al 2021 2 moisture s t o r a g e m m Œ∏ 10 0 20 Œ∏ 30 0 25 Œ∏ 60 0 3 Œ∏ 90 0 25 1000 Œ∏ 10 Œ∏ 30 Œ∏ 60 Œ∏ 90 represents volumetric water content at depths of 10 30 60 and 90 cm respectively and 1000 was multiplied in the above equation for converting m3 m3 to mm we also calculated the various components of soil moisture for all rainfall runoff events to understand the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture patterns the change in soil moisture Œ¥sm m3 m3 was computed for each event by subtracting the minimum soil moisture value from the maximum value the initial response time of each soil moisture location was used to calculate the vertical wetting front velocity and preferential flow occurrence initial response time was estimated as the time of commencement of soil moisture rise from the beginning of each event tymchak and torres 2007 singh et al 2021 to remove the noise we set the threshold of soil moisture rise to 0 001 m3 m3 which is the precision of the decagon 5tm soil moisture sensor resolution 0 0008 0 001 m3 m3 lin and zhou 2008 used the resolution of the cr 10x datalogger campbell scientific inc i e 0 002 m3 m3 as a threshold to identify the initial soil moisture response further the preferential flow was estimated using the order of initial response time lin and zhou 2008 wiekenkamp et al 2016 singh et al 2021 the preferential flow was identified when any soil moisture sensor from a greater depth showed an earlier response than the corresponding sensor at a shallower depth we estimated the preferential flow response and flagged it as 0 no response and 1 response for all the soil moisture measurement points the frequency of preferential flow occurrence was calculated by dividing the total number of flagged events by the total number of preferential flow events the rainfall and soil moisture characteristics were sorted into the preferential flow and non preferential flow groups and then the difference in the means were statistically tested using a t test to analyze the influence of hydro meteorological variables on preferential flows liu and lin 2015 the vertical wetting front velocity vwf mm h from ground surface to any particular soil layer were estimated as the ratio of soil moisture sensor depth to initial response time tymchak and torres 2007 singh et al 2021 vwf explains the speed at which rainwater reaches a particular soil layer 3 v wf depth of soil moisture sensor m m intial response time h 3 results 3 1 overview of rainfall runoff event characteristics we identified and analyzed 129 rainfall runoff events across p301 p303 and p300 catchments tables s1 s2 and s3 the total event rainfall varied between 5 05 mm and 255 4 mm coefficient of variation 1 37 whereas the peak hourly rainfall intensity ranged from 0 24 mm h to 16 26 mm h coefficient of variation 1 07 the event duration ranged from 21 h to 168 h the antecedent soil moisture storage ams for p301 p303 and p300 varied between 81 and 261 mm 92 to 324 mm and 91 to 298 mm respectively the highest value of rainfall triggered runoff coefficients rc defined as runoff divided by the rainfall were limited up to 18 12 and 14 in p301 p303 and p300 respectively further we have highlighted four different rainfall runoff events to illustrate the effect of different wetness conditions on the rainfall runoff relationships fig 2 table 1 these four events were selected from the 2011 water year as follows i at the beginning of the water year event 1 10 2 2010 ii at the beginning of the winter season event 2 12 14 2010 iii at the beginning of spring season event 3 3 16 2011 and iv during mid of summer event 4 6 28 2011 the drier soil moisture condition resulted in a lower rc and greater infiltration over the landscape which can be seen from the larger increase in soil moisture at all the depths fig 2 a 138 mm rainfall during the event 1 converted 1 08 0 28 and 0 89 rainfall into runoff in p301 p303 and p300 respectively the lower runoff conversion was associated with the lower ams condition table 1 further patterns in soil moisture profile showed no indication of preferential flow across the three catchments the lesser rainfall amount during the event 2 15 mm generated higher rc compared to the event 1 due to higher ams table 1 the rc during the event 2 was 3 32 in p301 2 11 in p303 and 3 72 in p300 for the corresponding ams of 241 mm 294 mm and 276 mm respectively further the subsurface flow was observed as the increase in soil moisture at deeper depths was higher than those at shallower depths fig 2 the variation in soil moisture between the different depths were quite small especially in p303 and p300 however in p303 and p300 soil moisture did not follow the expected trend with depth a 26 mm rainfall during the event 3 converted 10 35 7 87 and 10 11 rainfall into runoff in p301 p303 and p300 respectively this was primarily driven by the higher ams conditions across the three catchments we found soil moisture patterns during the event 3 very similar to those during the event 2 with higher water content at deeper depths in p303 and p300 in p303 average soil moisture at 90 cm depth during the event 0 366 m3 m3 was similar to the saturated water content Œ∏ s of 0 366 reported for coarse textured subsoil nemes et al 2001 at shallower depths the event average soil moisture was 0 288 0 311 and 0 34 m3 m3 at 10 30 and 60 cm depth respectively this subsurface saturation was only evident in p303 during the event 3 catchment storage decreased during the event 4 as the snowmelt season comes to an end however the catchment wetness during the event 4 was still maintained compared to fall event 1 due to prolonged snowmelt season thus the ams of 211 240 and 229 mm and rainfall of 38 mm during the event 4 resulted in runoff conversion of 5 56 3 79 and 5 46 in p301 p303 and p300 respectively soil moisture patterns remained similar to those in the previous two events but no sign of saturation 3 2 runoff thresholds the total event rainfall alone could not differentiate the runoff generation behavior fig 3 the relationship between rainfall and runoff is non linear with strong variability in the magnitude of runoff under similar rainfall events this weak correlation can also be verified through pearson s correlation coefficient r which is 0 48 0 26 and 0 64 in p301 p303 and p300 respectively similarly ams as the catchment wetness could not explain the catchment runoff fig 3b e and h the rainfall events occur across all the ranges of catchment wetness the high intensity events occurred in low ams conditions however in high ams conditions greater than200 mm the peak rainfall intensity is limited to 7 5 mm h it is visible that the 10 13 2009 event in p303 produced a significant amount of runoff rc 1 2 under a low ams 91 mm and high intensity rainfall 8 76 mm h conditions at the same time the 10 01 2010 event resulted in rc of 0 3 for a peak rainfall intensity of 16 26 mm h and ams of 99 mm in p303 further the peak rainfall intensity does not drive the catchment runoff as the saturated hydraulic conductivity of these catchments is very high bales et al 2011 the rc was separated into two groups more distinctly while using ams rainfall as a combined metrics of catchment wetness compared to ams or event rainfall individually fig 3c f and i for example the events on 10 01 2010 and 10 13 2009 in p303 discussed previously were separated more distinctly using ams rainfall as the catchment wetness these two events behaved differently i e the rc value of 10 01 2010 and 10 13 2009 events are 0 28 and 1 22 for high rainfall intensity and low ams conditions due to variation in rainfall depth but this variation was well explained by ams rainfall in p303 fig 3f we also used the k means clustering for defining the runoff thresholds and found that a significant amount of runoff rc 0 5 was generated when the ams rainfall is greater than 212 mm 238 mm 243 mm threshold values in p301 p303 and p300 respectively fig s1 rainfall runoff events were divided into two groups i e i group i when ams rainfall was less than the threshold and ii group ii when ams rainfall was greater than the threshold value table 2 the average ams of group i events was in the range of 110 134 mm whereas it was between 212 and 248 mm for group ii similarly the mean ams rainfall was in the range of 268 305 mm and 127 154 mm for group ii and group i events respectively the infiltration potential of p303 was higher than the p301 which was reflected in higher soil moisture storage and lower rc the runoff of these catchments was mainly driven by subsurface wetness however the rc of rainfall driven events was limited up to 15 in p303 and p300 and 18 in p301 catchment the difference in landscape wise variability in threshold was more prominent in p303 catchment due to larger difference in catchment storage between us and ls soil moisture locations fig 4 for p301 the runoff generation was triggered when the ams rainfall exceeded the value of 183 mm and 191 mm at the us and ls locations whereas the variation was 200 mm and 250 mm for p303 respectively the ams varied significantly among landscape positions in p303 wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 which is not true for p301 3 3 variability in soil moisture the occurrence of preferential flow estimated using initial response time varied in different catchments depths and slope positions table 3 fig 5 the preferential flow was observed in most of the rainfall events in p301 preferential flow occurred more frequently at lower slope ls 72 followed by upslope us 69 locations the incidence of preferential flow is more often at 90 cm depth of us and 60 cm depth of ls locations similarly in p303 the occurrence of preferential flow was 68 and 67 at us and ls locations respectively the highest preferential flow occurrence was at 90 cm 53 at us and 48 at ls compared to 60 cm and 30 cm depths the preferential flow was more frequent during the drought years 2012 2015 than those during the normal years 2010 2011 especially in p301 catchment which could have been caused by hydrophobicity fig s2 however for p303 the same phenomena were observed at depths of 30 and 90 cm at the us and 90 cm at ls locations we also noticed the control of catchment wetness in terms of ams and ams rainfall on preferential flow occurrence at most of the landscape locations of p301 and p303 table s6 the higher variability in the vertical wetting front velocity vwf was observed in different soil depth ranged from 1 5 mm h to 900 mm h fig 7 the mean vwf of p303 126 5 mm h was greater than the p301 76 75 mm h the highest value of mean vwf was observed at 90 cm depth at all landscape positions except for ls 60 cm in p301 overall the mean vwf at different landscape positions was significantly and directly associated with the soil depth i e 0 91 p 0 05 for p301 and 0 93 p 0 05 for p303 further we observed a significantly different wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 vertical pattern of vwf but no significantly different lateral pattern wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 was observed along the catchments 3 4 relationship between soil moisture and streamflow while looking into the relationship between soil moisture storage and streamflow fig 8 it can be inferred that the catchment discharge was low during dry soil moisture conditions and increased with an increase in catchment wetness a sharp rise in catchment discharge occurred when the soil moisture storage crossed the pre identified threshold value of 212 238 and 243 mm in p301 p303 and p300 catchments a significant correlation p 0 05 between 0 52 and 0 62 was observed between soil moisture storage and streamflow an increase in mean discharge from 3 2 to 34 l s 3 15 to 25 l s and 20 to 200 l s was observed due to a 106 mm 141 mm and 113 mm increase in mean soil moisture storage in p301 p303 and p300 respectively further we analyzed the variation in discharge and soil moisture for group ii threshold value and group i threshold value runoff generating events during drought years 2012 2015 and normal years 2010 2011 table 5 in group ii the mean discharge was reduced by 72 78 and 53 during drought years whereas 6 7 and 3 drop in soil moisture storage was recorded for p301 p303 and p300 respectively however the drop in soil moisture storage was higher for group i events than for group ii indicating that the dry period became drier than the wet period during the drought years 4 discussions 4 1 catchment wise variability in runoff thresholds event scale rainfall runoff and soil moisture analysis of three different mediterranean headwater forested catchments revealed that the runoff was primarily driven by catchment wetness i e ams rainfall depth rather than rainfall intensity fu et al 2013 zuecco et al 2019 the catchment wetness in terms of antecedent soil moisture storage ams could not segregate the runoff generation groups but the ams and rainfall depth together drive the runoff response the saturated hydraulic conductivity 10 210 mm h of these catchments is higher than the observed peak rainfall intensity 16 mm h which reduces the chance of infiltration excess runoff further saturation was not found in shallow soil layers but observed in deeper soil layers event 3 fig 2 which attributed to the absence of saturation excess runoff but the chances of subsurface runoff during rain events liu et al 2013 conducted endmember experiments in the krew and reported that the average contribution of subsurface flow to streamflow was 63 and 61 in p301 and p303 respectively further they stated that the subsurface flow and catchment discharge were highly correlated in the krew catchment similar observations are also found in the casper creek catchment of northern california where sand dominates the soil resulting in rapid infiltration and percolation of rainwater into the soil layers dymond et al 2021 the subsurface saturation triggered the subsurface flow of the catchment which is driven by the fill and spill mechanism tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 while comparing our results to other forested montane catchments we noticed that the threshold values are different for different catchments due to variations in the installation depth of soil moisture sensors soil properties catchment area and climatic conditions however the governing factors for various runoff generation processes are the same antecedent soil moisture storage and rainfall depth are two important controlling factors for runoff generation in sub surface and saturation excess runoff dominated catchments or hillslopes penna et al 2011 saffarpour et al 2016 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 stated precipitation depth 55 mm as the control of sub surface stormflow in a 10 ha hillslope of the panola mountain research watershed saffarpour et al 2016 observed control of ams 0 60 cm rainfall 250 mm on humid catchment stormflow which is dominated by saturation and sub surface flow similar observations were also reported by penna et al 2011 for alpine headwater catchments i e ams 0 30 cm above 45 triggered the streamflow and water table rise they also mentioned the control of rainfall intensity on hortonian overland flow which was also observed in lesser himalayan hillslopes of india sarkar et al 2015 nanda and sen 2021 catchment runoff was triggered when the ams rainfall was above 212 mm 238 mm and 250 mm in p301 1 km2 p303 1 3 km2 and p300 4 6 km2 respectively we also observed a clear threshold relationship between soil moisture storage and streamflow for all the catchments where the threshold value increased with an increase in the catchment area mcdonnell et al 2021 stated that the runoff threshold developed for larger scale might not be meaningful for the smaller scale due to variations in topography depth to bedrock catchment storage and soil properties the area average depth to bedrock is greater for p303 than p301 bales et al 2011 which supports the argument for the higher catchment storage capacity of p303 in p301 the depth to bedrock was greater than 75 cm at upslope us soil moisture location and surrounding areas however for p303 most of the catchment area is dominated by the deeper bedrock 75 cm and higher root density than p301 bales et al 2011 catchment having higher root density facilitates more infiltration and percolation and higher root water uptake in the system toohey et al 2018 and due to the same reason a higher runoff threshold was observed in p303 than in the p301 catchments in a nested catchment larger storage is attributed to a larger catchment area resulting in higher infiltration and percolation in larger catchments compared to smaller ones thus the catchment storage of p301 and p303 needed to be filled to generate streamflow at the outlet of p300 therefore the threshold value of p300 was higher than the p301 and p303 catchments we also observed the difference in mean discharge between group ii threshold value and group i threshold value during normal years 2010 11 and drought years 2012 15 the difference in mean discharge was higher during the normal water year i e 33 30 and 120 l s for p300 p301 and p300 respectively but the difference was 10 l s for p301 and p303 which was attributed to the dominance of baseflow during drought years the rainfall triggered runoff gradually decreased with the progression of drought years from 2012 to 2015 table s5 the decrease in runoff was associated with the gradual decrease in precipitation amount from 1020 mm 2012 to 558 mm 2015 4 2 spatial variability in runoff thresholds in the catchment scale fill and spill refers to filling several heterogeneous storage spaces to produce a significant amount of runoff at the outlet spence and woo 2003 and this heterogeneity increases with an increase in catchment size fig 4 we also observed the spatial heterogeneity in runoff generation thresholds at us and ls locations of p301 and p303 catchments fig 4 the difference in soil moisture storage at us and ls locations was clearly reflected in their runoff threshold values i e the threshold at the us threshold at ls further it was observed that the difference in threshold value between us and ls locations was larger for p303 50 mm than for p301 14 mm which was also reflected in their preferential flow frequencies table 3 the difference in ams between us and ls locations was statistically significant in p303 but not in p301 similar to the discussion of mcdonnell et al 2021 in the current study the subsurface flow might be initiated at us locations with lesser storage capacity and further spilled to ls locations to fill the storage and finally delivered to the catchment outlet this spatial variability in catchment scale soil moisture is mainly controlled by the aspect and slope position of the landscape mcmillan and srinivasan 2015 which directly influences the runoff generation thresholds however micro scale variability is mainly controlled soil hydraulic properties and surface resistance nanda et al 2019 many previous studies discussed storage variability and discharge relationship using hysteresis index at catchment haught and van meerveld 2011 pavlin et al 2021 and hillslope scale fovet et al 2015 scheliga et al 2018 further we observed more than 60 preferential flow frequency at all the landscape locations of p303 whereas the frequency was more than 50 for p301 similar to our observations vertical mcintosh et al n d and lateral preferential flow mcdonnell et al 1998 were observed in the subsurface flow dominated panola watershed liu et al 2013 also stated that the presence of preferential flow pathways in the shallow soil bedrock interface was a major route for subsurface flow in krew and these phenomena are consistent for the other mediterranean and humid catchments tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 graham and lin 2011 penna et al 2011 singh et al 2021 4 3 preferential flow pathways catchment wetness either in the form of soil moisture or precipitation influences the temporal variability of preferential flow occurrence tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 liu et al 2013 we observed significant control of ams rainfall on preferential flow occurrence in all the landscape positions table s6 rainfall depth and intensity did not significantly impact preferential flow occurrence in most landscape positions except for ls of p303 the same phenomena were observed for catchment runoff this highlighted the dependence of preferential flow and catchment runoff on catchment wetness similarly liu et al 2013 stated that the subsurface flow governed by the preferential flow pathways was activated during rainfall and snow melting events in krew catchments wiekenkamp et al 2016 stated that preferential flow increased with an increase in antecedent moisture conditions in their conceptual model but they did not observe any clear relationship among them in field conditions however singh et al 2021 revealed the role of higher antecedent soil moisture conditions in triggering the preferential flow at coweeta catchment north carolina usa they also observed a weak but significant relationship between rainfall depth and preferential flow wiekenkamp et al 2016 reported a positive effect of rainfall characteristics i e depth and intensity on preferential flow in the forested catchment for p301 and p303 except ls location the insignificant control of rainfall depth on preferential flow occurrence was apparent the rainfall depth did not entirely drive the preferential flow or the runoff of the subsurface flow dominated catchments further preferential flow occurrence was more consistent at us 90 and ls 60 cm depth in p301 and p303 catchments table 3 other studies also reported dominance of preferential flow occurrence at the specific horizon and in their interfaces during storms for a long period without any natural or artificial disturbances de rooij 2000 liu and lin 2015 singh et al 2021 we also revealed that the preferential flow was more frequent in drought years in comparison to normal water years fig s2 this phenomenon was more prominent in all soil depths and landscape positions in p301 drier than in p303 the infiltration pattern and hydraulic properties of the soil changed during drought years due to the formation of shrinkage cracks and soil water repellency this resulted in quick rainwater infiltration to the deeper soil horizon bypassing the upper soil horizon thus the preferential flow reported during drought years fig s2 occurred mainly through vertical pathways rather than lateral ways gimbel et al 2016 also reported similar observations and stated that water repellency was the reason for the finger flow in sandy soil during drought periods thus the influence of drought on infiltration patterns should be considered in hydrological models for realistic predictions of water balance components 4 4 soil moisture variability soil moisture variability analysis from 16 landscape positions and soil depths two slope positions two catchments four depths revealed that temporal variability in Œ¥sm was greater at deeper soil layers during rainfall events table 4 however the temporal variability in vertical wetting front velocity i e vwf did not show any consistent pattern along with the depth further we did not observe any clear trend in soil moisture response along the soil depth and this indicated the dominance of preferential flow pathways in these landscape positions table 4 singh et al 2021 soil properties govern the moisture distribution and its spatial heterogeneity due to variations in hydraulic properties soil depth and texture the soil moisture response indices were inconsistent along with the soil depth during different rainfall events figs 6 7 we observed positive and negative correlations between Œ¥sm and soil depth during multiple rainfall events due to subsurface flow thus soil moisture observation at a single depth especially in a subsurface flow dominated system may misinterpret the catchment scale soil moisture dynamic similarly while looking into different landscape positions we observed a significant difference in ams between us and ls locations wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 reflected in runoff threshold values many past studies also reported the linkage between spatial soil moisture variability and runoff generation processes at different scales blume and van meerveld 2015 van meerveld et al 2015 zuecco et al 2019 nanda et al 2019 nanda and sen 2021 the drier antecedent condition facilitated higher infiltration in various soil layers thus we observed higher mean Œ¥sm in near surface soil than in the deeper layers further singh et al 2021 stated that lower near surface soil bulk density indicates higher soil moisture storage at shallow depth than at deeper depth similarly as reported by bales et al 2011 the dry bulk density of p300 was extremely low at 15 cm depth 1 0 g cm 3 and increased with an increase in depth to 30 cm 1 25 1 35 g cm 3 and 60 cm 1 35 1 45 g cm 3 which reflected in the decrease in Œ¥sm along with the depth the shallow soil depth was more exposed to the atmospheric forcing thus the near surface soil pores were disconnected dry and non conducting compared to deeper soil this is attributed to the lower vertical wetting front velocity at the shallow soil layer rosenbaum et al 2012 demand et al 2019 singh et al 2021 while looking into rainfall characteristics larger rainfall depth yielded higher Œ¥sm response table s4 but no influence on wetting front velocity was observed these results expand our knowledge from previous research that attributed the influence of rainfall characteristics soil properties and antecedent moisture conditions on soil moisture penna et al 2011 nanda and sen 2021 singh et al 2021 the current study provides comprehensive results on runoff generation thresholds spatio temporal variability of preferential pathways and soil moisture indices in 16 different landscape positions and depths in three different mediterranean headwater catchments in southern sierra nevada california however we would like to highlight some of the limitations of the current study no soil moisture sensors were installed in the southern part of the p300 catchment this might have affected the runoff generation threshold value of p300 further for p303 the ls sensors were situated outside the catchment outlet but we used it as the surrogate for p303 ls soil moisture likewise for p301 ls soil moisture sensors were located near the stream at the upper part of the catchment fig 1 resulting in less soil moisture variability between us and ls soil moisture it could have captured broader spatial moisture variability if installed near the catchment outlet further we did not consider runoff due to snowmelt in the current study as the snow pillow was located only at the upper part of the catchment bales et al 2018 5 conclusions this study focused on runoff generation thresholds and spatio temporal variability of preferential flow soil moisture changes and vertical wetting front velocity in lateral and vertical directions during different rainfall events analyzing 129 rainfall runoff events we found that the catchment runoff triggered when the catchment wetness was above 212 mm 238 mm and 250 mm in p301 p303 and p300 respectively the spatial variation in runoff generation threshold was also observed between upslope us and lower slope ls landscape positions the runoff generation threshold was larger at ls due to its higher storage capacity than at the us location these catchments were dominated by subsurface flow runoff generation as we observed more than 60 frequency of preferential flow occurrence at us and ls locations of p301 and p303 the preferential flow was dominated at 60 cm and 90 cm depth at ls and us locations respectively further we observed a higher frequency of preferential flow during the drought period than the normal water years due to hydrophobicity furthermore we found higher variability of change in soil moisture at a deeper depth and no consistent pattern was observed at different landscape positions and catchments similarly a higher wetting front velocity was observed at deeper depth overall this study showed spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture indices and preferential flow in vertical and lateral directions this study will be useful for modelers trying to develop a more realistic hydrological model for headwater forested catchments considering the horizon of preferential flow pathways and runoff triggering thresholds credit authorship contribution statement aliva

1983,climate change and urbanization play critical roles in compounding future flood risk due to their adverse impacts on the rainfall regime and sea level rise although past studies have predicted the spatiotemporal variations in flood risk these have appreciable limitations viz i flood risk is predicted mainly by accounting for one driver at a time either ocean flooding or fluvial flooding and ii monetization of flood damage due to future flooding had not been investigated however multiple drivers could lead to flooding in coastal areas this study presents an innovative approach for investigating the cumulative effects of urbanization changes to the rainfall regime and sea level rise on consequential flood damage in a coastal urban area a comprehensive flood damage and hazard prediction model was developed by integrating 1d 2d aspects of mike flood and gis technology to assess the flood scenarios for 2040 2070 and 2100 by investigating three predictor variables urbanization rainfall regime and sea level rise the factorial design approach was used to construct a total of 27 future flood scenarios time horizons of 30 years provided for effectively capturing climate change and its influence on the hydrologic regime the generalized linear model glm was applied to create a statistical model based on future scenarios for each time horizon results confirmed that changes to the rainfall regime significantly influence the average annual damage aad caused by flooding for all time horizons at the same time the significance of the effects of urbanization and sea level rise was found to vary the model predicts that by 2040 urbanization would exacerbate aad with a significant contribution from sea level rise in contrast sea level rise would provide a marginally greater and more significant contribution to aad compared to urbanization in 2040 and 2070 compared to the base year 2017 aad was 78 197 and 351 higher in 2040 2070 and 2100 respectively the proposed flood damage prediction model developed can guide modelers and decision makers in assessing the compounding flood damage for future flood management in any geographic location keywords climate change flood damage urban flooding urbanization sea level rise data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the main cause of flooding in urban areas is rainfall which affects people and property in the form of pluvial and fluvial flooding fluvial flooding occurs when high water levels in river channels exceed bank heights while pluvial flooding occurs when the intensity of rainfall exceeds the infiltration capacity urban areas can be severely damaged by both pluvial and fluvial floods although in different ways tanaka et al 2020 urban regions are at risk of pluvial floods because a significant fraction of the land is converted to impervious surfaces that prevent infiltration netzel et al 2021 thrys√∏e et al 2021 lee and kim 2018 the effects of fluvial flooding have been investigated in numerous past studies there are however only a limited number of studies that have focused on the evaluation of damage due to combined pluvial and fluvial flooding reasons include the need for high resolution data the number of stakeholders involved in assessing pluvial floods the complexity of flooding processes in urban settings and the issues associated with the flood source muthusamy et al 2019 past studies report that worldwide flood disasters from 1900 to 2013 have caused around seven million deaths and a monetary loss of about us 600 billion disaster profiles 2013 dong 2006 quantifying the relationships between extreme precipitation and flood hazards in the pearl river basin found that extreme precipitation exerts a significant influence on the spatiotemporal distribution of floods the reduction in infiltration translates to an increase in surface runoff and flood peak huong pathirana 2013 blair et al 2014 climate change will result in radical modifications to the hydrological cycle leading to variations in temperature and moisture wind shear and atmospheric instability which may cause severe storm surges and coastal floods ipcc 2014 trenberth 2011 noted that future temperature increases could alter the natural water cycle and atmospheric moisture content leading to changes in rainfall characteristics the changes to rainfall characteristics are expected to result in more frequent extreme rainfall events which in turn are expected to increase the frequency of occurrence and severity of inland flooding kvoƒçka et al 2018 chen and zhang 2021 especially in coastal urban areas the sea level rise would exacerbate the flooding caused by inland rainfall chowdhury et al 2020 kopp et al 2021 coastal floods in urban regions have the potential to cause enormous economic impacts and in the past have resulted in the loss of lives in many parts of the world zheng et al 2014 bevacqua et al 2019 mac√≠as tapia et al 2021 in the case of flooding sea level rise as a result of climate change acts as a magnifying factor by restricting streamflow discharge into the ocean balica et al 2012 such a scenario will aggravate flood risk and the consequential flood damage in coastal areas nicholls cazenave 2010 without appropriate flood prevention planning an annual flood damage loss of about 0 3 to 9 3 of the global gross domestic product is expected by 2100 hinkel et al 2014 sea level rise slr is expected to increase to 1 m or greater considering the trends in anthropogenic activities and greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2100 rahmstorf 2007 kopp et al 2014 physically slr will increase the height of storm tides reduce pressure gradients essential for transporting fluvial water to the ocean and enable more significant upstream tide wave propagation guo et al 2015 hoitink and jay 2016 loftis et al 2019 consequently flood risk assessment of coastal urban regions is critical the significance of this finding needs to be viewed by the fact that 37 of the global population as of 2017 live in coastal communities un 2017 this further highlights the need to assess flood damage as a consequence of multiple drivers such as sea level rise slr extreme rainfall events and land use change chen et al 2021 thrys√∏e et al 2021 in turn flood damage assessment is essential as it can enhance decision making in relation to flood risk assessment for the formulation of effective strategies for damage reduction and or flood mitigation by broadening the awareness of catchment management authorities and enhancing the well being of flood vulnerable communities computational flood models used for simulating the extent of flooding depth duration and flow velocity have been of paramount importance for determining flood associated damages usually these are applied to investigate a range of city development scenarios and climate parameters for developing a strategic plan to implement appropriate adaptation measures this requires the incorporation of uncertain future conditions including their possible consequences and resulting damages in order to design flood risk mitigation measures in a timely and effective manner apel et al 2004 jamali et al 2018 in scotland a grid to grid hydrological flood forecasting model has been developed using 24 hour collective rainfall predictions and static flood risk maps speight et al 2016 by segmenting the drainage region into smaller areas and employing flood volumes and damage data lee and kim 2018 created a multi dimensional flood damage assessment technique recently flood modellers have explored a combination of 1d 2d hydrodynamic models to simulate the drainage network as well as overall flow swmm or mouse jamali et al 2018 sobek deltares 2017 and xpswmm xpsolutions 2017 are some of the commercially available models used for elaborately simulating flood characteristics these models involve intensive computations and are sometimes subjected to numerical instability lhomme et al 2006 leandro and martins 2016 considering this fact 1d 2d flood models which demand large computational details and time need some modification teng et al 2017 as the high computational time makes the model unsuitable for application in large regions which require multiple simulations and scenario assessment the application process of conventional 1d 2d models is often complex as it needs a significant amount of training and optimization and the flood prediction intervals are quite large and unsuitable for realistically estimating flood damages li et al 2017 the complexity of flood damage assessment is commonly exacerbated due to the involvement of multiple factors including flood depth flow velocity flood duration lead time for flood warning and the built environment characteristics merz et al 2010 jamali et al 2018 the complexity also arises from a large number of drivers the training and optimization involved and a large number of time steps which leads to high computation time thus it is challenging for practitioners to estimate flood damage in the targeted catchment future flood risks and associated flood damages are expected to be strongly influenced by the increase in urbanization and climate change driven changes to rainfall characteristics and sea level rise jamali et al 2018 chen et al 2021 flood damage occurrence and extent vary across different regions due to the characteristics of the catchment such as land use past researchers such as miller and hutchins 2017 semadeni davies et al 2008 gu et al 2011 and huong and pathirana 2013 have attempted to create methodology focused on determining flood damage by considering urbanization and climate change impacts on flooding these models are not appropriate for single drainage basins as they use long term rainfall data and a single drainage basin requires rainfall data on a per min per hr scale also little is known about the integrated and simultaneous influence of future changes to rainfall urbanization and sea level rise on urban flood damage costs mahmoud and gan 2018 zhou et al 2019 therefore it is crucial to statistically estimate future flood damage based on rainfall urbanization and sea level rise practitioners require comprehensive and simplified flood damage assessment models that include 1d 2d model components and use rainfall data at a lower scale per min and can be applied across various drainage basins this study combines climatic and urbanization trends to present a novel modelling framework for estimating future flood damage costs in coastal urban regions the study s objectives were 1 to develop a rational approach to assess the impacts of rainfall depth sea level rise and urbanization on floods for the years 2040 2070 and 2100 under different climate change scenarios and representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 and 2 to assess future flood damage costs under the compounding effects of predicted changes to rainfall depth sea level rise and urbanization the study outcomes are expected to contribute to creating new knowledge on the impacts of climate change and can guide the development of future flood mitigation strategies to enhance resilience to climate change the methodology proposed in this study is generic and can be applied to any area irrespective of the geographic location 2 methods 2 1 study area and data musgrave catchment located within the larger loders creek catchment in the gold coast australia fig 1 was selected as the study area for this research study the focus of the study was to assess the flood damage to residential buildings caused by the combination of climate change sea level rise and urbanization the relatively densely populated coastal residential region 1 82 km2 has predominantly flat terrain with the downstream part of the catchment prone to frequent floods further the flood risks are aggravated due to the augmented tidal flow effect on the coastal urban area therefore the selected catchment was eminently suitable for this study based on the city of gold coast planning scheme city of gold coast 2017 the urbanized areas in the gold coast are projected to increase to 88 by 2100 in comparison to the current land use 74 a detailed comparison between current and future land use is provided in table s1 the study considers three future time horizons 2040 2070 and 2100 with 2017 as the base year these future time horizons are in accordance with the future scenarios proposed by ipcc 2014 also the 30 year gap selected between the future time horizons is adequate to capture significant changes in the climate hulme et al 1999 moen fredman 2007 2 2 future scenarios the ipcc s rcp8 5 scenario was selected for this study to simulate the maximum possible impact of rainfall and sea level rise on flooding riahi et al 2011 rcp8 5 represents a situation where no viable policy is in force to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions van vuuren et al 2011 the lower and upper values of rcp8 5 for the selected years were considered as boundaries for the changes in rainfall depth ipcc 2014 temperature rises were assumed to increase rainfall depth the study used climate futures tool a software that runs several advanced climate simulations based on various scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions the climate futures tool s projection of the future temperature provides the percentage value of the increased rainfall depth clarke et al 2011 whetton et al 2012 the tool can be used to derive detailed temperature change forecasts which can then be converted to changes in future rainfall magnitude using the techniques advised by engineers australia ea according to ea 2016 the amount of rainfall should rise by 5 for every 1 0c rise in temperature the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 both of which are included in the ipcc s fifth assessment report ipcc 2014 are used by the climate futures tool this tool was used to generate the mean temperature and standard deviation for the temperature boundaries to produce random numbers high medium and low temperatures were defined accordingly the mean temperature plus the standard deviation yielded high boundaries medium limits were taken as the mean temperatures finally subtracting the standard deviation from the mean temperature yielded the lower bounds accordingly these temperature boundaries were transformed into rainfall depth based on ea 2016 advice as noted above between these rainfall boundaries random numbers were created to ensure equal rainfall probability random numbers were assumed to be evenly distributed the boundaries for sea level rise were also selected based on the lower and upper values of the predicted sea level rise using rcp8 5 for the given time period for each timeframe it was assumed that the sea level would remain steady throughout the flood simulation for assessing the national sea level rise 16 sea level gauging stations have been established along the coastline around australia fig 2 these gauges are equipped with a continuous tide gauge recorder which continuously monitors the sea level the sea level rise for australia s coastal areas at the 16 tides gauging stations has been projected by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro and bureau of meteorology bom 2007 based on ipcc s rcp scenarios the closest sea level gauging station to the musgrave avenue sub catchment is the newcastle station at this station csiro and bom 2015 have projected a range of sea level rise data for the years 2030 2040 2070 and 2090 accordingly the sea level rise for the current research study was based on this existing projection the projection from csiro and bom 2015 at the newcastle gauging station was plotted and polynomial regression procedures were used to extract the high medium and low sea level rise data for each scenario timeframe the urban development in the musgrave catchment was obtained by comparing the current land cover from google earth 2017 and the future land cover obtained from the city of gold coast planning scheme city of gold coast 2017 as per the city of gold coast planning scheme the maximum possible limit for land cover changes has been fixed a maximum of 13 9 of the city area is allowed to be changed to urban land since this change can be perceived within any time range the boundaries for urbanization were considered same for each time horizon i e 0 and 13 9 2 3 mike flood model mike flood model is a combination of mike 21 mike urban and mike 11 models the water level at loders creek and broadwater the ocean outfall was regarded as the model upstream and downstream boundaries respectively fig 3 in order to determine the initial upstream water level of loders creek the flood hydrograph developed by the gold coast natural hazards planning and environment division gcnhped 2016b using the unified river basin simulator urbs model was employed further the downstream boundary was limited based on the mean sea level of broadwater the ocean outfall as the baseline to predict the future sea level rise the mean sea level was used as it is expected to rise in the future for the different climate change scenarios nicholls cazenave 2010 ipcc 2014 additionally the rise in sea level will act as a barrier preventing the discharge of floodwater into the ocean the mike 21 setup consisted of the following parameters topography using a 2 2 m grid surface roughness using manning s equation infiltration rate to represent the change in land use and initial water surface elevation in loders creek mike urban was used to determine the flood extent and flood inundation in the designed stormwater drainage network in the musgrave catchment to correctly replicate the current stormwater network all of the existing conduits inlets and outlets gcnhped 2016a were input into mike urban fig 3 mike 11 was applied to model the streamflow in the open channels close to the bridges at musgrave avenue and gold coast highway in loders creek the mike flood model uses the design hourly rainfall as an input to mike 21 the design rainfall was determined by calculating the rainfall over the catchment area using thiessen polygon method for three stations namely biggera sea air and loder rainfall stations fig 3 thiessen polygon method is best suited for regions with sparse and irregularly distributed rain gauges appropriate with the topography of musgrave avenue sub catchment as it can more accurately account for fluctuations in precipitation over the area of interest if the rainfall is widely distributed and the shape of the region is complex other techniques like the isohyetal method work best in locations with uniform precipitation patterns and fairly regular shapes chowdhury et al 2016 further the rainfall was converted to runoff using an initial loss continuous loss il cl model to simulate the overland flow the initial assumption of il and cl prior to the calibration was based on the design loss value recommended in ea 2016 a range of different land uses was used in this research study including road pavement which was assumed to have no infiltration il cl 0 open space il 42 mm hr and cl 3 9 mm hr and community facilities high density residential low density residential medium density residential neighbourhood centre special purpose and sport and recreation il 12 6 mm hr and cl 1 17 mm hr this assumption means that the il and cl values for open space represent 30 of the total area some part of the runoff is taken up by the mike urban drainage network at the inlet node and discharges runoff into open channels in mike 21 while mike 11 calculated the water flow through the bridges more details about mike flood are provided by jamali et al 2018 in this study 1d and 2d components of mike flood model were used for musgrave catchment which had previously been calibrated and validated using historical rainfall and flood data of two flood events 1 flood caused by the heaviest june daily rainfall since 1967 bom 2007 on 28 june 2005 and 2 flood event on 2 january 2008 the validation was undertaken using a shorter period of the flood event on 2 january 2008 as the cross section modelled in mike 11 solely discharges to the receiving water without any stoppage the calibration was started by only changing the parameters in mike urban and mike 21 the procedures involved simulating the water level with mike flood and comparing the output to the actual water level as measured by the loders creek stream flow gauge since the historical data from gcnhped 2016a only displayed the water levels the comparison was based on that level the calibration process parameters were manually changed the simulated result and the observed hydrograph s flood peak and time to peak were compared consequently the validation process was carried out to ensure the accuracy of the calibrated model according to fig 4 the water level caused by the mike flood on 28 june 2005 resembles the measured water level in shape the rmse and cd values were 3 11 and 0 75 respectively as such the mike flood s calibration was deemed to be adequate when the simulated and observed hydrograph on 2 january 2008 climbs to its apex fig s4 displays a similar pattern and 1 18 and 0 44 respectively are the cd and rmse values the calibrated mike flood was validated generally with positive outcomes 2 4 flood damage hazard and vulnerability are the two measures which can be used to assess flood damage wang et al 2011 where hazard measures the frequency and severity of the flood event and vulnerability is related to the number of assets and people affected by the flood haynes et al 2008 monetary loss due to flood damage was estimated based on three factors viz i flood depth in each asset at risk ii the number of assets at risk and iii depth damage curve apel et al 2004 ballesteros c√°novas et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 a depth damage curve fig s1 developed by mason et al 2012 for eastern australia was utilized in this study to assess the flood damage as illustrated in fig 5 hazard generation was supported by flood heights and velocities estimated using the mike flood model there are four types of flood losses direct tangible indirect tangible direct intangible and indirect intangible direct tangible losses commonly include damage to assets agricultural resources damage to livestock and business disruption costs indirect tangible losses include disruption of public services such as traffic congestion and loss of tax revenues due to income losses due to floods losses such as psychological distress ecosystem damage and loss of life fall under the category of direct intangible loss whereas the inconvenience of post flood recovery and loss of trust in authorities belong to indirect intangible losses in this study the vulnerability was assessed by considering only the direct tangible losses as indirect and intangible losses are difficult to realistically estimate in actual monetary terms lekuthai and vongvisessomjai 2001 eleut√©rio 2012 tangible losses were estimated based on the number of assets individual assets such as residential properties that are exposed to flooding in the study area the average price of each type of property per m2 of floor area in the residential area was used to monetize the flood damage the land use was mapped using arcgis software in a residential area similar types of residential houses were grouped based on the simplified building type sbt classification fig 6 and table 1 arcgis 10 7 software was used to support the determination of flood damage by combining the flood depth and its extent obtained from the mike flood model together with the residential building map which contained the depth damage curve accordingly the flood damage for each sbt was calculated the flood damage value in the study area was then obtained by summing up the flood damage for each sbt group this study used average annual damage aad to represent flood damage aad provides an estimation of the flood damage for the design flood events encompassing a diverse range of magnitudes and frequencies to estimate aad design rainfall events for six annual exceedance probabilities aeps namely 50 20 10 5 2 and 1 were simulated using mike flood to encompass the range of design floods from frequent to rare events based on ea 2016 flood damage was calculated for each aep based on the method illustrated in fig 7 equation 1 was used to estimate aad based on ea 2016 1 aad i 1 n d n 1 d n 2 p n p n 1 where aad is the average annual damage d is the flood damage and p is the probability of aep occurrence 2 5 assessment of the flood damage relationships a generalized linear model glm was used to develop relationships between climate change and urbanization impacts on aad the glm was developed based on the necessity of having a simple linear model to reduce the computation time due to its flexible and interpretable framework for modelling a broad range of response variables and predictor variables glm was particularly well suited for this investigation this approach was advised by earlier studies on the relationship between urbanization and climate despite the non normal distribution of the data abdallah et al 2020 employed a glm to investigate the link between land surface temperature and urbanization in cairo egypt glm was used by njoroge et al 2021 to examine how temperature precipitation and land use change affected surface water runoff in the mara river basin kenya in order to account for over dispersion in the data yu et al 2018 employed glm with a quasi poisson distribution to simulate the relationship between urbanization and carbon emissions in china for this study 27 scenarios bounded by a range of predictor variables table 3 were randomly generated the creation of the glm to estimate flood damage aad needed a dataset of suitable size including aad and different predictor variables the development of the appropriate dataset was inspired by the factorial design approach jankovic et al 2021 which provides variability in the boundaries of the inputs to explore the relationships with flood damage aad in greater depth this study applied three predictor variables rainfall intensity increase urbanization increase and sea level rise also three levels k values within each of the predictor variables low medium and high were used tables 2 s2 and s3 if there were k factors or variables and each ran at 3 levels the number of combinations is 3 k hence the number of the appropriate predictors for aad was 33 27 which means there were 27 scenarios needed for each time horizon tables 2 s2 and s3 further the appropriate model among the designed glms was selected using akaike information criterion aic a model with a smaller aic is often better the aic rewards models that fit data well and penalizes models with more parameters that may overfit the data the candidate model with the lowest aic score is most likely to have generated the observed data thus the model with the lowest aic value balances model fit and complexity and best describes the data generating process the goodness fit of the glm model was evaluated by inspecting the residuals using the following plots 1 the model is affirmed to fit the data distribution well if the histogram forms a symmetric bell shape 2 the model fits the data well when the residual quantiles follow a straight line in q q plot 3 the model is considered to fit the data well if the residuals when plotted against the corresponding fitted values show no pattern and 4 the model fits the data well when the plot shows no pattern when the residuals are plotted against the predictor variables after the selection of the suitable statistical model the value of the parameter Œ≤ and the p value of each predictor variable extracted from the glm were evaluated the value of Œ≤ shows the contribution of the predictor variables rainfall urbanization and sea level rise to the value of the response variable aad the larger the value of Œ≤ the higher would be its influence on aad the variables were standardised to be on the same scale for ease of comparison the p value shows the significance of each predictor variable to the response variable this study used a p value of 0 05 as the threshold the predictor variables which have a p value 0 05 are significant to the response variable accordingly Œ≤ and the p value was applied to express the relationships between rainfall urbanization and sea level rise with flood damage aad the schematic of the procedure adopted is illustrated in fig 7 3 results 3 1 predictor variables for future time horizons the upper and lower boundaries obtained for sea level rise rainfall depth increase percentage and urbanization percentage are provided in table 3 the rainfall percentage increase in the upper and lower bounds was computed following the ea 2016 assumptions i e 5 rainfall magnitude will increase with 1 c increase in the temperature the difference between the lower and upper extremes of percentage increase in rainfall depth second column table 3 was found to increase when heading towards future time horizons for illustration in 2040 the projected lower and upper extremes of the increase in rainfall depth were 5 1 and 8 39 difference 3 29 respectively the corresponding projected values in 2100 were 19 09 and 27 67 difference 8 58 a similar trend can be observed for sea level rise as well corresponding to the three future time horizons however the change in urbanization percentage was kept constant for all three future time horizons this is because the maximum allowable increase in urbanization in the study area could occur anytime during the future time interval considered accordingly using the values given in table 3 27 scenarios corresponding to each future time horizon were developed tables 2 s2 and s3 by generating uniformly distributed random values between the lower and upper bounds 3 2 estimation of average annual damage aad the three parameters viz urbanization changes to the rainfall regime and sea level rise for each of the 27 scenarios corresponding to each time frame i e 2040 2070 and 2100 were used as inputs to the mike flood model in combination with the other parameters discussed in section 2 2 and 2 3 also the study assumed only infiltration losses for simulating hydrological processes in the mike flood model underpinned by using the il cl model the inputs to the mike flood model were adapted to make them suitable for each of the six aeps the specific rainfall magnitude is associated with specific aep based on the intensity frequency duration ifd curve the objective of ifd curves is to provide the design rainfall intensity for each frequency aep and rainfall duration the ifd curve for this research study was taken from bom 2016 fig 8 shows the ifd curve for loders creek catchment table 4 presents the rainfall intensity aep and duration from the ifd curve where 1ey means one exceedance per year for each of the six selected aeps several rainfall durations were selected for simulation the selected durations were 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 12 and 24 hrs according to ea 2016 each selected duration should be simulated for 10 temporal patterns in a typical flood modelling study these temporal patterns are provided in ea 2016 data hub however the calculation of aad is resource intensive if all the durations and temporal patterns are investigated using a two dimensional flood simulation model consequently it was determined to explore a specific rainfall length and temporal pattern that is critical for understanding flood damage after computing the hydrograph for the entire duration and temporal pattern the peak flood flows were extracted to determine the critical rainfall duration there were 10 peak flood flows as a result of each timeframe each of the 10 peak flood discharge median values was calculated the period of critical rainfall had the greatest median value consequently it was necessary to obtain the critical rainfall temporal pattern the selection of the appropriate temporal pattern starts with the median of the flood peaks the rainfall pattern with the peak flood discharge that is closest to the median peak flood was chosen as the critical rainfall temporal pattern within the defined critical rainfall time the calculated results of the critical rainfall duration and temporal pattern are given in table 5 consequently the flooded area for musgrave catchment was predicted the present study focuses only on the pluvial and fluvial floods where the downstream boundaries are determined by mean sea level which serves as a physical barrier to the discharge of flood water into the ocean for each timeframe it was assumed that the average sea level rise would remain constant during the flood simulation an illustration of the flooded area for the year 2040 is provided in fig 9 the resulting flooded area was then linked with the depth damage curve in arcgis using a python code and the flood damage values for all the scenarios under different time frames was obtained then using the flood damage values relating to aeps as inputs and applying equation 1 aad values for all the scenarios were computed tables 2 s2 and s3 simultaneously the flood damage maps for the musgrave catchment were generated by overlaying the flooded area and sbt rasters in the raster calculator in the arcgis environment fig 10 the flood damage maps obtained highlight the damage caused by the floods aad values in aud for each future time horizon the net severity of the damage represented by the distinct colours is observed to increase with the increase in time separation from the base period the aad value category ranging from aud 5 000 to 100 000 rises by about 25 between the years 2040 and 2070 and by 64 by 2100 also as evident in fig 10 the highest degree of severity underscored by the red colour emerges by the end of this century statistically the average aad value for the year 2040 in comparison to the year 2017 will increase by 78 which escalates to 197 by the year 2070 and dramatically rises to 351 by 2100 3 3 the relative influence of predictor variables on flood damage the influence of rainfall urbanization and sea level on flood damage aad was assessed using the glm in matlab an appropriate glm from the generated set of glms was selected based on the smallest aic value thus the statistical models representing the 27 future scenarios for each time frame i e 2040 2070 and 2100 were discerned equations 3 5 by substituting the relevant Œ≤ values table 6 for the given time horizon in eq 2 2 aa d time h o r i z o n Œ≤ 1 z 1 Œ≤ 2 z 2 Œ≤ 3 z 3 3 aa d 2040 0 69 z 1 0 25 z 2 0 14 z 3 4 aa d 2070 0 83 z 1 0 09 z 2 0 19 z 3 5 aa d 2100 0 77 z 1 0 05 z 2 0 38 z 3 where z1 rainfall z2 urbanization z3 sea level rise further it was found that each set of residuals corresponding to the glms has a bell shape histogram a straight line in the q q plot and shows no pattern when the residuals are plotted against the fitted results and the predictor variables figs 11 s2 s3 hence all the models can be considered to fit the data tables 2 s2 and s3 satisfactorily exercising the p values 0 05 the significance of each predictor variable rainfall urbanization and sea level rise in terms of its influence on flood damage aad was determined table 6 presents the glm results for future time horizons the influence or the contribution of each predictor variable to flood damage was determined using the parameter Œ≤ values table 6 for the year 2040 out of the two significant variables rainfall Œ≤ 0 69 was observed to be the major factor influencing flood damage followed by urbanization Œ≤ 0 25 and sea level rise Œ≤ 0 14 similarly for the year 2070 rainfall Œ≤ 0 83 stands as the major flood influential factor however sea level rise Œ≤ 0 19 dominates urbanization Œ≤ 0 09 lastly for the year 2100 the influential pattern of the variables remains similar to the year 2070 except for the relative increase in the sea level rise over rainfall though the Œ≤ values provide a good degree of comparison for intra time horizon predictor variables the same could be misleading while considering the inter time horizons table 6 for example the relative percentage increase in the Œ≤ values for rainfall z1 in the year 2040 0 69 and 2070 0 83 is about 20 however the actual values of rainfall urbanization and sea level rise table 7 obtained for each time horizon using the normalized sum of coefficients 1 form of equations 3 4 5 show that the increase in aad due to the increase in rainfall in these two future time horizons is nearly 50 aud 9 92 m and aud 19 27 m similarly the contribution to aad from urbanization z2 could be perceived as negligible for the year 2100 in comparison to 2040 i e only 20 of 2040 aud 0 05 m in 2040 and aud 0 25 m in 2100 however the actual contribution to aad in 2100 aud 1 64 m is about 50 of 2040 aud 3 6 m table 7 4 discussion this study combines the multiple drivers viz rainfall sea level rise and urbanization to flooding in a coastal region to assess their influence cumulatively as well as individually to aad for future time horizons the investigation was undertaken by aggregating land use change details sea level rise and rainfall depth increase projections using rcp 8 5 scenario topography and surface roughness information as inputs to the mike flood model the existing mike flood model was developed based on a previous study by gcnhped 2016a the study uses only mean sea level information to depict the sea level rise in the future which could be treated as a limitation of the current approach additionally due to the absence of a sea level gauging station in the study area the measurements from the newcastle gauging station closest to the study region were used the research study calibrated and validated the model using two historical flood events the flood inundation results obtained for various aeps were integrated with the depth damage curve to generate aad for future time horizons the model outcomes serve as a guide and a source to edify policy making in relation to future adaptation or flood resilience in urban regions by providing knowledge on the varying influence of the three principal drivers of floods over the investigated time horizons 4 1 predictor variables for future time horizons the rising trend in the projected rainfall depth table 3 acquired by combining ea 2016 guidelines and csiro s representative climate futures framework clarke et al 2011 whetton et al 2012 was found to be consistent with the multi model mean rainfall data developed by katzenberger et al 2021 for the future years up to 2090 also the general trend in the expansion of the range of uncertainties in the rainfall depth with future time agrees with the findings by katzenberger et al 2021 and a similar uncertainty pattern was also noted by alley et al 2019 4 2 average annual damage aad for the future time horizons fig 10 depicts an increasing degree of flood damage for future time horizons such increasing severity of flood damages has already been reported by many studies around the world ward et al 2017 denchak 2019 koks et al 2019 unep 2020 the proposed modelling framework in this study further helps in identifying the potential flood susceptible zones which would experience flood damage for instance the areas in the vicinity of loder creek where it bifurcates were found to be affected the most by flooding fig 10 for all three future scenarios investigated this observation could be attributed to the relatively low topography fig 3 compared to the contiguous topography in the upstream area the modelling also identified that some regions at the top right and the middle bottom in the catchment are more susceptible to floods this could be explained by the fact that these regions cater to maximum sbt 1 type building clusters fig 6 which exhibit a maximum total loss ratio for any inundation depth in comparison to other sbt types thus the model can noticeably distinguish the regions which are expected to undergo substantial flood damage and can aid flood resilience studies flood management authorities and policy makers additionally as can be observed from fig 10 i e flood damage corresponding to the year 2100 the model can detect the locations with high flood damage susceptibility interpolating this fact the proposed model could assist in the preparation of robust city development plans by identifying flood vulnerable areas and areas susceptible to high flood damage to facilitate the formulation of long term and effective planning and mitigation strategies 4 3 the relative influence of predictor variables on flood damage twenty seven scenarios selected based on the factorial design approach a more detailed explanation is provided in the supplementary material section 1 were used to develop a statistical model through glm analysis to assess the degree of influence of the three predictor variables rainfall sea level rise and urbanization on the flood damage values however it could be noted that glm assumes variables are uncorrelated thus glm limits the use of autocorrelated time series data also if the variables and interaction terms are not ordered correctly glm can lose precision which obliges a prior understanding of the data distribution before the introduction of any variable the comprehensive study of the final selected glm models i e equations 3 4 and 5 revealed that rainfall is the principal factor compared to sea level rise and urbanization in stimulating floods for the selected time horizons chen et al 2019 mu et al 2021 the Œ≤ values for the remaining predictor variables could be perceived as random however from equations 3 5 it could be deduced that the sea level rise becomes gradually dominant or overwhelms the urbanization factor in equation 5 slr even subsumes a portion of the rainfall factor therefore it may be concluded that sea level rise is another important factor although its effects could not be felt until the end of this century it could eventually pose an even greater hazard than rainfall on the other hand urbanization could also be a substantial player in generating floods however its influence is minimized in the study area by the virtue of the far sighted policy in the gold coast city s planning scheme which limits urban expansion to a well defined pattern 4 4 practical applications of proposed framework for other geographical areas the study integrates the compounding effects of rainfall sea level rise and urbanization on floods the projection of the first two variables based on rcp8 5 scenario as given in the ipcc s fifth assessment report contributes to uncertainty in the assessment of flood damage however this uncertainty could be assessed by future studies by applying appropriate analytical approaches kundzewicz et al 2018 rai et al 2022 sajith et al 2022 the depth damage curve relationships for different sbt types and the data concerning future urbanization were already available for the study area and hence would need to be determined for a different study area if not already available also the rise in flood damage frequencies in the future would naturally stimulate numerous adaptation strategies though such adaptations into the future were not included within the scope of this study the incorporation of any envisaged adaptation measure would increase the accuracy of the results 5 conclusions the study created a modelling framework for predicting the flood damage caused by climate change and changes in urbanization results revealed that the aad value increases significantly if there are no measures taken to mitigate the impacts of climate change the rcp8 5 scenario as an example in the study area it was found that aad increases to 78 in 2040 197 in 2070 and 351 in 2100 compared to the 2017 baseline aad value the average costs associated with flood damage losses in the study area were aud 15 55 m in 2040 aud 25 79 m in 2070 and aud 39 36 m in 2100 further the uncertainty in the flood damage prediction also increases with time and the uncertainty range would become wider in the foreseeable future the greater the uncertainty in the future the more flood mitigation scenarios need to be developed this trend is likely to occur in coastal urban regions if rcp8 5 is used as the basis for climate change influenced flood damage estimation the methodology adopted in the study predicts the level of the impact of urbanization and climate change on flood damage in the future however the development of land in coastal areas may not expand possibly due to land shortage or restricted by regulation under these circumstances the study found that if the rcp8 5 scenario takes place the change in rainfall will exert the highest influence on the flood magnitude and the resulting damage and followed by sea level rise the level of contribution of rainfall and sea level rise will differ in different geographical areas however the methodology used to quantify their contribution is generic and applies to any area in different geographic locations the outcomes would support the decisions concerning flood risk evaluation and strategic planning involving the implementation of engineering non engineering solutions for damage reduction and or flood mitigation

1983,climate change and urbanization play critical roles in compounding future flood risk due to their adverse impacts on the rainfall regime and sea level rise although past studies have predicted the spatiotemporal variations in flood risk these have appreciable limitations viz i flood risk is predicted mainly by accounting for one driver at a time either ocean flooding or fluvial flooding and ii monetization of flood damage due to future flooding had not been investigated however multiple drivers could lead to flooding in coastal areas this study presents an innovative approach for investigating the cumulative effects of urbanization changes to the rainfall regime and sea level rise on consequential flood damage in a coastal urban area a comprehensive flood damage and hazard prediction model was developed by integrating 1d 2d aspects of mike flood and gis technology to assess the flood scenarios for 2040 2070 and 2100 by investigating three predictor variables urbanization rainfall regime and sea level rise the factorial design approach was used to construct a total of 27 future flood scenarios time horizons of 30 years provided for effectively capturing climate change and its influence on the hydrologic regime the generalized linear model glm was applied to create a statistical model based on future scenarios for each time horizon results confirmed that changes to the rainfall regime significantly influence the average annual damage aad caused by flooding for all time horizons at the same time the significance of the effects of urbanization and sea level rise was found to vary the model predicts that by 2040 urbanization would exacerbate aad with a significant contribution from sea level rise in contrast sea level rise would provide a marginally greater and more significant contribution to aad compared to urbanization in 2040 and 2070 compared to the base year 2017 aad was 78 197 and 351 higher in 2040 2070 and 2100 respectively the proposed flood damage prediction model developed can guide modelers and decision makers in assessing the compounding flood damage for future flood management in any geographic location keywords climate change flood damage urban flooding urbanization sea level rise data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the main cause of flooding in urban areas is rainfall which affects people and property in the form of pluvial and fluvial flooding fluvial flooding occurs when high water levels in river channels exceed bank heights while pluvial flooding occurs when the intensity of rainfall exceeds the infiltration capacity urban areas can be severely damaged by both pluvial and fluvial floods although in different ways tanaka et al 2020 urban regions are at risk of pluvial floods because a significant fraction of the land is converted to impervious surfaces that prevent infiltration netzel et al 2021 thrys√∏e et al 2021 lee and kim 2018 the effects of fluvial flooding have been investigated in numerous past studies there are however only a limited number of studies that have focused on the evaluation of damage due to combined pluvial and fluvial flooding reasons include the need for high resolution data the number of stakeholders involved in assessing pluvial floods the complexity of flooding processes in urban settings and the issues associated with the flood source muthusamy et al 2019 past studies report that worldwide flood disasters from 1900 to 2013 have caused around seven million deaths and a monetary loss of about us 600 billion disaster profiles 2013 dong 2006 quantifying the relationships between extreme precipitation and flood hazards in the pearl river basin found that extreme precipitation exerts a significant influence on the spatiotemporal distribution of floods the reduction in infiltration translates to an increase in surface runoff and flood peak huong pathirana 2013 blair et al 2014 climate change will result in radical modifications to the hydrological cycle leading to variations in temperature and moisture wind shear and atmospheric instability which may cause severe storm surges and coastal floods ipcc 2014 trenberth 2011 noted that future temperature increases could alter the natural water cycle and atmospheric moisture content leading to changes in rainfall characteristics the changes to rainfall characteristics are expected to result in more frequent extreme rainfall events which in turn are expected to increase the frequency of occurrence and severity of inland flooding kvoƒçka et al 2018 chen and zhang 2021 especially in coastal urban areas the sea level rise would exacerbate the flooding caused by inland rainfall chowdhury et al 2020 kopp et al 2021 coastal floods in urban regions have the potential to cause enormous economic impacts and in the past have resulted in the loss of lives in many parts of the world zheng et al 2014 bevacqua et al 2019 mac√≠as tapia et al 2021 in the case of flooding sea level rise as a result of climate change acts as a magnifying factor by restricting streamflow discharge into the ocean balica et al 2012 such a scenario will aggravate flood risk and the consequential flood damage in coastal areas nicholls cazenave 2010 without appropriate flood prevention planning an annual flood damage loss of about 0 3 to 9 3 of the global gross domestic product is expected by 2100 hinkel et al 2014 sea level rise slr is expected to increase to 1 m or greater considering the trends in anthropogenic activities and greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2100 rahmstorf 2007 kopp et al 2014 physically slr will increase the height of storm tides reduce pressure gradients essential for transporting fluvial water to the ocean and enable more significant upstream tide wave propagation guo et al 2015 hoitink and jay 2016 loftis et al 2019 consequently flood risk assessment of coastal urban regions is critical the significance of this finding needs to be viewed by the fact that 37 of the global population as of 2017 live in coastal communities un 2017 this further highlights the need to assess flood damage as a consequence of multiple drivers such as sea level rise slr extreme rainfall events and land use change chen et al 2021 thrys√∏e et al 2021 in turn flood damage assessment is essential as it can enhance decision making in relation to flood risk assessment for the formulation of effective strategies for damage reduction and or flood mitigation by broadening the awareness of catchment management authorities and enhancing the well being of flood vulnerable communities computational flood models used for simulating the extent of flooding depth duration and flow velocity have been of paramount importance for determining flood associated damages usually these are applied to investigate a range of city development scenarios and climate parameters for developing a strategic plan to implement appropriate adaptation measures this requires the incorporation of uncertain future conditions including their possible consequences and resulting damages in order to design flood risk mitigation measures in a timely and effective manner apel et al 2004 jamali et al 2018 in scotland a grid to grid hydrological flood forecasting model has been developed using 24 hour collective rainfall predictions and static flood risk maps speight et al 2016 by segmenting the drainage region into smaller areas and employing flood volumes and damage data lee and kim 2018 created a multi dimensional flood damage assessment technique recently flood modellers have explored a combination of 1d 2d hydrodynamic models to simulate the drainage network as well as overall flow swmm or mouse jamali et al 2018 sobek deltares 2017 and xpswmm xpsolutions 2017 are some of the commercially available models used for elaborately simulating flood characteristics these models involve intensive computations and are sometimes subjected to numerical instability lhomme et al 2006 leandro and martins 2016 considering this fact 1d 2d flood models which demand large computational details and time need some modification teng et al 2017 as the high computational time makes the model unsuitable for application in large regions which require multiple simulations and scenario assessment the application process of conventional 1d 2d models is often complex as it needs a significant amount of training and optimization and the flood prediction intervals are quite large and unsuitable for realistically estimating flood damages li et al 2017 the complexity of flood damage assessment is commonly exacerbated due to the involvement of multiple factors including flood depth flow velocity flood duration lead time for flood warning and the built environment characteristics merz et al 2010 jamali et al 2018 the complexity also arises from a large number of drivers the training and optimization involved and a large number of time steps which leads to high computation time thus it is challenging for practitioners to estimate flood damage in the targeted catchment future flood risks and associated flood damages are expected to be strongly influenced by the increase in urbanization and climate change driven changes to rainfall characteristics and sea level rise jamali et al 2018 chen et al 2021 flood damage occurrence and extent vary across different regions due to the characteristics of the catchment such as land use past researchers such as miller and hutchins 2017 semadeni davies et al 2008 gu et al 2011 and huong and pathirana 2013 have attempted to create methodology focused on determining flood damage by considering urbanization and climate change impacts on flooding these models are not appropriate for single drainage basins as they use long term rainfall data and a single drainage basin requires rainfall data on a per min per hr scale also little is known about the integrated and simultaneous influence of future changes to rainfall urbanization and sea level rise on urban flood damage costs mahmoud and gan 2018 zhou et al 2019 therefore it is crucial to statistically estimate future flood damage based on rainfall urbanization and sea level rise practitioners require comprehensive and simplified flood damage assessment models that include 1d 2d model components and use rainfall data at a lower scale per min and can be applied across various drainage basins this study combines climatic and urbanization trends to present a novel modelling framework for estimating future flood damage costs in coastal urban regions the study s objectives were 1 to develop a rational approach to assess the impacts of rainfall depth sea level rise and urbanization on floods for the years 2040 2070 and 2100 under different climate change scenarios and representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 and 2 to assess future flood damage costs under the compounding effects of predicted changes to rainfall depth sea level rise and urbanization the study outcomes are expected to contribute to creating new knowledge on the impacts of climate change and can guide the development of future flood mitigation strategies to enhance resilience to climate change the methodology proposed in this study is generic and can be applied to any area irrespective of the geographic location 2 methods 2 1 study area and data musgrave catchment located within the larger loders creek catchment in the gold coast australia fig 1 was selected as the study area for this research study the focus of the study was to assess the flood damage to residential buildings caused by the combination of climate change sea level rise and urbanization the relatively densely populated coastal residential region 1 82 km2 has predominantly flat terrain with the downstream part of the catchment prone to frequent floods further the flood risks are aggravated due to the augmented tidal flow effect on the coastal urban area therefore the selected catchment was eminently suitable for this study based on the city of gold coast planning scheme city of gold coast 2017 the urbanized areas in the gold coast are projected to increase to 88 by 2100 in comparison to the current land use 74 a detailed comparison between current and future land use is provided in table s1 the study considers three future time horizons 2040 2070 and 2100 with 2017 as the base year these future time horizons are in accordance with the future scenarios proposed by ipcc 2014 also the 30 year gap selected between the future time horizons is adequate to capture significant changes in the climate hulme et al 1999 moen fredman 2007 2 2 future scenarios the ipcc s rcp8 5 scenario was selected for this study to simulate the maximum possible impact of rainfall and sea level rise on flooding riahi et al 2011 rcp8 5 represents a situation where no viable policy is in force to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions van vuuren et al 2011 the lower and upper values of rcp8 5 for the selected years were considered as boundaries for the changes in rainfall depth ipcc 2014 temperature rises were assumed to increase rainfall depth the study used climate futures tool a software that runs several advanced climate simulations based on various scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions the climate futures tool s projection of the future temperature provides the percentage value of the increased rainfall depth clarke et al 2011 whetton et al 2012 the tool can be used to derive detailed temperature change forecasts which can then be converted to changes in future rainfall magnitude using the techniques advised by engineers australia ea according to ea 2016 the amount of rainfall should rise by 5 for every 1 0c rise in temperature the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 both of which are included in the ipcc s fifth assessment report ipcc 2014 are used by the climate futures tool this tool was used to generate the mean temperature and standard deviation for the temperature boundaries to produce random numbers high medium and low temperatures were defined accordingly the mean temperature plus the standard deviation yielded high boundaries medium limits were taken as the mean temperatures finally subtracting the standard deviation from the mean temperature yielded the lower bounds accordingly these temperature boundaries were transformed into rainfall depth based on ea 2016 advice as noted above between these rainfall boundaries random numbers were created to ensure equal rainfall probability random numbers were assumed to be evenly distributed the boundaries for sea level rise were also selected based on the lower and upper values of the predicted sea level rise using rcp8 5 for the given time period for each timeframe it was assumed that the sea level would remain steady throughout the flood simulation for assessing the national sea level rise 16 sea level gauging stations have been established along the coastline around australia fig 2 these gauges are equipped with a continuous tide gauge recorder which continuously monitors the sea level the sea level rise for australia s coastal areas at the 16 tides gauging stations has been projected by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro and bureau of meteorology bom 2007 based on ipcc s rcp scenarios the closest sea level gauging station to the musgrave avenue sub catchment is the newcastle station at this station csiro and bom 2015 have projected a range of sea level rise data for the years 2030 2040 2070 and 2090 accordingly the sea level rise for the current research study was based on this existing projection the projection from csiro and bom 2015 at the newcastle gauging station was plotted and polynomial regression procedures were used to extract the high medium and low sea level rise data for each scenario timeframe the urban development in the musgrave catchment was obtained by comparing the current land cover from google earth 2017 and the future land cover obtained from the city of gold coast planning scheme city of gold coast 2017 as per the city of gold coast planning scheme the maximum possible limit for land cover changes has been fixed a maximum of 13 9 of the city area is allowed to be changed to urban land since this change can be perceived within any time range the boundaries for urbanization were considered same for each time horizon i e 0 and 13 9 2 3 mike flood model mike flood model is a combination of mike 21 mike urban and mike 11 models the water level at loders creek and broadwater the ocean outfall was regarded as the model upstream and downstream boundaries respectively fig 3 in order to determine the initial upstream water level of loders creek the flood hydrograph developed by the gold coast natural hazards planning and environment division gcnhped 2016b using the unified river basin simulator urbs model was employed further the downstream boundary was limited based on the mean sea level of broadwater the ocean outfall as the baseline to predict the future sea level rise the mean sea level was used as it is expected to rise in the future for the different climate change scenarios nicholls cazenave 2010 ipcc 2014 additionally the rise in sea level will act as a barrier preventing the discharge of floodwater into the ocean the mike 21 setup consisted of the following parameters topography using a 2 2 m grid surface roughness using manning s equation infiltration rate to represent the change in land use and initial water surface elevation in loders creek mike urban was used to determine the flood extent and flood inundation in the designed stormwater drainage network in the musgrave catchment to correctly replicate the current stormwater network all of the existing conduits inlets and outlets gcnhped 2016a were input into mike urban fig 3 mike 11 was applied to model the streamflow in the open channels close to the bridges at musgrave avenue and gold coast highway in loders creek the mike flood model uses the design hourly rainfall as an input to mike 21 the design rainfall was determined by calculating the rainfall over the catchment area using thiessen polygon method for three stations namely biggera sea air and loder rainfall stations fig 3 thiessen polygon method is best suited for regions with sparse and irregularly distributed rain gauges appropriate with the topography of musgrave avenue sub catchment as it can more accurately account for fluctuations in precipitation over the area of interest if the rainfall is widely distributed and the shape of the region is complex other techniques like the isohyetal method work best in locations with uniform precipitation patterns and fairly regular shapes chowdhury et al 2016 further the rainfall was converted to runoff using an initial loss continuous loss il cl model to simulate the overland flow the initial assumption of il and cl prior to the calibration was based on the design loss value recommended in ea 2016 a range of different land uses was used in this research study including road pavement which was assumed to have no infiltration il cl 0 open space il 42 mm hr and cl 3 9 mm hr and community facilities high density residential low density residential medium density residential neighbourhood centre special purpose and sport and recreation il 12 6 mm hr and cl 1 17 mm hr this assumption means that the il and cl values for open space represent 30 of the total area some part of the runoff is taken up by the mike urban drainage network at the inlet node and discharges runoff into open channels in mike 21 while mike 11 calculated the water flow through the bridges more details about mike flood are provided by jamali et al 2018 in this study 1d and 2d components of mike flood model were used for musgrave catchment which had previously been calibrated and validated using historical rainfall and flood data of two flood events 1 flood caused by the heaviest june daily rainfall since 1967 bom 2007 on 28 june 2005 and 2 flood event on 2 january 2008 the validation was undertaken using a shorter period of the flood event on 2 january 2008 as the cross section modelled in mike 11 solely discharges to the receiving water without any stoppage the calibration was started by only changing the parameters in mike urban and mike 21 the procedures involved simulating the water level with mike flood and comparing the output to the actual water level as measured by the loders creek stream flow gauge since the historical data from gcnhped 2016a only displayed the water levels the comparison was based on that level the calibration process parameters were manually changed the simulated result and the observed hydrograph s flood peak and time to peak were compared consequently the validation process was carried out to ensure the accuracy of the calibrated model according to fig 4 the water level caused by the mike flood on 28 june 2005 resembles the measured water level in shape the rmse and cd values were 3 11 and 0 75 respectively as such the mike flood s calibration was deemed to be adequate when the simulated and observed hydrograph on 2 january 2008 climbs to its apex fig s4 displays a similar pattern and 1 18 and 0 44 respectively are the cd and rmse values the calibrated mike flood was validated generally with positive outcomes 2 4 flood damage hazard and vulnerability are the two measures which can be used to assess flood damage wang et al 2011 where hazard measures the frequency and severity of the flood event and vulnerability is related to the number of assets and people affected by the flood haynes et al 2008 monetary loss due to flood damage was estimated based on three factors viz i flood depth in each asset at risk ii the number of assets at risk and iii depth damage curve apel et al 2004 ballesteros c√°novas et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 a depth damage curve fig s1 developed by mason et al 2012 for eastern australia was utilized in this study to assess the flood damage as illustrated in fig 5 hazard generation was supported by flood heights and velocities estimated using the mike flood model there are four types of flood losses direct tangible indirect tangible direct intangible and indirect intangible direct tangible losses commonly include damage to assets agricultural resources damage to livestock and business disruption costs indirect tangible losses include disruption of public services such as traffic congestion and loss of tax revenues due to income losses due to floods losses such as psychological distress ecosystem damage and loss of life fall under the category of direct intangible loss whereas the inconvenience of post flood recovery and loss of trust in authorities belong to indirect intangible losses in this study the vulnerability was assessed by considering only the direct tangible losses as indirect and intangible losses are difficult to realistically estimate in actual monetary terms lekuthai and vongvisessomjai 2001 eleut√©rio 2012 tangible losses were estimated based on the number of assets individual assets such as residential properties that are exposed to flooding in the study area the average price of each type of property per m2 of floor area in the residential area was used to monetize the flood damage the land use was mapped using arcgis software in a residential area similar types of residential houses were grouped based on the simplified building type sbt classification fig 6 and table 1 arcgis 10 7 software was used to support the determination of flood damage by combining the flood depth and its extent obtained from the mike flood model together with the residential building map which contained the depth damage curve accordingly the flood damage for each sbt was calculated the flood damage value in the study area was then obtained by summing up the flood damage for each sbt group this study used average annual damage aad to represent flood damage aad provides an estimation of the flood damage for the design flood events encompassing a diverse range of magnitudes and frequencies to estimate aad design rainfall events for six annual exceedance probabilities aeps namely 50 20 10 5 2 and 1 were simulated using mike flood to encompass the range of design floods from frequent to rare events based on ea 2016 flood damage was calculated for each aep based on the method illustrated in fig 7 equation 1 was used to estimate aad based on ea 2016 1 aad i 1 n d n 1 d n 2 p n p n 1 where aad is the average annual damage d is the flood damage and p is the probability of aep occurrence 2 5 assessment of the flood damage relationships a generalized linear model glm was used to develop relationships between climate change and urbanization impacts on aad the glm was developed based on the necessity of having a simple linear model to reduce the computation time due to its flexible and interpretable framework for modelling a broad range of response variables and predictor variables glm was particularly well suited for this investigation this approach was advised by earlier studies on the relationship between urbanization and climate despite the non normal distribution of the data abdallah et al 2020 employed a glm to investigate the link between land surface temperature and urbanization in cairo egypt glm was used by njoroge et al 2021 to examine how temperature precipitation and land use change affected surface water runoff in the mara river basin kenya in order to account for over dispersion in the data yu et al 2018 employed glm with a quasi poisson distribution to simulate the relationship between urbanization and carbon emissions in china for this study 27 scenarios bounded by a range of predictor variables table 3 were randomly generated the creation of the glm to estimate flood damage aad needed a dataset of suitable size including aad and different predictor variables the development of the appropriate dataset was inspired by the factorial design approach jankovic et al 2021 which provides variability in the boundaries of the inputs to explore the relationships with flood damage aad in greater depth this study applied three predictor variables rainfall intensity increase urbanization increase and sea level rise also three levels k values within each of the predictor variables low medium and high were used tables 2 s2 and s3 if there were k factors or variables and each ran at 3 levels the number of combinations is 3 k hence the number of the appropriate predictors for aad was 33 27 which means there were 27 scenarios needed for each time horizon tables 2 s2 and s3 further the appropriate model among the designed glms was selected using akaike information criterion aic a model with a smaller aic is often better the aic rewards models that fit data well and penalizes models with more parameters that may overfit the data the candidate model with the lowest aic score is most likely to have generated the observed data thus the model with the lowest aic value balances model fit and complexity and best describes the data generating process the goodness fit of the glm model was evaluated by inspecting the residuals using the following plots 1 the model is affirmed to fit the data distribution well if the histogram forms a symmetric bell shape 2 the model fits the data well when the residual quantiles follow a straight line in q q plot 3 the model is considered to fit the data well if the residuals when plotted against the corresponding fitted values show no pattern and 4 the model fits the data well when the plot shows no pattern when the residuals are plotted against the predictor variables after the selection of the suitable statistical model the value of the parameter Œ≤ and the p value of each predictor variable extracted from the glm were evaluated the value of Œ≤ shows the contribution of the predictor variables rainfall urbanization and sea level rise to the value of the response variable aad the larger the value of Œ≤ the higher would be its influence on aad the variables were standardised to be on the same scale for ease of comparison the p value shows the significance of each predictor variable to the response variable this study used a p value of 0 05 as the threshold the predictor variables which have a p value 0 05 are significant to the response variable accordingly Œ≤ and the p value was applied to express the relationships between rainfall urbanization and sea level rise with flood damage aad the schematic of the procedure adopted is illustrated in fig 7 3 results 3 1 predictor variables for future time horizons the upper and lower boundaries obtained for sea level rise rainfall depth increase percentage and urbanization percentage are provided in table 3 the rainfall percentage increase in the upper and lower bounds was computed following the ea 2016 assumptions i e 5 rainfall magnitude will increase with 1 c increase in the temperature the difference between the lower and upper extremes of percentage increase in rainfall depth second column table 3 was found to increase when heading towards future time horizons for illustration in 2040 the projected lower and upper extremes of the increase in rainfall depth were 5 1 and 8 39 difference 3 29 respectively the corresponding projected values in 2100 were 19 09 and 27 67 difference 8 58 a similar trend can be observed for sea level rise as well corresponding to the three future time horizons however the change in urbanization percentage was kept constant for all three future time horizons this is because the maximum allowable increase in urbanization in the study area could occur anytime during the future time interval considered accordingly using the values given in table 3 27 scenarios corresponding to each future time horizon were developed tables 2 s2 and s3 by generating uniformly distributed random values between the lower and upper bounds 3 2 estimation of average annual damage aad the three parameters viz urbanization changes to the rainfall regime and sea level rise for each of the 27 scenarios corresponding to each time frame i e 2040 2070 and 2100 were used as inputs to the mike flood model in combination with the other parameters discussed in section 2 2 and 2 3 also the study assumed only infiltration losses for simulating hydrological processes in the mike flood model underpinned by using the il cl model the inputs to the mike flood model were adapted to make them suitable for each of the six aeps the specific rainfall magnitude is associated with specific aep based on the intensity frequency duration ifd curve the objective of ifd curves is to provide the design rainfall intensity for each frequency aep and rainfall duration the ifd curve for this research study was taken from bom 2016 fig 8 shows the ifd curve for loders creek catchment table 4 presents the rainfall intensity aep and duration from the ifd curve where 1ey means one exceedance per year for each of the six selected aeps several rainfall durations were selected for simulation the selected durations were 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 12 and 24 hrs according to ea 2016 each selected duration should be simulated for 10 temporal patterns in a typical flood modelling study these temporal patterns are provided in ea 2016 data hub however the calculation of aad is resource intensive if all the durations and temporal patterns are investigated using a two dimensional flood simulation model consequently it was determined to explore a specific rainfall length and temporal pattern that is critical for understanding flood damage after computing the hydrograph for the entire duration and temporal pattern the peak flood flows were extracted to determine the critical rainfall duration there were 10 peak flood flows as a result of each timeframe each of the 10 peak flood discharge median values was calculated the period of critical rainfall had the greatest median value consequently it was necessary to obtain the critical rainfall temporal pattern the selection of the appropriate temporal pattern starts with the median of the flood peaks the rainfall pattern with the peak flood discharge that is closest to the median peak flood was chosen as the critical rainfall temporal pattern within the defined critical rainfall time the calculated results of the critical rainfall duration and temporal pattern are given in table 5 consequently the flooded area for musgrave catchment was predicted the present study focuses only on the pluvial and fluvial floods where the downstream boundaries are determined by mean sea level which serves as a physical barrier to the discharge of flood water into the ocean for each timeframe it was assumed that the average sea level rise would remain constant during the flood simulation an illustration of the flooded area for the year 2040 is provided in fig 9 the resulting flooded area was then linked with the depth damage curve in arcgis using a python code and the flood damage values for all the scenarios under different time frames was obtained then using the flood damage values relating to aeps as inputs and applying equation 1 aad values for all the scenarios were computed tables 2 s2 and s3 simultaneously the flood damage maps for the musgrave catchment were generated by overlaying the flooded area and sbt rasters in the raster calculator in the arcgis environment fig 10 the flood damage maps obtained highlight the damage caused by the floods aad values in aud for each future time horizon the net severity of the damage represented by the distinct colours is observed to increase with the increase in time separation from the base period the aad value category ranging from aud 5 000 to 100 000 rises by about 25 between the years 2040 and 2070 and by 64 by 2100 also as evident in fig 10 the highest degree of severity underscored by the red colour emerges by the end of this century statistically the average aad value for the year 2040 in comparison to the year 2017 will increase by 78 which escalates to 197 by the year 2070 and dramatically rises to 351 by 2100 3 3 the relative influence of predictor variables on flood damage the influence of rainfall urbanization and sea level on flood damage aad was assessed using the glm in matlab an appropriate glm from the generated set of glms was selected based on the smallest aic value thus the statistical models representing the 27 future scenarios for each time frame i e 2040 2070 and 2100 were discerned equations 3 5 by substituting the relevant Œ≤ values table 6 for the given time horizon in eq 2 2 aa d time h o r i z o n Œ≤ 1 z 1 Œ≤ 2 z 2 Œ≤ 3 z 3 3 aa d 2040 0 69 z 1 0 25 z 2 0 14 z 3 4 aa d 2070 0 83 z 1 0 09 z 2 0 19 z 3 5 aa d 2100 0 77 z 1 0 05 z 2 0 38 z 3 where z1 rainfall z2 urbanization z3 sea level rise further it was found that each set of residuals corresponding to the glms has a bell shape histogram a straight line in the q q plot and shows no pattern when the residuals are plotted against the fitted results and the predictor variables figs 11 s2 s3 hence all the models can be considered to fit the data tables 2 s2 and s3 satisfactorily exercising the p values 0 05 the significance of each predictor variable rainfall urbanization and sea level rise in terms of its influence on flood damage aad was determined table 6 presents the glm results for future time horizons the influence or the contribution of each predictor variable to flood damage was determined using the parameter Œ≤ values table 6 for the year 2040 out of the two significant variables rainfall Œ≤ 0 69 was observed to be the major factor influencing flood damage followed by urbanization Œ≤ 0 25 and sea level rise Œ≤ 0 14 similarly for the year 2070 rainfall Œ≤ 0 83 stands as the major flood influential factor however sea level rise Œ≤ 0 19 dominates urbanization Œ≤ 0 09 lastly for the year 2100 the influential pattern of the variables remains similar to the year 2070 except for the relative increase in the sea level rise over rainfall though the Œ≤ values provide a good degree of comparison for intra time horizon predictor variables the same could be misleading while considering the inter time horizons table 6 for example the relative percentage increase in the Œ≤ values for rainfall z1 in the year 2040 0 69 and 2070 0 83 is about 20 however the actual values of rainfall urbanization and sea level rise table 7 obtained for each time horizon using the normalized sum of coefficients 1 form of equations 3 4 5 show that the increase in aad due to the increase in rainfall in these two future time horizons is nearly 50 aud 9 92 m and aud 19 27 m similarly the contribution to aad from urbanization z2 could be perceived as negligible for the year 2100 in comparison to 2040 i e only 20 of 2040 aud 0 05 m in 2040 and aud 0 25 m in 2100 however the actual contribution to aad in 2100 aud 1 64 m is about 50 of 2040 aud 3 6 m table 7 4 discussion this study combines the multiple drivers viz rainfall sea level rise and urbanization to flooding in a coastal region to assess their influence cumulatively as well as individually to aad for future time horizons the investigation was undertaken by aggregating land use change details sea level rise and rainfall depth increase projections using rcp 8 5 scenario topography and surface roughness information as inputs to the mike flood model the existing mike flood model was developed based on a previous study by gcnhped 2016a the study uses only mean sea level information to depict the sea level rise in the future which could be treated as a limitation of the current approach additionally due to the absence of a sea level gauging station in the study area the measurements from the newcastle gauging station closest to the study region were used the research study calibrated and validated the model using two historical flood events the flood inundation results obtained for various aeps were integrated with the depth damage curve to generate aad for future time horizons the model outcomes serve as a guide and a source to edify policy making in relation to future adaptation or flood resilience in urban regions by providing knowledge on the varying influence of the three principal drivers of floods over the investigated time horizons 4 1 predictor variables for future time horizons the rising trend in the projected rainfall depth table 3 acquired by combining ea 2016 guidelines and csiro s representative climate futures framework clarke et al 2011 whetton et al 2012 was found to be consistent with the multi model mean rainfall data developed by katzenberger et al 2021 for the future years up to 2090 also the general trend in the expansion of the range of uncertainties in the rainfall depth with future time agrees with the findings by katzenberger et al 2021 and a similar uncertainty pattern was also noted by alley et al 2019 4 2 average annual damage aad for the future time horizons fig 10 depicts an increasing degree of flood damage for future time horizons such increasing severity of flood damages has already been reported by many studies around the world ward et al 2017 denchak 2019 koks et al 2019 unep 2020 the proposed modelling framework in this study further helps in identifying the potential flood susceptible zones which would experience flood damage for instance the areas in the vicinity of loder creek where it bifurcates were found to be affected the most by flooding fig 10 for all three future scenarios investigated this observation could be attributed to the relatively low topography fig 3 compared to the contiguous topography in the upstream area the modelling also identified that some regions at the top right and the middle bottom in the catchment are more susceptible to floods this could be explained by the fact that these regions cater to maximum sbt 1 type building clusters fig 6 which exhibit a maximum total loss ratio for any inundation depth in comparison to other sbt types thus the model can noticeably distinguish the regions which are expected to undergo substantial flood damage and can aid flood resilience studies flood management authorities and policy makers additionally as can be observed from fig 10 i e flood damage corresponding to the year 2100 the model can detect the locations with high flood damage susceptibility interpolating this fact the proposed model could assist in the preparation of robust city development plans by identifying flood vulnerable areas and areas susceptible to high flood damage to facilitate the formulation of long term and effective planning and mitigation strategies 4 3 the relative influence of predictor variables on flood damage twenty seven scenarios selected based on the factorial design approach a more detailed explanation is provided in the supplementary material section 1 were used to develop a statistical model through glm analysis to assess the degree of influence of the three predictor variables rainfall sea level rise and urbanization on the flood damage values however it could be noted that glm assumes variables are uncorrelated thus glm limits the use of autocorrelated time series data also if the variables and interaction terms are not ordered correctly glm can lose precision which obliges a prior understanding of the data distribution before the introduction of any variable the comprehensive study of the final selected glm models i e equations 3 4 and 5 revealed that rainfall is the principal factor compared to sea level rise and urbanization in stimulating floods for the selected time horizons chen et al 2019 mu et al 2021 the Œ≤ values for the remaining predictor variables could be perceived as random however from equations 3 5 it could be deduced that the sea level rise becomes gradually dominant or overwhelms the urbanization factor in equation 5 slr even subsumes a portion of the rainfall factor therefore it may be concluded that sea level rise is another important factor although its effects could not be felt until the end of this century it could eventually pose an even greater hazard than rainfall on the other hand urbanization could also be a substantial player in generating floods however its influence is minimized in the study area by the virtue of the far sighted policy in the gold coast city s planning scheme which limits urban expansion to a well defined pattern 4 4 practical applications of proposed framework for other geographical areas the study integrates the compounding effects of rainfall sea level rise and urbanization on floods the projection of the first two variables based on rcp8 5 scenario as given in the ipcc s fifth assessment report contributes to uncertainty in the assessment of flood damage however this uncertainty could be assessed by future studies by applying appropriate analytical approaches kundzewicz et al 2018 rai et al 2022 sajith et al 2022 the depth damage curve relationships for different sbt types and the data concerning future urbanization were already available for the study area and hence would need to be determined for a different study area if not already available also the rise in flood damage frequencies in the future would naturally stimulate numerous adaptation strategies though such adaptations into the future were not included within the scope of this study the incorporation of any envisaged adaptation measure would increase the accuracy of the results 5 conclusions the study created a modelling framework for predicting the flood damage caused by climate change and changes in urbanization results revealed that the aad value increases significantly if there are no measures taken to mitigate the impacts of climate change the rcp8 5 scenario as an example in the study area it was found that aad increases to 78 in 2040 197 in 2070 and 351 in 2100 compared to the 2017 baseline aad value the average costs associated with flood damage losses in the study area were aud 15 55 m in 2040 aud 25 79 m in 2070 and aud 39 36 m in 2100 further the uncertainty in the flood damage prediction also increases with time and the uncertainty range would become wider in the foreseeable future the greater the uncertainty in the future the more flood mitigation scenarios need to be developed this trend is likely to occur in coastal urban regions if rcp8 5 is used as the basis for climate change influenced flood damage estimation the methodology adopted in the study predicts the level of the impact of urbanization and climate change on flood damage in the future however the development of land in coastal areas may not expand possibly due to land shortage or restricted by regulation under these circumstances the study found that if the rcp8 5 scenario takes place the change in rainfall will exert the highest influence on the flood magnitude and the resulting damage and followed by sea level rise the level of contribution of rainfall and sea level rise will differ in different geographical areas however the methodology used to quantify their contribution is generic and applies to any area in different geographic locations the outcomes would support the decisions concerning flood risk evaluation and strategic planning involving the implementation of engineering non engineering solutions for damage reduction and or flood mitigation

1984,riparian lowlands are important for protecting aquatic ecosystems threatened by contamination their ability to attenuate and reduce nutrient rich water provides a useful ecosystem service previous field studies have shown that the hydrological conditions within a lowland can affect their reduction capabilities dependent on the dominant flow pathways i e surface runoff groundwater discharge and drain flow for example the likelihood of nutrient reduction within a riparian lowland dominated by surface runoff is low conversely if groundwater discharge dominates the likelihood is higher hence knowledge of the flow pathways can be used to provide a qualitative estimate of the reduction capacity in riparian lowlands information that is vital in assessing catchment scale processes the objective of this study is to establish a relationship between the dominant riparian flow pathways and lowland features such as slope and hydrogeology geology previous work had shown the ability of a downscaled high resolution numerical model to replicate observed annual flow patterns within a riparian lowland this downscaled numerical model was used to provide quantitative information regarding the riparian flow partitioning to diversify the dataset the riparian lowland was segmented to provide flow information at different scales and topographic and hydraulic properties within the model were perturbed to capture the range of topographic and geological characteristics present at large scale these data were then used to train a random forest rf model where the target variable was the fraction of overland flow applying the rf model to a 12 785 5 km2 large region in denmark provided a prediction in line with our understanding of the area this approach can prove useful in enhancing existing nitrate management tools by incorporating variability in lowland nitrate reduction capacity keywords modelling machine learning flow partitioning nitrate local scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction riparian lowlands have long been acknowledged to play a vital role for the quality of surface water bodies forming a biogeochemical filter which can remove and reduce potentially harmful nutrients contaminants in the groundwater prior to entering the hydraulically connected surface water hill 1996 naiman and d√©camps 1997 parsons et al 2004 the filtering ability of the riparian lowland is strongly influenced by the flow dynamics within the lowlands this means that when nutrient rich groundwater travels through such areas the strongly anoxic conditions coupled to the organic rich soils leads to strongly reducing conditions devito et al 2000 hill et al 2014 subsequent nutrient concentrations of any groundwater discharge are assumed to be negligible audet et al 2020 turetsky et al 2014 vidon and serchan 2016 the heterogeneity in both hydrogeological properties and settings of these environments will impact how water both overland flow and groundwater flow behave within the lowland area devito et al 2000 the dominant flow paths within a riparian lowland i e surface runoff groundwater discharge and or drain flow may be used as indicators of the potential for reduction of harmful nutrients to occur petersen et al 2020a petersen et al 2020b in particular field data has demonstrated that the nitrate n reduction capacity within lowlands can be linked to the amount of water entering the connected stream through lowland sediments petersen et al 2020b therefore the likelihood of n reduction within a riparian lowland dominated by overland flow is low conversely if groundwater discharge dominates the likelihood of n reduction is higher the challenge is then to determine the flow partitioning within a riparian lowland as an indirect measure of its n reduction capacity water management is often supported by spatially distributed models barlow et al 2003 barthel and banzhaf 2016 in denmark the national nitrogen model n model is used to inform the management strategies at the subcatchment scale 15 km2 referred to as id15 catchments h√∏jberg et al 2015a h√∏jberg et al 2021 the n model uses the danish national water resources model dk model see henriksen et al 2003 h√∏jberg et al 2013 and stisen et al 2019 as a basis for the subsurface flow and transport conditions the flow resolution relies on the grid scale of the dk model which has recently been reduced from 500 to 100 m however both resolutions are too coarse to spatially resolve the flow partitioning in riparian lowlands that typically cover less than one or a few model grids resolving the simulated flows within riparian lowlands requires refinement of the simulation grid such high resolution models can be computationally expensive and require additional data noorduijn et al 2021 demonstrated the potential of constructing a high resolution model of a riparian lowland by downscaling a calibrated national scale model that was able to replicate the observed flow partitioning within the lowland this downscaling approach represents a means to quantifying lowland flow partitioning however it is not feasible to apply this approach to all riparian lowlands due to the computationally expensive nature of high resolution models therefore an upscaling approach is required whereby the flow partitioning can be assessed from local scale data and applied to entire riparian lowlands ranging in area from 100 s 1000 s m2 this can subsequently be used in combination with management tools upscaling can be approached in several ways e g effective parameter approach de rooij 2009 wood 2009 distribution function approach cushman et al 2002 n≈ìtinger et al 2005 and dynamic upscaling approach hansen et al 2018 zehe et al 2006 effective parameter upscaling relies on the assumption that our process understanding and therefore mathematical representation thereof is applicable at a larger scale in such case an effective parameter set can be determined which will reproduce the average behaviour at the larger scale e g noorduijn et al 2014 another approach is to represent the upscaled parameters as distributions accounting for heterogeneity in the system herbst and diekkr√ºger 2002 the distribution function approach is commonly applied in geostatistics where multiple model realisations are generated using the parameter distributions carrera et al 2005 de marsily et al 2005 mariethoz et al 2010 dynamic upscaling is presented by hansen et al 2018 and refsgaard et al 2019 whereby some relationships are derived from a high resolution model for subsequent use in a coarser resolution model an advantage of this is that the relationships that are derived from a physically based model then is scaled for application at the target scale in this study we adopt a dynamic upscaling approach by combining a fine scale numerical model of a catchment containing a riparian lowland with detailed field data on flow partitioning and generally available covariates on riparian lowland conditions from this we investigate which landscape characteristics and hydraulic properties are most important in depicting flow partitioning within the lowland we hypothesize that the flow partitioning within a riparian lowland is controlled by the hydraulic pressure groundwater and overland flow into the riparian lowland from the upland areas and the physical characteristics of the lowland such as slope hydraulic conductivity and aquifer geometry therefore the high resolution model will enable differentiation of overland and groundwater flow pathways at the riparian boundary and their subsequent discharge into the stream this provides a basis upon which to relate the hydrological flows into the riparian lowland at its boundary to the flow partitioning into the connected stream this investigation represents an initial attempt to quantitatively differentiating between riparian lowlands based on flow dynamics and physical characterises 2 methodology in this study a high resolution 10 m grid scale numerical model of a catchment containing a riparian lowland is used to simulate the flow dynamics within a riparian lowland these data are then used to train a statistical machine learning model to predict the flow dynamics within the riparian lowland the training dataset for the statistical machine learning model is extended by modifying some of the properties within the fine resolution numerical model which alters the flow dynamics within the riparian lowland these modifications influence the riparian lowlands flow dynamics thereby providing additional information to the machine learning model the statistical machine learning model was then used to predict the flow dynamics in riparian lowlands in central denmark using data taken from the lower resolution 100 m grid scale danish national hydrological model the following sections provide in depth description of the approach 2 1 general approach the general approach in this study uses the following strategic steps fig 1 1 step 1 develop and test a high resolution local scale hydrological model base model capable of simulating flow partitioning overland flow subsurface flow for a riparian lowland 2 step 2 generalise the base model by perturbing it to cover the typical ranges of geomorphological conditions throughout the area of interest denmark 3 step 3 develop an approach to extract information from a single riparian lowland by segregation based on overland flow patterns 4 step 4 identify environmental covariates that are generally available throughout the area of interest 5 step 5 develop a statistical machine learning model that can simulate the fraction of overland flow to the river from environmental covariates 6 step 6 test the statistical machine learning model on a subset of danish lowlands the following sections describe the details in each step of the methodology 2 2 step 1 base model a local hydrological model was developed for the fensholt subcatchment where comprehensive field and modelling studies have been carried out de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2019a 2019b hansen 2002 petersen et al 2020a 2020b prinds et al 2020 2019 the fensholt subcatchment is in the headwaters of the norsminde catchment in eastern jutland denmark fig 2 it covers an area of 5 km2 in an undulating clay till landscape a small stream flows from west to east along the main axis of the subcatchment transiting through an organic rich peat deposit which coincides with the delineated riparian lowland 0 2 km2 there is a small localised sand deposit adjacent to the riparian lowland in an otherwise clay dominated landscape fensholt is a predominantly agricultural catchment with a dense network of tile drains draining shallow groundwater into the nearby stream the flat riparian lowland mean slope 5 is bounded by steep slopes up to 62 6 which connect to elevated upland areas average rainfall is 624 89 mm y between 2000 and 2018 baseflow sustains streamflow during the summer with quick responses to rainfall during the winter 2 2 1 base model link to national model set up the fensholt model setup was based on the danish national water resources model which is henceforth referred to as the dk model the dk model covers the entire landmass of denmark and is setup using the mike she code https www mikepoweredbydhi com dhi 2019 a 3d physically based fully distributed catchment model with coupled simulation of surface water and groundwater overland flow is simulated using the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equations streams are simulated using 1d routing included surface water groundwater exchanges controlled by a conductance term abbott et al 1986 butts and graham 2005 groundwater flow is solved by a 3d finite difference scheme and includes subsurface drainage controlled by a conductance term and a time constant the saturated flow is coupled with a simplified linear unsaturated zone module yan and smith 1994 mike she can simulate the major terrestrial processes of the hydrological cycle and their interaction including precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff groundwater recharge groundwater flow and river flow butts and graham 2005 henriksen et al 2003 h√∏jberg et al 2015b calibration of the dk model s hydraulic conductivity values uses groundwater head and river discharge data for information on the dk model setup and calibration see henriksen et al 2003 h√∏jberg et al 2013 h√∏jberg et al 2015a stisen et al 2019 the structure and parameterisation of the fensholt model was based on the dk model the upper boundary condition was climatic data from the danish meteorological institute consisting of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and air temperature groundwater head boundary conditions were extracted from the dk model for the period of 1990 2019 the mike hydro package was used to simulate stream flow which couples to mike she dhi 2017 tile drainage was included 0 9 m below ground level grid scale on agricultural areas in the upland surrounding the lowland for further information refer to hansen et al 2019a 2019b the lowland soil classification was used to delineate the riparian lowland and no tile drainage was simulated in this zone the following spin up strategy was used in all simulations to ensure that the groundwater head initial conditions within the model did not influence the simulation firstly the model was run from 1990 to 2019 with the initial groundwater heads equal to land surface this is the best approximation for shallow groundwater heads in denmark the final groundwater heads and surface water elevations were used to initialise the final model run from 1990 to 2019 and results for analyses were extracted for the period 2000 2018 hence at total spin up period of 38 years was used 2 2 2 simulation of flow partitioning in riparian lowland noorduijn et al 2021 demonstrated that it is possible to simulate the overland and groundwater flow partitioning within the riparian lowland on an annual basis by refining the dk model using observed flow data from four transects it was demonstrated that the simulated overland and groundwater flow approached the observed flows when the grid resolution was 10 m or 20 m therefore the dk model was refined to a 20 m grid resolution and annual overland and groundwater flow data were extracted from the model from 2000 to 2018 2 3 step 2 perturbation of base model the use of a single catchment in this analysis would limit the applicability of the statistical machine learning model to catchments with similar hydrological and physical characteristics to overcome this limitation the base case model was perturbed based on physical characteristics present at the regional scale in central jutland highlighted in fig 2a the central part of the jutland peninsula has an undulating landscape its general geomorphology is a result of the extent of the icesheet during the last ice age the icesheet extent is clearly demarcated by a ridge of glacial deposits in a north south orientation in the centre of jutland the landscape to the west of the ridge is characterised by gently sloping hills with thick sand deposits characteristic of a glacial outwash plain conversely eastern jutland has a strongly undulated characteristic with much steeper slopes composed of interbedded clay and sand deposits the general characteristics of the riparian lowlands are influenced by the landscape they are situated in therefore we focused on four main physical characteristics of the danish landscape when modifying the fensholt model surficial geology the surficial soil deposits can broadly be classified into clay and sand dominated areas see fig 3 a where the fensholt catchment is in a clay dominated area arvidsen et al 2020 to reflect the impact of the surficial deposits on the hydrological responses in the lowland a model perturbation was created by altering the distribution of soil hydraulic conductivity k to simulate a sand dominated environment fig 4 b geology the fensholt catchments subsurface geology has thick clay layers interbedded with sand lenses arvidsen et al 2020 prinds et al 2020 to replicate the subsurface geology typical in both eastern clay dominated and western sand dominated jutland fig 3c we exchanged the hydraulic conductivities of the adjacent sand and clay layers fig 4e and f while the layer geometries were not altered topography the geomorphological characteristics for denmark were evaluated at the id15 catchment scale fig 3b dhm 2023 to reflect conditions in a less undulating landscape the base model topography was smoothed using the uniform filter method from the python library scipy with a filter size of 30 m by 30 m 3x3 grid cells centred on the target grid cell this method calculates the average topography based on the topography of the cells within the filter area and assigns it to the target grid cell centre of the filter fig 4c shows the base case topography of the fensholt catchments and fig 4d highlights where the topographical elevation was changed as a result of the filtering process peat hydraulic conductivity peat ks in the dk model the peat deposits have a spatially uniform hydraulic conductivity k 2 33 10 5 ms 1 this is due to the limitations imposed by the grid scale of the dk model and due to the limited data availability describing the spatial variability of peat across dk conditions in the field are highly heterogeneous and strongly influenced by the surrounding surficial deposits consequently we have chosen to modify the k of the peat deposits such that the k reflects a transition from a sand dominated system to a clay dominated system although heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity within the peat will exist we limit the study to consider a homogenous effective hydraulic conductivity partly due to limited knowledge on the heterogeneity and partly to better isolate the importance of the hydraulic conductivity of the peat four peat k values were used between 2 33 10 4 2 33 10 7 m s 1 with an order of magnitude between each table 1 the peat k classes forms the main basis for grouping the models where all 16 models are listed in table 1 2 4 step 3 segregation of lowland to maximise the data obtainable from the model which is used for the machine learning training we apply a novel approach whereby the lowland is segmented based on the overland flow patterns overland flow is simulated using the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equations the overland flow routing for each surface cells within the model is based on distance to the closest stream and topographic slope as such each cell is associated with a stream reach whose length is determined by the gird resolution within the model and surface roughness manning s n and slope are used to simulate the overland flow rate therefore each stream reach has an associated source area consisting of numerous cells representing subcatchments within the lowland from which geomorphological and hydrological data can be extracted the associated source area changes with the length of the stream reach a longer stream reach will have a larger source area or subcatchment and the simulated hydrological responses will be a lumped average response due to the larger source area whereas a shorter stream reach will have a smaller source area and will therefore provide a more localised hydrological response the sizes of these segments are linked to the overland flow source area for a given length of stream and are therefore referred to based on the length of the stream reach fig 5 the overland flow segments appear orthogonal to the stream due to the coarse nature of the dem used to delineate them 20 m and the generally low slope within the lowland mean slope 5 this approach produces a total number of 48 subcatchments ranging from the entire lowland to 100 m stream reaches this approach increases the available data and diversity in the segment statistics which is important for the subsequent training of the machine learning algorithm and upscaling potential a key assumption in using the segments to quantify the flow partitioning is that the dominant flow direction is from the riparian boundary towards the corresponding stream reach for both groundwater flow and overland flow petersen et al 2020a we therefore assume that any lateral flow present is negligible noorduijn et al 2021 demonstrated that this assumption is valid where overland flow is dominant on an annual basis the simulated overland and groundwater flows into the riparian segments and into the corresponding stream reaches were extracted from each of the 16 models the simulated flow data were obtained for 2000 to 2018 and we also included the mean annual flow for these years as an additional data point this resulted in a total 19 years of flow data for each segment and the average flows providing a total of 960 data points number of segments 20 flow data points for each model a total of 15 360 data points for all 16 models the flow into the segments at the upland boundary will hence forth be referred to as the upland hydraulic flux and is included as a covariate in the subsequent analysis see table 2 the target variable of the analysis is the fraction of overland flow f o riv which represents the degree to which a lowland is dominated by overland flow f o riv r y o r y o r y g r y where o r y and g r y refers to the overland and groundwater flow into the river reach r for year y mm y a f o riv value of zero indicates no overland flow contribution to the stream therefore we assume that such a system will have a high nutrient reduction capacity a f o riv value greater than zero indicates that there is some amount of overland flow contribution to the stream and therefore the nutrient reduction capacity is inversely linked to the modelled f o riv value 2 5 step 4 environmental covariates the environmental covariates represent the properties which might best influence the flow dynamics within the riparian lowland selection of relevant environmental covariates is based on previous research and our process understanding of flow dynamics within riparian lowlands prior to training the statistical machine learning model it is unclear which environmental covariates will assist in predicting the overland flow partitioning therefore we have included all potentially relevant covariates in the training process for each lowland segment we extract 22 stationary environmental covariates based on statistics of 9 selected variables table 2 vidon and hill 2004a established a conceptual model of riparian behaviour using 8 study sites in a till environment in canada the main characteristics were sediment permeability upland hydraulic pressure and slope among these slope will have a strong influence on overland flow within the riparian lowland by definition riparian lowlands tend to occur in flat areas so three different measures of slope are used elevation difference Œ¥elev general slope slopegeneral and local slope slopegrid the Œ¥elev is the change in elevation between the riparian zone boundary and stream the slopegeneral is Œ¥elev divided by the distance to the stream and the slopegrid is determined by gis analysis of the 10 m dem to obtain spatially derived slope data dahl et al 2007 developed typologies that classify riparian lowlands based on the groundwater aquifer type and hydraulic setting these types describe different levels of connectivity between the riparian lowland and the aquifer connected disconnected or confined and the aquifer types local or regional this typology indicates that the subsurface geological information such as depth to a confining layer and hydraulic parameters are important metrics for describing the groundwater flow response in view of this covariates related to the aquifer structure and hydraulic properties were included namely depth to clay occurrence and aquifer transmissivity and hydraulic properties the depth to clay occurrence was determined using the dk models geological model stisen et al 2019 and provides information on the thickness of the higher hydraulic conductivity sand layers above the upper clay layer the hydraulic covariates within the riparian lowland were obtained from the hydrological model the number of layers to consider when extracting the statistics was guided by the depth of the stream aquifer interactions in the fensholt model the stream directly interacts with the top 4 model layers therefore statistics for the transmissivity and horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity were extracted for the top four model layers within the riparian segments due to the log normal distribution of these covariates these values were log transformed to obtain a standard normal distribution which is preferred in the statistical analysis the inclusion of the upland hydraulic pressure in the statistical analysis also assumes this information is available for other riparian lowlands it is possible to extract this information from the dk model however given the precision and resolution of this data the partitioning of overland and groundwater flow into the lowlands will be very uncertain therefore in order to reduce uncertainty we consider the total hydraulic pressure oup gup into the lowlands rather than the individual components the information extracted from all 16 models base case and perturbed of the fensholt catchment are referred to as the fensholt dataset 2 6 step 5 statistical machine learning model predicting flow partitioning the primary aim of the statistical analysis is to deduce some multi dimensional relationships that describe the overland flow contribution to streams within riparian lowlands using physical properties covariates that are mappable for all riparian lowlands in denmark and the hydraulic pressure at the riparian lowland boundary the following workflow was used to train and evaluate the statistical model 1 preprocess fensholt dataset environmental covariates and f o riv a the fensholt dataset was separated into training 65 and validation 35 subsets using a random sampling method b standardisation of all the covariates in the training dataset 2 train the statistical model using the training subset 3 evaluate the predictive capabilities of the trained model using the validation dataset we used a random forest rf algorithm to predict f o riv the rf was performed in python using the scikit learn package pedregosa et al 2011 2 6 1 data preprocessing training and validating datasets separation of the fensholt dataset into a training and validation dataset provides additional means of validating the trained model all steps in the development of the statistical model were based on the training dataset and stored the same procedures and stored parameterisations were then applied to the validation dataset in this way the validation dataset is treated as an independent dataset from the training dataset standardisation the covariate values are scaled to a standard normal distribution mean 0 standard deviation 1 to ensure that they are all treated equally this involved dividing the mean centred values by their standard deviation x i j s x i j x j œÉ j where x i j s refers to the scaled value of the j th covariate of the i th data point x j to the mean and œÉ j to the standard deviation of the j th covariate both the mean and standard deviation are computed from the training data 2 6 2 random forest rf random forest is a supervised machine learning technique which has been successfully applied to numerous water resource questions tyralis et al 2019 koch et al 2019a and koch et al 2019b demonstrated that the random forest machine learning approach is capable of predicting both groundwater levels and depth to redox interface by using results from low resolution numerical model simulations as part of the training data random forest rf is composed of a number of decision trees each tree is grown by recursively splitting the training data into more homogenous groups breiman 2001 each tree is grown using a bootstrapped subset of the training data generated through a process referred to as bagging bagging is the process whereby subsets of the training dataset are generated by bootstrapping with replacement bootstrapping with replacement will increase the probability for the same training data instance to occur in multiple subsets and therefore trees whilst others may not be sampled at all the training subset passed to each tree represents approximately 66 7 of the instances from the original training data this is referred to as the in the bag subset of the data the remaining 33 3 of the training data are referred to as the out of bag and play no role in training the tree the in the bag and out of bag subsets will be different for each tree in the forest once trained the rf model provides an out of bag prediction for each instance in the training dataset based on the average prediction across all trees where the data point was withheld at each branch in the tree the split is determined using a random subset of the training covariates this means that each branch in the tree will be based on percentage of the covariates in the training data randomising the covariates used in branch development and bagging decrease the accuracy of individual trees but increase the diversity in trees resulting in a more robust prediction when averaging across all trees biau and scornet 2016 2 6 3 model evaluation model performance the performance of the rf model was quantified based on the following metrics on the out of bag oob predictions and the predictions for the validation dataset pearson s correlation coefficient r2 spearman s correlation coefficient rs the kendall s rank coefficient œÑ root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae the pearson s r2 spearman s rs and kendall s œÑ coefficients provide information on the correlation between the simulated and predicted f oriv the pearson s r2 provides a measure of the degree of the relationship between linearly related variables and assumes a normal distribution both kendall s œÑ and spearman s rs are non parametric tests used to measure the degree of association and strength between variables spearman s rs does this by ranking the variables and comparing the corresponding ranks between the variables whilst kendalls œÑ compares the ordinal association between the variables neither spearman s rs nor kendall s œÑ make assumptions of the distribution of the variables as discussed above the oob predictions represent predictions generated by withholding part of the training dataset during the development of the rf model the validation dataset represents an external independent dataset whose data was not used in training the rf model therefore rf model predictions for the validation dataset provide an additional rf model evaluation option to investigate the reliability of these metrics an additional 10 fold cross validation cv test of the model was performed the fensholt dataset was split into a training dataset 67 of the available training data and a validation dataset 33 of the available training data the cv test splits the training dataset into 10 subsets of approximately 10 of the training data sequentially each subset is withheld from the training dataset and the models trained on the remaining 90 of the data the model performance is then evaluated on the validation dataset the final 10 fold cv score is the average score across all subset covariate importance rf models can provide a quantitative assessment of the importance of each covariate this information can be useful to better understand the rf model and provide a rationality check of its physical meaningfulness we applied a permutation accuracy approach similar to that used by koch et al 2019b whereby we iteratively exclude one or more covariates retrain the rf model and note how the oob pearson s r2 and rmse changes if removal of a single covariate or group of covariates results in a large change in the oob rmse or r2 then that covariate or group of covariates is considered important in modelling the target variable determining the importance can be obscured by correlation between covariates strobl et al 2008 given that information lost when removing a covariate will still be preserved in those covariates to which it is correlated therefore we applied three covariate grouping strategies first permuting each covariate each statistic secondly permuting each covariate type all statistics for a given covariate and thirdly creating groups of physically related covariates and permuting the groups table 2 2 6 4 model sensitivity analysis the lowland segmentation approach implemented in this study assumes that the covariates of a segment are independent of the scale of the segment to explore this assumption we performed a simple sensitivity analysis by repeating step 5 after removing the data from the 100 m segments fig 5a the removal of these data will reduce the size of the training data from 15 360 to 8 000 this dataset will henceforth be referred to as the truncated dataset 2 7 step 6 regional scale applications the trained rf model was applied to riparian lowlands in the 12 785 5 km2 dk model area for central jutland fig 2 to explore its applicability and predictive potential in areas beyond the fensholt catchment the 100 m dk model was used to extract both flow and hydraulic parameters for each of the lowlands within the target area the mean annual upland flux from 2000 to 2010 was used for further analysis data are available on the distribution and shape of riparian lowlands based on the presence of organic rich peat across denmark at a 25 m resolution and within each lowland all covariate values were extracted the topographic and slope statistics for each riparian lowland was based on the same 10 m resolution grid data used in the fensholt dataset see supplementary data for methodology these data will hence forth be referred to as the c dk dataset application of the rf model to this c dk dataset assumes that the model is suitably reliable for application in this extended area assuming this was the case reliability means that the accuracy of model predictions is on average the same as its accuracy on the training dataset however the c dk dataset is likely to contain lowlands whose various covariate characteristics are beyond the range of data in the training dataset application of the model to these lowlands means that the predictions would be considered more uncertain therefore the applicability of the rf model to the c dk dataset was assessed by comparing the ranges of the covariates in both the fensholt dataset all 16 models table 1 and the c dk dataset the c dk lowland covariate values were standardised using the mean and standard deviation from the fensholt dataset the resulting standardised c dk covariate dataset will therefore have a standard normal distribution based on the covariate values in fensholt dataset outliers could therefore be identified as data points that falls outside a predefined number of standard deviations std from the mean the impact of outlier removal on the predicted categorization of lowlands was explored the models were applied to the entire dataset including outliers and to lowlands within 4 and 6 standard deviations from the mean 3 results 3 1 training and testing of models 3 1 1 flow partitioning the riparian lowland segmentation resulted in 15 360 simulated f oriv by the 16 perturbed models of the fensholt catchment the f oriv is strongly influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the overlying peat the cumulative distribution functions cdf shown in fig 6 a clearly show that in general there is a clear correlation between the peat kh and the partitioning of flow into the stream with the lower peat kh values being clearly more dominated by overland flow than high peat kh values for example the fraction of segments where f oriv 0 25 i e groundwater dominated for peat kh of 10 4 ms 1 10 5 ms 1 10 6 ms 1 and 10 7 ms 1 are 0 76 0 59 0 40 and 0 33 respectively fig 6b shows the cdf based on segment length and therefore reflects the impact of spatial heterogeneity in flows as the segment lengths decrease the cdfs are similar for all segment lengths where approx 40 of the segments have no overland flow contribution to the stream only the segments 1000 m and the entire lowland deviate with less groundwater dominance in the simulations a higher number of overland flow dominated segments and a less smooth cdf the shapes of the cdf for these larger segments have a number of steps which can be attributed to the various responses for the different model perturbations listed in table 1 3 1 2 random forest model the rf model was used to predict the fraction of overland flow into the connected river reach f oriv within the riparian lowland using 23 covariates table 2 the rf regression model was constrained by the following parameterisation the number of decision trees was one hundred bootstrapping with replacement was used to generate training subsets for each tree 25 of covariates were considered when splitting the data the trees were pruned to a maximum depth of 10 to prevent overfitting with no limit to the maximum number of nodes in each tree rmse was used to determine the optimal model parametrisation the predictive performance of the rf model is shown in fig 7 for 1 the average prediction of the training dataset only over trees where data were withheld during rf training as an out of bag oob sample 2 the average prediction over all trees for the validation dataset and 3 the average prediction over all trees for the entire dataset the rf prediction for the entire dataset is presented for reference only and should not be used to evaluate the model performance conversely both the oob and validation dataset predictions of f o riv provide an independent evaluation of the model performance and in both cases the rf model is able to capture a substantial proportion of the variability in the dataset with a spearman s rank rs kendall s œÑ coefficient and root mean squared error of rmse approx 0 967 0 863 and 0 053 for the oob predictions and 0 968 0 866 and 0 051 for the validation dataset table 3 the pearson s r2 metric is less informative than either spearman s rank rs and kendall s œÑ coefficient due to the bias toward f o riv of 0 in the dataset producing r2 values very close to 1 this is not corroborated by the scatter visible in fig 7a the results of the cross validation are very similar to both the oob and validation datasets metrics table 3 this agreement provides validity to both the oob and the validations metrics as a means to quantify the accuracy of the rf model to provide insight into the larger scale response of the riparian lowland fig 7b shows simulated and predicted f o riv for the entire lowland and segments 1000 m the simulated f o riv extracted from the base case model see table 1 for the entire lowland orange circles are clustered at 0 48 the addition of the perturbed models resulted in a larger range in simulated f o riv with minimum and maximum f o riv of approx 0 2 0 95 a similar increase in simulated f o riv is shown of the 1000 m segments where the base case model simulated values in two clusters the first cluster falls between 0 12 and 0 49 and the second cluster at 0 69 blue dots in fig 7b the inclusion of the perturbed models expands this range considerably blue crosses in fig 7b fig 8 shows the covariate importance based on the concept of permutation accuracy and highlights that the hydrogeology geology group has the highest importance in the trained rf model with a 26 and 289 decrease in the rf models performance for kendall s œÑ and rmse respectively when this group is permuted the terrain and upland flux covariate groups are of diminishing importance to the rf model with a drop in model performance of 6 and 2 for kendall s œÑ and 63 and 17 in rmse permutation through both the covariate statistics light blue bars in fig 8a and individual covariates coloured bars in fig 8a has minimal impact on kendall s tau 2 decrease value conversely the rmse was affected by the permutation through both the covariate types and individual covariates fig 8b of the covariate types light blue bars in fig 8b transmissivity 16 is the most important followed by kv 14 and slopegeneral 14 while the least important covariate is distance 10 when each individual covariate statistic coloured bars in fig 8b was considered

to clay mean rmse and kendall s œÑ of 12 and 1 respectively Œ¥elev mean rmse and kendall s œÑ of 11 and 1 respectively distance mean rmse and kendall s œÑ of 11 and 1 respectively were the top six most sensitive environmental covariates and the least sensitive covariate was kv std which resulted in a minor deterioration in rmse and kendall s œÑ 8 and 1 respectively we chose to retain this covariate in the subsequent analysis given that inclusion only has a very minor impact on model performance 3 2 regional scale applications 3 2 1 covariates data were collected for 2802 lowlands in central jutland through gis analysis and extraction from the numerical model of the region the ranges in covariate values were then compared to those extracted from the fensholt dataset in fig 9 in general there is overlap in covariate value ranges however there are four covariates where 50 of the covariate values in the c dk dataset are beyond the range in the fensholt dataset namely t min kv mean kh max and kv max therefore the predicted f o riv for lowlands whose for example kh max values are beyond the range of the training dataset will be more uncertain the covariate importance can provide guidance as to how applicable the rf model is to a new dataset of the aforementioned four covariates t min kv mean kh max and kv max their individual importance varies however the importance of the collective type t kv and kh exceeds the individual covariate statistics importance this suggests that even for cases where individual covariate values are beyond the range of the fensholt dataset the uncertainty in the predicted f o riv may not be much larger than the prediction uncertainty seen for the training dataset in light of this we have chosen to exclude some lowlands from analysis by assessing whether any covariate values for the top five environmental covariate and upland flux total of six covariates related to that lowland is within x standard deviations of the mean of the fensholt dataset for example lowland a and b have standardised values for t mean of 2 3 and 4 5 if the threshold is 4 standard deviations then lowland a is included in the analysis and lowland b is excluded as the number of std increases so do the number of lowlands included in the analysis in the case for 4 standard deviations the resulting c dk dataset includes 89 of the lowlands if this is increased to 6 standard deviations the resulting c dk dataset includes 96 of the lowlands however the uncertainty in the predictions will increase 3 2 2 rf model predictions fig 10 shows a map of the predicted f o riv across lowlands in the c dk dataset for the year 2005 for a those c dk lowlands best represented by the training dataset based on the six most sensitive covariates i e within 4 std b lowlands within 6 std which will include some outliers and c all data which will include all outliers at the individual lowland scale there is a spatial trend in f o riv fig 10a b c with a higher diversity in the predicted f o riv values to the east than to the west of the c dk area predicted f o riv values 0 5 tend to be located in the east of the c dk area whereas predicted f o riv of 0 5 are distributed across the area when aggregating lowland f o riv to subcatchment scale in fig 10d e and f the east west pattern is harder to distinguish this spatial pattern in both the individual lowlands and aggregated subcatchment scales are maintained as more outliers are included into the dataset fig 11 a shows that inclusion of outliers only has a very small impact on the distribution of predictions for the rf model 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the rf model s f o riv predictions to the segment sizes included in the fensholt training dataset was explored by excluding the 100 m segments from the training dataset and retraining the rf model henceforth predictions based on this model will be referred to as f o riv sen the spatial pattern in f o riv sen predictions show a similar spatial pattern to those shown in fig 10 see fig sd similar to the f o riv predictions f o riv sen 0 5 are evenly distributed throughout the c dk areas and f o riv sen 0 5 are more abundant to the east of the c dk area to assess the robustness of the rf predictions for the c dk lowlands we have compared the f o riv and f o riv sen predictions fig 11a and the differences referred to as the residuals are illustrated in fig 11b the residuals appear to have a negligible difference in mean 0 05 and a relatively small standard deviation 0 09 inclusion of outlier lowlands does not impact the spread of residuals indicating that the rf model is robust to predictions when covariates are beyond values in the training dataset 4 discussion 4 1 upscaling approach we developed a dynamic upscaling approach that is unique in the sense that we combined high quality field data on flow partitioning from a riparian lowland petersen et al 2020a a downscaled fine resolution numerical model noorduijn et al 2021 and a machine learning technique random forest regression to enable prediction of flow partitioning in riparian lowland from generally available covariates this approach can be used to predict the flow partitioning in riparian lowlands for specific years or the mean annual behaviour to our knowledge few studies have combined hydrological model simulations and spatial data together with machine learning applications in an upscaling approach koch et al 2019a koch et al 2019b are examples which use the combination of spatial and simulated covariates and machine learning methods to predict depth to the redox interface and refining simulated water table depth this work also indicates the potential of rf to predict a spatially integrated response namely the flow partitioning in an entire lowland in the current study we rely on simulated flow partitioning from a single riparian lowland to limit the impact of a using a single riparian lowland model we developed additional data extraction methods to fully capitalize on the information available from numerical simulations this was necessary to ensure both size of the training data set and diversity in the covariate values 4 2 predictive ability of the rf models based on the fensholt training dataset which we constructed by combining knowledge inferred from the detailed field data in the fensholt lowland with the nationwide covariate data we trained a random forest rf model the rf performance was based on five metrics which clearly demonstrated that the rf model was able to accurately predict f o riv from the covariates the structure of the different decision trees that form the rf model was explored by permuting through the covariates this provided a quantitative means to explore the importance of the covariates in the rf model which otherwise functions as a black box the covariate importance for the training dataset indicated that the upland hydraulic flux slopegeneral and transmissivity contributed the most to reducing the rf models predictive error conceptually these covariates align well with our understanding of the riparian lowland characteristics governing the partitioning into groundwater and overland flow vidon and hill 2004b attributed similar characteristics in development of their conceptual model which linked the depth of permeable sediments in the upland and riparian lowland topography riparian soil texture and hydraulic connectivity to nitrate removal fig 7 vidon and hill 2004b the generation of overland flow is often linked to high slope gradients tetzlaff et al 2009 or sudden changes in slope that can induce surface groundwater seepage gold et al 2002 riparian lowlands by definition often lie in the valley floor and have minimal slope the importance of slopegeneral as opposed to slopegrid indicates that the slope within the riparian lowland does not influence the prediction of f o riv as much as the overall slope e g between boundary to stream the subsurface geological structure will impact both the groundwater flow and the potential generation of overland flow within the riparian lowland dahl et al 2007 fig 8 clearly demonstrates that the permutation of covariates related to the riparian lowlands hydrogeology significantly increases the rf model error of the individual hydrogeology covariate types the transmissivity which combines the layer thickness and horizontal hydraulic conductivity is the most important this means that significant improvement in the estimation of the flow partitioning and thereby the potential nutrient reduction in lowlands can be obtained through geological and hydrogeological mapping of the lowlands it is noted that the covariates originate from a combination of field data terrain hydrogeology and simulations with the national hydrological model upland hydraulic flux this is a major breakthrough compared to the study of dahl et al 2007 who introduced the flow partitioning concept in riparian lowlands and analysed conditions in denmark their analyses were mainly qualitative and they were not able to identify unambiguous relationships between riparian hydrogeology and flow partitioning our findings suggest that rf is a very powerful tool to exploit information in covariates and that adding model simulated upland hydraulic flux is a necessary covariate for predicting flow partitioning in a riparian lowland 4 3 model applicability and uncertainties the trained rf model was used to predict the f oriv for riparian lowland in the central jutland c dk region determining the accuracy of the predicted spatial pattern is challenging due to the limited field data available nonetheless the results appear encouraging the spatial pattern reflects the expected pattern of a general tendency to lower f o riv in the flatter sandy western part of c dk compared to the clay dominated and more hilly eastern part the base case dk model for the fensholt catchment used for the training dataset indicated f o riv for the riparian lowland was 0 48 this lowland is within the c dk region therefore all covariates and inflows were extracted from the 100 m dk model based on this information the rf model predicted f o riv of 0 38 this demonstrates some degree of robustness in the rf model even though covariate values will differ when derived from a 20 m model and 100 m model the mean annual upland flux from the base case fensholt model is 611 mm y compared to 39 mm y from the c dk model this difference in upland flux can be attributed to the impacts of grid scale on the generation on overland flow within the riparian lowlands the topographic slopes within the c dk model are in general smaller than within the 20 m fensholt models resulting to lower near surface hydraulic gradients this is the likely cause for the difference in mean annual flux between the 20 m and 100 m models the distinctive difference in the distributions between the training data and the c dk predictions is interesting the segmentation of the riparian lowland resulted in a dominance of segments with no overland flow contribution to the stream in the fensholt training dataset this demonstrates that the overland flow contribution to the stream is a localised occurrence in comparison the predicted values of f o riv for c dk riparian lowlands are all 0 however the range in c dk predictions closely matches the range in simulated f o riv for the entire fensholt riparian lowland from the different perturbed models we have established the rf model on the basis of information from a combination of i observed flow partitioning data in a single riparian lowland ii a high resolution hydrological model for this lowland and iii a wide range of covariate data covering nationwide conditions although the rf model shows a very high level of accuracy from the tests against the training dataset the underlying assumptions introduce a considerable uncertainty into the rf predictions when extrapolated to the c dk area two of the key assumptions are that the perturbations of hydrogeological conditions result in theoretical lowland configurations that are representative for the real lowlands and that the hydrological model is able to simulate flow partitioning also in the lowlands that represent extrapolations from the base model in fensholt assessing the validity of these assumptions requires additional comprehensive field and modelling studies that are beyond the scope of the present study to obtain an estimate of the level of uncertainty involved we have performed a simple sensitivity analysis where we have truncated the training dataset by omitting the 100 m reaches comparing the rf model derived from the full dataset with an rf model derived from the truncated dataset provides an uncertainty measure the comparison of the two rf models across all c dk lowlands shows a negligible difference in the mean overland flow fraction and a standard deviation of the differences of 0 09 which is 25 of the predicted mean the comparison also shows that the lowlands with covariates exceeding those represented in the training dataset do not result in large prediction differences which can be seen as an indication of model robustness the f o riv prediction uncertainties are most likely larger than what is seen in the simple sensitivity analysis however the results of the sensitivity analysis are encouraging as they suggest some level of robustness being able to differentiate between the n reduction potential across lowlands is a major step forward in national nitrate management and regulation compared to the present approach in which all lowlands have to be considered equal 5 conclusion riparian lowlands play a key role in buffering aquatic systems from excess groundwater nitrate which has leached from adjacent farmland quantifying their n reduction capacity at a national scale remains a challenge consequently they are often treated uniformly in reality the spatial variability in nitrate reduction capacity will vary within and between lowlands limited data availability makes it difficult to assess lowland reduction at the national scale lowland nutrient reduction capacity has been linked to flow path partitioning if an aquatic system is primarily fed by groundwater the potential for n reduction is high conversely if overland flow dominates the reduction capacity is low this study focusses on using rf to predict the fraction of overland flow contribution to streams in riparian lowlands we used a high resolution model of a riparian lowland to simulate the hydrological responses and based our training dataset upon the simulated fluxes terrain and hydrogeological conditions in the model by perturbing key terrain and hydrogeological elements in the model we were able to create additional model realisations of the riparian lowland rather than rely on a single model which also expands the dataset to be more representative of riparian lowlands across denmark the trained rf model was able to capture most of the variability in the training dataset this was then used to predict the fraction of overland flow in riparian lowlands in the central jutland region although there is limited data available for lowlands in this area the results look highly plausible this regional map can provide an initial step to incorporating the spatial variability in lowland flow dynamics into the danish nitrogen model which from a practical water management perspective is a major step forward

1984,riparian lowlands are important for protecting aquatic ecosystems threatened by contamination their ability to attenuate and reduce nutrient rich water provides a useful ecosystem service previous field studies have shown that the hydrological conditions within a lowland can affect their reduction capabilities dependent on the dominant flow pathways i e surface runoff groundwater discharge and drain flow for example the likelihood of nutrient reduction within a riparian lowland dominated by surface runoff is low conversely if groundwater discharge dominates the likelihood is higher hence knowledge of the flow pathways can be used to provide a qualitative estimate of the reduction capacity in riparian lowlands information that is vital in assessing catchment scale processes the objective of this study is to establish a relationship between the dominant riparian flow pathways and lowland features such as slope and hydrogeology geology previous work had shown the ability of a downscaled high resolution numerical model to replicate observed annual flow patterns within a riparian lowland this downscaled numerical model was used to provide quantitative information regarding the riparian flow partitioning to diversify the dataset the riparian lowland was segmented to provide flow information at different scales and topographic and hydraulic properties within the model were perturbed to capture the range of topographic and geological characteristics present at large scale these data were then used to train a random forest rf model where the target variable was the fraction of overland flow applying the rf model to a 12 785 5 km2 large region in denmark provided a prediction in line with our understanding of the area this approach can prove useful in enhancing existing nitrate management tools by incorporating variability in lowland nitrate reduction capacity keywords modelling machine learning flow partitioning nitrate local scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction riparian lowlands have long been acknowledged to play a vital role for the quality of surface water bodies forming a biogeochemical filter which can remove and reduce potentially harmful nutrients contaminants in the groundwater prior to entering the hydraulically connected surface water hill 1996 naiman and d√©camps 1997 parsons et al 2004 the filtering ability of the riparian lowland is strongly influenced by the flow dynamics within the lowlands this means that when nutrient rich groundwater travels through such areas the strongly anoxic conditions coupled to the organic rich soils leads to strongly reducing conditions devito et al 2000 hill et al 2014 subsequent nutrient concentrations of any groundwater discharge are assumed to be negligible audet et al 2020 turetsky et al 2014 vidon and serchan 2016 the heterogeneity in both hydrogeological properties and settings of these environments will impact how water both overland flow and groundwater flow behave within the lowland area devito et al 2000 the dominant flow paths within a riparian lowland i e surface runoff groundwater discharge and or drain flow may be used as indicators of the potential for reduction of harmful nutrients to occur petersen et al 2020a petersen et al 2020b in particular field data has demonstrated that the nitrate n reduction capacity within lowlands can be linked to the amount of water entering the connected stream through lowland sediments petersen et al 2020b therefore the likelihood of n reduction within a riparian lowland dominated by overland flow is low conversely if groundwater discharge dominates the likelihood of n reduction is higher the challenge is then to determine the flow partitioning within a riparian lowland as an indirect measure of its n reduction capacity water management is often supported by spatially distributed models barlow et al 2003 barthel and banzhaf 2016 in denmark the national nitrogen model n model is used to inform the management strategies at the subcatchment scale 15 km2 referred to as id15 catchments h√∏jberg et al 2015a h√∏jberg et al 2021 the n model uses the danish national water resources model dk model see henriksen et al 2003 h√∏jberg et al 2013 and stisen et al 2019 as a basis for the subsurface flow and transport conditions the flow resolution relies on the grid scale of the dk model which has recently been reduced from 500 to 100 m however both resolutions are too coarse to spatially resolve the flow partitioning in riparian lowlands that typically cover less than one or a few model grids resolving the simulated flows within riparian lowlands requires refinement of the simulation grid such high resolution models can be computationally expensive and require additional data noorduijn et al 2021 demonstrated the potential of constructing a high resolution model of a riparian lowland by downscaling a calibrated national scale model that was able to replicate the observed flow partitioning within the lowland this downscaling approach represents a means to quantifying lowland flow partitioning however it is not feasible to apply this approach to all riparian lowlands due to the computationally expensive nature of high resolution models therefore an upscaling approach is required whereby the flow partitioning can be assessed from local scale data and applied to entire riparian lowlands ranging in area from 100 s 1000 s m2 this can subsequently be used in combination with management tools upscaling can be approached in several ways e g effective parameter approach de rooij 2009 wood 2009 distribution function approach cushman et al 2002 n≈ìtinger et al 2005 and dynamic upscaling approach hansen et al 2018 zehe et al 2006 effective parameter upscaling relies on the assumption that our process understanding and therefore mathematical representation thereof is applicable at a larger scale in such case an effective parameter set can be determined which will reproduce the average behaviour at the larger scale e g noorduijn et al 2014 another approach is to represent the upscaled parameters as distributions accounting for heterogeneity in the system herbst and diekkr√ºger 2002 the distribution function approach is commonly applied in geostatistics where multiple model realisations are generated using the parameter distributions carrera et al 2005 de marsily et al 2005 mariethoz et al 2010 dynamic upscaling is presented by hansen et al 2018 and refsgaard et al 2019 whereby some relationships are derived from a high resolution model for subsequent use in a coarser resolution model an advantage of this is that the relationships that are derived from a physically based model then is scaled for application at the target scale in this study we adopt a dynamic upscaling approach by combining a fine scale numerical model of a catchment containing a riparian lowland with detailed field data on flow partitioning and generally available covariates on riparian lowland conditions from this we investigate which landscape characteristics and hydraulic properties are most important in depicting flow partitioning within the lowland we hypothesize that the flow partitioning within a riparian lowland is controlled by the hydraulic pressure groundwater and overland flow into the riparian lowland from the upland areas and the physical characteristics of the lowland such as slope hydraulic conductivity and aquifer geometry therefore the high resolution model will enable differentiation of overland and groundwater flow pathways at the riparian boundary and their subsequent discharge into the stream this provides a basis upon which to relate the hydrological flows into the riparian lowland at its boundary to the flow partitioning into the connected stream this investigation represents an initial attempt to quantitatively differentiating between riparian lowlands based on flow dynamics and physical characterises 2 methodology in this study a high resolution 10 m grid scale numerical model of a catchment containing a riparian lowland is used to simulate the flow dynamics within a riparian lowland these data are then used to train a statistical machine learning model to predict the flow dynamics within the riparian lowland the training dataset for the statistical machine learning model is extended by modifying some of the properties within the fine resolution numerical model which alters the flow dynamics within the riparian lowland these modifications influence the riparian lowlands flow dynamics thereby providing additional information to the machine learning model the statistical machine learning model was then used to predict the flow dynamics in riparian lowlands in central denmark using data taken from the lower resolution 100 m grid scale danish national hydrological model the following sections provide in depth description of the approach 2 1 general approach the general approach in this study uses the following strategic steps fig 1 1 step 1 develop and test a high resolution local scale hydrological model base model capable of simulating flow partitioning overland flow subsurface flow for a riparian lowland 2 step 2 generalise the base model by perturbing it to cover the typical ranges of geomorphological conditions throughout the area of interest denmark 3 step 3 develop an approach to extract information from a single riparian lowland by segregation based on overland flow patterns 4 step 4 identify environmental covariates that are generally available throughout the area of interest 5 step 5 develop a statistical machine learning model that can simulate the fraction of overland flow to the river from environmental covariates 6 step 6 test the statistical machine learning model on a subset of danish lowlands the following sections describe the details in each step of the methodology 2 2 step 1 base model a local hydrological model was developed for the fensholt subcatchment where comprehensive field and modelling studies have been carried out de schepper et al 2017 hansen et al 2019a 2019b hansen 2002 petersen et al 2020a 2020b prinds et al 2020 2019 the fensholt subcatchment is in the headwaters of the norsminde catchment in eastern jutland denmark fig 2 it covers an area of 5 km2 in an undulating clay till landscape a small stream flows from west to east along the main axis of the subcatchment transiting through an organic rich peat deposit which coincides with the delineated riparian lowland 0 2 km2 there is a small localised sand deposit adjacent to the riparian lowland in an otherwise clay dominated landscape fensholt is a predominantly agricultural catchment with a dense network of tile drains draining shallow groundwater into the nearby stream the flat riparian lowland mean slope 5 is bounded by steep slopes up to 62 6 which connect to elevated upland areas average rainfall is 624 89 mm y between 2000 and 2018 baseflow sustains streamflow during the summer with quick responses to rainfall during the winter 2 2 1 base model link to national model set up the fensholt model setup was based on the danish national water resources model which is henceforth referred to as the dk model the dk model covers the entire landmass of denmark and is setup using the mike she code https www mikepoweredbydhi com dhi 2019 a 3d physically based fully distributed catchment model with coupled simulation of surface water and groundwater overland flow is simulated using the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equations streams are simulated using 1d routing included surface water groundwater exchanges controlled by a conductance term abbott et al 1986 butts and graham 2005 groundwater flow is solved by a 3d finite difference scheme and includes subsurface drainage controlled by a conductance term and a time constant the saturated flow is coupled with a simplified linear unsaturated zone module yan and smith 1994 mike she can simulate the major terrestrial processes of the hydrological cycle and their interaction including precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff groundwater recharge groundwater flow and river flow butts and graham 2005 henriksen et al 2003 h√∏jberg et al 2015b calibration of the dk model s hydraulic conductivity values uses groundwater head and river discharge data for information on the dk model setup and calibration see henriksen et al 2003 h√∏jberg et al 2013 h√∏jberg et al 2015a stisen et al 2019 the structure and parameterisation of the fensholt model was based on the dk model the upper boundary condition was climatic data from the danish meteorological institute consisting of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and air temperature groundwater head boundary conditions were extracted from the dk model for the period of 1990 2019 the mike hydro package was used to simulate stream flow which couples to mike she dhi 2017 tile drainage was included 0 9 m below ground level grid scale on agricultural areas in the upland surrounding the lowland for further information refer to hansen et al 2019a 2019b the lowland soil classification was used to delineate the riparian lowland and no tile drainage was simulated in this zone the following spin up strategy was used in all simulations to ensure that the groundwater head initial conditions within the model did not influence the simulation firstly the model was run from 1990 to 2019 with the initial groundwater heads equal to land surface this is the best approximation for shallow groundwater heads in denmark the final groundwater heads and surface water elevations were used to initialise the final model run from 1990 to 2019 and results for analyses were extracted for the period 2000 2018 hence at total spin up period of 38 years was used 2 2 2 simulation of flow partitioning in riparian lowland noorduijn et al 2021 demonstrated that it is possible to simulate the overland and groundwater flow partitioning within the riparian lowland on an annual basis by refining the dk model using observed flow data from four transects it was demonstrated that the simulated overland and groundwater flow approached the observed flows when the grid resolution was 10 m or 20 m therefore the dk model was refined to a 20 m grid resolution and annual overland and groundwater flow data were extracted from the model from 2000 to 2018 2 3 step 2 perturbation of base model the use of a single catchment in this analysis would limit the applicability of the statistical machine learning model to catchments with similar hydrological and physical characteristics to overcome this limitation the base case model was perturbed based on physical characteristics present at the regional scale in central jutland highlighted in fig 2a the central part of the jutland peninsula has an undulating landscape its general geomorphology is a result of the extent of the icesheet during the last ice age the icesheet extent is clearly demarcated by a ridge of glacial deposits in a north south orientation in the centre of jutland the landscape to the west of the ridge is characterised by gently sloping hills with thick sand deposits characteristic of a glacial outwash plain conversely eastern jutland has a strongly undulated characteristic with much steeper slopes composed of interbedded clay and sand deposits the general characteristics of the riparian lowlands are influenced by the landscape they are situated in therefore we focused on four main physical characteristics of the danish landscape when modifying the fensholt model surficial geology the surficial soil deposits can broadly be classified into clay and sand dominated areas see fig 3 a where the fensholt catchment is in a clay dominated area arvidsen et al 2020 to reflect the impact of the surficial deposits on the hydrological responses in the lowland a model perturbation was created by altering the distribution of soil hydraulic conductivity k to simulate a sand dominated environment fig 4 b geology the fensholt catchments subsurface geology has thick clay layers interbedded with sand lenses arvidsen et al 2020 prinds et al 2020 to replicate the subsurface geology typical in both eastern clay dominated and western sand dominated jutland fig 3c we exchanged the hydraulic conductivities of the adjacent sand and clay layers fig 4e and f while the layer geometries were not altered topography the geomorphological characteristics for denmark were evaluated at the id15 catchment scale fig 3b dhm 2023 to reflect conditions in a less undulating landscape the base model topography was smoothed using the uniform filter method from the python library scipy with a filter size of 30 m by 30 m 3x3 grid cells centred on the target grid cell this method calculates the average topography based on the topography of the cells within the filter area and assigns it to the target grid cell centre of the filter fig 4c shows the base case topography of the fensholt catchments and fig 4d highlights where the topographical elevation was changed as a result of the filtering process peat hydraulic conductivity peat ks in the dk model the peat deposits have a spatially uniform hydraulic conductivity k 2 33 10 5 ms 1 this is due to the limitations imposed by the grid scale of the dk model and due to the limited data availability describing the spatial variability of peat across dk conditions in the field are highly heterogeneous and strongly influenced by the surrounding surficial deposits consequently we have chosen to modify the k of the peat deposits such that the k reflects a transition from a sand dominated system to a clay dominated system although heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity within the peat will exist we limit the study to consider a homogenous effective hydraulic conductivity partly due to limited knowledge on the heterogeneity and partly to better isolate the importance of the hydraulic conductivity of the peat four peat k values were used between 2 33 10 4 2 33 10 7 m s 1 with an order of magnitude between each table 1 the peat k classes forms the main basis for grouping the models where all 16 models are listed in table 1 2 4 step 3 segregation of lowland to maximise the data obtainable from the model which is used for the machine learning training we apply a novel approach whereby the lowland is segmented based on the overland flow patterns overland flow is simulated using the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equations the overland flow routing for each surface cells within the model is based on distance to the closest stream and topographic slope as such each cell is associated with a stream reach whose length is determined by the gird resolution within the model and surface roughness manning s n and slope are used to simulate the overland flow rate therefore each stream reach has an associated source area consisting of numerous cells representing subcatchments within the lowland from which geomorphological and hydrological data can be extracted the associated source area changes with the length of the stream reach a longer stream reach will have a larger source area or subcatchment and the simulated hydrological responses will be a lumped average response due to the larger source area whereas a shorter stream reach will have a smaller source area and will therefore provide a more localised hydrological response the sizes of these segments are linked to the overland flow source area for a given length of stream and are therefore referred to based on the length of the stream reach fig 5 the overland flow segments appear orthogonal to the stream due to the coarse nature of the dem used to delineate them 20 m and the generally low slope within the lowland mean slope 5 this approach produces a total number of 48 subcatchments ranging from the entire lowland to 100 m stream reaches this approach increases the available data and diversity in the segment statistics which is important for the subsequent training of the machine learning algorithm and upscaling potential a key assumption in using the segments to quantify the flow partitioning is that the dominant flow direction is from the riparian boundary towards the corresponding stream reach for both groundwater flow and overland flow petersen et al 2020a we therefore assume that any lateral flow present is negligible noorduijn et al 2021 demonstrated that this assumption is valid where overland flow is dominant on an annual basis the simulated overland and groundwater flows into the riparian segments and into the corresponding stream reaches were extracted from each of the 16 models the simulated flow data were obtained for 2000 to 2018 and we also included the mean annual flow for these years as an additional data point this resulted in a total 19 years of flow data for each segment and the average flows providing a total of 960 data points number of segments 20 flow data points for each model a total of 15 360 data points for all 16 models the flow into the segments at the upland boundary will hence forth be referred to as the upland hydraulic flux and is included as a covariate in the subsequent analysis see table 2 the target variable of the analysis is the fraction of overland flow f o riv which represents the degree to which a lowland is dominated by overland flow f o riv r y o r y o r y g r y where o r y and g r y refers to the overland and groundwater flow into the river reach r for year y mm y a f o riv value of zero indicates no overland flow contribution to the stream therefore we assume that such a system will have a high nutrient reduction capacity a f o riv value greater than zero indicates that there is some amount of overland flow contribution to the stream and therefore the nutrient reduction capacity is inversely linked to the modelled f o riv value 2 5 step 4 environmental covariates the environmental covariates represent the properties which might best influence the flow dynamics within the riparian lowland selection of relevant environmental covariates is based on previous research and our process understanding of flow dynamics within riparian lowlands prior to training the statistical machine learning model it is unclear which environmental covariates will assist in predicting the overland flow partitioning therefore we have included all potentially relevant covariates in the training process for each lowland segment we extract 22 stationary environmental covariates based on statistics of 9 selected variables table 2 vidon and hill 2004a established a conceptual model of riparian behaviour using 8 study sites in a till environment in canada the main characteristics were sediment permeability upland hydraulic pressure and slope among these slope will have a strong influence on overland flow within the riparian lowland by definition riparian lowlands tend to occur in flat areas so three different measures of slope are used elevation difference Œ¥elev general slope slopegeneral and local slope slopegrid the Œ¥elev is the change in elevation between the riparian zone boundary and stream the slopegeneral is Œ¥elev divided by the distance to the stream and the slopegrid is determined by gis analysis of the 10 m dem to obtain spatially derived slope data dahl et al 2007 developed typologies that classify riparian lowlands based on the groundwater aquifer type and hydraulic setting these types describe different levels of connectivity between the riparian lowland and the aquifer connected disconnected or confined and the aquifer types local or regional this typology indicates that the subsurface geological information such as depth to a confining layer and hydraulic parameters are important metrics for describing the groundwater flow response in view of this covariates related to the aquifer structure and hydraulic properties were included namely depth to clay occurrence and aquifer transmissivity and hydraulic properties the depth to clay occurrence was determined using the dk models geological model stisen et al 2019 and provides information on the thickness of the higher hydraulic conductivity sand layers above the upper clay layer the hydraulic covariates within the riparian lowland were obtained from the hydrological model the number of layers to consider when extracting the statistics was guided by the depth of the stream aquifer interactions in the fensholt model the stream directly interacts with the top 4 model layers therefore statistics for the transmissivity and horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity were extracted for the top four model layers within the riparian segments due to the log normal distribution of these covariates these values were log transformed to obtain a standard normal distribution which is preferred in the statistical analysis the inclusion of the upland hydraulic pressure in the statistical analysis also assumes this information is available for other riparian lowlands it is possible to extract this information from the dk model however given the precision and resolution of this data the partitioning of overland and groundwater flow into the lowlands will be very uncertain therefore in order to reduce uncertainty we consider the total hydraulic pressure oup gup into the lowlands rather than the individual components the information extracted from all 16 models base case and perturbed of the fensholt catchment are referred to as the fensholt dataset 2 6 step 5 statistical machine learning model predicting flow partitioning the primary aim of the statistical analysis is to deduce some multi dimensional relationships that describe the overland flow contribution to streams within riparian lowlands using physical properties covariates that are mappable for all riparian lowlands in denmark and the hydraulic pressure at the riparian lowland boundary the following workflow was used to train and evaluate the statistical model 1 preprocess fensholt dataset environmental covariates and f o riv a the fensholt dataset was separated into training 65 and validation 35 subsets using a random sampling method b standardisation of all the covariates in the training dataset 2 train the statistical model using the training subset 3 evaluate the predictive capabilities of the trained model using the validation dataset we used a random forest rf algorithm to predict f o riv the rf was performed in python using the scikit learn package pedregosa et al 2011 2 6 1 data preprocessing training and validating datasets separation of the fensholt dataset into a training and validation dataset provides additional means of validating the trained model all steps in the development of the statistical model were based on the training dataset and stored the same procedures and stored parameterisations were then applied to the validation dataset in this way the validation dataset is treated as an independent dataset from the training dataset standardisation the covariate values are scaled to a standard normal distribution mean 0 standard deviation 1 to ensure that they are all treated equally this involved dividing the mean centred values by their standard deviation x i j s x i j x j œÉ j where x i j s refers to the scaled value of the j th covariate of the i th data point x j to the mean and œÉ j to the standard deviation of the j th covariate both the mean and standard deviation are computed from the training data 2 6 2 random forest rf random forest is a supervised machine learning technique which has been successfully applied to numerous water resource questions tyralis et al 2019 koch et al 2019a and koch et al 2019b demonstrated that the random forest machine learning approach is capable of predicting both groundwater levels and depth to redox interface by using results from low resolution numerical model simulations as part of the training data random forest rf is composed of a number of decision trees each tree is grown by recursively splitting the training data into more homogenous groups breiman 2001 each tree is grown using a bootstrapped subset of the training data generated through a process referred to as bagging bagging is the process whereby subsets of the training dataset are generated by bootstrapping with replacement bootstrapping with replacement will increase the probability for the same training data instance to occur in multiple subsets and therefore trees whilst others may not be sampled at all the training subset passed to each tree represents approximately 66 7 of the instances from the original training data this is referred to as the in the bag subset of the data the remaining 33 3 of the training data are referred to as the out of bag and play no role in training the tree the in the bag and out of bag subsets will be different for each tree in the forest once trained the rf model provides an out of bag prediction for each instance in the training dataset based on the average prediction across all trees where the data point was withheld at each branch in the tree the split is determined using a random subset of the training covariates this means that each branch in the tree will be based on percentage of the covariates in the training data randomising the covariates used in branch development and bagging decrease the accuracy of individual trees but increase the diversity in trees resulting in a more robust prediction when averaging across all trees biau and scornet 2016 2 6 3 model evaluation model performance the performance of the rf model was quantified based on the following metrics on the out of bag oob predictions and the predictions for the validation dataset pearson s correlation coefficient r2 spearman s correlation coefficient rs the kendall s rank coefficient œÑ root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae the pearson s r2 spearman s rs and kendall s œÑ coefficients provide information on the correlation between the simulated and predicted f oriv the pearson s r2 provides a measure of the degree of the relationship between linearly related variables and assumes a normal distribution both kendall s œÑ and spearman s rs are non parametric tests used to measure the degree of association and strength between variables spearman s rs does this by ranking the variables and comparing the corresponding ranks between the variables whilst kendalls œÑ compares the ordinal association between the variables neither spearman s rs nor kendall s œÑ make assumptions of the distribution of the variables as discussed above the oob predictions represent predictions generated by withholding part of the training dataset during the development of the rf model the validation dataset represents an external independent dataset whose data was not used in training the rf model therefore rf model predictions for the validation dataset provide an additional rf model evaluation option to investigate the reliability of these metrics an additional 10 fold cross validation cv test of the model was performed the fensholt dataset was split into a training dataset 67 of the available training data and a validation dataset 33 of the available training data the cv test splits the training dataset into 10 subsets of approximately 10 of the training data sequentially each subset is withheld from the training dataset and the models trained on the remaining 90 of the data the model performance is then evaluated on the validation dataset the final 10 fold cv score is the average score across all subset covariate importance rf models can provide a quantitative assessment of the importance of each covariate this information can be useful to better understand the rf model and provide a rationality check of its physical meaningfulness we applied a permutation accuracy approach similar to that used by koch et al 2019b whereby we iteratively exclude one or more covariates retrain the rf model and note how the oob pearson s r2 and rmse changes if removal of a single covariate or group of covariates results in a large change in the oob rmse or r2 then that covariate or group of covariates is considered important in modelling the target variable determining the importance can be obscured by correlation between covariates strobl et al 2008 given that information lost when removing a covariate will still be preserved in those covariates to which it is correlated therefore we applied three covariate grouping strategies first permuting each covariate each statistic secondly permuting each covariate type all statistics for a given covariate and thirdly creating groups of physically related covariates and permuting the groups table 2 2 6 4 model sensitivity analysis the lowland segmentation approach implemented in this study assumes that the covariates of a segment are independent of the scale of the segment to explore this assumption we performed a simple sensitivity analysis by repeating step 5 after removing the data from the 100 m segments fig 5a the removal of these data will reduce the size of the training data from 15 360 to 8 000 this dataset will henceforth be referred to as the truncated dataset 2 7 step 6 regional scale applications the trained rf model was applied to riparian lowlands in the 12 785 5 km2 dk model area for central jutland fig 2 to explore its applicability and predictive potential in areas beyond the fensholt catchment the 100 m dk model was used to extract both flow and hydraulic parameters for each of the lowlands within the target area the mean annual upland flux from 2000 to 2010 was used for further analysis data are available on the distribution and shape of riparian lowlands based on the presence of organic rich peat across denmark at a 25 m resolution and within each lowland all covariate values were extracted the topographic and slope statistics for each riparian lowland was based on the same 10 m resolution grid data used in the fensholt dataset see supplementary data for methodology these data will hence forth be referred to as the c dk dataset application of the rf model to this c dk dataset assumes that the model is suitably reliable for application in this extended area assuming this was the case reliability means that the accuracy of model predictions is on average the same as its accuracy on the training dataset however the c dk dataset is likely to contain lowlands whose various covariate characteristics are beyond the range of data in the training dataset application of the model to these lowlands means that the predictions would be considered more uncertain therefore the applicability of the rf model to the c dk dataset was assessed by comparing the ranges of the covariates in both the fensholt dataset all 16 models table 1 and the c dk dataset the c dk lowland covariate values were standardised using the mean and standard deviation from the fensholt dataset the resulting standardised c dk covariate dataset will therefore have a standard normal distribution based on the covariate values in fensholt dataset outliers could therefore be identified as data points that falls outside a predefined number of standard deviations std from the mean the impact of outlier removal on the predicted categorization of lowlands was explored the models were applied to the entire dataset including outliers and to lowlands within 4 and 6 standard deviations from the mean 3 results 3 1 training and testing of models 3 1 1 flow partitioning the riparian lowland segmentation resulted in 15 360 simulated f oriv by the 16 perturbed models of the fensholt catchment the f oriv is strongly influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the overlying peat the cumulative distribution functions cdf shown in fig 6 a clearly show that in general there is a clear correlation between the peat kh and the partitioning of flow into the stream with the lower peat kh values being clearly more dominated by overland flow than high peat kh values for example the fraction of segments where f oriv 0 25 i e groundwater dominated for peat kh of 10 4 ms 1 10 5 ms 1 10 6 ms 1 and 10 7 ms 1 are 0 76 0 59 0 40 and 0 33 respectively fig 6b shows the cdf based on segment length and therefore reflects the impact of spatial heterogeneity in flows as the segment lengths decrease the cdfs are similar for all segment lengths where approx 40 of the segments have no overland flow contribution to the stream only the segments 1000 m and the entire lowland deviate with less groundwater dominance in the simulations a higher number of overland flow dominated segments and a less smooth cdf the shapes of the cdf for these larger segments have a number of steps which can be attributed to the various responses for the different model perturbations listed in table 1 3 1 2 random forest model the rf model was used to predict the fraction of overland flow into the connected river reach f oriv within the riparian lowland using 23 covariates table 2 the rf regression model was constrained by the following parameterisation the number of decision trees was one hundred bootstrapping with replacement was used to generate training subsets for each tree 25 of covariates were considered when splitting the data the trees were pruned to a maximum depth of 10 to prevent overfitting with no limit to the maximum number of nodes in each tree rmse was used to determine the optimal model parametrisation the predictive performance of the rf model is shown in fig 7 for 1 the average prediction of the training dataset only over trees where data were withheld during rf training as an out of bag oob sample 2 the average prediction over all trees for the validation dataset and 3 the average prediction over all trees for the entire dataset the rf prediction for the entire dataset is presented for reference only and should not be used to evaluate the model performance conversely both the oob and validation dataset predictions of f o riv provide an independent evaluation of the model performance and in both cases the rf model is able to capture a substantial proportion of the variability in the dataset with a spearman s rank rs kendall s œÑ coefficient and root mean squared error of rmse approx 0 967 0 863 and 0 053 for the oob predictions and 0 968 0 866 and 0 051 for the validation dataset table 3 the pearson s r2 metric is less informative than either spearman s rank rs and kendall s œÑ coefficient due to the bias toward f o riv of 0 in the dataset producing r2 values very close to 1 this is not corroborated by the scatter visible in fig 7a the results of the cross validation are very similar to both the oob and validation datasets metrics table 3 this agreement provides validity to both the oob and the validations metrics as a means to quantify the accuracy of the rf model to provide insight into the larger scale response of the riparian lowland fig 7b shows simulated and predicted f o riv for the entire lowland and segments 1000 m the simulated f o riv extracted from the base case model see table 1 for the entire lowland orange circles are clustered at 0 48 the addition of the perturbed models resulted in a larger range in simulated f o riv with minimum and maximum f o riv of approx 0 2 0 95 a similar increase in simulated f o riv is shown of the 1000 m segments where the base case model simulated values in two clusters the first cluster falls between 0 12 and 0 49 and the second cluster at 0 69 blue dots in fig 7b the inclusion of the perturbed models expands this range considerably blue crosses in fig 7b fig 8 shows the covariate importance based on the concept of permutation accuracy and highlights that the hydrogeology geology group has the highest importance in the trained rf model with a 26 and 289 decrease in the rf models performance for kendall s œÑ and rmse respectively when this group is permuted the terrain and upland flux covariate groups are of diminishing importance to the rf model with a drop in model performance of 6 and 2 for kendall s œÑ and 63 and 17 in rmse permutation through both the covariate statistics light blue bars in fig 8a and individual covariates coloured bars in fig 8a has minimal impact on kendall s tau 2 decrease value conversely the rmse was affected by the permutation through both the covariate types and individual covariates fig 8b of the covariate types light blue bars in fig 8b transmissivity 16 is the most important followed by kv 14 and slopegeneral 14 while the least important covariate is distance 10 when each individual covariate statistic coloured bars in fig 8b was considered individually depth to clay std rmse and kendall s œÑ of 13 and 1 respectively t mean rmse and kendall s œÑ of 13 and 1 respectively slopegrid std rmse and kendall s œÑ of 12 and 1 respectively depth to clay mean rmse and kendall s œÑ of 12 and 1 respectively Œ¥elev mean rmse and kendall s œÑ of 11 and 1 respectively distance mean rmse and kendall s œÑ of 11 and 1 respectively were the top six most sensitive environmental covariates and the least sensitive covariate was kv std which resulted in a minor deterioration in rmse and kendall s œÑ 8 and 1 respectively we chose to retain this covariate in the subsequent analysis given that inclusion only has a very minor impact on model performance 3 2 regional scale applications 3 2 1 covariates data were collected for 2802 lowlands in central jutland through gis analysis and extraction from the numerical model of the region the ranges in covariate values were then compared to those extracted from the fensholt dataset in fig 9 in general there is overlap in covariate value ranges however there are four covariates where 50 of the covariate values in the c dk dataset are beyond the range in the fensholt dataset namely t min kv mean kh max and kv max therefore the predicted f o riv for lowlands whose for example kh max values are beyond the range of the training dataset will be more uncertain the covariate importance can provide guidance as to how applicable the rf model is to a new dataset of the aforementioned four covariates t min kv mean kh max and kv max their individual importance varies however the importance of the collective type t kv and kh exceeds the individual covariate statistics importance this suggests that even for cases where individual covariate values are beyond the range of the fensholt dataset the uncertainty in the predicted f o riv may not be much larger than the prediction uncertainty seen for the training dataset in light of this we have chosen to exclude some lowlands from analysis by assessing whether any covariate values for the top five environmental covariate and upland flux total of six covariates related to that lowland is within x standard deviations of the mean of the fensholt dataset for example lowland a and b have standardised values for t mean of 2 3 and 4 5 if the threshold is 4 standard deviations then lowland a is included in the analysis and lowland b is excluded as the number of std increases so do the number of lowlands included in the analysis in the case for 4 standard deviations the resulting c dk dataset includes 89 of the lowlands if this is increased to 6 standard deviations the resulting c dk dataset includes 96 of the lowlands however the uncertainty in the predictions will increase 3 2 2 rf model predictions fig 10 shows a map of the predicted f o riv across lowlands in the c dk dataset for the year 2005 for a those c dk lowlands best represented by the training dataset based on the six most sensitive covariates i e within 4 std b lowlands within 6 std which will include some outliers and c all data which will include all outliers at the individual lowland scale there is a spatial trend in f o riv fig 10a b c with a higher diversity in the predicted f o riv values to the east than to the west of the c dk area predicted f o riv values 0 5 tend to be located in the east of the c dk area whereas predicted f o riv of 0 5 are distributed across the area when aggregating lowland f o riv to subcatchment scale in fig 10d e and f the east west pattern is harder to distinguish this spatial pattern in both the individual lowlands and aggregated subcatchment scales are maintained as more outliers are included into the dataset fig 11 a shows that inclusion of outliers only has a very small impact on the distribution of predictions for the rf model 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the rf model s f o riv predictions to the segment sizes included in the fensholt training dataset was explored by excluding the 100 m segments from the training dataset and retraining the rf model henceforth predictions based on this model will be referred to as f o riv sen the spatial pattern in f o riv sen predictions show a similar spatial pattern to those shown in fig 10 see fig sd similar to the f o riv predictions f o riv sen 0 5 are evenly distributed throughout the c dk areas and f o riv sen 0 5 are more abundant to the east of the c dk area to assess the robustness of the rf predictions for the c dk lowlands we have compared the f o riv and f o riv sen predictions fig 11a and the differences referred to as the residuals are illustrated in fig 11b the residuals appear to have a negligible difference in mean 0 05 and a relatively small standard deviation 0 09 inclusion of outlier lowlands does not impact the spread of residuals indicating that the rf model is robust to predictions when covariates are beyond values in the training dataset 4 discussion 4 1 upscaling approach we developed a dynamic upscaling approach that is unique in the sense that we combined high quality field data on flow partitioning from a riparian lowland petersen et al 2020a a downscaled fine resolution numerical model noorduijn et al 2021 and a machine learning technique random forest regression to enable prediction of flow partitioning in riparian lowland from generally available covariates this approach can be used to predict the flow partitioning in riparian lowlands for specific years or the mean annual behaviour to our knowledge few studies have combined hydrological model simulations and spatial data together with machine learning applications in an upscaling approach koch et al 2019a koch et al 2019b are examples which use the combination of spatial and simulated covariates and machine learning methods to predict depth to the redox interface and refining simulated water table depth this work also indicates the potential of rf to predict a spatially integrated response namely the flow partitioning in an entire lowland in the current study we rely on simulated flow partitioning from a single riparian lowland to limit the impact of a using a single riparian lowland model we developed additional data extraction methods to fully capitalize on the information available from numerical simulations this was necessary to ensure both size of the training data set and diversity in the covariate values 4 2 predictive ability of the rf models based on the fensholt training dataset which we constructed by combining knowledge inferred from the detailed field data in the fensholt lowland with the nationwide covariate data we trained a random forest rf model the rf performance was based on five metrics which clearly demonstrated that the rf model was able to accurately predict f o riv from the covariates the structure of the different decision trees that form the rf model was explored by permuting through the covariates this provided a quantitative means to explore the importance of the covariates in the rf model which otherwise functions as a black box the covariate importance for the training dataset indicated that the upland hydraulic flux slopegeneral and transmissivity contributed the most to reducing the rf models predictive error conceptually these covariates align well with our understanding of the riparian lowland characteristics governing the partitioning into groundwater and overland flow vidon and hill 2004b attributed similar characteristics in development of their conceptual model which linked the depth of permeable sediments in the upland and riparian lowland topography riparian soil texture and hydraulic connectivity to nitrate removal fig 7 vidon and hill 2004b the generation of overland flow is often linked to high slope gradients tetzlaff et al 2009 or sudden changes in slope that can induce surface groundwater seepage gold et al 2002 riparian lowlands by definition often lie in the valley floor and have minimal slope the importance of slopegeneral as opposed to slopegrid indicates that the slope within the riparian lowland does not influence the prediction of f o riv as much as the overall slope e g between boundary to stream the subsurface geological structure will impact both the groundwater flow and the potential generation of overland flow within the riparian lowland dahl et al 2007 fig 8 clearly demonstrates that the permutation of covariates related to the riparian lowlands hydrogeology significantly increases the rf model error of the individual hydrogeology covariate types the transmissivity which combines the layer thickness and horizontal hydraulic conductivity is the most important this means that significant improvement in the estimation of the flow partitioning and thereby the potential nutrient reduction in lowlands can be obtained through geological and hydrogeological mapping of the lowlands it is noted that the covariates originate from a combination of field data terrain hydrogeology and simulations with the national hydrological model upland hydraulic flux this is a major breakthrough compared to the study of dahl et al 2007 who introduced the flow partitioning concept in riparian lowlands and analysed conditions in denmark their analyses were mainly qualitative and they were not able to identify unambiguous relationships between riparian hydrogeology and flow partitioning our findings suggest that rf is a very powerful tool to exploit information in covariates and that adding model simulated upland hydraulic flux is a necessary covariate for predicting flow partitioning in a riparian lowland 4 3 model applicability and uncertainties the trained rf model was used to predict the f oriv for riparian lowland in the central jutland c dk region determining the accuracy of the predicted spatial pattern is challenging due to the limited field data available nonetheless the results appear encouraging the spatial pattern reflects the expected pattern of a general tendency to lower f o riv in the flatter sandy western part of c dk compared to the clay dominated and more hilly eastern part the base case dk model for the fensholt catchment used for the training dataset indicated f o riv for the riparian lowland was 0 48 this lowland is within the c dk region therefore all covariates and inflows were extracted from the 100 m dk model based on this information the rf model predicted f o riv of 0 38 this demonstrates some degree of robustness in the rf model even though covariate values will differ when derived from a 20 m model and 100 m model the mean annual upland flux from the base case fensholt model is 611 mm y compared to 39 mm y from the c dk model this difference in upland flux can be attributed to the impacts of grid scale on the generation on overland flow within the riparian lowlands the topographic slopes within the c dk model are in general smaller than within the 20 m fensholt models resulting to lower near surface hydraulic gradients this is the likely cause for the difference in mean annual flux between the 20 m and 100 m models the distinctive difference in the distributions between the training data and the c dk predictions is interesting the segmentation of the riparian lowland resulted in a dominance of segments with no overland flow contribution to the stream in the fensholt training dataset this demonstrates that the overland flow contribution to the stream is a localised occurrence in comparison the predicted values of f o riv for c dk riparian lowlands are all 0 however the range in c dk predictions closely matches the range in simulated f o riv for the entire fensholt riparian lowland from the different perturbed models we have established the rf model on the basis of information from a combination of i observed flow partitioning data in a single riparian lowland ii a high resolution hydrological model for this lowland and iii a wide range of covariate data covering nationwide conditions although the rf model shows a very high level of accuracy from the tests against the training dataset the underlying assumptions introduce a considerable uncertainty into the rf predictions when extrapolated to the c dk area two of the key assumptions are that the perturbations of hydrogeological conditions result in theoretical lowland configurations that are representative for the real lowlands and that the hydrological model is able to simulate flow partitioning also in the lowlands that represent extrapolations from the base model in fensholt assessing the validity of these assumptions requires additional comprehensive field and modelling studies that are beyond the scope of the present study to obtain an estimate of the level of uncertainty involved we have performed a simple sensitivity analysis where we have truncated the training dataset by omitting the 100 m reaches comparing the rf model derived from the full dataset with an rf model derived from the truncated dataset provides an uncertainty measure the comparison of the two rf models across all c dk lowlands shows a negligible difference in the mean overland flow fraction and a standard deviation of the differences of 0 09 which is 25 of the predicted mean the comparison also shows that the lowlands with covariates exceeding those represented in the training dataset do not result in large prediction differences which can be seen as an indication of model robustness the f o riv prediction uncertainties are most likely larger than what is seen in the simple sensitivity analysis however the results of the sensitivity analysis are encouraging as they suggest some level of robustness being able to differentiate between the n reduction potential across lowlands is a major step forward in national nitrate management and regulation compared to the present approach in which all lowlands have to be considered equal 5 conclusion riparian lowlands play a key role in buffering aquatic systems from excess groundwater nitrate which has leached from adjacent farmland quantifying their n reduction capacity at a national scale remains a challenge consequently they are often treated uniformly in reality the spatial variability in nitrate reduction capacity will vary within and between lowlands limited data availability makes it difficult to assess lowland reduction at the national scale lowland nutrient reduction capacity has been linked to flow path partitioning if an aquatic system is primarily fed by groundwater the potential for n reduction is high conversely if overland flow dominates the reduction capacity is low this study focusses on using rf to predict the fraction of overland flow contribution to streams in riparian lowlands we used a high resolution model of a riparian lowland to simulate the hydrological responses and based our training dataset upon the simulated fluxes terrain and hydrogeological conditions in the model by perturbing key terrain and hydrogeological elements in the model we were able to create additional model realisations of the riparian lowland rather than rely on a single model which also expands the dataset to be more representative of riparian lowlands across denmark the trained rf model was able to capture most of the variability in the training dataset this was then used to predict the fraction of overland flow in riparian lowlands in the central jutland region although there is limited data available for lowlands in this area the results look highly plausible this regional map can provide an initial step to incorporating the spatial variability in lowland flow dynamics into the danish nitrogen model which from a practical water management perspective is a major step forward
