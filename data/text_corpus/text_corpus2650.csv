increasing pollutions leading to the urgent requirement for oil water separation technology as a widely used technique for wastewater purification through selective permeation and repellence 1 4 membrane separation has the advantages of simple operation high efficiency low cost and eco friendliness in comparison with other conventional strategies 5 9 these merits make membrane separation the most promising oil polluted water cleanup method 10 13 the most widely used separation membrane for oil water separation is the one with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity until now

input complicated and toxic chemical involved productions in this communication we report a low cost green and facile way to fabricate graphene oxide connected cotton fibers goccf membrane with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity through soaking cotton in graphene oxide go aqueous alcoholic suspension followed by drying in the air previously underwater superoleophobic membranes were prepared by coating superhydrophilic materials on porous substrate our porous goccf membrane was constructed by connecting cotton fibers with superhydrophilic go nanosheets not based on a porous substrate therefore this approach provides a new strategy to produce separation membrane the resultant goccf membrane exhibits excellent capability for separating various oil water mixtures with high efficiency furthermore the goccf membrane also shows superior antifouling behavior with retaining nearly unchanged ultra high water flux and high separation efficiency in the whole oil water separation processes recycled for 30 times the ease of preparation and outstanding performance could endow the goccf membrane with practical application in oil leakage and industrial oily wastewater treatments 2 experimental 2 1 materials natural long staple cotton was purchased from huizhou aiyi fiber technology co ltd china graphene oxide suspension 5 mg ml 1 was bought from hengqiu tech inc china various organic liquids were obtained shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd china 2 2 fabrication of graphene oxide connected cotton fibers membrane as the schematic diagram shown in scheme 1 a go aqueous alcoholic suspension was prepared by mixing 1 5 g l 1 of go aqueous suspension with the equivalent volume of ethanol followed by ultrasonication for 10 min 0 3 g cotton was evenly spread on a petri dish with diameter of 90 mm the go aqueous alcoholic suspension was then slowly decanted into the petri dish to submerge the cotton after soaking in the solution for 2 h the go suspension impregnated cotton was carefully taken out and dried in the air under 40 c for 4 h and then the goccf membrane was obtained 2 3 oil water separation the oil water separation test was conducted on a setup constructed by clipping the goccf membrane between two quartz tubes with inner diameter of 15 mm the oil water mixture oil concentration of 50 was prepared by mixing oil and water with equivalent mass through stirring for 30 min after decanting the oil water mixture into upper tube the permeated water was gathered with a beaker beneath the lower tube the oil concentration of the permeated water was determined by uv visible absorption spectrum see detail in supplementary information the separation efficiency η was calculated with the formula η 1 c p c f 100 where c p and c f are the oil concentrations of the permeated water and feed oil water mixture respectively the water flux j was calculated as j v s t where v is the volume of the permeated water s is the area of the membrane in contact with the mixture and t is the separation time 3 results and discussion the goccf membrane was fabricated by simply soaking cotton in go aqueous alcoholic suspension followed by air drying without involving toxic chemical reagents special equipment and complex reaction and procedure this method presents an inexpensive eco friendly and simple route to producing superwetting membrane as displayed in fig 1 a the pristine cotton shows a water contact angle woa of 152 suggesting its superhydrophobicity thus the cotton cannot absorb go aqueous suspension however the cotton shows superoleophilicity with complete permeation of oil fig 1b therefore ethanol was added into go aqueous suspension to ensure the submersion of the cotton in the go aqueous alcoholic suspension the as prepared goccf membrane presents a compact brown thin membrane fig 1c indicating the coating of go nanosheets the formation of the compact membrane is ascribed to the stacking of go sheets and cotton fibers under the attraction of the strong capillary force with the evaporation of water and ethanol as well as the strong van der waals force between go nanosheets and cotton fibers on the complete evaporation leading to the firm connection of cotton fibers with go nanosheets as seen from fig 1d and e water permeated into goccf membrane while the oil droplet formed a globularity with oil contact angle oca of 150 on the surface implying the superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity of the membrane moreover the chloroform droplet can be easily detached from the goccf membrane even it was pressed on the surface in water fig 1f reflecting the low oil affinity of the membrane under water the scanning electron microscopic sem morphologies of the pristine cotton and goccf membrane are shown in fig 2 the pristine cotton is composed of intertwined cotton fibers fig 2a with smooth surface fig 2b as for goccf membrane it is clear that the go nanosheets were covered on the cotton and integrated with cotton fibers and pores formed on the surface fig 2c and d higher magnification sem image shown in the inset of fig 2d exhibits a micro nanoscale wrinkled rough surface which should be ascribed to the increased nanometer scale corrugations induced by various oxygen containing functional groups of the go nanosheets 20 as the cross sectional sem image shown in fig s1 the goccf membrane presents a hierarchical layered structure with numerous small pores therefore there must be many small pores existed inside the large pores on the surface of the goccf membrane shown in fig 2c which is of great importance to the selective permeation of water and repellency of oil the energy dispersive x ray edx elemental mapping shown in fig 2e reveals the uniform distribution of c and o elements which are mainly originated from the coated go nanosheets the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the pristine cotton and goccf membrane are shown fig 3 a compared with the pattern of the pristine cotton a diffraction peak of go nanosheets appears at 10 45 corresponding to an average interlayer distance of 0 846 nm this distance is much larger than that of pristine graphite 0 335 nm ascribable to the intercalation of oxygen containing functional groups as shown in fig s2 the brunauer emmett teller bet nitrogen adsorption isotherm reveals a specific surface area of 9 96 m2 g 1 for the goccf membrane larger than that of pristine cotton 6 29 m2 g 1 which can be attributed to the larger specific surface area of the incorporated go nanosheets the c 1s x ray photoelectron spectrum xps of go coated on cotton fibers is displayed in fig 3b which can be divided in to three peaks of c c c c co and co bonds at the vicinity of 284 6 286 6 and 288 ev respectively 21 fig 3c displays the fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum of go coated on cotton fibers the absorption peaks at 3261 1428 and 873 cm 1 are originated from the oh stretching of hydroxyl groups 21 the peaks at 1166 and 1042 cm 1 are attributed to the co stretching of epoxy and alkoxy groups respectively 22 the peak at 1726 cm 1 is ascribed to the co stretching of carbonyl groups 21 the peak at 1632 cm 1 come from the c c c c stretching of sp 2 carbon domains 21 fig 3d shows the thermogravimetric analysis tga curves of the pristine cotton and goccf membrane for goccf membrane the mass loss around 200 c can be attributed to the removal of oxygen functional groups on go the drastic mass loss around 350 c is ascribed to the decomposition of cotton fibers in agreement with the curve of the pristine cotton the abundant polar groups including hydroxyl carbonyl epoxy and alkoxy groups on the coated go nanosheets have a good affinity for water 23 the synergistic effect of the rough surface and the hydrophilic polar groups resulted in the superhydrophilicity of the goccf membrane with wca of 0 in the oil water solid system when oil droplet is in contact with the surface of the goccf membrane under water water trapped in the rough micro nanostructure provide a strong repulsive force due to the repellency between polar water and non polar oil molecules leading to the large oca and low oil affinity under water the superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic properties could endow the goccf membrane with potential application in oil water separation as displayed in fig 4a and video s1 after pouring the mixture of benzene stained with oil red and water into the upper tube of the separation setup sandwiched with the goccf membrane water passed through the goccf membrane in about 2 s while oil was retained on the upper tube the harvested water is limpid without observable red oil reflecting the applicability of the goccf membrane for oil water separation on the contrary both oil and water can pass through the pristine cotton sandwiched between the two tubes fig s3 the separation capability of the goccf membrane was evaluated by separating the mixtures of various oils and water as presented in fig 4b the separation efficiency for the mixtures of benzene n hexane n heptane petroleum ether and kerosene can reach 99 88 99 92 99 86 99 85 and 99 93 respectively

bentonite blended pvc uf membrane 97 17 the separation efficiencies are also higher than the oil removal efficiency with many other routes such as adsorption with functionalized mesoporous materials mcm 41 85 7 27 decomposition with sba 15 supported bimetallic catalyst 85 28 and cracking with beta mcm 48 catalyst 98 1 29 the superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic properties could endow

catalyst 98 1 29 to evaluate the reusability of the goccf membrane the separation process was repeated for thirty cycles after each separation cycle the membrane was only washed with water as seen from fig 4c the separation efficiencies of benzene water mixture maintain above 99 8 in all separation cycles implying the excellent recyclability of the goccf membrane moreover the membrane still preserves an almost unchanged ultra high water permeation flux about 95 000 l m 2 h 1 in all separation cycles fig 4d and the repeatedly used goccf membrane still preserved its original morphology fig s4 indicating its superb stability and antifouling performance the water flux is much higher than most previous reported membranes such as pvc bentonite uf membrane 421 3 l m 2 h 1 30 pluronic f127

13251,the integral hydrophobic characteristic of polymers hinders their implementations towards water treatment in the present work highly hydrophilic and antifouling polyvinyl chloride membranes were fabricated based on graphene oxide silver go ag nanolayers the distinctive infiltration approach of polyvinyl chloride resin through the stacked go ag layers results in surface availability of highly hydrophilic graphene oxide nanosheets incorporation of different weight percent of go ag to the polyvinyl chloride resin increases the permeability rejection and antifouling properties of polyvinyl chloride membranes water contact angle of pure polyvinyl chloride was found to decrease from 92 5 to 61 4 for go ag based membrane water flux and bovine serum albumin rejection of pure polyvinyl chloride membrane were improved from 192 lm 2 h 1 to 613 lm 2 h 1 and 81 5 to 92 1 respectively besides this graphene oxide silver based membrane depicts least irreversible fouling 14 3 and highest flux recovery ratio 85 6 maintenance of high flux recovery ratio of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane after three consecutive cycles of water and bovine serum albumin filtration justify the high durability of membrane the synthesized go ag nanoadditive showed appreciable antibacterial activity against escherichia coli thermo gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry analysis of go ag based membranes proves their high thermal stability as well graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide silver nanoparticles resin infiltration bsa rejection cyclic filtration 1 introduction approach to sustainable clean water has become a rigorous challenge throughout the world according to world water council about 3 9 billion people will suffer from water scarcity issue by 2030 1 2 development and implementation of cost effective and ecofriendly high performance membrane filters can tackle the dilemma of water shortage traditional water treatment strategies include ion exchange chemical precipitation oxidation reduction adsorption electrochemical method photo catalysis reverse osmosis and membrane filtration 3 4 ultrafiltration and microfiltration techniques are usually employed to remove colloids microorganisms bacteria and macromolecules from polluted water polymer membranes based on low cost hydrophilic nanoadditives are being used as ultrafiltration membranes among various polymers polyvinyl chloride pvc 5 polysulfone ps 6 cellulose acetate ca 7 polyvinyledene fluoride pvdf 8 and polyethersulfone pes 9 are widely used for membrane fabrication one of the main problems associated with the use of polymeric membrane is biofouling which deteriorate the membrane quality and reduces the lifespan of membranes 10 11 fouling may occur due to adsorption of colloids pollutants and macromolecules and microorganisms on the membrane surface or inside the pores 12 13 adhesion of proteins and microorganisms from the feed water results in rapid augmentation of biofilm on the membrane surface some oxidizing agents like hydrogen peroxide chlorine dioxide and mono chloramine are widely used to remove biofilms which cannot be removed through simple hydraulic washing however using these chemicals may results in derogation of membrane surface which deteriorate separation efficiency of membranes 14 15 therefore it is mandatory to develop novel membranes which have strong resistance to biofilms without using these oxidants using appropriate hydrophilic nanofillers can compensate the membrane fouling and hence improves membrane performance various organic and inorganic nanomaterials like go 16 sba 17 zno 18 tio2 19 and fe2o3 20 are being explored for waste water treatment graphene oxide go a two dimensional carbon nanofiller with its distinctive features like excellent thermo mechanical stability high surface functionality tunability high surface area hydrophilicity antibacterial property and low cost production has been investigated widely for fabrication of high performance membranes presence of honey comb like nanochannel network with tunable d spacing facilitates the water transport through graphene oxide while rejecting the pollutants 2 16 zhao et al 21 fabricated go based pvc membranes by using phase inversion method and reported a significant increase in hydrophilicity water flux and durability of pvc go membranes hasan et al 22 investigated that addition of go 1 3 wt into pvc matrix leads to a highly stable thermo mechanical membrane hossien et al 23 studied the effect of aspartic acid functionalized go on pvc matrix and suggested that go aspartate based membranes have good fouling control and better water flux properties vahid et al 24 prepared antifouling pvc membranes embedded with graphene quantum dots these membranes showed 98 bsa rejection and 96 reactive blue rejection however π π stacking of go sheets results in its agglomeration within polymer matrix and affects its applications one of the quick method to overcome agglomeration is functionalization of go with different metal and metal oxide nanoparticles 25 go ag 26 go zno 18 go tio2 19 and go nanodiamond 27 are widely used to improve the permeate flux and antifouling properties of polymer membranes among metal nanoparticles silver nanoparticles agnps are broadly used because of their low cost low toxicity and outstanding antimicrobial features the antimicrobial property of agnps is directly linked with their size and shape low colloidal stability of agnps results in their aggregation which decreases their surface area and antimicrobial activity 15 so the main problem associated with the use of graphene oxide and silver nanoparticles is their agglomeration property functionalization of go with agnps results in high exfoliation of go nanosheets by increasing the interlayer distance of go nanolayers on the other hand using highly oxygenated substrate like go provides high binding sites for nucleation and growth of agnps 15 25 so functionalization of go with agnps helps in uniform dispersion of agnps and exfoliation of go nanosheets as well cobos et al 26 reported the use of pva go ag nanocomposite against two pathogenic bacteria staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli firouzjaei et al 28 designed a thin film composite tfc membrane based on go ag and tested against escherichia coli and sodium alginate the study of firouzjaei et al studied that go ag based tfc membrane exhibited strong antimicrobial activity as compared to go and silver based tfc membranes ilyas et al 29 investigated that peg go ag reinforced pvdf co hfp membranes possess excellent control over bsa protein fouling and water flux recovery polymer membranes are mostly fabricated by phase inversion or solution casting methods which involve mixing of nanofillers within polymer matrix and membrane surface remain deficient of hydrophilic moieties 30 resin infiltration technique can help in surface availability of nanocomposites to tackle the hydrophobic and fouling concerns of polymers resin infiltration assembly is reciprocal to layer by layer assembly in which the layered components interact with each other by electrostatic attraction or h bonding 31 the aim of the present study was to fabricate a highly hydrophilic and fouling resistant pvc membrane by using go ag nanocomposite in this strategy graphene oxide was synthesized and functionalized with silver nanoparticles silver nanoparticles acts as nano spacers between graphene oxide layers and prevents restacking of go layers on the other hand go substrate favors the uniform dispersion and stability of silver nanoparticles go and go ag nanocomposites were dispersed in thf and filtered through vacuum filtration assembly to obtain a go go ag layer than the pvc thf resin was filtered through the well settled go and go ag layer this resin infiltration results in crosslinking the go ag nanosheets with polyvinyl chloride pvc chains which increases their stability synergistic properties of go and agnps as well as surface availability of go ag will gave outstanding features to the synthesized membrane performance of pvc go and pvc

mixed together and dissolved in 50 ml sulfuric acid under magnetic stirring than kmno4 6 g was added to the above mixture while placing the reaction flask in an ice bath after thorough mixing of kmno4 100 ml distilled water was added to the mixture and refluxed at 90 c for 1 h finally 30 h2o2 solution was added under stirring and solution was filtered to obtain go the obtained go was washed with excess amount of water to neutralize its ph and dried at 50 c the synthesized go was then grinded finely and functionalized with silver nanoparticles agnps by following chemical reduction method

stirring nabh4 reduces the ag ions decorated on the surface of go sheets silver functionalized go nanosheets go ag were than washed with deionized water and dried in vacuum oven at 50 c 2 3 fabrication of pvc go ag membranes pvc go ag nanocomposite membranes p go ag were fabricated by employing resin infiltration technique as shown in scheme 1 go ag 0 25 0 5 and 1 wt nanoadditives were dispersed in thf 10 ml by ultrasonication well dispersed go ag suspensions were filtered through a 0 2 μm polyethersulfone pes filter paper fitted in a vacuum filtration assembly after partial drying of go ag layer pvc resin 10 g in 80 ml thf was dropped on to this go ag layer and allowed to filter through the nanoadditive layer viscosity of the pvc resin was 900 8 5 pa s 1 resin infiltration of pvc through go ag nano channels helps in gripping of go ag particles resulting in increased stability of pvc go ag membrane the obtained membrane was peeled off from the surface of filter paper and dried at room temperature pvc go 0 5 wt membrane was synthesized following the same above mentioned procedure the pristine pvc membrane was fabricated by using solution casting method 2 4 characterization of nanofiller purity and crystallinity of go and go ag nanocomposites were studied by using bruker xrd x ray diffraction d8 phaser 2θ 5 to 80 surface morphology of nanoadditives was

go ag were explored by malvern zetasizer instrument 2 5 characterization of nanocomposite membranes for the characterization of nanocomposite membranes same equipment s and models are used as for nanofiller characterization xrd patterns of all the synthesized membranes were explored by bruker xrd d8 phaser 2θ 5 to 80 to check the crystalline or amorphous nature of membranes surface morphology of p go ag nanocomposite membrane was studied by sem leo supra and tem all the samples were precoated with gold using cressington gold sputter coater chemical nature and functionalities of p go and p go ag membranes were explored by ftir spectra nicolet is10 ftir spectrophotometer over a range of 500 to 4000 cm 1 2 6 thermal and mechanical stability of membranes thermal stability of all the nanocomposite membranes was analyzed by netzsch thermo gravimetric analyzer with heating rate of 10 per minute membrane coupons were heated from 25 to 700 c and weight loss of each sample was noted accordingly dsc study was done to check the glass transition temperature and melting temperature of the prepared membranes tensile strength of the fabricated membranes was explored by win test analysis using testometric materials testing machine uk 2 7 porosity and water contact angle porosity ε of all the nanocomposite membranes was explored by using gravimetric analysis table 1 enlists the equation used to evaluate the porosity of membranes 32 where w2 and w1 are the weight of dry and wet membrane l is the membrane thickness m a is active area of membrane m2 and ρw is the density of water 0 998 g cm3 in eq 1 for porosity measurement as shown in table 1 water contact angle is directly linked with hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of composites high contact angle refers to more hydrophobic character and less permeability of water water contact angle of all the membranes was measured by using tensiometer ksv apparatus to check the effect of go ag on hydrophilicity of pvc membranes 2 8 permeability and rejection water permeability of all the membranes was checked by undergoing water flux jw measurement using a filtration assembly having 10 cm2 effective membrane area initially the membranes were compressed for 0 5 h by applying 0 1 mpa nitrogen gas pressure in order to get the steady membrane flux after membrane compaction pressure was slightly reduced and adjusted to 0 06 mpa for water flux measurement than the water flux jw1 was calculated by using eq 2 listed in table 1 33 where v is the permeated volume l of liquid a is total area of membrane in m2 and t is time required for permeation three sets of each membrane were fabricated and triplicate measurements were noted to minimize the error after 30 min the water feed was replaced by 0 5 g l bsa solution in phosphate buffer saline and bsa flux was noted using the above mentioned equation bsa rejection was measured through uv spectroscopy by noting the concentration of feed and permeates eq 3 table 1 was applied to calculate of bsa rejection 33 cp and cf are the concentrations of permeate and feed solution in mole dm 3 2 9 antifouling ratio and flux recovery antifouling properties of all the membranes were explored by comparing the water and bsa flux of all the membranes after measuring the bsa flux for 0 5 h the membranes were washed with distilled water to remove the adsorbed foulants and then water flux was noted again for another 0 5 h to measure the flux recovery ratio total fouling ratio rt reversible fouling ratio rir irreversible fouling ratio rir and flux recovery ratio frr were calculated using eqs 4 7 respectively table 1 34 where jw1 is pure water flux jp is bsa protein flux and jw2 is water flux after washing the membrane 2 10 leaching of go and go ag leaching of go and agnps from the fabricated p go and p go ag 0 5 wt membranes was monitored by uv spectroscopy the fabricated membranes were dipped in 50 ml distilled water and sonicated by bath sonication for 1 h than the uv spectra was recorded to monitor the leaching of go and agnps the membranes were remained dipped in water and uv spectra was noted again after 24 h 1 day and 168 h 1 week to check the stability of go ag 2 11 antibacterial performance microbial resistance of go and go ag nanocomposites was studied against escherichia coli 105 cfu strain 1 mg ml of go and go ag nanocomposite solution was incubated with e coli culture and sem images were taken at different incubation times to compare the bactericidal properties of go and go ag 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go and go ag purity and crystallinity of go and go ag nanosheets was studied by xrd spectroscopy xrd pattern of go fig 1 shows a clear peak at 11 59 θ while that of graphite at 26 θ fig s1 xrd peak of go in go ag nanocomposite slightly shifts towards lower theta i e 10 39 θ which suggested the strong intercalation of agnps between go sheets 35 this intercalation of agnps between stacked go layers results in increased d spacing of go nanosheets increased d spacing in go ag nanosheets 8 5 å as compared to go nanosheets 7 6 å depicts the excellent features of go ag in terms of stability and dispersion besides this the appearance of agnps peaks at 38 12 θ 64 40 θ and 77 40 θ confirms the successful functionalization of go nanosheets in order to explore the morphological features of go and go ag nanocomposites sem and tem analysis were performed sem and tem images of go a b and go ag c d are represented in fig 2 sem micrograph of go shows multilayer patterns of go stacked upon each other on the other hand go ag microstructure reveals unfolded sheets of go tem images further clarify the uniform dispersion of go ag nanosheets tem micrographs of go ag manifest crumpled nanosheets of go decorated with uniformly distributed agnps sem and tem images proves that silver functionalization helps in better dispersion of go nanosheets which results in increased d spacing of go patterns and unfurling of stacked go sheets uniform distribution of agnps results in increase in specific surface area of agnps and hence increases their availability edx analysis of go ag nanoadditive confirms the presence of agnps on graphene oxide sheets as shown in fig s2 to investigate the functionalities of go and go ag nanocomposite ftir spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 as shown in fig 3 appearance of a clear hump at 3124 and 3147 cm 1 represents the presence of oh functional group in go and go ag the peak at 1710 cm 1 and 1613 cm 1 in go nanocomposite confirms the stretching vibration co and cc respectively the peak at 1026 cm 1 deals with the epoxy stretching vibration of co in case of go ag nanocomposite a small shift in stretching vibrations of co and cc was observed this shift in peaks from 1710 to 1719 cm 1 and 1613 to 1570 cm 1 indicates the interaction of agnps with carbonyl and carboxyl moieties of go nanosheets 36 successful functionalization of go by agnps was further explored by uv spectra fig 4a shows the uv spectra of go and go ag in the uv spectra of go two clear absorption peaks were observed due to n pi and pi pi transitions in uv spectra of go the absorption peaks at 214 nm and 236 nm represents the pi pi and n pi transitions of cc and co functional groups in go ag nanocomposite the absorption peak at 390 nm indicates strong resonance of agnps furthermore the raman spectra of go and go ag fig 4b clarify the presence of sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbon atoms the appearance of d and g bands in raman spectral analysis of go was due to the vibrations of sp3and sp2 carbon atoms the drastic increase in intensities of d 1360 cm 1 and g 1598 cm 1 bands of go in go ag was attributed to the fast charge transfer mechanism due to silver functionalization of go nanosheets 37 38 surface charges of nanofillers play a crucial role in controlling the permeability and rejection of different molecules zeta potential gives a better estimation of surface charges of nanofillers zeta potential of freshly prepared go and go ag solutions 1 mg ml was measured three times for each sample zeta potential of pure go was noted to be 21 4 2 1 mv while that of go ag was found to be 31 4 3 2 mv zeta potential graphs of go and go ag nanocomposites are shown in fig s3 supplementary data increased surface charge of go ag nanocomposite will result in increased hydrophilicity and high electro static repulsion of bsa foulant 3 2 characterization of membranes 3 2 1 morphology and chemical nature of membranes xrd patterns of all the pvc membranes with and without addition of go and go ag are represented in fig s4 xrd spectra of pure pvc membrane consist of a minute hump at 23 2 θ which suggests the amorphous nature of pvc in go and go ag loaded membranes the characteristic peaks of go and agnps merged together within the polymer matrix xrd patterns of p go and p go ag membranes consist of a clear hump in the range 36 to 40 θ as compared to pvc membrane by increasing the go ag content from 0 25 to 1 wt a small shift in position of hump towards higher theta value was observed at a very high filler content i e p go ag 1 wt the appearance of minute peaks at 12 8 θ and 38 4 θ was noticed which can be attributed to the characteristic xrd peaks of go and agnps surface morphology of all the pvc membranes incorporated with go and go ag nanofiller was explored by sem analysis fig 5 shows the sem images of pvc p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 25 0 5 1 wt the sem image of pure pvc shows a very dense membrane surface sem micrographs of go based pvc membrane shows the clusters of undispersed go sheets while go ag based membranes depicts regular patterns go sheets dispersed throughout the pvc matrix fesem images of p go ag membranes prove that agnps helps in better dispersion of go which results in well exfoliation of go however at a very higher filler content 1 wt the go ag nanoparticles tends to agglomerate but this aggregation was much less as compare to un functionalized go the particle size of agglomerated go sheets clearly reduced in p go ag membranes which manifest strong intercalation of silver nanoparticles between go sheets resulting in increased interlayer spacing and better dispersion thickness of the fabricated membranes lies between 100 μm to 190 μm respectively thickness of pure pvc was 100 μm while that of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was 160 μm and p go ag 1 wt membrane was 190 μm respectively cross sectional sem images of pvc membrane with and without go ag nanoadditive are represented in fig 6 cross sectional sem images of pure pvc membrane comprises of a dense skin layer while that of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane shows some finger like projections and micro voids throughout the membrane cross section presence of a porous sub layer in addition to the surface skin layer in case of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane can be attributed to the interactions of go ag nanosheets with pvc chains by covalent bonding along with displacement of cl atoms from pvc backbone resulting in disordering the pvc chains and increasing the porous structures surface features of p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt were further investigated by tem analysis as shown in fig 7 tem image of p go membrane was comprised of stacked go sheets while that of p go ag tem displays crumpled silk like patterns of unfolded go ag sheets figs 5 and 7 portrayed the uniformly decorated go ag nanolayers throughout the polymer matrix resulting in increased surface roughness and hydrophilicity of p go ag membranes the tem images of p go ag at 200 nm resemble the tem micrographs of pure go ag nanoadditive which ensures the availability of go ag nanofiller on the top of the membrane surface the tem micrographs of p go ag indicate that silver functionalization helps in preventing the stacking of go sheets which results in decreased agglomeration of nanoadditives within the polymer matrix these results suggest that p go ag nanocomposite comprises excellent features as compared to pristine pvc and p go membrane sem and tem analysis validate that the surface properties of the pvc membranes are robustly influenced by incorporation of go and go ag nanocomposites according to hosseini et al 39 the bet brunauer emmett teller surface area of pvc membrane was about 14 61 m2 g another study of zaheen ullah et al 31 reported that the bet surface area of pvc go membrane was 474 03 m2 g these studies illustrate that go plays and important role in increasing the specific surface area of pvc membranes surface functionalities of the p go and p go ag membranes were explored through ftir spectra as shown in fig s5 a clear shift in peak from 1642 to 1715 cm 1 was observed in go ag containing membranes which clarify the interaction of co moieties of go with pvc resin a slight shift in peak positions of co co and cc was observed in p go ag spectra as compare pure ftir peaks of go ag fig 3 which suggests the favorable interaction of pvc resin filtered through go ag nanolayers 3 2 2 thermal and mechanical stability of membranes to investigate the thermal stability of fabricated membranes all the membrane samples were heated from 25 c to 700 c in an inert atmosphere a two step degradation behavior was observed in tga curves of all the membranes fig 8a tga curve of pure pvc membrane shows first degradation step at 209 c and degradation continuous up to 370 c this degradation mainly corresponds to the elimination of small molecules like hcl at this stage the cl radical formed from cleavage of ccl bond withdraw h from the nearby ch bond and results in hcl evolution a major weight loss of the pvc membrane occurs involving dislocation of all the cl atoms and leaving behind polyene backbone 40 no weight loss was observed from 370 c to 446 c which suggests the stability of polymer backbone in this region another minor weight loss was noted in the temp range of 446 c to 508 c in case of p go 0 5 wt membrane the first degradation temperature increases up to 249 c while for p go ag 0 5 wt membrane initial degradation starts at 263 c this increase in degradation temperature corresponds to the strong interaction of go ag nanosheets with ccl bonds of pvc matrix a total weight loss of 98 was obtained for pure pvc membrane and for p go and p go ag 0 5 wt membrane the weight loss decreases to 86 72 and 45 62 respectively tga curves of p go ag 1 wt membrane shows a weight loss of 80 02 which indicates the aggregation of nanofiller at high filler content such aggregations weaken the polymer go interaction and results in poor stability of membranes so the thermal stability of all the modified membranes increases appreciably up to 0 5 wt filler content and decreases again on further increase in filler content thermal stability of pvc and p go and p go ag based membranes was further explored by dsc analysis fig 8b membrane coupons were heating from 25 to 300 c at the rate of 10 per minute and then cooled back to room temperature glass transition temperature tg of all the modified pvc membranes was found to be increased as compare to pure pvc tg of the pure membrane was 55 27 c and increased to 64 5 c by the addition of 1 wt go ag nanocomposite as the glass transition temperature depends on the mobility of polymer molecules addition of nanofillers like go and go ag increases the compactness of polymer chains and tg shifts to the higher temperature moreover the crystallization temperature tcrys and melting temperature of the go ag modified pvc membranes also increases tcrys of pure pvc was noted by an exothermic curve at 222 c while that of p go ag 0 5 wt was at 228 c unmodified pvc membrane shows an endothermic melting curve at 276 c while p go ag 0 5 wt membrane undergo melting at 286 c so the increase in tg tcrys and tm represents the strong intercalation of go and go ag nanosheets within the polymer chains resulting in increased thermal stability as reported in literature 41 42 introduction of highly functional nanosheets in polymer resin limits the chain mobility of host polymer and hence changes the tg tcrys and tm subsequently mechanical stability of pristine pvc p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt membranes was monitored by tensile testing and reported in fig 9 tensile strength of pvc membrane was noted as 44 9 mpa while that of p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was 33 6 mpa and 20 5 mpa respectively this decrease in tensile strength insinuate the increased porosity of go and go ag based membranes the presence of large number of microporous cavities and high porosity as observed in fig 6 c d are the main reasons behind decreased tensile strength of go ag based membranes 32 3 2 3 water contact angle and porosity porosity and water contact angle are the two main features in controlling the membrane performance although in general a highly porous membrane corresponds to excellent water permeation but in many cases all the pores are not equally available for reaction aggregation of nanocomposites may result in pore blocking and hence decreases their availability porosity of all the go ag based membranes fig 10 a was found to be increased as compared to pure pvc and go based pvc membrane porosity of pvc membrane was 62 6 while that of 0 5 wt p go ag was 82 respectively further increase in filler content decreases the membrane porosity these results are in good agreement with sem micrographs of membranes and shows that p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was best in terms of increased porosity and excellent dispersion of nanofiller in case of 1 wt p go ag membrane the go sheets tends to agglomerate which results in congestion of water channels and pore blockage hydrophilicity test of pvc membranes was carried out by measuring the static water contact angle on all the membrane surfaces contact angle is a surface property and linked primarily with the quantity and quality of nanoadditives dispersed in polymer matrix as well as with surface roughness of membrane addition of hydrophilic nanocomposites results in increased hydrophilic character of pvc membranes 43 44 water contact angle of pristine pvc and all the modified membranes are listed in fig 10 a while fig 10 b represents the water contact angle images of pvc p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt membrane respectively the unique infiltration approach of pvc resin through the go and go ag nanosheets results in availability of go nanosheets on the membrane surface as confirmed from tem images of membrane fig 7 and decreases the water contact angle of p go ag based membranes by increasing the surface roughness of membranes water contact angle of pristine pvc decreases from 92 to 73 for p go 0 5 wt and 61 for p go ag 0 5 wt membrane however in case of p go ag 1 wt nanocomposite the water contact angle was found to increase up to 64 which corresponds to the aggregation of go ag nanolayers at high filler content resulting in poor hydrophilicity these results of decreased contact angle of p go ag based membranes indicating an increased surface roughness of membrane are consistent with the literature 45 ahmed sari et al 46 reported a consistent decrease in water contact angle with increased surface roughness entailing an increased hydrophilic character to the membrane surface 3 3 membrane performance 3 3 1 water flux and bsa rejection of membranes pure water flux jw and bsa flux jp of all the membranes was evaluated and shown in fig 11 a addition of water friendly nanocomposites to the pvc matrix leads to the successful tuning of membranes properties water flux of all the modified membranes was found to be increased as compare to pure pvc membrane water flux for pvc membrane was 192 lm 2 h 1 while that of p go ag 0 5 wt was 613 lm 2 h 1 which gives an increase of 219 water flux was found to increase linearly with the increase of go ag content up to 0 5 wt but a further increase in go ag wt leads to the reduction of water transport through the p go ag channels at a very high filler content i e 1 wt p go ag the aggregation increases resulting in pores clogging and decreasing the water permeation in p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt membrane water flux increases by 1 9 folds and 3 2 folds in comparison with pure pvc membrane the p go ag 0 5 wt was noticed to be the best membrane in terms of higher water flux and increased hydrophilicity these results support the earlier results of sem porosity and contact angle as all these analysis depicts that for 1 wt membrane aggregation effect surmounts and results in malfunctioning of membrane in order to assess the bsa rejection of pvc membranes the pure water was replaced with bsa feed solution by changing the feed water with bsa protein solution the flux of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane decreases to 348 lm 2 h 1 decline in bsa flux was attributed to the surface adsorption of bsa foulants resulting in blocking of water channels and hence lowering the permeability the bsa flux decreases drastically for pure pvc membrane which corresponds to the highly hydrophobic nature of pvc resulting in adsorption of bsa molecules on the membrane surface as shown figs 11 and 12 increased water permeation as well as high bsa rejection can be attributed to the combined effect of h bonding as well as electrostatic forces on the membrane surface and interface in case of p go ag based membrane formation of a dense water layer on the membrane surface repels the hydrophobic bsa molecules and increases their rejection although the bsa flux of all the membranes decreases with time but this decrease was slightly low in case of p go ag based membranes bsa molecules are negatively charged at ph 7 an increase in membrane surface charge as confirmed from zeta potential of go ag 31 4 mv fig s3 increases the electrostatic repulsion between bsa and membrane surface resulting in decreased bsa adsorption 47 bsa rejection for pvc membrane was 81 5 while that of p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt was 87 and 92 1 as shown in fig 11 b in contradiction with water flux the bsa rejection of 1 wt p go ag membrane increases significantly 93 3 this increase in bsa rejection was supported from literature high filler content may induce pore blocking and decreases the permeability but it provides increased active surface for adsorption of bsa molecules within the stacked layers of go 47 3 3 2 antifouling efficiency of membranes antifouling efficiency of a filtration membrane is closely associated with its hydrophobic or hydrophilic property microorganisms and proteins bsa are considered as main pollutants causing membrane fouling these pollutants badly affect the membrane performance by setting down on the surface of membranes or inside the pores however availability of hydrophilic surfaces on the top layer of membrane could hinder the protein adsorption by forming a water layer on the membrane surface fig 12 48 synergistic effects of go and agnps excels the hydrophilicity of p go ag membrane fouling ratios of all the fabricated membranes are shown in fig 11 c among all the fabricated membranes highest total fouling ratio and highest irreversible fouling ratio was noticed in case of pvc membrane i e 74 9 and 54 6 fouling ratio decreases to 56 by the addition of 0 5 wt p go and decreases to lowest value of 43 23 for p go ag 0 5 wt membrane temporary fouling can be reversed by back flushing or washing the membrane with distilled water permanent blocking of pores by adhesion of membrane foulants results in irreversible membrane fouling and decreases the efficiency and life span of membrane filters these results indicate that go ag nanofiller plays an essential role in decreasing the membrane fouling and hence increases the water transport through the modified membranes 3 3 3 flux recovery ratio of membranes after sequential filtration of water and bsa solutions through the membranes all the membranes were washed with water for 30 min and water flux was measured again to estimate the flux recovery ratio of membranes frr of all the fabricated membranes are shown in fig 13 a irreversible fouling of membranes either by adsorption of bsa on the surface or by pore blocking results in poor flux recovery frr was highest for p go ag 0 5 wt membrane 85 6 and lowest for pvc membrane 45 3 p go 0 5 wt membrane exhibit 68 1 frr while that of p go ag 0 25 wt shows frr of 70 9 these results revealed the appreciable hydrophilic features of go ag in tailoring the surface properties of pvc membranes bsa molecules are hydrophobic in nature and availability of highly hydrophilic go ag nanosheets on the membrane surface helps in controlling the bsa adsorption on membranes 3 4 cyclic filtration due to high risks of polymer membrane foiling the re usability of polymer membranes is quite challenging among all the pvc go ag based membranes p go ag 0 5 wt showed the best performance in terms of permeability and rejection in order to check the reusability of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane four successive cycles of water permeation were designed cyclic flux and frr of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was shown in fig 13 b c water and bsa permeation was noted over a period of 3 5 h after initial compaction of membrane jw1 was noted every 5 min up to 0 5 h after that bsa permeation flux jp was noted in the same way for next 0 5 h bsa flux was found to decrease appreciably suggesting the adsorption of bsa molecules within the nanochannels of go the fouled membrane was washed with distilled water for another 0 5 h and then jw2 was measured to figure out the flux recovery ratio the same sequence of water and bsa filtration followed by membrane washing was repeated for 3 5 h jw1 jw2 jw3 and frr for cyclic flux were calculated by using the eqs 1 and 7 table 1 respectively water flux of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane for three filtration cycles was 613 lm 2 h 1 525 lm 2 h 1 and 517 lm 2 h 1 flux recovery ratio of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was 85 64 84 17 and 80 26 which reveals high stability and reusability of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane 3 5 leaching effect of go and go ag rapid release of nanoparticles from the membrane matrix can affect the durability and performance of a membrane filter leaching of go and agnps from the fabricated pvc membranes was monitored by uv spectroscopy fig s6 the fabricated p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt membranes were dipped in 50 ml distilled water and sonicated by bath sonication for 1 h the uv spectra reveals the stability of both go and agnps as no any peak was observed in the range of 200 to 450 nm after 1 h sonication the membranes were remained dipped in water and uv spectra was noted again after 24 h 1 day and 168 h 1 week the uv spectra of both samples after 24 h justify the stability of go ag as shown in fig s6 a however a long term interaction with water results in negligible leaching of go from p go 0 5 wt but the p go ag 0 5 wt membrane still persists its stability fig s6 b the infiltration of pvc resin through the go ag nanolayers results in immobilization of silver nanoparticles on go surfaces which hinders the leaching of silver nanoparticles and increases the stability of p go ag membranes li jingchun et al 49 studied that go helps in controlling the release of agnps from polymer membranes by providing large number of anchoring sites in terms of functional groups saranya et al 50 also supports the negligible leaching of go ag nanofiller and confirms the stability of go ag besides this cyclic filtration of water and bsa solutions also depicts the stability of go ag based membranes 3 6 antibacterial features another big issue associated with membrane filtration is formation of biofilm or cake layer on polymer membrane due to accumulation of microorganisms on the membrane surface using antibacterial nanoparticles to reduce the chances of biofilm formation is an effective strategy to enhance membrane performance 51 in order to assess the antibacterial properties of synthesized go and go ag nanocomposites a gram negative bacteria escherichia coli was chosen as biofoulant usually gram negative bacteria are considered to be more resistant to antibiotics due to their compact cell wall as compared to gram positive bacteria so if a substance is resistant to gram negative bacteria it would also be effective to gram positive bacteria 52 in order explore the antibacterial features of go and go ag nano composites e coli culture 105 cfu was incubated with freshly prepared 1 mg ml go and go ag nanocomposite sem micrographs of both samples were recorded after 0 5 h 3 h and 6 h incubation fig 9 represents the sem micrographs of go and go ag nanocomposites incubated with e coli culture at different incubation time sem image of pure e coli culture is shown in fig s7 sem images of go and go ag nanocomposite manifest the minimal adhesion of e coli on the surface of go nanosheets as compared to control sample fig s7 sem micrographs of go nanocomposite at 3 h incubation comprises a large number of e coli cells while in case of go ag nanocomposite the number of e coli cells decreases appreciably this decrease in e coli cells suggest the interaction of ag nanoparticles with the e coli cell wall resulting in rupturing of cell wall and killing of e coli cells after 6 h incubation only two e coli cells diffused in go ag nanocomposite were viewed through sem as shown in fig 14 f these results manifest the effectiveness of go ag nanocomposite in controlling bacterial growth so the intercalation of go ag nanocomposite in pvc membranes can successfully assist in minimizing microbial fouling of membranes 3 7 proposed interactions between pvc go ag and h2o molecules in the pvc go ag membranes polar groups of graphene oxide may interact with cl groups of pvc resulting in disordered pvc chains these interactions result in increased roughness and porosity of membranes on the other hand the polar groups of go interact with external water molecules resulting in h bonding in p go ag membranes a covalent bond exists between cc atoms of pvc and go fig 15 represent the possible interaction between pvc and go ag sheets as well as with water molecules presence of strong h bonding and high polarity increases the hydrophilicity and permeability of p go ag membranes 3 8 comparison with literature table 2 compares the performance of fabricated membranes with some other membranes from literature comparison was made interms of water flux rejection and flux recovery ratio of membranes by the addition of different modifiers ahmed et al reported the synthesis of pluronic f127 polyacrylonitrile bentonite pvc membrane for ultrafiltration the fabricated membrane possesses excellent features interms of ultralow water contact angle increased antifouling property with 97 oil removal efficiency alardhi et al 53 proclaimed the use of pvc hollow fiber membranes for the rejection of methyl green from simulated waste water with a removal efficiency of 59 46 and permeate flux of 32 71 l h m2 karim et al 54 designed an ultrafiltration membrane based on ag tio2 and α aminophosphonate modified montmorillonite mmt the composite membrane comprises excellent permeate flux 400 lm 2 h 1 and reduced protein fouling abdel wahed et al 55 demonstrate the use of use of zno tio2 based ceramic glass material as photo catalyst for decontamination of textile waste water zno tio2 photo catalyst exhibit maximum efficiency of 53 for removal of humic acid ali et al 56 deliberate the use of activated carbon and zirconium oxide zro2 for the photo degradation of 4 octylphenol table 2 depicts the outstanding permeate flux of fabricated p go ag membrane as compared to many other pvc membranes this comparison supports the use of go ag nanofiller as a surface modifier as well as a highly hydrophilic and antifouling adsorbent to treat the biofouling of polymer membranes 3 9 possible applications future prospects because of high hydrophilicity excellent antifouling property and enhanced thermal stability the go ag nanocomposite can help in tailoring the hydrophobic challenges of polymeric membranes although the p go ag membrane possesses enhanced performance in terms of water flux and bsa rejection there is a need to improve the bsa rejection without compromising water flux the synthesized p go ag membranes can be used for waste water treatment heavy metal adsorption etc the synthesized go ag nanofiller have vast majority of applications in target drug delivery bone regeneration artificial muscle formation etc however these membranes still need a lot of modifications and tests to be used in food packaging and other real life applications so the present study is a gateway to further explore the go based membranes to tackle the environmental challenges 4 conclusion in this study go ag based highly hydrophilic and antifouling polyvinyl chloride membranes were fabricated by resin infiltration technique the synthesized p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was found to have outstanding performance in terms of permeation rejection and reusability water contact angle of pristine polyvinyl chloride membrane was 92 while that of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was 61 pure water permeation flux and bsa bovine serum albumin rejection of polyvinyl chloride membrane improved from 192 lm 2 h 1 to 613 lm 2 h 1 and 81 5 to 92 1 for p go ag 0 5 wt membrane the irreversible fouling of polyvinyl chloride membrane decreases from 54 6 to 14 4 suggesting the highly antifouling character of go ag p go ag 0 5 wt membrane exhibits excellent flux recovery after three successive cycles of water and bsa filtration besides this the synthesized go ag nanocomposite was proved to be effective against e coli these results indicate that go ag based membranes have great potential in combating the water scarcity and can be used in high

13251,the integral hydrophobic characteristic of polymers hinders their implementations towards water treatment in the present work highly hydrophilic and antifouling polyvinyl chloride membranes were fabricated based on graphene oxide silver go ag nanolayers the distinctive infiltration approach of polyvinyl chloride resin through the stacked go ag layers results in surface availability of highly hydrophilic graphene oxide nanosheets incorporation of different weight percent of go ag to the polyvinyl chloride resin increases the permeability rejection and antifouling properties of polyvinyl chloride membranes water contact angle of pure polyvinyl chloride was found to decrease from 92 5 to 61 4 for go ag based membrane water flux and bovine serum albumin rejection of pure polyvinyl chloride membrane were improved from 192 lm 2 h 1 to 613 lm 2 h 1 and 81 5 to 92 1 respectively besides this graphene oxide silver based membrane depicts least irreversible fouling 14 3 and highest flux recovery ratio 85 6 maintenance of high flux recovery ratio of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane after three consecutive cycles of water and bovine serum albumin filtration justify the high durability of membrane the synthesized go ag nanoadditive showed appreciable antibacterial activity against escherichia coli thermo gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry analysis of go ag based membranes proves their high thermal stability as well graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide silver nanoparticles resin infiltration bsa rejection cyclic filtration 1 introduction approach to sustainable clean water has become a rigorous challenge throughout the world according to world water council about 3 9 billion people will suffer from water scarcity issue by 2030 1 2 development and implementation of cost effective and ecofriendly high performance membrane filters can tackle the dilemma of water shortage traditional water treatment strategies include ion exchange chemical precipitation oxidation reduction adsorption electrochemical method photo catalysis reverse osmosis and membrane filtration 3 4 ultrafiltration and microfiltration techniques are usually employed to remove colloids microorganisms bacteria and macromolecules from polluted water polymer membranes based on low cost hydrophilic nanoadditives are being used as ultrafiltration membranes among various polymers polyvinyl chloride pvc 5 polysulfone ps 6 cellulose acetate ca 7 polyvinyledene fluoride pvdf 8 and polyethersulfone pes 9 are widely used for membrane fabrication one of the main problems associated with the use of polymeric membrane is biofouling which deteriorate the membrane quality and reduces the lifespan of membranes 10 11 fouling may occur due to adsorption of colloids pollutants and macromolecules and microorganisms on the membrane surface or inside the pores 12 13 adhesion of proteins and microorganisms from the feed water results in rapid augmentation of biofilm on the membrane surface some oxidizing agents like hydrogen peroxide chlorine dioxide and mono chloramine are widely used to remove biofilms which cannot be removed through simple hydraulic washing however using these chemicals may results in derogation of membrane surface which deteriorate separation efficiency of membranes 14 15 therefore it is mandatory to develop novel membranes which have strong resistance to biofilms without using these oxidants using appropriate hydrophilic nanofillers can compensate the membrane fouling and hence improves membrane performance various organic and inorganic nanomaterials like go 16 sba 17 zno 18 tio2 19 and fe2o3 20 are being explored for waste water treatment graphene oxide go a two dimensional carbon nanofiller with its distinctive features like excellent thermo mechanical stability high surface functionality tunability high surface area hydrophilicity antibacterial property and low cost production has been investigated widely for fabrication of high performance membranes presence of honey comb like nanochannel network with tunable d spacing facilitates the water transport through graphene oxide while rejecting the pollutants 2 16 zhao et al 21 fabricated go based pvc membranes by using phase inversion method and reported a significant increase in hydrophilicity water flux and durability of pvc go membranes hasan et al 22 investigated that addition of go 1 3 wt into pvc matrix leads to a highly stable thermo mechanical membrane hossien et al 23 studied the effect of aspartic acid functionalized go on pvc matrix and suggested that go aspartate based membranes have good fouling control and better water flux properties vahid et al 24 prepared antifouling pvc membranes embedded with graphene quantum dots these membranes showed 98 bsa rejection and 96 reactive blue rejection however π π stacking of go sheets results in its agglomeration within polymer matrix and affects its applications one of the quick method to overcome agglomeration is functionalization of go with different metal and metal oxide nanoparticles 25 go ag 26 go zno 18 go tio2 19 and go nanodiamond 27 are widely used to improve the permeate flux and antifouling properties of polymer membranes among metal nanoparticles silver nanoparticles agnps are broadly used because of their low cost low toxicity and outstanding antimicrobial features the antimicrobial property of agnps is directly linked with their size and shape low colloidal stability of agnps results in their aggregation which decreases their surface area and antimicrobial activity 15 so the main problem associated with the use of graphene oxide and silver nanoparticles is their agglomeration property functionalization of go with agnps results in high exfoliation of go nanosheets by increasing the interlayer distance of go nanolayers on the other hand using highly oxygenated substrate like go provides high binding sites for nucleation and growth of agnps 15 25 so functionalization of go with agnps helps in uniform dispersion of agnps and exfoliation of go nanosheets as well cobos et al 26 reported the use of pva go ag nanocomposite against two pathogenic bacteria staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli firouzjaei et al 28 designed a thin film composite tfc membrane based on go ag and tested against escherichia coli and sodium alginate the study of firouzjaei et al studied that go ag based tfc membrane exhibited strong antimicrobial activity as compared to go and silver based tfc membranes ilyas et al 29 investigated that peg go ag reinforced pvdf co hfp membranes possess excellent control over bsa protein fouling and water flux recovery polymer membranes are mostly fabricated by phase inversion or solution casting methods which involve mixing of nanofillers within polymer matrix and membrane surface remain deficient of hydrophilic moieties 30 resin infiltration technique can help in surface availability of nanocomposites to tackle the hydrophobic and fouling concerns of polymers resin infiltration assembly is reciprocal to layer by layer assembly in which the layered components interact with each other by electrostatic attraction or h bonding 31 the aim of the present study was to fabricate a highly hydrophilic and fouling resistant pvc membrane by using go ag nanocomposite in this strategy graphene oxide was synthesized and functionalized with silver nanoparticles silver nanoparticles acts as nano spacers between graphene oxide layers and prevents restacking of go layers on the other hand go substrate favors the uniform dispersion and stability of silver nanoparticles go and go ag nanocomposites were dispersed in thf and filtered through vacuum filtration assembly to obtain a go go ag layer than the pvc thf resin was filtered through the well settled go and go ag layer this resin infiltration results in crosslinking the go ag nanosheets with polyvinyl chloride pvc chains which increases their stability synergistic properties of go and agnps as well as surface availability of go ag will gave outstanding features to the synthesized membrane performance of pvc go and pvc go ag membrane was analyzed by measuring the water flux bsa flux bsa rejection antifouling study cyclic filtration and go ag leaching test the synthesized go and go ag nanocomposites were also tested against gram negative bacteria escherichia coli 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials graphite powder 99 9 silver nitrate agno3 99 sodium nitrate nano3 98 potassium permanganate kmno4 95 and sulfuric

stirring nabh4 reduces the ag ions decorated on the surface of go sheets silver functionalized go nanosheets go ag were than washed with deionized water and dried in vacuum oven at 50 c 2 3 fabrication of pvc go ag membranes pvc go ag nanocomposite membranes p go ag were fabricated by employing resin infiltration technique as shown in scheme 1 go ag 0 25 0 5 and 1 wt nanoadditives were dispersed in thf 10 ml by ultrasonication well dispersed go ag suspensions were filtered through a 0 2 μm polyethersulfone pes filter paper fitted in a vacuum filtration assembly after partial drying of go ag layer pvc resin 10 g in 80 ml thf was dropped on to this go ag layer and allowed to filter through the nanoadditive layer viscosity of the pvc resin was 900 8 5 pa s 1 resin infiltration of pvc through go ag nano channels helps in gripping of go ag particles resulting in increased stability of pvc go ag membrane the obtained membrane was peeled off from the surface of filter paper and dried at room temperature pvc go 0 5 wt membrane was synthesized following the same above mentioned procedure the pristine pvc membrane was fabricated by using solution casting method 2 4 characterization of nanofiller purity and crystallinity of go and go ag nanocomposites were studied by using bruker xrd x ray diffraction d8 phaser 2θ 5 to 80 surface morphology of nanoadditives was

go ag membranes were explored by ftir spectra nicolet is10 ftir spectrophotometer over a range of 500 to 4000 cm 1 2 6 thermal and mechanical stability of membranes thermal stability of all the nanocomposite membranes was analyzed by netzsch thermo gravimetric analyzer with heating rate of 10 per minute membrane coupons were heated from 25 to 700 c and weight loss of each sample was noted accordingly dsc study was done to check the glass transition temperature and melting temperature of the prepared membranes tensile strength of the fabricated membranes was explored by win test analysis using testometric materials testing machine uk 2 7 porosity and water contact angle porosity ε of all the nanocomposite membranes was explored by using gravimetric analysis table 1 enlists the equation used to evaluate the porosity of membranes 32 where w2 and w1 are the weight of dry and wet membrane l is the membrane thickness m a is active area of membrane m2 and ρw is the density of water 0 998 g cm3 in eq 1 for porosity measurement as shown in table 1 water contact angle is directly linked with hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of composites high contact angle refers to more hydrophobic character and less permeability of water water contact angle of all the membranes was measured by using tensiometer ksv apparatus to check the effect of go ag on hydrophilicity of pvc membranes 2 8 permeability and rejection water permeability of all the membranes was checked by undergoing water flux jw measurement using a filtration assembly having 10 cm2 effective membrane area initially the membranes were compressed for 0 5 h by applying 0 1 mpa nitrogen gas pressure in order to get the steady membrane flux after membrane compaction pressure was slightly reduced and adjusted to 0 06 mpa for water flux measurement than the water flux jw1 was calculated by using eq 2 listed in table 1 33 where v is the permeated volume l of liquid a is total area of membrane in m2 and t is time required for permeation three sets of each membrane were fabricated and triplicate measurements were noted to minimize the error after 30 min the water feed was replaced by 0 5 g l bsa solution in phosphate buffer saline and bsa flux was noted using the above mentioned equation bsa rejection was measured through uv spectroscopy by noting the concentration of feed and permeates eq 3 table 1 was applied to calculate of bsa rejection 33 cp and cf are the concentrations of permeate and feed solution in mole dm 3 2 9 antifouling ratio and flux recovery antifouling properties of all the membranes were explored by comparing the water and bsa flux of all the membranes after measuring the bsa flux for 0 5 h the membranes were washed with distilled water to remove the adsorbed foulants and then water flux was noted again for another 0 5 h to measure the flux recovery ratio total fouling ratio rt reversible fouling ratio rir irreversible fouling ratio rir and flux recovery ratio frr were calculated using eqs 4 7 respectively table 1 34 where jw1 is pure water flux jp is bsa protein flux and jw2 is water flux after washing the membrane 2 10 leaching of go and go ag leaching of go and agnps from the fabricated p go and p go ag 0 5 wt membranes was monitored by uv spectroscopy the fabricated membranes were dipped in 50 ml distilled water and sonicated by bath sonication for 1 h than the uv spectra was recorded to monitor the leaching of go and agnps the membranes were remained dipped in water and uv spectra was noted again after 24 h 1 day and 168 h 1 week to check the stability of go ag 2 11 antibacterial performance microbial resistance of go and go ag nanocomposites was studied against escherichia coli 105 cfu strain 1 mg ml of go and go ag nanocomposite solution was incubated with e coli culture and sem images were taken at different incubation times to compare the bactericidal properties of go and go ag 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go and go ag purity and crystallinity of go and go ag nanosheets was studied by xrd spectroscopy xrd pattern of go fig 1 shows a clear peak at 11 59 θ while that of graphite at 26 θ fig s1 xrd peak of go in go ag nanocomposite slightly shifts towards lower theta i e 10 39 θ which suggested the strong intercalation of agnps between go sheets 35 this intercalation of agnps between stacked go layers results in increased d spacing of go nanosheets increased d spacing in go ag nanosheets 8 5 å as compared to go nanosheets 7 6 å depicts the excellent features of go ag in terms of stability and dispersion besides this the appearance of agnps peaks at 38 12 θ 64 40 θ and 77 40 θ confirms the successful functionalization of go nanosheets in order to explore the morphological features of go and go ag nanocomposites sem and tem analysis were performed sem and tem images of go a b and go ag c d are represented in fig 2 sem micrograph of go shows multilayer patterns of go stacked upon each other on the other hand go ag microstructure reveals unfolded sheets of go tem images further clarify the uniform dispersion of go ag nanosheets tem micrographs of go ag manifest crumpled nanosheets of go decorated with uniformly distributed agnps sem and tem images proves that silver functionalization helps in better dispersion of go nanosheets which results in increased d spacing of go patterns and unfurling of stacked go sheets uniform distribution of agnps results in increase in specific surface area of agnps and hence increases their availability edx analysis of go ag nanoadditive confirms the presence of agnps on graphene oxide sheets as shown in fig s2 to investigate the functionalities of go and go ag nanocomposite ftir spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 as shown in fig 3 appearance of a clear hump at 3124 and 3147 cm 1 represents the presence of oh functional group in go and go ag the peak at 1710 cm 1 and 1613 cm 1 in go nanocomposite confirms the stretching vibration co and cc respectively the peak at 1026 cm 1 deals with the epoxy stretching vibration of co in case of go ag nanocomposite a small shift in stretching vibrations of co and cc was observed this shift in peaks from 1710 to 1719 cm 1 and 1613 to 1570 cm 1 indicates the interaction of agnps with carbonyl and carboxyl moieties of go nanosheets 36 successful functionalization of go by agnps was further explored by uv spectra fig 4a shows the uv spectra of go and go ag in the uv spectra of go two clear absorption peaks were observed due to n pi and pi pi transitions in uv spectra of go the absorption peaks at 214 nm and 236 nm represents the pi pi and n pi transitions of cc and co functional groups in go ag nanocomposite the absorption peak at 390 nm indicates strong resonance of agnps furthermore the raman spectra of go and go ag fig 4b clarify the presence of sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbon atoms the appearance of d and g bands in raman spectral analysis of go was due to the vibrations of sp3and sp2 carbon atoms the drastic increase in intensities of d 1360 cm 1 and g 1598 cm 1 bands of go in go ag was attributed to the fast charge transfer mechanism due to silver functionalization of go nanosheets 37 38 surface charges of nanofillers play a crucial role in controlling the permeability and rejection of different molecules zeta potential gives a better estimation of surface charges of nanofillers zeta potential of freshly prepared go and go ag solutions 1 mg ml was measured three times for each sample zeta potential of pure go was noted to be 21 4 2 1 mv while that of go ag was found to be 31 4 3 2 mv zeta potential graphs of go and go ag nanocomposites are shown in fig s3 supplementary data increased surface charge of go ag nanocomposite will result in increased hydrophilicity and high electro static repulsion of bsa foulant 3 2 characterization of membranes 3 2 1 morphology and chemical nature of membranes xrd patterns of all the pvc membranes with and without addition of go and go ag are represented in fig s4 xrd spectra of pure pvc membrane consist of a minute hump at 23 2 θ which suggests the amorphous nature of pvc in go and go ag loaded membranes the characteristic peaks of go and agnps merged together within the polymer matrix xrd patterns of p go and p go ag membranes consist of a clear hump in the range 36 to 40 θ as compared to pvc membrane by increasing the go ag content from 0 25 to 1 wt a small shift in position of hump towards higher theta value was observed at a very high filler content i e p go ag 1 wt the appearance of minute peaks at 12 8 θ and 38 4 θ was noticed which can be attributed to the characteristic xrd peaks of go and agnps surface morphology of all the pvc membranes incorporated with go and go ag nanofiller was explored by sem analysis fig 5 shows the sem images of pvc p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 25 0 5 1 wt the sem image of pure pvc shows a very dense membrane surface sem micrographs of go based pvc membrane shows the clusters of undispersed go sheets while go ag based membranes depicts regular patterns go sheets dispersed throughout the pvc matrix fesem images of p go ag membranes prove that agnps helps in better dispersion of go which results in well exfoliation of go however at a very higher filler content 1 wt the go ag nanoparticles tends to agglomerate but this aggregation was much less as compare to un functionalized go the particle size of agglomerated go sheets clearly reduced in p go ag membranes which manifest strong intercalation of silver nanoparticles between go sheets resulting in increased interlayer spacing and better dispersion thickness of the fabricated membranes lies between 100 μm to 190 μm respectively thickness of pure pvc was 100 μm while that of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was 160 μm and p go ag 1 wt membrane was 190 μm respectively cross sectional sem images of pvc membrane with and without go ag nanoadditive are represented in fig 6 cross sectional sem images of pure pvc membrane comprises of a dense skin layer while that of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane shows some finger like projections and micro voids throughout the membrane cross section presence of a porous sub layer in addition to the surface skin layer in case of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane can be attributed to the interactions of go ag nanosheets with pvc chains by covalent bonding along with displacement of cl atoms from pvc backbone resulting in disordering the pvc chains and increasing the porous structures surface features of p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt were further investigated by tem analysis as shown in fig 7 tem image of p go membrane was comprised of stacked go sheets while that of p go ag tem displays crumpled silk like patterns of unfolded go ag sheets figs 5 and 7 portrayed the uniformly decorated go ag nanolayers throughout the polymer matrix resulting in increased surface roughness and hydrophilicity of p go ag membranes the tem images of p go ag at 200 nm resemble the tem micrographs of pure go ag nanoadditive which ensures the availability of go ag nanofiller on the top of the membrane surface the tem micrographs of p go ag indicate that silver functionalization helps in preventing the stacking of go sheets which results in decreased agglomeration of nanoadditives within the polymer matrix these results suggest that p go ag nanocomposite comprises excellent features as compared to pristine pvc and p go membrane sem and tem analysis validate that the surface properties of the pvc membranes are robustly influenced by incorporation of go and go ag nanocomposites according to hosseini et al 39 the bet brunauer emmett teller surface area of pvc membrane was about 14 61 m2 g another study of zaheen ullah et al 31 reported that the bet surface area of pvc go membrane was 474 03 m2 g these studies illustrate that go plays and important role in increasing the specific surface area of pvc membranes surface functionalities of the p go and p go ag membranes were explored through ftir spectra as shown in fig s5 a clear shift in peak from 1642 to 1715 cm 1 was observed in go ag containing membranes which clarify the interaction of co moieties of go with pvc resin a slight shift in peak positions of co co and cc was observed in p go ag spectra as compare pure ftir peaks of go ag fig 3 which suggests the favorable interaction of pvc resin filtered through go ag nanolayers 3 2 2 thermal and mechanical stability of membranes to investigate the thermal stability of fabricated membranes all the membrane samples were heated from 25 c to 700 c in an inert atmosphere a two step degradation behavior was observed in tga curves of all the membranes fig 8a tga curve of pure pvc membrane shows first degradation step at 209 c and degradation continuous up to 370 c this degradation mainly corresponds to the elimination of small molecules like hcl at this stage the cl radical formed from cleavage of ccl bond withdraw h from the nearby ch bond and results in hcl evolution a major weight loss of the pvc membrane occurs involving dislocation of all the cl atoms and leaving behind polyene backbone 40 no weight loss was observed from 370 c to 446 c which suggests the stability of polymer backbone in this region another minor weight loss was noted in the temp range of 446 c to 508 c in case of p go 0 5 wt membrane the first degradation temperature increases up to 249 c while for p go ag 0 5 wt membrane initial degradation starts at 263 c this increase in degradation temperature corresponds to the strong interaction of go ag nanosheets with ccl bonds of pvc matrix a total weight loss of 98 was obtained for pure pvc membrane and for p go and p go ag 0 5 wt membrane the weight loss decreases to 86 72 and 45 62 respectively tga curves of p go ag 1 wt membrane shows a weight loss of 80 02 which indicates the aggregation of nanofiller at high filler content such aggregations weaken the polymer go interaction and results in poor stability of membranes so the thermal stability of all the modified membranes increases appreciably up to 0 5 wt filler content and decreases again on further increase in filler content thermal stability of pvc and p go and p go ag based membranes was further explored by dsc analysis fig 8b membrane coupons were heating from 25 to 300 c at the rate of 10 per minute and then cooled back to room temperature glass transition temperature tg of all the modified pvc membranes was found to be increased as compare to pure pvc tg of the pure membrane was 55 27 c and increased to 64 5 c by the addition of 1 wt go ag nanocomposite as the glass transition temperature depends on the mobility of polymer molecules addition of nanofillers like go and go ag increases the compactness of polymer chains and tg shifts to the higher temperature moreover the crystallization temperature tcrys and melting temperature of the go ag modified pvc membranes also increases tcrys of pure pvc was noted by an exothermic curve at 222 c while that of p go ag 0 5 wt was at 228 c unmodified pvc membrane shows an endothermic melting curve at 276 c while p go ag 0 5 wt membrane undergo melting at 286 c so the increase in tg tcrys and tm represents the strong intercalation of go and go ag nanosheets within the polymer chains resulting in increased thermal stability as reported in literature 41 42 introduction of highly functional nanosheets in polymer resin limits the chain mobility of host polymer and hence changes the tg tcrys and tm subsequently mechanical stability of pristine pvc p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt membranes was monitored by tensile testing and reported in fig 9 tensile strength of pvc membrane was noted as 44 9 mpa while that of p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was 33 6 mpa and 20 5 mpa respectively this decrease in tensile strength insinuate the increased porosity of go and go ag based membranes the presence of large number of microporous cavities and high porosity as observed in fig 6 c d are the main reasons behind decreased tensile strength of go ag based membranes 32 3 2 3 water contact angle and porosity porosity and water contact angle are the two main features in controlling the membrane performance although in general a highly porous membrane corresponds to excellent water permeation but in many cases all the pores are not equally available for reaction aggregation of nanocomposites may result in pore blocking and hence decreases their availability porosity of all the go ag based membranes fig 10 a was found to be increased as compared to pure pvc and go based pvc membrane porosity of pvc membrane was 62 6 while that of 0 5 wt p go ag was 82 respectively further increase in filler content decreases the membrane porosity these results are in good agreement with sem micrographs of membranes and shows that p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was best in terms of increased porosity and excellent dispersion of nanofiller in case of 1 wt p go ag membrane the go sheets tends to agglomerate which results in congestion of water channels and pore blockage hydrophilicity test of pvc membranes was carried out by measuring the static water contact angle on all the membrane surfaces contact angle is a surface property and linked primarily with the quantity and quality of nanoadditives dispersed in polymer matrix as well as with surface roughness of membrane addition of hydrophilic nanocomposites results in increased hydrophilic character of pvc membranes 43 44 water contact angle of pristine pvc and all the modified membranes are listed in fig 10 a while fig 10 b represents the water contact angle images of pvc p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt membrane respectively the unique infiltration approach of pvc resin through the go and go ag nanosheets results in availability of go nanosheets on the membrane surface as confirmed from tem images of membrane fig 7 and decreases the water contact angle of p go ag based membranes by increasing the surface roughness of membranes water contact angle of pristine pvc decreases from 92 to 73 for p go 0 5 wt and 61 for p go ag 0 5 wt membrane however in case of p go ag 1 wt nanocomposite the water contact angle was found to increase up to 64 which corresponds to the aggregation of go ag nanolayers at high filler content resulting in poor hydrophilicity these results of decreased contact angle of p go ag based membranes indicating an increased surface roughness of membrane are consistent with the literature 45 ahmed sari et al 46 reported a consistent decrease in water contact angle with increased surface roughness entailing an increased hydrophilic character to the membrane surface 3 3 membrane performance 3 3 1 water flux and bsa rejection of membranes pure water flux jw and bsa flux jp of all the membranes was evaluated and shown in fig 11 a addition of water friendly nanocomposites to the pvc matrix leads to the successful tuning of membranes properties water flux of all the modified membranes was found to be increased as compare to pure pvc membrane water flux for pvc membrane was 192 lm 2 h 1 while that of p go ag 0 5 wt was 613 lm 2 h 1 which gives an increase of 219 water flux was found to increase linearly with the increase of go ag content up to 0 5 wt but a further increase in go ag wt leads to the reduction of water transport through the p go ag channels at a very high filler content i e 1 wt p go ag the aggregation increases resulting in pores clogging and decreasing the water permeation in p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt membrane water flux increases by 1 9 folds and 3 2 folds in comparison with pure pvc membrane the p go ag 0 5 wt was noticed to be the best membrane in terms of higher water flux and increased hydrophilicity these results support the earlier results of sem porosity and contact angle as all these analysis depicts that for 1 wt membrane aggregation effect surmounts and results in malfunctioning of membrane in order to assess the bsa rejection of pvc membranes the pure water was replaced with bsa feed solution by changing the feed water with bsa protein solution the flux of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane decreases to 348 lm 2 h 1 decline in bsa flux was attributed to the surface adsorption of bsa foulants resulting in blocking of water channels and hence lowering the permeability the bsa flux decreases drastically for pure pvc membrane which corresponds to the highly hydrophobic nature of pvc resulting in adsorption of bsa molecules on the membrane surface as shown figs 11 and 12 increased water permeation as well as high bsa rejection can be attributed to the combined effect of h bonding as well as electrostatic forces on the membrane surface and interface in case of p go ag based membrane formation of a dense water layer on the membrane surface repels the hydrophobic bsa molecules and increases their rejection although the bsa flux of all the membranes decreases with time but this decrease was slightly low in case of p go ag based membranes bsa molecules are negatively charged at ph 7 an increase in membrane surface charge as confirmed from zeta potential of go ag 31 4 mv fig s3 increases the electrostatic repulsion between bsa and membrane surface resulting in decreased bsa adsorption 47 bsa rejection for pvc membrane was 81 5 while that of p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt was 87 and 92 1 as shown in fig 11 b in contradiction with water flux the bsa rejection of 1 wt p go ag membrane increases significantly 93 3 this increase in bsa rejection was supported from literature high filler content may induce pore blocking and decreases the permeability but it provides increased active surface for adsorption of bsa molecules within the stacked layers of go 47 3 3 2 antifouling efficiency of membranes antifouling efficiency of a filtration membrane is closely associated with its hydrophobic or hydrophilic property microorganisms and proteins bsa are considered as main pollutants causing membrane fouling these pollutants badly affect the membrane performance by setting down on the surface of membranes or inside the pores however availability of hydrophilic surfaces on the top layer of membrane could hinder the protein adsorption by forming a water layer on the membrane surface fig 12 48 synergistic effects of go and agnps excels the hydrophilicity of p go ag membrane fouling ratios of all the fabricated membranes are shown in fig 11 c among all the fabricated membranes highest total fouling ratio and highest irreversible fouling ratio was noticed in case of pvc membrane i e 74 9 and 54 6 fouling ratio decreases to 56 by the addition of 0 5 wt p go and decreases to lowest value of 43 23 for p go ag 0 5 wt membrane temporary fouling can be reversed by back flushing or washing the membrane with distilled water permanent blocking of pores by adhesion of membrane foulants results in irreversible membrane fouling and decreases the efficiency and life span of membrane filters these results indicate that go ag nanofiller plays an essential role in decreasing the membrane fouling and hence increases the water transport through the modified membranes 3 3 3 flux recovery ratio of membranes after sequential filtration of water and bsa solutions through the membranes all the membranes were washed with water for 30 min and water flux was measured again to estimate the flux recovery ratio of membranes frr of all the fabricated membranes are shown in fig 13 a irreversible fouling of membranes either by adsorption of bsa on the surface or by pore blocking results in poor flux recovery frr was highest for p go ag 0 5 wt membrane 85 6 and lowest for pvc membrane 45 3 p go 0 5 wt membrane exhibit 68 1 frr while that of p go ag 0 25 wt shows frr of 70 9 these results revealed the appreciable hydrophilic features of go ag in tailoring the surface properties of pvc membranes bsa molecules are hydrophobic in nature and availability of highly hydrophilic go ag nanosheets on the membrane surface helps in controlling the bsa adsorption on membranes 3 4 cyclic filtration due to high risks of polymer membrane foiling the re usability of polymer membranes is quite challenging among all the pvc go ag based membranes p go ag 0 5 wt showed the best performance in terms of permeability and rejection in order to check the reusability of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane four successive cycles of water permeation were designed cyclic flux and frr of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was shown in fig 13 b c water and bsa permeation was noted over a period of 3 5 h after initial compaction of membrane jw1 was noted every 5 min up to 0 5 h after that bsa permeation flux jp was noted in the same way for next 0 5 h bsa flux was found to decrease appreciably suggesting the adsorption of bsa molecules within the nanochannels of go the fouled membrane was washed with distilled water for another 0 5 h and then jw2 was measured to figure out the flux recovery ratio the same sequence of water and bsa filtration followed by membrane washing was repeated for 3 5 h jw1 jw2 jw3 and frr for cyclic flux were calculated by using the eqs 1 and 7 table 1 respectively water flux of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane for three filtration cycles was 613 lm 2 h 1 525 lm 2 h 1 and 517 lm 2 h 1 flux recovery ratio of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was 85 64 84 17 and 80 26 which reveals high stability and reusability of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane 3 5 leaching effect of go and go ag rapid release of nanoparticles from the membrane matrix can affect the durability and performance of a membrane filter leaching of go and agnps from the fabricated pvc membranes was monitored by uv spectroscopy fig s6 the fabricated p go 0 5 wt and p go ag 0 5 wt membranes were dipped in 50 ml distilled water and sonicated by bath sonication for 1 h the uv spectra reveals the stability of both go and agnps as no any peak was observed in the range of 200 to 450 nm after 1 h sonication the membranes were remained dipped in water and uv spectra was noted again after 24 h 1 day and 168 h 1 week the uv spectra of both samples after 24 h justify the stability of go ag as shown in fig s6 a however a long term interaction with water results in negligible leaching of go from p go 0 5 wt but the p go ag 0 5 wt membrane still persists its stability fig s6 b the infiltration of pvc resin through the go ag nanolayers results in immobilization of silver nanoparticles on go surfaces which hinders the leaching of silver nanoparticles and increases the stability of p go ag membranes li jingchun et al 49 studied that go helps in controlling the release of agnps from polymer membranes by providing large number of anchoring sites in terms of functional groups saranya et al 50 also supports the negligible leaching of go ag nanofiller and confirms the stability of go ag besides this cyclic filtration of water and bsa solutions also depicts the stability of go ag based membranes 3 6 antibacterial features another big issue associated with membrane filtration is formation of biofilm or cake layer on polymer membrane due to accumulation of microorganisms on the membrane surface using antibacterial nanoparticles to reduce the chances of biofilm formation is an effective strategy to enhance membrane performance 51 in order to assess the antibacterial properties of synthesized go and go ag nanocomposites a gram negative bacteria escherichia coli was chosen as biofoulant usually gram negative bacteria are considered to be more resistant to antibiotics due to their compact cell wall as compared to gram positive bacteria so if a substance is resistant to gram negative bacteria it would also be effective to gram positive bacteria 52 in order explore the antibacterial features of go and go ag nano composites e coli culture 105 cfu was incubated with freshly prepared 1 mg ml go and go ag nanocomposite sem micrographs of both samples were recorded after 0 5 h 3 h and 6 h incubation fig 9 represents the sem micrographs of go and go ag nanocomposites incubated with e coli culture at different incubation time sem image of pure e coli culture is shown in fig s7 sem images of go and go ag nanocomposite manifest the minimal adhesion of e coli on the surface of go nanosheets as compared to control sample fig s7 sem micrographs of go nanocomposite at 3 h incubation comprises a large number of e coli cells while in case of go ag nanocomposite the number of e coli cells decreases appreciably this decrease in e coli cells suggest the interaction of ag nanoparticles with the e coli cell wall resulting in rupturing of cell wall and killing of e coli cells after 6 h incubation only two e coli cells diffused in go ag nanocomposite were viewed through sem as shown in fig 14 f these results manifest the effectiveness of go ag nanocomposite in controlling bacterial growth so the intercalation of go ag nanocomposite in pvc membranes can successfully assist in minimizing microbial fouling of membranes 3 7 proposed interactions between pvc go ag and h2o molecules in the pvc go ag membranes polar groups of graphene oxide may interact with cl groups of pvc resulting in disordered pvc chains these interactions result in increased roughness and porosity of membranes on the other hand the polar groups of go interact with external water molecules resulting in h bonding in p go ag membranes a covalent bond exists between cc atoms of pvc and go fig 15 represent the possible interaction between pvc and go ag sheets as well as with water molecules presence of strong h bonding and high polarity increases the hydrophilicity and permeability of p go ag membranes 3 8 comparison with literature table 2 compares the performance of fabricated membranes with some other membranes from literature comparison was made interms of water flux rejection and flux recovery ratio of membranes by the addition of different modifiers ahmed et al reported the synthesis of pluronic f127 polyacrylonitrile bentonite pvc membrane for ultrafiltration the fabricated membrane possesses excellent features interms of ultralow water contact angle increased antifouling property with 97 oil removal efficiency alardhi et al 53 proclaimed the use of pvc hollow fiber membranes for the rejection of methyl green from simulated waste water with a removal efficiency of 59 46 and permeate flux of 32 71 l h m2 karim et al 54 designed an ultrafiltration membrane based on ag tio2 and α aminophosphonate modified montmorillonite mmt the composite membrane comprises excellent permeate flux 400 lm 2 h 1 and reduced protein fouling abdel wahed et al 55 demonstrate the use of use of zno tio2 based ceramic glass material as photo catalyst for decontamination of textile waste water zno tio2 photo catalyst exhibit maximum efficiency of 53 for removal of humic acid ali et al 56 deliberate the use of activated carbon and zirconium oxide zro2 for the photo degradation of 4 octylphenol table 2 depicts the outstanding permeate flux of fabricated p go ag membrane as compared to many other pvc membranes this comparison supports the use of go ag nanofiller as a surface modifier as well as a highly hydrophilic and antifouling adsorbent to treat the biofouling of polymer membranes 3 9 possible applications future prospects because of high hydrophilicity excellent antifouling property and enhanced thermal stability the go ag nanocomposite can help in tailoring the hydrophobic challenges of polymeric membranes although the p go ag membrane possesses enhanced performance in terms of water flux and bsa rejection there is a need to improve the bsa rejection without compromising water flux the synthesized p go ag membranes can be used for waste water treatment heavy metal adsorption etc the synthesized go ag nanofiller have vast majority of applications in target drug delivery bone regeneration artificial muscle formation etc however these membranes still need a lot of modifications and tests to be used in food packaging and other real life applications so the present study is a gateway to further explore the go based membranes to tackle the environmental challenges 4 conclusion in this study go ag based highly hydrophilic and antifouling polyvinyl chloride membranes were fabricated by resin infiltration technique the synthesized p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was found to have outstanding performance in terms of permeation rejection and reusability water contact angle of pristine polyvinyl chloride membrane was 92 while that of p go ag 0 5 wt membrane was 61 pure water permeation flux and bsa bovine serum albumin rejection of polyvinyl chloride membrane improved from 192 lm 2 h 1 to 613 lm 2 h 1 and 81 5 to 92 1 for p go ag 0 5 wt membrane the irreversible fouling of polyvinyl chloride membrane decreases from 54 6 to 14 4 suggesting the highly antifouling character of go ag p go ag 0 5 wt membrane exhibits excellent flux recovery after three successive cycles of water and bsa filtration besides this the synthesized go ag nanocomposite was proved to be effective against e coli these results indicate that go ag based membranes have great potential in combating the water scarcity and can be used in high

13252,in a comparative approach toward treating real pulp and paper wastewater ppww iron based electro chemical processes such as peroxi coagulation pc electrocoagulation ec electro fenton ef and ultrasound assisted pc ec and ef were investigated sono peroxi coagulation spc process showed the best performance for treating the ppww the optimal results were achieved under reaction time 50 min current density 140 ma and ph 2 0 employing the spc process for treating ppww under optimal conditions the best cod removal efficiency 81 7 was achieved also continuous ph adjustment of the solution as compared to lack of adjustment showed a significant influence on cod removal efficiency more than 10 the effect of ph on the spc process and the kind of electro chemical treatment process utilized on biodegradability were investigated using bod cod ratio and average oxidation state aos in comparison with other electro chemical processes used in this study the best biodegradability results were obtained for the spc process in ph 2 being 0 4 and 0 94 for bod cod ratio and aos respectively spc process compared to the sono ef process had superior cod removal efficiency and their difference in performance reached near 40 the influence of sonication was obtained 11 3 and 9 for pc and ef processes respectively in evaluating the toxicity the best germination index of raphanus sativus irrigated by treated wastewater samples was achieved 77 9 for the spc process the application of us for electrochemical process increased energy consumption and cost of process considerably the sludge of spc was also evaluated by fourier transform infrared spectrum ftir x ray diffractometer xrd and field emission scanning electron microscope fesem graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biodegradability electro fenton peroxi coagulation phytotoxicity pulp and paper wastewater ultrasound 1 introduction when it comes to water consumption in the production process of industries the pulp and paper industry is ranked near the top 1 2 which makes this industrial section one of the largest producers of wastewater in the world 3 the pulp and paper wastewater ppww due to the presence of a wide spectrum of toxic and non biodegradable organic materials adsorbable organic halogens color phenolic compounds etc is considered a real threat to biotic life and the environment 4 5 as such there is an emerging demand to explore more efficient sustainable and inexpensive techniques for treating ppww in this regard biological treatment methods such as anaerobic aerobic decompositions are among the conventional and eco friendly approaches toward ppww that have been applied commonly however the presence of recalcitrant substances brings about low biodegradability prohibiting the microorganisms to cope with such waste streams 2 3 6 thus the application of other treatment methods has gained significant attention in the effort to ameliorate the adverse impacts of ppww on the environment 6 and the subsequent biological treatment units there are numerous reports on the treatment of ppww based on physical chemical electrochemical and biological processes 8 however since these methods have some major limitations shortcomings and lack of efficiencies electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops as an alternative have been extensively investigated and proved to be efficient for wastewaters containing resistant organic materials 7 8 it is well known that the individual techniques have some shortcomings for the efficient treatment of real ppww due to its complex nature in recent years the great abundance and the versatile role both as coagulant and catalyst in electrochemical processes have made iron fe one of the most favorable substances to be used in wastewater treatment generally iron based electrochemical processes can be categorized as electro coagulation ec electro fenton ef or a combination of them 9 in electro coagulation ec a sacrificial anode fe as an example is used for in situ electro generation of coagulant species in the solution 9 on the other hand electro fenton ef process combines the generation of ho via common fenton reaction as shown in eq 1 and electro generation of h2o2 via oxygen reduction reaction as written in eq 2 in the presence of ferrous ion as a catalyst 10 12 this process when equipped with a sacrificial fe anode for in situ electro generation of ferrous ion eq 3 is called peroxi coagulation pc 9 11 taking advantage of both advanced oxidation and ec processes 13 1 h 2 o 2 fe 2 fe 3 ho oh k 40 80 m 1 s 1 2 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 e 0 0 68 v she 3 fe fe 2 2 e e 0 0 44 v she the ho produced in the fenton reaction is of strong oxidizing potential with a non selective nature making it capable of mineralizing a broad spectrum of organic pollutants through producing dehydrogenated or hydroxylated intermediates 13 14 what is more at cathode fe3 is reduced thus fe2 is regenerated via eq 4 and the residual fe3 in the solution gives rise to the formation of fe oh 3 precipitates via eq 5 contributing to pollutant removal by coagulation mechanism 15 16 4 fe 3 e fe 2 e 0 0 77 v she 5 fe 3 3 oh fe oh 3 pc process not only generates h2o2 and fe2 in situ which eliminates the costly storage and transport of h2o2 and fe 11 and prevents their direct addition to the wastewater 10 but also minimizes the required fe2 with the regeneration of this ionic species via eqs 6 and 7 10 15 17 making the entire process a highly attractive approach toward wastewater treatment 6 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe ooh 2 h k 0 001 0 01 m 1 s 1 7 fe 3 ho 2 fe 2 h o 2 k 1 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 nowadays considered as an advanced oxidation technology the ultrasound us process has grabbed the attention of academic environments 18 according to the well known hot spot theory ultrasound irradiation in liquids triggers acoustic cavitation which can be defined as formation growth and implosive collapse of bubbles leading to the generation of short lived sites of high pressure and temperature that are responsible for the thermal dissociation of h2o and formation of short life radicals 18 20 8 h 2 o us ho h 9 o 2 us 2 o 10 h o 2 us ho 2 however the recombination of formed radicals is one of the drawbacks of the us process leading to the gradual accumulation of h2o2 in the solution via the following equations eqs 11 12 thus decreases the degradation rate of organic matter 18 20 thus it would be more appealing to combine the us with other treatment methods in this vein hybridizing the us with fenton based advanced oxidation processes like ef and pc will be extremely advantageous based on three compelling reasons higher efficiency of ho generation increasing the turbulence for better contact of the radicals and pollutants and enhanced regeneration of ferrous ions that can end in faster degradation of pollutants 21 11 ho ho h 2 o 2 k 5 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 12 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 k 8 3 10 5 m 1 s 1 recently ef has been combined with us process as sono ef sef us application could improve catalytic activity of iron based catalysts the us application regenerates ferrous ions and even it could excite heterogeneous catalysts for the generation hydroxyl radicals 22 23 to the authors knowledge up to now for treating real ppww there is no previous study specifically focused on the pc process in comparison to ec and ef in the presence and absence of us waves in the present study various operational parameters such as electrolysis time applied current and ph were assessed and their influence on cod reduction in the sono peroxi coagulation spc process was investigated although the transformation products were not determined directly the oxidation degree of organic compounds was tracked using biodegradability measurements of bod cod ratio and average oxidation state aos 24 thus the effect of the kind of process used and ph of the spc process on improving biodegradability and cod removal efficiency of the ppww were investigated in optimal conditions as mentioned previously spc takes advantage of combined mechanisms of advanced oxidation and coagulation therefore to study the synergistic effects in this hybrid process us assisted ef and pc processes were comparatively investigated in optimal conditions furthermore the toxicity reduction of the optimally treated ppww was thoroughly evaluated finally spc sludge was also characterized by different methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of the ppww the pulp and paper wastewater ppww used in this work was taken from a real industrial unit located in khuzestan province iran it was kept at 4 c without any pre treatment until use a summary of the physical and chemical characteristics of this waste stream are presented in table 1 2 2 materials feso4 7h2o and naoh pellet were supplied from merck co sulfuric acid 96 was obtained from sigma aldrich all chemicals were analytical grade reagents and used as received carbon felt was purchased from sazeh morakkab inc iran all iron plates were purchased commercially to remove grease and other impurities iron fe plates were completely washed in acetone solution also after finishing each experiment iron electrodes were washed with dilute hcl 10 and finally were rinsed with deionized water di and dried in room temperature 2 3 electro chemical apparatus and experimental set up in this study an electrochemical reactor made of plexiglass was used for the spc process 10 cm diameter and 13 cm height with total volume of 1 l fig 1 prior to the commencement of each run 700 ml of ppww was poured into the reactor an iron sheet with dimensions of 11 cm 2 cm was used as the anode and carbon felt with an effective area of 45 cm2 was employed as the cathode the distance between electrodes was kept 4 cm a digital dc power supply dezhung 30 v 3 0 a equipped with voltage and current regulating ability was used for providing electrical current subsequently low frequency ultrasound us irradiation 20 khz was performed using a sonotrode with a power of 100 w q125 sonicator which was placed in the space between electrodes in order to produce hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the solution an aeration blower with a capacity of 1 5 l min was utilized to inject air into the reactor content a digital magnetic stirrer ika was responsible for agitating the solution at 200 rpm for the beginning of each experiment air sparging was conducted for 15 min before the start of the process also to provide the reactor with ultrasound and electrical current the sonicator and dc power supply were switched on in advance the ph of the solutions was measured by a ph meter and h2so4 and naoh 0 1 m were used to regulate the initial and online ph of the solutions in each run also ph adjustment of the samples was carried out every 10 min for keeping the ph of the solution constant during the reaction for performing the experiments associated with sef and ec us processes the same reactor was employed with replacing the iron electrode with platinum electrode for the sef process and replacing the carbon felt electrode with iron electrode for ec us process also it is worth mentioning that for the sef process iron in the form of a pre prepared feso4 solution was added to the solution manually experiments were conducted in a batch system the cod reduction was obtained by the following equation 13 cod reduction co d 0 cod t co d 0 100 where cod0 and codt are the concentrations of initial cod mg l and cod at a specific time mg l respectively 2 4 phytotoxicity assessment the toxicity of the treated samples was measured using real plant irrigation radish raphanus sativus was used as an environmental element and the germination index gi of this plant was recorded the required tests were performed with raw ppww and treated by spc pc ec us sef and ef seeds of radish were distributed uniformly on a paper filter in a petri dish each time 10 ml of samples was added to petri dish nescofilm was used to seal the petri dishes preventing from moisture loss then petri dishes incubated for 72 h at 25 c distilled water was used for control tests the gi was calculated

hach dr5000 bod5 values of the samples were measured according to the standard methods 25 total organic carbon toc of raw and treated solutions was determined on a shimadzu 5050 toc analyzer iron was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy perkin elmer spc sludge was decanted and dried at 103 c for 1 h the powder diffraction patterns of spc sludge were recorded by x ray diffractometer xrd

bruker germany the field emission scanning electron microscope fesem of spc sludge was obtained using a tescan mira3 microscope czech republic 2 6 electrical energy consumption and cost evaluation one of the most significant parameters in every electrochemical process is electrical energy consumed during the process as it can affect the economy of the whole process profoundly in this connection the electrical energy consumption eec kwh kg cod removed of the applied treatment methods was calculated using the following equation 9 15 eec u i t v y cod initial where u i t v and y parameters are cell voltage v applied current a reaction time h wastewater volume l and cod removal efficiency respectively the operational cost was evaluated based on the following equation 16 operation cost a c e b eec where ce is kg iron lost and the parameters of a and b are the costs of usd kg iron and usd kwh respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 comparative degradation of pc and ec in the presence of us to conduct a general comparison between ec and pc and determine the effect of us alone and accompanying ec and pc processes in the treatment of ppww a series of experiments were performed under adjusted ph 3 and current of 110 ma fig 2 shows the comparative performance of various processes in cod removal with reaction time as can be seen in fig 2 although ec shows a quite acceptable performance in cod removal when compared to the pc process the difference is significant this could be attributed to the simultaneous generation of h2o2 and fe2 leading to complete consumption of h2o2 for efficient production of ho in the fenton reaction eq 1 this ends in the fast reaction of ho with organic compounds enhanced by continuous generation of catalytic species of fe2 through anodic dissolution also organic matter and intermediates produced as a result of ho oxidation can be coagulated by fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 precipitates forming by excess fe2 in the solution 9 14 26 according to fig 2 the application of ultrasound us had a remarkable effect on the performance of ec and pc processes in this hybrid approach more free radicals are available for the reaction which in turn increase the reaction rate and cod removal efficiency conversely the employment of the us alone could not yield an acceptable result in removing organic content the better performance of the ec us combined system in cod removal compared to ec alone can be ascribed to the preventive behavior of us against the formation of a passive layer on the surface of the electrodes as a common and major challenge of the ec process and cleaning the electrode surface by removing tiny bubbles also reducing the diffusional layer near the electrode surface ec us system is capable of producing more coagulant species as a result of improved current efficiency what is more the presence of us in the ec process causes the formation of ho and h and also accelerated the oxidation of pollutants 27 29 besides us agitation significantly affects the particle size degree of solubilization and organic material structure 30 32 considering the identical mechanism of coagulation in both spc and ec us systems the same justifications can be applied to the spc process additionally the better removal behavior of spc in comparison with the pc process is explained by the higher efficiency of ho production and the physical and chemical ho effect of the us process 19 21 therefore the weak ability of the us alone can be due to the low capacity of the us in the generation of reactive species 22 as well as lack of fe2 species in the solution as catalyst compared to the spc process and fast recombination rate of formed radicals 18 20 3 2 effect of applied current on cod removal efficiency in the spc process the applied current is one of the most determinant operational parameters affecting both the anode dissociation and release of iron in the solution and the generation of hydrogen peroxide in the cathode 33 fig 3 indicates the effect of applied current on cod removal efficiency of the ppww at ph 3 versus reaction time at the current of 50 ma the cod removal efficiency reached around 48 5 within 50 min reaction time when the current increased to 140 ma the cod removal efficiency reached its maximum which was more than 80 this could be related to the increased rate of h2o2 production at the cathode with high currents ending in more ho generation and increased rate of anodic dissolution which leads to the production of more iron hydroxide precipitates for trapping the pollutants 33 35 however further increasing the current up to 170 ma did not have a positive consequence and resulted in dropping the cod removal efficiency to less than 80 this can be associated with high concentrations of ferrous ions in the solution and their scavenging effect as a result of rapid iron dissolution at higher currents under such a circumstance excess ferrous ion combines with the produced ho and is oxidized to ferric ion eq 17 34 afterward the excess ferric ions react with h2o2 to produce hydroperoxyl radical species ho2 eq 6 which are of weak oxidizing power relative to ho 36 moreover at high currents the oxygen content of the solution is removed by reducing the oxygen at the cathode eq 18 competing with the generation of h2o2 at the cathode thus lowering the overall oxidizing capacity and energy efficiency of the system 33 37 38 also oxidation of h2o2 at the anode can account for lower removal efficiency in higher currents in which h2o2 is oxidized to hydroperoxyl radical and oxygen consequently eqs 19 and 20 hence 140 ma was chosen as the optimum level of current for subsequent experiments 17 fe 2 ho fe 3 oh k 3 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 18 o 2 2 h 2 2 h 2 o 19 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h e 20 ho 2 o 2 h e 3 3 effect of ph on cod removal efficiency in the spc process ph is of a pivotal role in the elimination efficiency of pollutants as it can determine the iron state and the ho generating performance of the spc process 15 33 to dive more into this topic the cod removal efficiency of the spc process was evaluated under various ph conditions ph 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 and applied current of 140 ma with ph regulation as can be seen in fig 4 for the spc process the highest cod removal efficiencies were achieved at ph values of 2 0 and 3 0 which were around 81 and the removal process under ph 2 0 showed a slightly better performance rather than under ph 3 0 however with increasing the ph value up to 6 0 the cod removal efficiency dropped to less than 55 this result proved the dominant effect of the advanced oxidation phase of the spc process over the electro coagulation phase to be more specific in the ph range of 2 4 where the ideal condition is provided for the production of ho efficiently the dominant mechanism of cod removal is the oxidation 15 on the other hand in the ph range of 5 6 the oxidation process is intensively weakened instead the electro coagulation mechanism becomes the major cod removal path in the solution 15 33 thus the overall removal performance is representative of the advanced oxidation and electro coagulation system in the extremely acidic environment and almost neutral conditions respectively in fact in the neutral ph range the electro generated h2o2 shows an unstable behavior due to decomposition to water and oxygen prohibiting the ho formation in the solution 9 33 39 therefore the oxidation mechanism is not able to strongly govern the cod removal in this ph range however the ideal ph for progressing the fenton reaction is about 2 8 13 40 which was in agreement with our findings where dissolved oxygen consumes hydrogen ions so that it can be converted to hydrogen peroxide 9 also for keeping the fe dissolved in the solution and easy conversion of fe2 to fe3 low ph values are required 15 that is why the best results of cod removal were achieved in ph values of 2 and 3 on the contrary a neutral ph spectrum that lowers the concentration of fe3 and inhibits the fe2 regeneration favors the formation of fe oh n species by coagulation process resulting in pollutant elimination either by charge neutralization or complexation thus the obtained results in the neutral ph range are mainly attributed to the cogulation mechanism 9 15 in addition the oxidation potential of ho is reduced by increase of ph based on nernst equation eq 21 in which the oxidation potential of ho is decreased from 2 68 to 2 44 v when solution ph is increased from 2 to 6 e0 ho h2o 2 8 41 42 21 e 0 e ho h 2 o 0 0 059 ph in the pc process due to the continuous production of oh ions in the fenton reaction and consumption of hydrogen cations the ph tends to increase gradually 13 as can be seen performing the experiments without ph adjustment led to the increment of ph during reaction time and approached the neutral ph range after 50 min taking this into account all of the conducted experiments for investigating the impact of initial ph under ph regulation were repeated under the same condition but without ph adjustment and the results were compared in fig 5 for acidic initial phs the increase in ph with time was steeper than that of neutral ph ranges so that for example at initial ph 2 0 the final ph of the solution reached over 6 0 within 50 min fig 6 this wide ph spectrum in the spc process meant that solutions starting with advanced oxidation in a highly acidic range could reach the neutral phs where electrocoagulation is the dominant mechanism of pollutant removal fig 5 displays the comparative cod removal of ppww under various phs with and without ph regulation according to this plot for the initial ph of 2 0 and 3 0 the ph adjustment has a considerable effect on the cod removal efficiency however this is not the case for higher initial phs the more the initial ph of the solution is the less the cod removal is influenced by the presence or lack of ph adjustment and for the initial ph of 5 0 and 6 0 the ph adjustment has a slightly positive impact on the removal efficiency to clarify as mentioned above when the initial ph is in the range of 2 3 the governing removal mechanism is aop which was proved to be more powerful compared to the coagulation based processes in the neutral ph zone 33 thus in the acidic range when the ph is not adjusted the ph increases with time and goes toward the neutral ph range where the dominant removal mechanism is coagulation and this prevents the aop from the degradation of pollutants completely by turning it into ec coagulation thus lowering the removal efficiency this was in agreement with the works done by other researchers 9 13 however in the neutral ph range the aop is not dominantly determinant and the removal is controlled by the ec process 9 additionally the increase in ph of the solutions in the neutral zone which is not as sharp as that of solutions with very low initial ph values is not able to drive the final ph of the solution out of the neutral region hence the determinant mechanism of cod removal in the neutral ph range is kept ec and ph adjustment does not show a remarkable difference in cod removal efficiency over non adjusted solutions finally considering the obtained results regulated ph 2 0 was selected as the optimum ph 3 4 comparative degradation of ef and pc in the presence and absence of us to gain a better insight into the spc process and its degradation ability the cod removal efficiency of the ef process as a contributing mechanism in the spc process was studied in the presence and absence of ultrasound irradiation as shown in fig 7 it was observed that the spc process which is comprised of a modified sef and ec us compared to the sef process had nearly two times greater efficiency in cod removal this superior performance of the spc process over the sef process can be ascribed to the continuous generation of fe2 ions in the solution supplying the sufficient catalyst for the fenton process which results in the production of more ho species and thus better oxidation performance furthermore the spc process takes advantage of combining oxidation and ec processes considering the in situ generation of ferrous and thus ferric ions which improves the removal efficiency of the spc process over the sef process by ec us 26 43 in addition results in fig 7 showed the obvious influence of ultrasound irradiation on the pc and ef processes this plot indicates that for pc and ef processes ultrasonic assistance can improve the cod removal efficiency up to 11 3 and 9 respectively which is a considerable modification in removal performance 20 22 3 5 effect of ph on biodegradability the biodegradability of the ppww treated by the spc process was investigated under various ph conditions although the produced intermediates through oxidation were not determined decomposition of organic matter into other by products was reflected using the degree of oxidation indicated by bod cod ratio and average oxidation state aos indices aos which is a measure of oxidation extent for organic substances is valued between 4 as the most oxidized state of carbon co2 and 4 as the most reduced state of carbon ch4 44 aos can be calculated by the following equation 33 22 aos 4 1 5 cod toc where cod and toc are chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon respectively both in mg l generally for feeding a biological treatment unit by a waste stream a bod cod value higher than 0 4 is necessary for the proper performance of the biomass 45 however as can be seen in fig 8 a and b the untreated ppww is characterized by a bod cod ratio of 0 17 which is indicative of high resistance of ppww against biological treatment methods moreover the aos of untreated ppww was achieved 1 98 which is way lower than the oxidized state being a sign of low biodegradability of ppww fig 8a represents the bod cod of the spc process under various ph conditions as can be observed the spc process had the best enhancement of biodegradability at ph 2 reaching 0 4 this can be explained by the fact that at ph 2 0 the oxidation power of the spc process is extreme and recalcitrant compounds are degraded or transformed to more biodegradable products 46 47 on the other hand at other ph values of 3 4 5 6 the bod cod ratios were achieved 0 29 0 22 0 15 0 15 respectively showing the weaker performance of the spc process in ph ranges higher than 2 moreover at ph values of 3 and 4 where ho is still able to be produced with the aid of soluble fe2 biodegradability enhancement can still be observed conversely at ph values of 5 and 6 there is no soluble fe2 catalyst remnant for the production of ho and the dominant removal mechanism is electrocoagulation which is unable to decompose recalcitrant substances to more biodegradable ones 15 33 accordingly similar trends can be observed considering the aos behavior under various ph conditions fig 8b reflecting the more potent ability of the spc process for efficient degradation and turning the resistant organic compounds into biodegradable intermediates in the acidic ph spectrum hence ph 2 was selected as the optimum ph value of the spc process for the purpose of biodegradability enhancement 3 6 biodegradability improvement of ef and pc in the presence and absence of us the biodegradability of the spc pc ef and sef processes was investigated comparatively to find the best approach toward biodegradability enhancement as can be seen in fig 9 a and b among the mentioned processes the spc process had the best biodegradability enhancement in terms of bod cod ratio and aos indices reaching the 0 4 and 0 94 values respectively also this plot shows the superiority of the ultrasound assisted pc and ef processes as compared to ordinary pc and ef processes as can be seen in figs 9a and 9b the original ppww had bod cod ratio and aos value of 0 17 and 1 98 respectively regarding both the bod cod ratio and aos the spc process had a significantly better performance compared to the pc process alone 0 4 vs 0 25 justifying the positive impact of ultrasound in production efficiency of ho and consequently its better oxidation 19 21 the same scenario is applicable for the sef process compared to the ef process however the bod cod ratio and aos for sef are just slightly better than those of ef and far worse than those of spc displaying the superior performance of the spc over sef in transforming nonbiodegradable compounds into biodegradable substances 3 7 phytotoxicity in order to have a multi faceted evaluation and take a step toward real environmental impacts of the employed treatment methods the phytotoxicity of the treated samples was measured using radish plant irrigation as it is obvious from table 2 the spc process showed the best germination result being 77 9 which was significantly higher than other treatment approaches also spc increased the gi of the raphanus sativus plant to a great extent over the raw ppww 25 6 reflecting the environmental friendliness of the spc process after spc and pc processes ec and ec us processes showed good gi results achieving 47 7 and 46 8 respectively the high gi values obtained confirmed the environmentally friendly nature of the treated samples to be reused for irrigation purposes these results were in complete agreement with other studies 48 49 3 8 iron fate in spc the production of electrochemical sludge and soluble iron in the effluent for peroxi coagulation is unavoidable since iron corrosion occurs in the anode the iron concentration in the solution was monitored during 50 min reaction time fig s1 as can be seen increase in reaction time enhanced the concentration of iron which was related to faraday s law in which reaction time has direct relationship with the amount of corroded iron the highest concentration of iron was 25 6 mg l which is remarkable in terms of disposal hence a further simple treatment is needed for iron removal like the precipitation by naoh iron rich sludge could be evaluated for further use or disposal electrochemical sludge generated was 110 ml l which is considerable for chemical and electrochemical treatment in this way electrochemical sludge was characterized by xrd ftir and fesem analyses fig s2 shows xrd pattern of electrochemical sludge as can be seen it is found that all the diffraction peaks in 2θ 30 41 36 12 43 54 53 56 58 01 63 65 and 75 50 are consistent with the referenced data of 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 4 2 2 5 1 1 4 4 0 and 5 3 3 plane distances respectively jcpds card no 65 3107 xrd pattern could provide enough evidence to confirm that fe3o4 particles were formed during electrochemical generation of sludge ftir spectrum of spc sludge is presented in fig s3 a broad band appearing in the 3425 cm 1 region in spc sludge suggests the presence of oh due to the presence of hydroxyl groups derived from fe oh and ppww 50 a bend in the 2962 cm 1 region is related to ch group two stretches were observed at 1638 and 1384 cm 1 which were attributed to amide and ch3 groups respectively 51 a sharp stretch in 1102 cm 1 presumably represents ester amine and carboxylic acids coagulated in the spc two bends in the 600 and 749 cm 1 are associated with feo bond 51 fig s4a shows morphology of spc sludge in which irregular particles were formed during coagulation mechanism in a closer view fig s4b several particles were agglomerated and it seems that a flat media with lumpy parts was formed 3 9 electrical energy consumption eec in order to evaluate economic feasibility of the present study in comparison with other processes electrical energy consumption was calculated the obtained results of eec have been summarized in table 3 as can be seen in table 3 although the us assisted treatment methods have shown a significant removal efficiency compared to us lacked processes the application of us may be a burdensome pressure on the economy of the work regarding this fact the pc process with a quite acceptable removal result and the lowest eec among other treatment methods can be a rational option when it comes to considering the technical and economic aspects of the work simultaneously it can be ascertained from the table 3 that the electrical energy consumed per kg cod removed of the present study was proved to stand in a rational place as compared to other studies done on treatment of ppww by electrochemical methods the cost evaluation of these processes was conducted by eq 16 accordingly the cost of pc spc ef sef ec and ec us processes were 0 118 11 48 0 446 20 2 0 133 and 15 57 usd kg cod removed respectively regarding the eec and cost estimation applying us for electrochemical processes increases the electrical energy consumption and consequently cost of the process 4 conclusion in this study for treatment of ppww electrochemical methods of pc ef and ec were thoroughly investigated and the effect of us alone and in combination with these processes was studied despite the weak performance of the us in cod removal of ppww hybrid systems of spc sef and ec us revealed a significant removal efficiency compared to usual pc ef and ec the best cod removal efficiency was achieved 81 7 for the spc process spc process showed a high dependence on ph and ph stability during the reaction time so that high ph ranges and lack of ph adjustment left an adverse influence on removal yield the best results of organic elimination and biodegradability improvement concerning ph condition were obtained under ph 2 and ph regulation reflecting the prominent role of aop compared with ec as two contributing mechanisms in the spc process moreover a comparison of spc and sef revealed that the spc process takes advantage of a modified sef process coupled with the ec process raising its cod removal efficiency significantly the best outcomes associated with bod cod ratio and aos were achieved for the spc process that could enhance these indices to the biologically treatable range of wastewaters 0 4 for bod cod and 0 94 for aos by reducing the cod content without a considerable change in bod level needless to say the us played a major role in the enhancement of biodegradability however us application is limited in large scale in which its cost is extremely high hence us based processes can be considered for low

13252,in a comparative approach toward treating real pulp and paper wastewater ppww iron based electro chemical processes such as peroxi coagulation pc electrocoagulation ec electro fenton ef and ultrasound assisted pc ec and ef were investigated sono peroxi coagulation spc process showed the best performance for treating the ppww the optimal results were achieved under reaction time 50 min current density 140 ma and ph 2 0 employing the spc process for treating ppww under optimal conditions the best cod removal efficiency 81 7 was achieved also continuous ph adjustment of the solution as compared to lack of adjustment showed a significant influence on cod removal efficiency more than 10 the effect of ph on the spc process and the kind of electro chemical treatment process utilized on biodegradability were investigated using bod cod ratio and average oxidation state aos in comparison with other electro chemical processes used in this study the best biodegradability results were obtained for the spc process in ph 2 being 0 4 and 0 94 for bod cod ratio and aos respectively spc process compared to the sono ef process had superior cod removal efficiency and their difference in performance reached near 40 the influence of sonication was obtained 11 3 and 9 for pc and ef processes respectively in evaluating the toxicity the best germination index of raphanus sativus irrigated by treated wastewater samples was achieved 77 9 for the spc process the application of us for electrochemical process increased energy consumption and cost of process considerably the sludge of spc was also evaluated by fourier transform infrared spectrum ftir x ray diffractometer xrd and field emission scanning electron microscope fesem graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biodegradability electro fenton peroxi coagulation phytotoxicity pulp and paper wastewater ultrasound 1 introduction when it comes to water consumption in the production process of industries the pulp and paper industry is ranked near the top 1 2 which makes this industrial section one of the largest producers of wastewater in the world 3 the pulp and paper wastewater ppww due to the presence of a wide spectrum of toxic and non biodegradable organic materials adsorbable organic halogens color phenolic compounds etc is considered a real threat to biotic life and the environment 4 5 as such there is an emerging demand to explore more efficient sustainable and inexpensive techniques for treating ppww in this regard biological treatment methods such as anaerobic aerobic decompositions are among the conventional and eco friendly approaches toward ppww that have been applied commonly however the presence of recalcitrant substances brings about low biodegradability prohibiting the microorganisms to cope with such waste streams 2 3 6 thus the application of other treatment methods has gained significant attention in the effort to ameliorate the adverse impacts of ppww on the environment 6 and the subsequent biological treatment units there are numerous reports on the treatment of ppww based on physical chemical electrochemical and biological processes 8 however since these methods have some major limitations shortcomings and lack of efficiencies electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops as an alternative have been extensively investigated and proved to be efficient for wastewaters containing resistant organic materials 7 8 it is well known that the individual techniques have some shortcomings for the efficient treatment of real ppww due to its complex nature in recent years the great abundance and the versatile role both as coagulant and catalyst in electrochemical processes have made iron fe one of the most favorable substances to be used in wastewater treatment generally iron based electrochemical processes can be categorized as electro coagulation ec electro fenton ef or a combination of them 9 in electro coagulation ec a sacrificial anode fe as an example is used for in situ electro generation of coagulant species in the solution 9 on the other hand electro fenton ef process combines the generation of ho via common fenton reaction as shown in eq 1 and electro generation of h2o2 via oxygen reduction reaction as written in eq 2 in the presence of ferrous ion as a catalyst 10 12 this process when equipped with a sacrificial fe anode for in situ electro generation of ferrous ion eq 3 is called peroxi coagulation pc 9 11 taking advantage of both advanced oxidation and ec processes 13 1 h 2 o 2 fe 2 fe 3 ho oh k 40 80 m 1 s 1 2 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 e 0 0 68 v she 3 fe fe 2 2 e e 0 0 44 v she the ho produced in the fenton reaction is of strong oxidizing potential with a non selective nature making it capable of mineralizing a broad spectrum of organic pollutants through producing dehydrogenated or hydroxylated intermediates 13 14 what is more at cathode fe3 is reduced thus fe2 is regenerated via eq 4 and the residual fe3 in the solution gives rise to the formation of fe oh 3 precipitates via eq 5 contributing to pollutant removal by coagulation mechanism 15 16 4 fe 3 e fe 2 e 0 0 77 v she 5 fe 3 3 oh fe oh 3 pc process not only generates h2o2 and fe2 in situ which eliminates the costly storage and transport of h2o2 and fe 11 and prevents their direct addition to the wastewater 10 but also minimizes the required fe2 with the regeneration of this ionic species via eqs 6 and 7 10 15 17 making the entire process a highly attractive approach toward wastewater treatment 6 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe ooh 2 h k 0 001 0 01 m 1 s 1 7 fe 3 ho 2 fe 2 h o 2 k 1 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 nowadays considered as an advanced oxidation technology the ultrasound us process has grabbed the attention of academic environments 18 according to the well known hot spot theory ultrasound irradiation in liquids triggers acoustic cavitation which can be defined as formation growth and implosive collapse of bubbles leading to the generation of short lived sites of high pressure and temperature that are responsible for the thermal dissociation of h2o and formation of short life radicals 18 20 8 h 2 o us ho h 9 o 2 us 2 o 10 h o 2 us ho 2 however the recombination of formed radicals is one of the drawbacks of the us process leading to the gradual accumulation of h2o2 in the solution via the following equations eqs 11 12 thus decreases the degradation rate of organic matter 18 20 thus it would be more appealing to combine the us with other treatment methods in this vein hybridizing the us with fenton based advanced oxidation processes like ef and pc will be extremely advantageous based on three compelling reasons higher efficiency of ho generation increasing the turbulence for better contact of the radicals and pollutants and enhanced regeneration of ferrous ions that can end in faster degradation of pollutants 21 11 ho ho h 2 o 2 k 5 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 12 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 k 8 3 10 5 m 1 s 1 recently ef has been combined with us process as sono ef sef us application could improve catalytic activity of iron based catalysts the us application regenerates ferrous ions and even it could excite heterogeneous catalysts for the generation hydroxyl radicals 22 23 to the authors knowledge up to now for treating real ppww there is no previous study specifically focused on the pc process in comparison to ec and ef in the presence and absence of us waves in the present study various operational parameters such as electrolysis time applied current and ph were assessed and their influence on cod reduction in the sono peroxi coagulation spc process was investigated although the transformation products were not determined directly the oxidation degree of organic compounds was tracked using biodegradability measurements of bod cod ratio and average oxidation state aos 24 thus the effect of the kind of process used and ph of the spc process on improving biodegradability and cod removal efficiency of the ppww were investigated in optimal conditions as mentioned previously spc takes advantage of combined mechanisms of advanced oxidation and coagulation therefore to study the synergistic effects in this hybrid process us assisted ef and pc processes were comparatively investigated in optimal conditions furthermore the toxicity reduction of the optimally treated ppww was thoroughly evaluated finally spc sludge was also characterized by different methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of the ppww the pulp and paper wastewater ppww used in this work was taken from a real industrial unit located in khuzestan province iran it was kept at 4 c without any pre treatment until use a summary of the physical and chemical characteristics of this waste stream are presented in table 1 2 2 materials feso4 7h2o and naoh pellet were supplied from merck co sulfuric acid 96 was obtained from sigma aldrich all chemicals were analytical grade reagents and used as received carbon felt was purchased from sazeh morakkab inc iran all iron plates were purchased commercially to remove grease and other impurities iron fe plates were completely washed in acetone solution also after finishing each experiment iron electrodes were washed with dilute hcl 10 and finally were rinsed with deionized water di and dried in room temperature 2 3 electro chemical apparatus and experimental set up in this study an electrochemical reactor made of plexiglass was used for the spc process 10 cm diameter and 13 cm height with total volume of 1 l fig 1 prior to the commencement of each run 700 ml of ppww was poured into the reactor an iron sheet with dimensions of 11 cm 2 cm was used as the anode and carbon felt with an effective area of 45 cm2 was employed as the cathode the distance between electrodes was kept 4 cm a digital dc power supply dezhung 30 v 3 0 a equipped with voltage and current regulating ability was used for providing electrical current subsequently low frequency ultrasound us irradiation 20 khz was performed using a sonotrode with a power of 100 w q125 sonicator which was placed in the space between electrodes in order to produce hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the solution an aeration blower with a capacity of 1 5 l min was utilized to inject air into the reactor content a digital magnetic stirrer ika was responsible for agitating the solution at 200 rpm for the beginning of each experiment air sparging was conducted for 15 min before the start of the process also to provide the reactor with ultrasound and electrical current the sonicator and dc power supply were switched on in advance the ph of the solutions was measured by a ph meter and h2so4 and naoh 0 1 m were used to regulate the initial and online ph of the solutions in each run also ph adjustment of the samples was carried out every 10 min for keeping the ph of the solution constant during the reaction for performing the experiments associated with sef and ec us processes the same reactor was employed with replacing the iron electrode with platinum electrode for the sef process and replacing the carbon felt electrode with iron electrode for ec us process also it is worth mentioning that for the sef process iron in the form of a pre prepared feso4 solution was added to the solution manually experiments were conducted in a batch system the cod reduction was obtained by the following equation 13 cod reduction co d 0 cod t co d 0 100 where cod0 and codt are the concentrations of initial cod mg l and cod at a specific time mg l respectively 2 4 phytotoxicity assessment the toxicity of the treated samples was measured using real plant irrigation radish raphanus sativus was used as an environmental element and the germination index gi of this plant was recorded the required tests were performed with raw ppww and treated by spc pc ec us sef and ef seeds of radish were distributed uniformly on a paper filter in a petri dish each time 10 ml of samples was added to petri dish nescofilm was used to seal the petri dishes preventing from moisture loss then petri dishes incubated for 72 h at 25 c distilled water was used for control tests the gi was calculated

of the most significant parameters in every electrochemical process is electrical energy consumed during the process as it can affect the economy of the whole process profoundly in this connection the electrical energy consumption eec kwh kg cod removed of the applied treatment methods was calculated using the following equation 9 15 eec u i t v y cod initial where u i t v and y parameters are cell

where ce is kg iron lost and the parameters of a and b are the costs of usd kg iron and usd kwh respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 comparative degradation of pc and ec in the presence of us to conduct a general comparison between ec and pc and determine the effect of us alone and accompanying ec and pc processes in the treatment of ppww a series of experiments were performed under adjusted ph 3 and current of 110 ma fig 2 shows the comparative performance of various processes in cod removal with reaction time as can be seen in fig 2 although ec shows a quite acceptable performance in cod removal when compared to the pc process the difference is significant this could be attributed to the simultaneous generation of h2o2 and fe2 leading to complete consumption of h2o2 for efficient production of ho in the fenton reaction eq 1 this ends in the fast reaction of ho with organic compounds enhanced by continuous generation of catalytic species of fe2 through anodic dissolution also organic matter and intermediates produced as a result of ho oxidation can be coagulated by fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 precipitates forming by excess fe2 in the solution 9 14 26 according to fig 2 the application of ultrasound us had a remarkable effect on the performance of ec and pc processes in this hybrid approach more free radicals are available for the reaction which in turn increase the reaction rate and cod removal efficiency conversely the employment of the us alone could not yield an acceptable result in removing organic content the better performance of the ec us combined system in cod removal compared to ec alone can be ascribed to the preventive behavior of us against the formation of a passive layer on the surface of the electrodes as a common and major challenge of the ec process and cleaning the electrode surface by removing tiny bubbles also reducing the diffusional layer near the electrode surface ec us system is capable of producing more coagulant species as a result of improved current efficiency what is more the presence of us in the ec process causes the formation of ho and h and also accelerated the oxidation of pollutants 27 29 besides us agitation significantly affects the particle size degree of solubilization and organic material structure 30 32 considering the identical mechanism of coagulation in both spc and ec us systems the same justifications can be applied to the spc process additionally the better removal behavior of spc in comparison with the pc process is explained by the higher efficiency of ho production and the physical and chemical ho effect of the us process 19 21 therefore the weak ability of the us alone can be due to the low capacity of the us in the generation of reactive species 22 as well as lack of fe2 species in the solution as catalyst compared to the spc process and fast recombination rate of formed radicals 18 20 3 2 effect of applied current on cod removal efficiency in the spc process the applied current is one of the most determinant operational parameters affecting both the anode dissociation and release of iron in the solution and the generation of hydrogen peroxide in the cathode 33 fig 3 indicates the effect of applied current on cod removal efficiency of the ppww at ph 3 versus reaction time at the current of 50 ma the cod removal efficiency reached around 48 5 within 50 min reaction time when the current increased to 140 ma the cod removal efficiency reached its maximum which was more than 80 this could be related to the increased rate of h2o2 production at the cathode with high currents ending in more ho generation and increased rate of anodic dissolution which leads to the production of more iron hydroxide precipitates for trapping the pollutants 33 35 however further increasing the current up to 170 ma did not have a positive consequence and resulted in dropping the cod removal efficiency to less than 80 this can be associated with high concentrations of ferrous ions in the solution and their scavenging effect as a result of rapid iron dissolution at higher currents under such a circumstance excess ferrous ion combines with the produced ho and is oxidized to ferric ion eq 17 34 afterward the excess ferric ions react with h2o2 to produce hydroperoxyl radical species ho2 eq 6 which are of weak oxidizing power relative to ho 36 moreover at high currents the oxygen content of the solution is removed by reducing the oxygen at the cathode eq 18 competing with the generation of h2o2 at the cathode thus lowering the overall oxidizing capacity and energy efficiency of the system 33 37 38 also oxidation of h2o2 at the anode can account for lower removal efficiency in higher currents in which h2o2 is oxidized to hydroperoxyl radical and oxygen consequently eqs 19 and 20 hence 140 ma was chosen as the optimum level of current for subsequent experiments 17 fe 2 ho fe 3 oh k 3 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 18 o 2 2 h 2 2 h 2 o 19 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h e 20 ho 2 o 2 h e 3 3 effect of ph on cod removal efficiency in the spc process ph is of a pivotal role in the elimination efficiency of pollutants as it can determine the iron state and the ho generating performance of the spc process 15 33 to dive more into this topic the cod removal efficiency of the spc process was evaluated under various ph conditions ph 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 and applied current of 140 ma with ph regulation as can be seen in fig 4 for the spc process the highest cod removal efficiencies were achieved at ph values of 2 0 and 3 0 which were around 81 and the removal process under ph 2 0 showed a slightly better performance rather than under ph 3 0 however with increasing the ph value up to 6 0 the cod removal efficiency dropped to less than 55 this result proved the dominant effect of the advanced oxidation phase of the spc process over the electro coagulation phase to be more specific in the ph range of 2 4 where the ideal condition is provided for the production of ho efficiently the dominant mechanism of cod removal is the oxidation 15 on the other hand in the ph range of 5 6 the oxidation process is intensively weakened instead the electro coagulation mechanism becomes the major cod removal path in the solution 15 33 thus the overall removal performance is representative of the advanced oxidation and electro coagulation system in the extremely acidic environment and almost neutral conditions respectively in fact in the neutral ph range the electro generated h2o2 shows an unstable behavior due to decomposition to water and oxygen prohibiting the ho formation in the solution 9 33 39 therefore the oxidation mechanism is not able to strongly govern the cod removal in this ph range however the ideal ph for progressing the fenton reaction is about 2 8 13 40 which was in agreement with our findings where dissolved oxygen consumes hydrogen ions so that it can be converted to hydrogen peroxide 9 also for keeping the fe dissolved in the solution and easy conversion of fe2 to fe3 low ph values are required 15 that is why the best results of cod removal were achieved in ph values of 2 and 3 on the contrary a neutral ph spectrum that lowers the concentration of fe3 and inhibits the fe2 regeneration favors the formation of fe oh n species by coagulation process resulting in pollutant elimination either by charge neutralization or complexation thus the obtained results in the neutral ph range are mainly attributed to the cogulation mechanism 9 15 in addition the oxidation potential of ho is reduced by increase of ph based on nernst equation eq 21 in which the oxidation potential of ho is decreased from 2 68 to 2 44 v when solution ph is increased from 2 to 6 e0 ho h2o 2 8 41 42 21 e 0 e ho h 2 o 0 0 059 ph in the pc process due to the continuous production of oh ions in the fenton reaction and consumption of hydrogen cations the ph tends to increase gradually 13 as can be seen performing the experiments without ph adjustment led to the increment of ph during reaction time and approached the neutral ph range after 50 min taking this into account all of the conducted experiments for investigating the impact of initial ph under ph regulation were repeated under the same condition but without ph adjustment and the results were compared in fig 5 for acidic initial phs the increase in ph with time was steeper than that of neutral ph ranges so that for example at initial ph 2 0 the final ph of the solution reached over 6 0 within 50 min fig 6 this wide ph spectrum in the spc process meant that solutions starting with advanced oxidation in a highly acidic range could reach the neutral phs where electrocoagulation is the dominant mechanism of pollutant removal fig 5 displays the comparative cod removal of ppww under various phs with and without ph regulation according to this plot for the initial ph of 2 0 and 3 0 the ph adjustment has a considerable effect on the cod removal efficiency however this is not the case for higher initial phs the more the initial ph of the solution is the less the cod removal is influenced by the presence or lack of ph adjustment and for the initial ph of 5 0 and 6 0 the ph adjustment has a slightly positive impact on the removal efficiency to clarify as mentioned above when the initial ph is in the range of 2 3 the governing removal mechanism is aop which was proved to be more powerful compared to the coagulation based processes in the neutral ph zone 33 thus in the acidic range when the ph is not adjusted the ph increases with time and goes toward the neutral ph range where the dominant removal mechanism is coagulation and this prevents the aop from the degradation of pollutants completely by turning it into ec coagulation thus lowering the removal efficiency this was in agreement with the works done by other researchers 9 13 however in the neutral ph range the aop is not dominantly determinant and the removal is controlled by the ec process 9 additionally the increase in ph of the solutions in the neutral zone which is not as sharp as that of solutions with very low initial ph values is not able to drive the final ph of the solution out of the neutral region hence the determinant mechanism of cod removal in the neutral ph range is kept ec and ph adjustment does not show a remarkable difference in cod removal efficiency over non adjusted solutions finally considering the obtained results regulated ph 2 0 was selected as the optimum ph 3 4 comparative degradation of ef and pc in the presence and absence of us to gain a better insight into the spc process and its degradation ability the cod removal efficiency of the ef process as a contributing mechanism in the spc process was studied in the presence and absence of ultrasound irradiation as shown in fig 7 it was observed that the spc process which is comprised of a modified sef and ec us compared to the sef process had nearly two times greater efficiency in cod removal this superior performance of the spc process over the sef process can be ascribed to the continuous generation of fe2 ions in the solution supplying the sufficient catalyst for the fenton process which results in the production of more ho species and thus better oxidation performance furthermore the spc process takes advantage of combining oxidation and ec processes considering the in situ generation of ferrous and thus ferric ions which improves the removal efficiency of the spc process over the sef process by ec us 26 43 in addition results in fig 7 showed the obvious influence of ultrasound irradiation on the pc and ef processes this plot indicates that for pc and ef processes ultrasonic assistance can improve the cod removal efficiency up to 11 3 and 9 respectively which is a considerable modification in removal performance 20 22 3 5 effect of ph on biodegradability the biodegradability of the ppww treated by the spc process was investigated under various ph conditions although the produced intermediates through oxidation were not determined decomposition of organic matter into other by products was reflected using the degree of oxidation indicated by bod cod ratio and average oxidation state aos indices aos which is a measure of oxidation extent for organic substances is valued between 4 as the most oxidized state of carbon co2 and 4 as the most reduced state of carbon ch4 44 aos can be calculated by the following equation 33 22 aos 4 1 5 cod toc where cod and toc are chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon respectively both in mg l generally for feeding a biological treatment unit by a waste stream a bod cod value higher than 0 4 is necessary for the proper performance of the biomass 45 however as can be seen in fig 8 a and b the untreated ppww is characterized by a bod cod ratio of 0 17 which is indicative of high resistance of ppww against biological treatment methods moreover the aos of untreated ppww was achieved 1 98 which is way lower than the oxidized state being a sign of low biodegradability of ppww fig 8a represents the bod cod of the spc process under various ph conditions as can be observed the spc process had the best enhancement of biodegradability at ph 2 reaching 0 4 this can be explained by the fact that at ph 2 0 the oxidation power of the spc process is extreme and recalcitrant compounds are degraded or transformed to more biodegradable products 46 47 on the other hand at other ph values of 3 4 5 6 the bod cod ratios were achieved 0 29 0 22 0 15 0 15 respectively showing the weaker performance of the spc process in ph ranges higher than 2 moreover at ph values of 3 and 4 where ho is still able to be produced with the aid of soluble fe2 biodegradability enhancement can still be observed conversely at ph values of 5 and 6 there is no soluble fe2 catalyst remnant for the production of ho and the dominant removal mechanism is electrocoagulation which is unable to decompose recalcitrant substances to more biodegradable ones 15 33 accordingly similar trends can be observed considering the aos behavior under various ph conditions fig 8b reflecting the more potent ability of the spc process for efficient degradation and turning the resistant organic compounds into biodegradable intermediates in the acidic ph spectrum hence ph 2 was selected as the optimum ph value of the spc process for the purpose of biodegradability enhancement 3 6 biodegradability improvement of ef and pc in the presence and absence of us the biodegradability of the spc pc ef and sef processes was investigated comparatively to find the best approach toward biodegradability enhancement as can be seen in fig 9 a and b among the mentioned processes the spc process had the best biodegradability enhancement in terms of bod cod ratio and aos indices reaching the 0 4 and 0 94 values respectively also this plot shows the superiority of the ultrasound assisted pc and ef processes as compared to ordinary pc and ef processes as can be seen in figs 9a and 9b the original ppww had bod cod ratio and aos value of 0 17 and 1 98 respectively regarding both the bod cod ratio and aos the spc process had a significantly better performance compared to the pc process alone 0 4 vs 0 25 justifying the positive impact of ultrasound in production efficiency of ho and consequently its better oxidation 19 21 the same scenario is applicable for the sef process compared to the ef process however the bod cod ratio and aos for sef are just slightly better than those of ef and far worse than those of spc displaying the superior performance of the spc over sef in transforming nonbiodegradable compounds into biodegradable substances 3 7 phytotoxicity in order to have a multi faceted evaluation and take a step toward real environmental impacts of the employed treatment methods the phytotoxicity of the treated samples was measured using radish plant irrigation as it is obvious from table 2 the spc process showed the best germination result being 77 9 which was significantly higher than other treatment approaches also spc increased the gi of the raphanus sativus plant to a great extent over the raw ppww 25 6 reflecting the environmental friendliness of the spc process after spc and pc processes ec and ec us processes showed good gi results achieving 47 7 and 46 8 respectively the high gi values obtained confirmed the environmentally friendly nature of the treated samples to be reused for irrigation purposes these results were in complete agreement with other studies 48 49 3 8 iron fate in spc the production of electrochemical sludge and soluble iron in the effluent for peroxi coagulation is unavoidable since iron corrosion occurs in the anode the iron concentration in the solution was monitored during 50 min reaction time fig s1 as can be seen increase in reaction time enhanced the concentration of iron which was related to faraday s law in which reaction time has direct relationship with the amount of corroded iron the highest concentration of iron was 25 6 mg l which is remarkable in terms of disposal hence a further simple treatment is needed for iron removal like the precipitation by naoh iron rich sludge could be evaluated for further use or disposal electrochemical sludge generated was 110 ml l which is considerable for chemical and electrochemical treatment in this way electrochemical sludge was characterized by xrd ftir and fesem analyses fig s2 shows xrd pattern of electrochemical sludge as can be seen it is found that all the diffraction peaks in 2θ 30 41 36 12 43 54 53 56 58 01 63 65 and 75 50 are consistent with the referenced data of 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 4 2 2 5 1 1 4 4 0 and 5 3 3 plane distances respectively jcpds card no 65 3107 xrd pattern could provide enough evidence to confirm that fe3o4 particles were formed during electrochemical generation of sludge ftir spectrum of spc sludge is presented in fig s3 a broad band appearing in the 3425 cm 1 region in spc sludge suggests the presence of oh due to the presence of hydroxyl groups derived from fe oh and ppww 50 a bend in the 2962 cm 1 region is related to ch group two stretches were observed at 1638 and 1384 cm 1 which were attributed to amide and ch3 groups respectively 51 a sharp stretch in 1102 cm 1 presumably represents ester amine and carboxylic acids coagulated in the spc two bends in the 600 and 749 cm 1 are associated with feo bond 51 fig s4a shows morphology of spc sludge in which irregular particles were formed during coagulation mechanism in a closer view fig s4b several particles were agglomerated and it seems that a flat media with lumpy parts was formed 3 9 electrical energy consumption eec in order to evaluate economic feasibility of the present study in comparison with other processes electrical energy consumption was calculated the obtained results of eec have been summarized in table 3 as can be seen in table 3 although the us assisted treatment methods have shown a significant removal efficiency compared to us lacked processes the application of us may be a burdensome pressure on the economy of the work regarding this fact the pc process with a quite acceptable removal result and the lowest eec among other treatment methods can be a rational option when it comes to considering the technical and economic aspects of the work simultaneously it can be ascertained from the table 3 that the electrical energy consumed per kg cod removed of the present study was proved to stand in a rational place as compared to other studies done on treatment of ppww by electrochemical methods the cost evaluation of these processes was conducted by eq 16 accordingly the cost of pc spc ef sef ec and ec us processes were 0 118 11 48 0 446 20 2 0 133 and 15 57 usd kg cod removed respectively regarding the eec and cost estimation applying us for electrochemical processes increases the electrical energy consumption and consequently cost of the process 4 conclusion in this study for treatment of ppww electrochemical methods of pc ef and ec were thoroughly investigated and the effect of us alone and in combination with these processes was studied despite the weak performance of the us in cod removal of ppww hybrid systems of spc sef and ec us revealed a significant removal efficiency compared to usual pc ef and ec the best cod removal efficiency was achieved 81 7 for the spc process spc process showed a high dependence on ph and ph stability during the reaction time so that high ph ranges and lack of ph adjustment left an adverse influence on removal yield the best results of organic elimination and biodegradability improvement concerning ph condition were obtained under ph 2 and ph regulation reflecting the prominent role of aop compared with ec as two contributing mechanisms in the spc process moreover a comparison of spc and sef revealed that the spc process takes advantage of a modified sef process coupled with the ec process raising its cod removal efficiency significantly the best outcomes associated with bod cod ratio and aos were achieved for the spc process that could enhance these indices to the biologically treatable range of wastewaters 0 4 for bod cod and 0 94 for aos by reducing the cod content without a considerable change in bod level needless to say the us played a major role in the enhancement of biodegradability however us application is limited in large scale in which its cost is extremely high hence us based processes can be considered for low

13253,in the present study the feasibility of aerobic cometabolism biodegradation of mtbe was investigated by the microbial consortium obtained municipal wastewater treatment plant in the presence of glucose growth substrate for in situ bioremediation of mtbe as the second most common pollutant in groundwater for this purpose various criteria including mtbe removal efficiency microbial population and activity biomass growth and decay rate substrate removal rate excess sludge generation and sludge settling velocity was investigated due to evaluate its compatibility for in situ bioremediation at the lowest glucose concentration required for effective growth of microbial consortium 60 mg l and initial mtbe concentration of 40 mg l mtbe and cod removal efficiencies were 85 and 92 respectively under this operating condition coefficient of biomass production of 0 51 mg vss mg cod and active mlvss gross mlvss of 0 85 were achieved these high values indicated that mtbe and its intermediate products induced no inhibitory effect on microbial consortium in the presence of glucose in addition to the survival and growth of microbial consortium high microbial activity and low cellular debris additionally biomass decay rate was obtained 0 0243 day 1 which indicated its high continuity and resistant to changes in environmental conditions of the aquifer furthermore excess sludge generation and svi were 44 mg vss day and 87 ml mg respectively that showed low probability of bio clogging and high potential for biofilm formation therefore cometabolism in presence of glucose growth substrate by the studied microbial consortium is recommended for in situ bioremediation of mtbe contaminated groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations aops advanced oxidation processes msm

rate biomass decay rate specific substrate consumption rate 1 introduction mtbe is one of the oxygenated additives that is added to increase the octane number of gasoline 62 due to the presence of mtbe in gasoline it easily released into groundwater by each fuel leakage or accidental spills for instance in storing or transportation of fuel or while unburned gasoline releases from boats or other recreational equipment this compound has a very high solubility in water hardly absorbs soil particles and is very mobile in the soil thus it remains and migrates in groundwater for a long time after release 11 30 52 as a result mtbe is known as one of the important pollutants of groundwater mtbe is a toxic and flammable compound which in case of its presence in water changes its odor and taste damages the liver kidneys and nervous system causes eye and skin irritants and has carcinogenic potential 30 52 69 consequently mtbe contaminated groundwater remediation is very essential different methods such as adsorption air stripping electrochemical oxidation advanced oxidation processes aops and biological process have been investigated for mtbe contaminated groundwater remediation so far however these technologies have some disadvantages that limit their use for mtbe treatment for instance in the adsorption process adsorbate just move from one phase to another phase even in case of high removal efficiency and the saturated adsorbent require further regeneration or disposal 28 51 in particular mtbe hardly adsorbed to adsorbents due to its low octanol water coefficient in the range of 0 02 to 1 1 60 low henry s law constant of mtbe in the range of 0 0216 to 0 0555 60 cause low mtbe removal efficiency by air stripping unless spends more air and increases treatment time which makes it a non economical treatment technology for mtbe contaminated groundwater remediation 30 additionally air stripping produces a huge amount of air pollution that requires further treatment and causes more expenses 54 on the other hand aops are energy intensive processes that despite the high removal efficiency require high chemical consumption and ph adjustment which leads to the formation of some undesirable intermediate products and high costs 1 30 similarly ph adjustment especially in the acidic range and adding electrolytes for electrical conductivity adjustment are required for electrochemical oxidation processes that require further neutralization and desalination and increase the cost of the process 2 30 biological treatment methods especially under aerobic conditions that degrade and break down pollutants into harmless compounds are one of the suitable options for mtbe contaminated groundwater remediation due to their high removal efficiency low cost and low negative effects compared to the different common treatment methods of mtbe that were mentioned 7 15 30 58 in situ bioremediation is a reliable biological method among various ex situ and in situ biological technologies that is commonly used for contaminated groundwater remediation today because in situ bioremediation is an efficient environmentally friendly economical and non invasive method that does not destroy the soil structure has a simple operation and requires low maintenance 15 65 the performance of in situ bioremediation depends on various parameters includes pollutant concentration the presence of active bacteria with the capability of degrading the target pollutant microbial population microbial diversity the presence of suitable carbon source for bacterial survival and growth to overcome the microbial lag phase biomass growth and accumulation as well as environmental condition of the aquifer 6 11 20 29 the presence of a strong ether bond and a third carbon in the molecular structure of mtbe makes it a chemically stable compound which its breaking is difficult for a wide range of bacteria however some bacteria such as arthrobacter sp atcc27778 36 hydrogenophaga flava env7 59 aquincola tertiaricarbonis l108 50 variovorax paradoxus cl 8 70 methylibium petroleiphilum pm1 24 can degrade mtbe by direct metabolism however for other bacteria degradation of this compound will be possible only through cometabolism if the pollutant as the only source of carbon is not sufficient for the growth and survival of bacteria cometabolism can enable pollutant degradation for bacteria under cometabolism the bacteria receive the carbon and energy needed for growth from the growth substrate and then the synthesis of enzymes required for the target pollutant degradation increases consequently the rate of pollutant degradation also increases as bacteria growth improves 33 34 66 mtbe cometabolism was investigated by rhodococcus rubber in the presence of ethanol 23 pseudomonas mendocina kr 1 in the presence of n alkanes 56 consortium of m1 p pseudomonas in the presence of pentane 43 pseudomonas putida gpol in the presence of octane 55 a mixture of pseudomonas strains in the presence of n alkanes 42 pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of hexane 53 a mixture of pseudomonas strains in the presence of n octane 31 pseudomonas sp wl1 in the presence of n octane 34 and n pentane 33 acinetobacter sp sl3 in the presence of n alkanes 32 up to now most studies about mtbe cometabolism have investigated a pure culture of bacteria or a microbial synthesis of some specific bacteria and only a few studies 41 45 63 71 have used a microbial consortium extracted from contaminated groundwater it is in spite of the fact that the microbial consortium has shown better performance for mtbe degradation than a pure culture of bacteria because various enzymes which are produced in the presence of different microbial species enable the degradation of different substrates therefore not only is the pollutant mtbe exposed to more enzymes but also the enzymes needed to break down the intermediates of the target pollutant are produced 31 glucose is an available and inexpensive hydrocarbon that as the growth substrate can rapidly act as the carbon source for bacteria 10 35 various studies about the effect of glucose growth substrate on growth of different microbial cultures by lv et al 40 li et al 35 pathania and jana 48 and bennett et al 10 had concluded that glucose can easily and quickly provide sufficient carbon and energy as well as a suitable growth medium for bacterial growth which can maintain the survival and richness of microbial diversity and accelerate pollutant degradation despite biomass growth is a critical parameter affecting the in situ bioremediation performance during its lifetime excessive biomass growth and sludge generation which leads to biomass accumulation and bio clogging is the main problem of in situ bioremediation that affects its lifetime 6 29 excessive biomass growth decreases nutrient concentration rapidly as a result endangers bacterial survival which affects the process performance on the other hand bio clogging due to excessive microbial population its non homogenous distribution and high cell debris reduces soil permeability which reduces the concentration of carbon nutrient and oxygen for downstream bacteria and affects the in situ bioremediation performance 11 20 29 consequently analyzing the microbial assessment in terms of net growth and population bacterial survival and decay microbial activity excess sludge generation and cell debris is necessary before microbial consortium augmentation for in situ bioremediation 6 however to the best of the author s knowledge only the microbial population has been studied in published feasibility studies on mtbe treatment by a pure culture or consortium of bacteria as well as by direct metabolism or cometabolism and other critical effective parameters have not been investigated therefore the aim of the present study is to investigate a real microbial consortium for mtbe aerobic biodegradation in terms of mtbe removal efficiency and providing favorable growth and decay conditions as well as high active microbial population besides low probability of bio clogging for in situ bioremediation applications municipal sewage sludge is an available bacterial source with a high diversity of bacteria 13 39 that has good potential for using glucose as a growth substrate 64 consequently in the present study the feasibility of aerobic biodegradation of mtbe was investigated in the presence of glucose growth substrate through microbial consortium obtained from municipal wastewater treatment plant for in situ bioremediation application of mtbe contaminated groundwater for this purpose the consumption rate and concentration reduction of mtbe as well as the growth and concentration of biomass were studied under variation of the growth substrate and mtbe concentration in addition the effect of mtbe cometabolism and concentration of carbon source on the quality of microbial population was comprehensively investigated by evaluation of the net growth of active biomass biomass growth and decay rate specific substrate removal rate excess sludge generation and sludge settling velocity to determine the compatibility of the mtbe acclimatized microbial consortium for in situ bioremediation under the conditions and environment of the aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 microbial consortium and feeding method the microbial consortium used in this study was obtained from the returned sludge of one of the tehran municipal wastewater treatment plants with cod mlss od600 and ph approximately equal to 300 mg l 4870 mg l 9 68 and 8 respectively for starting up the experiments four liters of synthetic wastewater containing mtbe glucose growth substrate and mineral salt medium msm were added to 1 l of concentrated biomass it is worthy to note that in order to support the growth of bacteria at maximum activity and efficiency balanced nutrients at c n p 100 5 1 ratio were added to the msm for this purpose the sum organic load of mtbe and glucose introduced as carbon source nh4no3 was used as nitrogen source as well as k2hpo4 and kh2po4 were used as phosphorus source which nh4no3 k2hpo4 and kh2po4 concentration were varied proportional to changes in mtbe and glucose concentration during the gradual acclimatization period in addition other essential micronutrients for bacterial growth including fecl2 4h2o mgso4 7h2o cacl2 2h2o znso4 7h2o mnso4 h2o cuso4 5h2o al2so4 18h2o and cocl2 6h2o at a ratio of 1 667 2 333 0 667 0 067 0 033 0 033 0 233 0 006 mg l per 100 mg l of cod were dissolved and added into the msm the gradual acclimatization was conducted by gradually increasing mtbe concentration as well as step by step decreasing glucose concentration along the acclimatization period in the first step synthesis wastewater with an initial cod concentration of 300 mg l was prepared by 255 mg l of glucose and only 5 mg l of mtbe to prevent possible toxicity due to high mtbe concentration after that by repeating the initial mtbe and glucose concentration the microbial consortium was adapted to mtbe and passed the lag phase then the initial concentration of mtbe gradually increased in order to reach the average mtbe concentration have been detected in groundwater equal to 50 mg l 27 30 57 61 and the glucose concentration gradually decreased to determine the minimum amount of glucose required for cometabolism for this purpose in each five next steps glucose contribution in the initial cod decreased approximately 10 and mtbe concentration was slightly increased less than 10 mg l until the mtbe and glucose concentration reached 40 mg l and 60 mg l respectively then in the final step glucose contribution from the carbon source reached zero and mtbe concentration reached 50 mg l 2 2 procedure cometabolism of mtbe in the presence of glucose growth substrate was investigated using a sbr system fig 1 in a 5 l working volume reactor at room temperature equal to 22 3 c each cycle of the sbr system including filling 10 min mixing 23 h settling 30 min decantation 10 min and idling 10 min lasted 24 h in addition air was injected into the system through an air pump in order to supply the required oxygen to the bacteria and sufficient mixing inside the reactor mtbe and cod concentration from the treated wastewater in the decantation phase as well as od600 and mlss from the mixture sample of wastewater and the microbial consortium in the mixing phase were measured daily at the end of each cycle also mlvss and svi from the mixture sample in the mixing phase were measured for each initial mtbe and glucose concentration additionally do and ph were regularly monitored in order to control the required optimal growth condition for the microbial consortium as do and ph were in the range of 4 6 mg l and 8 8 3 respectively during the experimental period it is worthy to note that all experiments were repeated three times 2 3 sludge production and decay if sludge is discharged regularly from the sbr system the age of the sludge is calculated according to eq 1 12 1 θ x vss v r x d v d x eff v eff t c where θ is the age of the sludge or sludge retention time srt d xvss is the mlvss in the sbr reactor mg vss l vr is the working volume of the reactor l xd is the biomass concentration of the regularly discharged from the sbr reactor vd is the regular discharge volume l xeff is the mlvss of the effluent mg vss l veff is the effluent volume l and tc is the time per cycle of sbr d the main approach of this study is the possibility of the in situ bioremediation of mtbe by cometabolism there is no daily sludge discharge from the aquifer during the in situ bioremediation and only an unspecific amount of biomass is washed from the aquifer due to scour therefore the sludge age was calculated according to eq 2 which is used for sbr systems without any regular sludge discharge 12 2 θ x vss v r x eff v eff t c the observed coefficient of biomass production depends on the net sludge production including biomass growth and death and is a ratio that reveals the biomass production rate to the substrate consumption rate which is obtained through eq 3 4 26 12 3 y obs x vss 2 x vss 1 v r x eff v eff t c c in c eff v eff t c where yobs is the observed

cin is the initial cod concentration mg cod l and ceff is the cod concentration of effluent mg cod l if the sbr system becomes steady state or the biomass concentration in the reactor remains constant eq 3 can be summarized as eq 4 12 since in this study each initial mtbe and glucose concentrations continued until the reactor reached steady state the yobs values were calculated according to eq 4 4 y obs x vss c in c eff the difference between the theoretical coefficient of biomass production with the observed coefficient yobs due to various mechanisms including endogenous metabolism death and bacteria predation by invading bacteria is revealed by the specific biomass decay rate which they are calculated through eq 5 26 12 5 μ y q obs k d where μ is the specific biomass growth rate day 1 which is inversely related to θ eq 6 y is the theoretical coefficient of biomass production mg vss mg cod kd is specific biomass decay rate day 1 and qobs is the observed specific substrate

eff v eff t c v r x vss the f m ratio as a key parameter affecting the biological system is also calculated through eq 8 that revealed the amount of influent feed to the biomass concentration 14 8 f m

eq 9 25 9 x a x vss 1 0 2 k d θ where xa is the active biomass in the reactor mg vss l the amount of sludge generation in biological systems which depends on the growth and decay rate of bacteria is also calculated according to eq 10 3 10 p μ v r x vss k d v r x vss where p is the daily sludge generation mg vss day 2 5 chemicals it is worthy to note that all chemicals include mtbe 99 8 nh4no3 95

whatman filter paper was purchased from ge healthcare co usa and ashless filter paper was obtained from johnson test papers ltd uk 2 6 analytical methods mtbe concentration was measured by uv vis spectrophotometer dr 4000 hach at its corresponding maximum wavelength of 340 nm and through converting the absorbance to the mtbe concentration by the calibration curve cod concentration was measured based on closed reflux colorimetric method according to 5220d standard using the cod reactor drb200 hach furthermore all of the measurements of microbial parameters include od600 2130b mlss 2540d mlvss 2540e and svi 2710d were performed according to the water and wastewater standard methods 5 furthermore bacterial staining was identified by the gram staining method 3 results and discussion 3 1 cometabolism performance in order to investigate the mtbe cometabolism in the presence of glucose growth substrate the variations of initial concentration and removal efficiency of mtbe and cod had been monitored and the obtained results are presented in fig 2 according to the figure at the beginning of the acclimatization despite the low mtbe concentration and high glucose concentration the system performance fluctuated due to exposure of the microbial consortium to the new feed however after a few cycles and repeated feeding the fluctuations were gradually eliminated and the removal efficiency of mtbe and cod reached about 100 after 10 days which showed the microbial consortium had the ability to consume available substrates subsequently by increasing the mtbe concentration and decreasing initial glucose concentration in each step initially the removal efficiency decreased significantly which indicated increasing mtbe concentration in each step had an inhibitory effect against the consumption of substrate by microbial consortium the initial inhibition coincided with increasing the mtbe concentration may be due to the lack of the mtbe degrading enzymes at the beginning of each step 49 in fact probably at the beginning of exposure the amount of enzyme produced was not sufficient to break down the available concentration of mtbe which reduced the removal efficiency of mtbe and cod however if the microbial consortium had enough contact time and due to the continuous and daily supply of growth substrate 9 gradually most of the influent mtbe and substrate degraded and the removal efficiency of mtbe and cod increased again after a few cycles as can be seen in fig 2 variations of the growth substrate concentration and its reduction had no effect on system performance and in accordance with the barajas rodriguez et al 9 even at the lowest growth substrate concentration most of the influent feed is degraded by microbial consortium as at the lowest concentration of glucose growth substrate equal to 60 mg l and initial mtbe concentration of 40 mg l the removal efficiencies of the mtbe and cod were 85 and 92 in 24 h afterward by stopping feeding of glucose growth substrate in the case of that mtbe was the only available carbon source for bacteria in addition to a further decline in system performance the time required to eliminate the inhibitory effect of mtbe was approximately twice the time was required for the lowest influent glucose concentration which based on the results obtained in the study by xiao et al 66 may be indicated more time required for producing a sufficient amount of mtbe degrading enzymes however after seven days the system performance improved due to the elimination of the inhibitory effect as a result when the initial mtbe concentration of 50 mg l is the only available carbon source for the microbial consortium the mtbe and cod removal efficiencies reached 70 and 93 in 24 h li et al 32 using acinetobacter sp sl3 the growth substrate of n alkanes 50 mg l and the initial concentration of mtbe between 8 and 45 mg l after 2 days achieved 95 of mtbe removal efficiency in another study salazar et al 53 used pseudomonas aeruginosa and hexane 360 to 1680 mg l as growth substrates for an initial mtbe concentration between 240 and 720 mg l which finally reached to 70 mtbe removal efficiency the higher mtbe removal efficiency and shorter degradation time of cometabolism in the present study can be due to the use of glucose as the growth substrate as well as a real microbial consortium similar to li et al 31 in the presence of glucose growth substrate bacteria that were able to produce enzymes needed to degrade mtbe were active and enable the degradation of mtbe in addition due to the use of microbial consortium it is possible that the enzymes required could be produced by various bacteria and each path of the mtbe degradation pathway had been done with the participation of one or more species of bacteria also one group of bacteria may have been able to degrade growth substrate and mtbe and another group might have been able to degrade the intermediate products or the other group of bacteria might have participated in several degradation paths 31 which resulted in high cod removal efficiency and also indicated that producing intermediate products did not prevent the degradation of organic load therefore due to the removal efficiency of mtbe the studied microbial consortium was able to degrade mtbe by cometabolism in the presence of glucose as the growth substrate even at the lowest glucose concentration of 60 mg l additionally the microbial consortium was able to break down mtbe as the only carbon source by direct metabolism even in the case of stopping glucose feeding by increasing the contact time for elimination of inhibitory effect despite reducing the removal efficiency 3 2 biomass concentration od600 and mlss represents the biomass concentration and microbial population in the system as a result the variations of these two parameters along with the variation of mtbe and glucose concentration are presented in fig 3 as can be seen by an increase in mtbe concentration and decrease in glucose concentration biomass concentration and the microbial population decreased significantly the severe decline was probably due to reduced initial organic load and toxicity due to the presence of mtbe as well as the production of intermediate products 46 while by repetition of initial mtbe and glucose concentration also initial organic load the rate of decline gradually decreased the microbial population was regenerated and the biomass concentration increased microbial regeneration occurred during the acclimatization period even in the final step which the highest decrease in biomass concentration and microbial population happened regeneration of the microbial population and regrowth of biomass indicated biomass activation in the presence of the available feed therefore in addition to being a suitable growth substrate for bacteria glucose also improved microbial growth 31 furthermore biomass regeneration showed that mtbe and its intermediate products could also be used as a carbon source for microbial consortium which showed no inhibitory effect on bacteria 46 despite the microbial consortium activity the reduction of od600 from 1 94 to 0 98 in the last step of glucose addition and 0 91 for the final step when mtbe was the only carbon source can be due to the reduction of the initial organic load from 300 mg cod l to 122 mg cod l and 75 mg cod l respectively in fact by reducing the influent organic load the energy resulted from the substrate degradation is not sufficient for cell survival and bacteria growth and most of the resulting energy was consumed for bacterial maintenance and a small amount of energy was used to grow microbial population 21 it is worthy to note that the high mlss value even up to the final step can be due to the presence of inorganic substances including additives nutrients and micronutrients in the feed and also due to the biomass decay and cell debris as a matter of fact during the biological process the hardly biodegradable parts of the bacterial cell are expelled from the cell such as the cell wall and become the inert part of the sludge 26 mlss represents the sum of organic and inorganic parts of the sludge also dead and living cells but mlvss indicates only the organic part of the sludge and can better determine the activity of the microbial population 16 68 thus the values of mlvss mlss ratio by variation of initial concentration of mtbe and glucose were also monitored and the obtained results are presented in fig 3 as shown the mlvss mlss ratio decreased in the early steps of increasing mtbe concentration and decreasing glucose concentration which it seems that inhibition occurred against microbial growth although in general reducing the initial cod concentration and organic load leads to a decrease in mlvss mlss 16 by repeating a constant feeding over time mtbe was also consumed as the carbon source for the microbial consortium and along with glucose had provided a suitable growth medium for the microbial consortium as mlvss mlss ratio had been increased from the fifth step and again being in the appropriate range of the biological systems thus firstly in the case that the microbial consortium was exposed to a new substrate and growth medium it entered the delay phase and resulted in a reduction of bacterial growth 68 subsequently the microbial population increased which indicated entering the logarithmic growth phase and microbial consortium compatibility to the new medium and substrate 68 then considering the high biomass concentration in the final two steps and the high mlvss mlss it can be concluded that the microbial consortium had passed the delay phase had normal growth and there were many living bacteria in the system 47 3 3 specific rates sludge production and decay as mentioned before sludge age is one of the key parameters affecting the performance of biological system since sludge age affects the biomass growth and specific substrate consumption rates the variation of the yobs and qobs coincide with srt variation during the mtbe cometabolism was evaluated and the obtained results are presented in fig 4 sludge retention time or sludge age depends on the mlvss concentration in the reactor and discharged volume thus variations of sludge age calculated through eq 2 positively affected the mlvss mlss ratio which is in accordance with the reported results in the study of amanatidou et al 4 about activated sludge yobs is resulted for a specific type of substrate and indicates substrate conversion rate and the resulting energy for bacterial metabolic processes 19 and is highly dependent on biological system operating conditions srt is one of the effective parameters which positively affects the coefficient of biomass production in this study the observed coefficient of biomass production was calculated according to eq 4 by assuming that the sbr reactor reached steady state at each step yobs had been constantly increased throughout the experimental period which indicated that the microbial consortium gradually acquired more ability to consume the available substrate and was able to break down mtbe and glucose by elimination of the delay phase and entering the logarithmic growth phase in fact over time more enzymes had been probably produced that were needed to break down the feed and the feasibility of breaking down and consuming feed had increased for the microbial consortium consequently the observed coefficient of biomass production had increased however generally increasing srt reduces the observed coefficient of biomass production and vice versa 22 the mentioned trend continued during the first half of the experimental period but changed from the fifth step that mlvss mlss was increased as the yobs values increased despite the increasing srt which similar dependency between yobs and mlvss mlss was also reported by fan et al 16 in the last half of the experiment the yobs values increased significantly from 0 2 mg vss mg cod to 0 71 mg vss mg cod which was also higher than the reported values for mtbe consumption by morales et al 43 equal to 0 45 mg vss mg mtbe for complete degradation of 75 mg l mtbe in the presence of 75 mg l pentane and müller et al 44 equal to 0 55 mg vss mg mtbe for direct metabolism of 220 mg l mtbe this significant increase and high yobs values in the last half of the experimental period may be due to more substrate storage capacity of the remaining bacterial species storage capacity means that the substrate firstly stored and accumulated in the bacterial cell and then enters into the metabolic and degradation processes 26 it is worthy to note that biomass production coefficient indicates the occurrence of the substrate storage within the bacterial cell as the higher biomass storage capacity leads to higher biomass production coefficient 26 the specific substrate consumption rate or qobs indicated the ratio of consumed substrate to biomass produced 17 according to fig 4 the values of qobs calculated based on eq 7 fluctuated in the early steps during this period the initial cod concentration and mlvss in the reactor were decreasing and qobs had increased from 0 129 mg cod mg vss day to 0 177 mg cod mg vss day however over time and by the continuous decrease of the initial organic load as well as by the continuous increase of mlvss qobs also decreased steadily and finally reached 0 039 mg cod mg vss day it is worthy to note that qobs values in a study by müller et al 44 were obtained equal to 0 92 mmol mtbe g dm h for direct metabolism of 220 mg l mtbe the low values of qobs in the last half of the experiment compared to values were reported by müller et al 44 could be due to the low concentration of initial mtbe and glucose concentration in this period which reduced the amount of available substrate according to eq 5 by plotting the variations of specific biomass growth rate μ versus the qobs the values of theoretical coefficient of biomass production y and the specific biomass decay rate kd can be calculated using the slope of the fitted line as a result the graph of μ variation versus qobs along with the variation of initial mtbe and glucose concentration was plotted based on eq 5 and is presented in fig 5 the specific biomass decay rate is an intrinsic parameter of bacteria due to the physiological conditions of the microbial consortium and does not depend on the type and concentration of substrate as well as srt 19 as can be seen kd for the studied microbial consortium was equal to 0 0243 day 1 which means 2 43 of biomass produced was degraded per day kd values have been reported in the range of 0 006 0 7 day 1 corresponding to the type of the bacteria in other studies 17 22 26 thus the kd obtained in this study despite being low is in the range of values reported low kd value indicates high biological activity of the microbial consortium and shows that a very small percentage of biomass decay daily 49 as a result since the studied microbial consortium was able to consume mtbe and had a low biomass decay rate it can be a suitable option for in situ bioremediation of mtbe as a common groundwater pollutant because for in situ bioremediation method changes in plume contamination seasonal and environmental conditions fluctuate the available substrate concentration to the bacteria which in case of high biomass decay rate a high percentage of the biomass concentration will be degraded until the changes are eliminated 49 consequently the performance of the bioremediation process is reduced however in case of low biomass decay rate most of the available biomass concentrations will survive until the changes are eliminated and bioremediation will continue with high performance the theoretical coefficient of biomass production is the same as yobs except that yobs expresses the amount of the net growth in fact the bacteria endogenous metabolism death endogenous decay as well as the predation of some bacteria by other bacteria cause differences in the values of these two parameters 26 cheng and hsieh according to fig 5 y was obtained 0 1181 mg vss mg cod which is lower than the reported values in the other studies in the range of 0 2 0 6 mg vss mg cod 12 25 26 the difference in the obtained coefficients can be due to the differences in the nature of the biological system the system operating conditions or the history of the microbial consortium 8 3 4 active biomass and sludge generation as mentioned before mlvss represents the organic part of biomass which contains both living and dead bacterial cells therefore to determine the living part of mlvss or active mlvss the amount of cell debris must be separated from the living bacterial cells for this purpose the amount of active mlvss was calculated through eq 9 and its variation compared to the gross mlvss is presented in fig 6 variations of gross mlvss and active mlvss were similar during the experimental period the values of these two parameters decreased in the early experimental period when the microbial consortium was in the delay phase and increased when it entered into logarithmic growth phase however the differences between the gross and active mlvss were not the same throughout the experiment and changes in the active mlvss gross mlvss ratio depended on the srt as by decreasing the srt the differences between them decreased and the active mlvss gross mlvss ratio increased from 0 84 for srt 37 days to 0 9 for srt 22 days then by increasing srt the differences increased and at srt 35 days active mlvss gross mlvss ratio decreased to 0 85 this may be due to the fact that by increasing srt more cell debris remains in the system and also by decreasing sludge discharge less cellular debris leaves the reactor 37 in a conventional biological system typically 20 of the degraded biomass is converted to cellular debris 37 which results in less active mlvss contribution in the gross mlvss however by changing the operating conditions and srt in this study the conversion ratio of degraded biomass to cell debris was achieved in the range of 10 15 and the contribution of active mlvss in the gross mlvss increased since the initial mtbe and glucose concentration were varied the amount of available feed to the bacteria varied during the experimental period therefore the trend of f m variations based on eq 8 which indicates the amount of available feed to the bacteria as well as changes in the amount of sludge produced based on eq 10 is presented in fig 7 in addition to the initial substrate concentration f m also depends on the concentration and growth of mlvss as f m values decrease by increasing mlvss 4 thus f m decreased proportionally to decreasing initial mtbe and glucose concentration but increased slightly in the early experimental period when mlvss values were decreasing however as the microbial consortium entered into the logarithmic growth phase the mlvss concentration increased again and f m values decreased more rapidly it is worthy to note that the f m values reached from 0 154 kg cod kg vss day at the beginning of the experimental period to 0 067 kg cod kg vss day in the last step of adding glucose to the feed and to 0 043 kg cod kg vss day when mtbe was the only available carbon source for the microbial consortium since f m actually shows the amount of available substrate per unit of biomass mass it has a significant impact on sludge generation 4 thus the daily sludge generation values which depend on the growth and degradation of bacteria vary with the change in srt and f m 3 4 in the present study in the first half of the experiment daily sludge generation increased when srt decreased and f m increased then by increasing srt undegraded compounds accumulated and led to more bacterial death 26 and at the same time f m decreased which resulting in a significant drop in daily sludge generation reached 44 mg vss day and 24 mg vss day in the two final steps respectively daily sludge generation values indicated that the biomass accumulation within this system was low in either the presence or absence of glucose growth substrate biomass accumulation is one of the main drawbacks of biological systems that must be discharged and disposed in case of ex situ treatment methods and also increases the possibility of aquifer clogging in case of in situ bioremediation 8 67 recently wide research has been conducted on various methods to reduce biomass accumulation that change in operating condition especially increasing srt is one of the effective methods in this regard 67 it is worthy to note that due to the operating condition conducted in this study low daily sludge generation or biomass accumulation can be due to low f m ratio low qobs and high srt as the low f m ratio increases the death of microbial consortium the low qobs leads to reduced growth of microbial consortium as well as high srt increases the predator species in the microbial consortium 4 since variation of initial substrate concentration and operating condition can change the quality of the sludge the svi parameter was evaluated as an indicator for the sludge quality and settleability which the results are presented in fig 8 as can be seen svi values decreased during the experimental period from 125 ml mg to 86 ml mg based on microscopic observation different bacterial species included cocci bacilli spirillum and filamentous were in the source of the microbial consortium obtained from wastewater treatment plant which is in accordance with higher initial svi values at the beginning of the experimental period however bacterial staining test showed only the presence of cocci and bacilli species for the microbial consortium after aerobic cometabolism acclimatization period in the final step which is consistent with the lower svi values additionally it can be concluded that the system was in extended aeration mode due to high srt between 20 and 40 days low f m between 0 04 kg cod kg vss day to 0 20 kg cod kg vss day as well as high concentration of dissolved oxygen 4 mg l data not shown according to the study by amanatidou et al 4 svi values can reduce under extended aeration mode decreasing svi values during the experimental period indicated an increase in sludge settling velocity and sludge density consequently the rate of biofilm formation will increase and biofilm scouring will decrease in case of using for in situ bioremediation 18 38 therefore according to the approach of this research based on using microbial consortium for in situ bioremediation the studied microbial consortium by maintaining sludge quality and settleability high rate of biofilm formation and low scour in the aquifer had the ability to consume mtbe effectively in the presence of glucose growth substrate 4 conclusion in the present study the feasibility of aerobic cometabolism biodegradation of mtbe by the microbial consortium obtained municipal sewage sludge was investigated in the presence of glucose growth substrate for in situ bioremediation of mtbe contaminated groundwater for this purpose various criteria including mtbe removal efficiency microbial population and activity biomass growth and decay rate substrate removal rate excess sludge generation and sludge settling velocity was investigated due to achieving optimal growth and decay condition low possibility of bio clogging high potential for biofilm formation and high compatibility of acclimatized microbial consortium to the variations of environmental conditions and plume concentration in aquifer the results showed high activity of the microbial consortium even at the lowest glucose concentration as well as effective degradation and consumption of mtbe in addition the biomass growth rate and active mlvss gross mlvss ratio was very high and the biomass decay rate was very low these results indicated the microbial consortium ability to consume available substrate maintenance of bacterial cell growth and survival high activity of microbial consortium and low amount of cell debris due to low biomass decay rate the studied microbial consortium was also highly resistant to changes in environmental conditions or concentration of substrate in the aquifer that can be survived with high continuity during the bioremediation period also the amount of excess sludge generated for the studied system was very low which indicated that the biomass will not be generated excessively and the possibility of aquifer bio clogging will reduce additionally low biomass settling velocity showed high rate of biofilm formation and low biofilm scouring during in situ bioremediation therefore the studied microbial consortium and glucose growth substrate are strongly suggested for bioremediation which can prolong the lifetime of the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

13253,in the present study the feasibility of aerobic cometabolism biodegradation of mtbe was investigated by the microbial consortium obtained municipal wastewater treatment plant in the presence of glucose growth substrate for in situ bioremediation of mtbe as the second most common pollutant in groundwater for this purpose various criteria including mtbe removal efficiency microbial population and activity biomass growth and decay rate substrate removal rate excess sludge generation and sludge settling velocity was investigated due to evaluate its compatibility for in situ bioremediation at the lowest glucose concentration required for effective growth of microbial consortium 60 mg l and initial mtbe concentration of 40 mg l mtbe and cod removal efficiencies were 85 and 92 respectively under this operating condition coefficient of biomass production of 0 51 mg vss mg cod and active mlvss gross mlvss of 0 85 were achieved these high values indicated that mtbe and its intermediate products induced no inhibitory effect on microbial consortium in the presence of glucose in addition to the survival and growth of microbial consortium high microbial activity and low cellular debris additionally biomass decay rate was obtained 0 0243 day 1 which indicated its high continuity and resistant to changes in environmental conditions of the aquifer furthermore excess sludge generation and svi were 44 mg vss day and 87 ml mg respectively that showed low probability of bio clogging and high potential for biofilm formation therefore cometabolism in presence of glucose growth substrate

mtbe in gasoline it easily released into groundwater by each fuel leakage or accidental spills for instance in storing or transportation of fuel or while unburned gasoline releases from boats or other recreational equipment this compound has a very high solubility in water hardly absorbs soil particles and is very mobile in the soil thus it remains and migrates in groundwater for a long time after release 11 30 52 as a result mtbe is known as one of the important pollutants of groundwater mtbe is a toxic and flammable compound which in case of its presence in water changes its odor and taste damages the liver kidneys and nervous system causes eye and skin irritants and has carcinogenic potential 30 52 69 consequently mtbe contaminated groundwater remediation is very essential different methods such as adsorption air stripping electrochemical oxidation advanced oxidation processes aops and biological process have been investigated for mtbe contaminated groundwater remediation so far however these technologies have some disadvantages that limit their use for mtbe treatment for instance in the adsorption process adsorbate just move from one phase to another phase even in case of high removal efficiency and the saturated adsorbent require further regeneration or disposal 28 51 in particular mtbe hardly adsorbed to adsorbents due to its low octanol water coefficient in the range of 0 02 to 1 1 60 low henry s law constant of mtbe in the range of 0 0216 to 0 0555 60 cause low mtbe removal efficiency by air stripping unless spends more air and increases treatment time which makes it a non economical treatment technology for mtbe contaminated groundwater remediation 30 additionally air stripping produces a huge amount of air pollution that requires further treatment and causes more expenses 54 on the other hand aops are energy intensive processes that despite the high removal efficiency require high chemical consumption and ph adjustment which leads to the formation of some undesirable intermediate products and high costs 1 30 similarly ph adjustment especially in the acidic range and adding electrolytes for electrical conductivity adjustment are required for electrochemical oxidation processes that require further neutralization and desalination and increase the cost of the process 2 30 biological treatment methods especially under aerobic conditions that degrade and break down pollutants into harmless compounds are one of the suitable options for mtbe contaminated groundwater remediation due to their high removal efficiency low cost and low negative effects compared to the different common treatment methods of mtbe that were mentioned 7 15 30 58 in situ bioremediation is a reliable biological method among various ex situ and in situ biological technologies that is commonly used for contaminated groundwater remediation today because in situ bioremediation is an efficient environmentally friendly economical and non invasive method that does not destroy the soil structure has a simple operation and requires low maintenance 15 65 the performance of in situ bioremediation depends on various parameters includes pollutant concentration the presence of active bacteria with the capability of degrading the target pollutant microbial population microbial diversity the presence of suitable carbon source for bacterial survival and growth to overcome the microbial lag phase biomass growth and accumulation as well as environmental condition of the aquifer 6 11 20 29 the presence of a strong ether bond and a third carbon in the molecular structure of mtbe makes it a chemically stable compound which its breaking is difficult for a wide range of bacteria however some bacteria such as arthrobacter sp atcc27778 36 hydrogenophaga flava env7 59 aquincola tertiaricarbonis l108 50 variovorax paradoxus cl 8 70 methylibium petroleiphilum pm1 24 can degrade mtbe by direct metabolism however for other bacteria degradation of this compound will be possible only through cometabolism if the pollutant as the only source of carbon is not sufficient for the growth and survival of bacteria cometabolism can enable pollutant degradation for bacteria under cometabolism the bacteria receive the carbon and energy needed for growth from the growth substrate and then the synthesis of enzymes required for the target pollutant degradation increases consequently the rate of pollutant degradation also increases as bacteria growth improves 33 34 66 mtbe cometabolism was investigated by rhodococcus rubber in the presence of ethanol 23 pseudomonas mendocina kr 1 in the presence of n alkanes 56 consortium of m1 p pseudomonas in the presence of pentane 43 pseudomonas putida gpol in the presence of octane 55 a mixture of pseudomonas strains in the presence of n alkanes 42 pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of hexane 53 a mixture of pseudomonas strains in the presence of n octane 31 pseudomonas sp wl1 in the presence of n octane 34 and n pentane 33 acinetobacter sp sl3 in the presence of n alkanes 32 up to now most studies about mtbe cometabolism have investigated a pure culture of bacteria or a microbial synthesis of some specific bacteria and only a few studies 41 45 63 71 have used a microbial consortium extracted from contaminated groundwater it is in spite of the fact that the microbial consortium has shown better performance for mtbe degradation than a pure culture of bacteria because various enzymes which are produced in the presence of different microbial species enable the degradation of different substrates therefore not only is the pollutant mtbe exposed to more enzymes but also the enzymes needed to break down the intermediates of the target pollutant are produced 31 glucose is an available and inexpensive hydrocarbon that as the growth substrate can rapidly act as the carbon source for bacteria 10 35 various studies about the effect of glucose growth substrate on growth of different microbial cultures by lv et al 40 li et al 35 pathania and jana 48 and bennett et al 10 had concluded that glucose can easily and quickly provide sufficient carbon and energy as well as a suitable growth medium for bacterial growth which can maintain the survival and richness of microbial diversity and accelerate pollutant degradation despite biomass growth is a critical parameter affecting the in situ bioremediation performance during its lifetime excessive biomass growth and sludge generation which leads to biomass accumulation and bio clogging is the main problem of in situ bioremediation that affects its lifetime 6 29 excessive biomass growth decreases nutrient concentration rapidly as a result endangers bacterial survival which affects the process performance on the other hand bio clogging due to excessive microbial population its non homogenous distribution and high cell debris reduces soil permeability which reduces the concentration of carbon nutrient and oxygen for downstream bacteria and affects the in situ bioremediation performance 11 20 29 consequently analyzing the microbial assessment in terms of net growth and population bacterial survival and decay microbial activity excess sludge generation and cell debris is necessary before microbial consortium augmentation for in situ bioremediation 6 however to the best of the author s knowledge only the microbial population has been studied in published feasibility studies on mtbe treatment by a pure culture or consortium of bacteria as well as by direct metabolism or cometabolism and other critical effective parameters have not been investigated therefore the aim of the present study is to investigate a real microbial consortium for mtbe aerobic biodegradation in terms of mtbe removal efficiency and providing favorable growth and decay conditions as well as high active microbial population besides low probability of bio clogging for in situ bioremediation applications municipal sewage sludge is an available bacterial source with a high diversity of bacteria 13 39 that has good potential for using glucose as a growth substrate 64 consequently in the present study the feasibility of aerobic biodegradation of mtbe was investigated in the presence of glucose growth substrate through microbial consortium obtained from municipal wastewater treatment plant for in situ bioremediation application of mtbe contaminated groundwater for this purpose the consumption rate and concentration reduction of mtbe as well as the growth and concentration of biomass were studied under variation of the growth substrate and mtbe concentration in addition the effect of mtbe cometabolism and concentration of carbon source on the quality of microbial population was comprehensively investigated by evaluation of the net growth of active biomass biomass growth and decay rate specific substrate removal rate excess sludge generation and sludge settling velocity to determine the compatibility of the mtbe acclimatized microbial consortium for in situ bioremediation under the conditions and environment of the aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 microbial consortium and feeding method the microbial consortium used in this study was obtained from the returned sludge of one of the tehran municipal wastewater treatment plants with cod mlss od600 and ph approximately equal to 300 mg l 4870 mg l 9 68 and 8 respectively for starting up the experiments four liters of synthetic wastewater containing mtbe glucose growth substrate and mineral salt medium msm were added to 1 l of concentrated biomass it is worthy to note that in order to support the growth of bacteria at maximum activity and efficiency balanced nutrients at c n p 100 5 1 ratio were added to the msm for this purpose the sum organic load of mtbe and glucose introduced as carbon source nh4no3 was used as nitrogen source as well as k2hpo4 and kh2po4 were used as phosphorus source which nh4no3 k2hpo4 and kh2po4 concentration were varied proportional to changes in mtbe and glucose concentration during the gradual acclimatization period in addition other essential micronutrients for bacterial growth including fecl2 4h2o mgso4 7h2o cacl2 2h2o znso4 7h2o mnso4 h2o cuso4 5h2o al2so4 18h2o and cocl2 6h2o at a ratio of 1 667 2 333 0 667 0 067 0 033 0 033 0 233 0 006 mg l per 100 mg l of cod were dissolved and added into the msm the gradual acclimatization was conducted by gradually increasing mtbe concentration as well as step by step decreasing glucose concentration along the acclimatization period in the first step synthesis wastewater with an initial cod concentration of 300 mg l was prepared by 255 mg l of glucose and only 5 mg l of mtbe to prevent possible toxicity due to high mtbe concentration after that by repeating the initial mtbe and glucose concentration the microbial consortium was adapted to mtbe and passed the lag phase then the initial concentration of mtbe gradually increased in order to reach the average mtbe concentration have been detected in groundwater equal to 50 mg l 27 30 57 61 and the glucose concentration gradually decreased to determine the minimum amount of glucose required for cometabolism for this purpose in each five next steps glucose contribution in the initial cod decreased approximately 10 and mtbe concentration was slightly increased less than 10 mg l until the mtbe and glucose concentration reached 40 mg l and 60 mg l respectively then in the final step glucose contribution from the carbon source reached zero and mtbe concentration reached 50 mg l 2 2 procedure cometabolism of mtbe in the presence of glucose growth substrate was investigated using a sbr system fig 1 in a 5 l working volume reactor at room temperature equal to 22 3 c each cycle of the sbr system including filling 10 min mixing 23 h settling 30 min decantation 10 min and idling 10 min lasted 24 h in addition air was injected into the system through an air pump in order to supply the required oxygen to the bacteria and sufficient mixing inside the reactor mtbe and cod concentration from the treated wastewater in the decantation phase as well as od600 and mlss from the mixture sample of wastewater and the microbial consortium in the mixing phase were measured daily at the end of each cycle also mlvss and svi from the mixture sample in the mixing phase were measured for each initial mtbe and glucose concentration additionally do and ph were regularly monitored in order to control the required optimal growth condition for the microbial consortium as do and ph were in the range of 4 6 mg l and 8 8 3 respectively during the experimental period it is worthy to note that all experiments were repeated three times 2 3 sludge production and decay if sludge is discharged regularly from the sbr system the age of the sludge is calculated according to eq 1 12 1 θ x vss v r x d v d x eff v eff t c where θ is the age of the sludge or sludge retention time srt d xvss is the mlvss in the sbr reactor mg vss l vr is the working volume of the reactor l xd is the biomass concentration of the regularly discharged from the sbr reactor vd is the regular discharge volume l xeff is the mlvss of the effluent mg vss l veff is the effluent volume l and tc is the time per cycle of sbr d the main approach of this study is the possibility of the in situ bioremediation of mtbe by cometabolism there is no daily sludge discharge from the aquifer during the in situ bioremediation and only an unspecific amount of biomass is washed from the aquifer due to scour therefore the sludge age was calculated according to eq 2 which is used for sbr systems without any regular sludge discharge 12 2 θ x vss v r x eff v eff t c the observed coefficient of biomass production depends on the net sludge production including biomass growth and death and is a ratio that reveals the biomass production rate to the substrate consumption rate which is obtained through eq 3 4 26 12 3 y obs x vss 2 x vss 1 v r x eff v eff t c c in c eff v eff t c where yobs is the observed coefficient of biomass production mg vss mg cod xvss 2 is the mlvss in the reactor at the end of the sbr cycle mg vss l xvss 1 is the mlvss in the reactor at the beginning of the sbr cycle mg vss l cin is the initial cod concentration mg cod l and ceff is the cod concentration of effluent mg cod l if the sbr system becomes steady state or the biomass concentration in the reactor remains constant eq 3 can be summarized as eq 4 12 since in this study each initial mtbe and glucose concentrations continued until the reactor reached steady state the yobs values were calculated according to eq 4 4 y obs x vss c in c eff the difference between the theoretical coefficient of biomass production with the observed coefficient yobs due to various mechanisms including endogenous metabolism death and bacteria predation by invading bacteria is revealed by the specific biomass decay rate which they are calculated through eq 5 26 12 5 μ y q obs k d where μ is the specific biomass growth rate day 1 which is inversely related to θ eq 6 y is the theoretical coefficient of biomass production mg vss mg cod kd is specific biomass decay rate day 1 and qobs is the observed specific substrate consumption rate mg cod mg vss day as a matter of fact qobs is the ratio between the substrate consumed and biomass concentration which is calculated according to eq 7 25 4 12 6 μ 1 θ 7 q obs c in c eff v eff t c v r x vss the f m ratio as a key parameter affecting the biological system is also calculated through eq 8 that revealed the amount of influent feed to the biomass concentration 14 8 f m

eq 9 25 9 x a x vss 1 0 2 k d θ where xa is the active biomass in the reactor mg vss l the amount of sludge generation in biological systems which depends on the growth and decay rate of bacteria is also calculated according to eq 10 3 10 p μ v r x vss k d v r x vss where p is the daily sludge generation mg vss day 2 5 chemicals it is worthy to note that all chemicals include mtbe 99 8 nh4no3 95 k2hpo4 98 kh2po4 99 5 fecl2 4h2o 98 mgso4 7h2o 99 5 cacl2 2h2o 99 znso4 7h2o 99 5 mnso4 h2o 99 cuso4 5h2o 98 5 al2so4 18h2o 100 and cocl2 6h2o 99 were supplied from merck co germany additionally whatman filter paper was purchased from ge healthcare co usa and ashless filter paper was obtained from johnson test papers ltd uk 2 6 analytical methods mtbe concentration was measured by uv vis spectrophotometer dr 4000 hach at its corresponding maximum wavelength of 340 nm and through converting the absorbance to the mtbe concentration by the calibration curve cod concentration was measured based on closed reflux colorimetric method according to 5220d standard using the cod reactor drb200 hach furthermore all of the measurements of microbial parameters include od600 2130b mlss 2540d mlvss 2540e and svi 2710d were performed according to the water and wastewater standard methods 5 furthermore bacterial staining was identified by the gram staining method 3 results and discussion 3 1 cometabolism performance in order to investigate the mtbe cometabolism in the presence of glucose growth substrate the variations of initial concentration and removal efficiency of mtbe and cod had been monitored and the obtained results are presented in fig 2 according to the figure at the beginning of the acclimatization despite the low mtbe concentration and high glucose concentration the system performance fluctuated due to exposure of the microbial consortium to the new feed however after a few cycles and repeated feeding the fluctuations were gradually eliminated and the removal efficiency of mtbe and cod reached about 100 after 10 days which showed the microbial consortium had the ability to consume available substrates subsequently by increasing the mtbe concentration and decreasing initial glucose concentration in each step initially the removal efficiency decreased significantly which indicated increasing mtbe concentration in each step had an inhibitory effect against the consumption of substrate by microbial consortium the initial inhibition coincided with increasing the mtbe concentration may be due to the lack of the mtbe degrading enzymes at the beginning of each step 49 in fact probably at the beginning of exposure the amount of enzyme produced was not sufficient to break down the available concentration of mtbe which reduced the removal efficiency of mtbe and cod however if the microbial consortium had enough contact time and due to the continuous and daily supply of growth substrate 9 gradually most of the influent mtbe and substrate degraded and the removal efficiency of mtbe and cod increased again after a few cycles as can be seen in fig 2 variations of the growth substrate concentration and its reduction had no effect on system performance and in accordance with the barajas rodriguez et al 9 even at the lowest growth substrate concentration most of the influent feed is degraded by microbial consortium as at the lowest concentration of glucose growth substrate equal to 60 mg l and initial mtbe concentration of 40 mg l the removal efficiencies of the mtbe and cod were 85 and 92 in 24 h afterward by stopping feeding of glucose growth substrate in the case of that mtbe was the only available carbon source for bacteria in addition to a further decline in system performance the time required to eliminate the inhibitory effect of mtbe was approximately twice the time was required for the lowest influent glucose concentration which based on the results obtained in the study by xiao et al 66 may be indicated more time required for producing a sufficient amount of mtbe degrading enzymes however after seven days the system performance improved due to the elimination of the inhibitory effect as a result when the initial mtbe concentration of 50 mg l is the only available carbon source for the microbial consortium the mtbe and cod removal efficiencies reached 70 and 93 in 24 h li et al 32 using acinetobacter sp sl3 the growth substrate of n alkanes 50 mg l and the initial concentration of mtbe between 8 and 45 mg l after 2 days achieved 95 of mtbe removal efficiency in another study salazar et al 53 used pseudomonas aeruginosa and hexane 360 to 1680 mg l as growth substrates for an initial mtbe concentration between 240 and 720 mg l which finally reached to 70 mtbe removal efficiency the higher mtbe removal efficiency and shorter degradation time of cometabolism in the present study can be due to the use of glucose as the growth substrate as well as a real microbial consortium similar to li et al 31 in the presence of glucose growth substrate bacteria that were able to produce enzymes needed to degrade mtbe were active and enable the degradation of mtbe in addition due to the use of microbial consortium it is possible that the enzymes required could be produced by various bacteria and each path of the mtbe degradation pathway had been done with the participation of one or more species of bacteria also one group of bacteria may have been able to degrade growth substrate and mtbe and another group might have been able to degrade the intermediate products or the other group of bacteria might have participated in several degradation paths 31 which resulted in high cod removal efficiency and also indicated that producing intermediate products did not prevent the degradation of organic load therefore due to the removal efficiency of mtbe the studied microbial consortium was able to degrade mtbe by cometabolism in the presence of glucose as the growth substrate even at the lowest glucose concentration of 60 mg l additionally the microbial consortium was able to break down mtbe as the only carbon source by direct metabolism even in the case of stopping glucose feeding by increasing the contact time for elimination of inhibitory effect despite reducing the removal efficiency 3 2 biomass concentration od600 and mlss represents the biomass concentration and microbial population in the system as a result the variations of these two parameters along with the variation of mtbe and glucose concentration are presented in fig 3 as can be seen by an increase in mtbe concentration and decrease in glucose concentration biomass concentration and the microbial population decreased significantly the severe decline was probably due to reduced initial organic load and toxicity due to the presence of mtbe as well as the production of intermediate products 46 while by repetition of initial mtbe and glucose concentration also initial organic load the rate of decline gradually decreased the microbial population was regenerated and the biomass concentration increased microbial regeneration occurred during the acclimatization period even in the final step which the highest decrease in biomass concentration and microbial population happened regeneration of the microbial population and regrowth of biomass indicated biomass activation in the presence of the available feed therefore in addition to being a suitable growth substrate for bacteria glucose also improved microbial growth 31 furthermore biomass regeneration showed that mtbe and its intermediate products could also be used as a carbon source for microbial consortium which showed no inhibitory effect on bacteria 46 despite the microbial consortium activity the reduction of od600 from 1 94 to 0 98 in the last step of glucose addition and 0 91 for the final step when mtbe was the only carbon source can be due to the reduction of the initial organic load from 300 mg cod l to 122 mg cod l and 75 mg cod l respectively in fact by reducing the influent organic load the energy resulted from the substrate degradation is not sufficient for cell survival and bacteria growth and most of the resulting energy was consumed for bacterial maintenance and a small amount of energy was used to grow microbial population 21 it is worthy to note that the high mlss value even up to the final step can be due to the presence of inorganic substances including additives nutrients and micronutrients in the feed and also due to the biomass decay and cell debris as a matter of fact during the biological process the hardly biodegradable parts of the bacterial cell are expelled from the cell such as the cell wall and become the inert part of the sludge 26 mlss represents the sum of organic and inorganic parts of the sludge also dead and living cells but mlvss indicates only the organic part of the sludge and can better determine the activity of the microbial population 16 68 thus the values of mlvss mlss ratio by variation of initial concentration of mtbe and glucose were also monitored and the obtained results are presented in fig 3 as shown the mlvss mlss ratio decreased in the early steps of increasing mtbe concentration and decreasing glucose concentration which it seems that inhibition occurred against microbial growth although in general reducing the initial cod concentration and organic load leads to a decrease in mlvss mlss 16 by repeating a constant feeding over time mtbe was also consumed as the carbon source for the microbial consortium and along with glucose had provided a suitable growth medium for the microbial consortium as mlvss mlss ratio had been increased from the fifth step and again being in the appropriate range of the biological systems thus firstly in the case that the microbial consortium was exposed to a new substrate and growth medium it entered the delay phase and resulted in a reduction of bacterial growth 68 subsequently the microbial population increased which indicated entering the logarithmic growth phase and microbial consortium compatibility to the new medium and substrate 68 then considering the high biomass concentration in the final two steps and the high mlvss mlss it can be concluded that the microbial consortium had passed the delay phase had normal growth and there were many living bacteria in the system 47 3 3 specific rates sludge production and decay as mentioned before sludge age is one of the key parameters affecting the performance of biological system since sludge age affects the biomass growth and specific substrate consumption rates the variation of the yobs and qobs coincide with srt variation during the mtbe cometabolism was evaluated and the obtained results are presented in fig 4 sludge retention time or sludge age depends on the mlvss concentration in the reactor and discharged volume thus variations of sludge age calculated through eq 2 positively affected the mlvss mlss ratio which is in accordance with the reported results in the study of amanatidou et al 4 about activated sludge yobs is resulted for a specific type of substrate and indicates substrate conversion rate and the resulting energy for bacterial metabolic processes 19 and is highly dependent on biological system operating conditions srt is one of the effective parameters which positively affects the coefficient of biomass production in this study the observed coefficient of biomass production was calculated according to eq 4 by assuming that the sbr reactor reached steady state at each step yobs had been constantly increased throughout the experimental period which indicated that the microbial consortium gradually acquired more ability to consume the available substrate and was able to break down mtbe and glucose by elimination of the delay phase and entering the logarithmic growth phase in fact over time more enzymes had been probably produced that were needed to break down the feed and the feasibility of breaking down and consuming feed had increased for the microbial consortium consequently the observed coefficient of biomass production had increased however generally increasing srt reduces the observed coefficient of biomass production and vice versa 22 the mentioned trend continued during the first half of the experimental period but changed from the fifth step that mlvss mlss was increased as the yobs values increased despite the increasing srt which similar dependency between yobs and mlvss mlss was also reported by fan et al 16 in the last half of the experiment the yobs values increased significantly from 0 2 mg vss mg cod to 0 71 mg vss mg cod which was also higher than the reported values for mtbe consumption by morales et al 43 equal to 0 45 mg vss mg mtbe for complete degradation of 75 mg l mtbe in the presence of 75 mg l pentane and müller et al 44 equal to 0 55 mg vss mg mtbe for direct metabolism of 220 mg l mtbe this significant increase and high yobs values in the last half of the experimental period may be due to more substrate storage capacity of the remaining bacterial species storage capacity means that the substrate firstly stored and accumulated in the bacterial cell and then enters into the metabolic and degradation processes 26 it is worthy to note that biomass production coefficient indicates the occurrence of the substrate storage within the bacterial cell as the higher biomass storage capacity leads to higher biomass production coefficient 26 the specific substrate consumption rate or qobs indicated the ratio of consumed substrate to biomass produced 17 according to fig 4 the values of qobs calculated based on eq 7 fluctuated in the early steps during this period the initial cod concentration and mlvss in the reactor were decreasing and qobs had increased from 0 129 mg cod mg vss day to 0 177 mg cod mg vss day however over time and by the continuous decrease of the initial organic load as well as by the continuous increase of mlvss qobs also decreased steadily and finally reached 0 039 mg cod mg vss day it is worthy to note that qobs values in a study by müller et al 44 were obtained equal to 0 92 mmol mtbe g dm h for direct metabolism of 220 mg l mtbe the low values of qobs in the last half of the experiment compared to values were reported by müller et al 44 could be due to the low concentration of initial mtbe and glucose concentration in this period which reduced the amount of available substrate according to eq 5 by plotting the variations of specific biomass growth rate μ versus the qobs the values of theoretical coefficient of biomass production y and the specific biomass decay rate kd can be calculated using the slope of the fitted line as a result the graph of μ variation versus qobs along with the variation of initial mtbe and glucose concentration was plotted based on eq 5 and is presented in fig 5 the specific biomass decay rate is an intrinsic parameter of bacteria due to the physiological conditions of the microbial consortium and does not depend on the type and concentration of substrate as well as srt 19 as can be seen kd for the studied microbial consortium was equal to 0 0243 day 1 which means 2 43 of biomass produced was degraded per day kd values have been reported in the range of 0 006 0 7 day 1 corresponding to the type of the bacteria in other studies 17 22 26 thus the kd obtained in this study despite being low is in the range of values reported low kd value indicates high biological activity of the microbial consortium and shows that a very small percentage of biomass decay daily 49 as a result since the studied microbial consortium was able to consume mtbe and had a low biomass decay rate it can be a suitable option for in situ bioremediation of mtbe as a common groundwater pollutant because for in situ bioremediation method changes in plume contamination seasonal and environmental conditions fluctuate the available substrate concentration to the bacteria which in case of high biomass decay rate a high percentage of the biomass concentration will be degraded until the changes are eliminated 49 consequently the performance of the bioremediation process is reduced however in case of low biomass decay rate most of the available biomass concentrations will survive until the changes are eliminated and bioremediation will continue with high performance the theoretical coefficient of biomass production is the same as yobs except that yobs expresses the amount of the net growth in fact the bacteria endogenous metabolism death endogenous decay as well as the predation of some bacteria by other bacteria cause differences in the values of these two parameters 26 cheng and hsieh according to fig 5 y was obtained 0 1181 mg vss mg cod which is lower than the reported values in the other studies in the range of 0 2 0 6 mg vss mg cod 12 25 26 the difference in the obtained coefficients can be due to the differences in the nature of the biological system the system operating conditions or the history of the microbial consortium 8 3 4 active biomass and sludge generation as mentioned before mlvss represents the organic part of biomass which contains both living and dead bacterial cells therefore to determine the living part of mlvss or active mlvss the amount of cell debris must be separated from the living bacterial cells for this purpose the amount of active mlvss was calculated through eq 9 and its variation compared to the gross mlvss is presented in fig 6 variations of gross mlvss and active mlvss were similar during the experimental period the values of these two parameters decreased in the early experimental period when the microbial consortium was in the delay phase and increased when it entered into logarithmic growth phase however the differences between the gross and active mlvss were not the same throughout the experiment and changes in the active mlvss gross mlvss ratio depended on the srt as by decreasing the srt the differences between them decreased and the active mlvss gross mlvss ratio increased from 0 84 for srt 37 days to 0 9 for srt 22 days then by increasing srt the differences increased and at srt 35 days active mlvss gross mlvss ratio decreased to 0 85 this may be due to the fact that by increasing srt more cell debris remains in the system and also by decreasing sludge discharge less cellular debris leaves the reactor 37 in a conventional biological system typically 20 of the degraded biomass is converted to cellular debris 37 which results in less active mlvss contribution in the gross mlvss however by changing the operating conditions and srt in this study the conversion ratio of degraded biomass to cell debris was achieved in the range of 10 15 and the contribution of active mlvss in the gross mlvss increased since the initial mtbe and glucose concentration were varied the amount of available feed to the bacteria varied during the experimental period therefore the trend of f m variations based on eq 8 which indicates the amount of available feed to the bacteria as well as changes in the amount of sludge produced based on eq 10 is presented in fig 7 in addition to the initial substrate concentration f m also depends on the concentration and growth of mlvss as f m values decrease by increasing mlvss 4 thus f m decreased proportionally to decreasing initial mtbe and glucose concentration but increased slightly in the early experimental period when mlvss values were decreasing however as the microbial consortium entered into the logarithmic growth phase the mlvss concentration increased again and f m values decreased more rapidly it is worthy to note that the f m values reached from 0 154 kg cod kg vss day at the beginning of the experimental period to 0 067 kg cod kg vss day in the last step of adding glucose to the feed and to 0 043 kg cod kg vss day when mtbe was the only available carbon source for the microbial consortium since f m actually shows the amount of available substrate per unit of biomass mass it has a significant impact on sludge generation 4 thus the daily sludge generation values which depend on the growth and degradation of bacteria vary with the change in srt and f m 3 4 in the present study in the first half of the experiment daily sludge generation increased when srt decreased and f m increased then by increasing srt undegraded compounds accumulated and led to more bacterial death 26 and at the same time f m decreased which resulting in a significant drop in daily sludge generation reached 44 mg vss day and 24 mg vss day in the two final steps respectively daily sludge generation values indicated that the biomass accumulation within this system was low in either the presence or absence of glucose growth substrate biomass accumulation is one of the main drawbacks of biological systems that must be discharged and disposed in case of ex situ treatment methods and also increases the possibility of aquifer clogging in case of in situ bioremediation 8 67 recently wide research has been conducted on various methods to reduce biomass accumulation that change in operating condition especially increasing srt is one of the effective methods in this regard 67 it is worthy to note that due to the operating condition conducted in this study low daily sludge generation or biomass accumulation can be due to low f m ratio low qobs and high srt as the low f m ratio increases the death of microbial consortium the low qobs leads to reduced growth of microbial consortium as well as high srt increases the predator species in the microbial consortium 4 since variation of initial substrate concentration and operating condition can change the quality of the sludge the svi parameter was evaluated as an indicator for the sludge quality and settleability which the results are presented in fig 8 as can be seen svi values decreased during the experimental period from 125 ml mg to 86 ml mg based on microscopic observation different bacterial species included cocci bacilli spirillum and filamentous were in the source of the microbial consortium obtained from wastewater treatment plant which is in accordance with higher initial svi values at the beginning of the experimental period however bacterial staining test showed only the presence of cocci and bacilli species for the microbial consortium after aerobic cometabolism acclimatization period in the final step which is consistent with the lower svi values additionally it can be concluded that the system was in extended aeration mode due to high srt between 20 and 40 days low f m between 0 04 kg cod kg vss day to 0 20 kg cod kg vss day as well as high concentration of dissolved oxygen 4 mg l data not shown according to the study by amanatidou et al 4 svi values can reduce under extended aeration mode decreasing svi values during the experimental period indicated an increase in sludge settling velocity and sludge density consequently the rate of biofilm formation will increase and biofilm scouring will decrease in case of using for in situ bioremediation 18 38 therefore according to the approach of this research based on using microbial consortium for in situ bioremediation the studied microbial consortium by maintaining sludge quality and settleability high rate of biofilm formation and low scour in the aquifer had the ability to consume mtbe effectively in the presence of glucose growth substrate 4 conclusion in the present study the feasibility of aerobic cometabolism biodegradation of mtbe by the microbial consortium obtained municipal sewage sludge was investigated in the presence of glucose growth substrate for in situ bioremediation of mtbe contaminated groundwater for this purpose various criteria including mtbe removal efficiency microbial population and activity biomass growth and decay rate substrate removal rate excess sludge generation and sludge settling velocity was investigated due to achieving optimal growth and decay condition low possibility of bio clogging high potential for biofilm formation and high compatibility of acclimatized microbial consortium to the variations of environmental conditions and plume concentration in aquifer the results showed high activity of the microbial consortium even at the lowest glucose concentration as well as effective degradation and consumption of mtbe in addition the biomass growth rate and active mlvss gross mlvss ratio was very high and the biomass decay rate was very low these results indicated the microbial consortium ability to consume available substrate maintenance of bacterial cell growth and survival high activity of microbial consortium and low amount of cell debris due to low biomass decay rate the studied microbial consortium was also highly resistant to changes in environmental conditions or concentration of substrate in the aquifer that can be survived with high continuity during the bioremediation period also the amount of excess sludge generated for the studied system was very low which indicated that the biomass will not be generated excessively and the possibility of aquifer bio clogging will reduce additionally low biomass settling velocity showed high rate of biofilm formation and low biofilm scouring during in situ bioremediation therefore the studied microbial consortium and glucose growth substrate are strongly suggested for bioremediation which can prolong the lifetime of the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

13254,recovery of ammonia nh3 and phosphorous p from municipal wastewater is important to minimize the environmental impact of their discharge and to comply with the concept of circular economy technologies have been established to recover p in form of struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o for its use as a fertilizer nh3 is usually converted to molecular nitrogen and released to the atmosphere however nh3 recovery in form of nh3 h2o mixture is relevant for numerous applications such as manufacturing of cleaning agents sanitizers and liquid fertilizers membrane distillation md a process driven by the partial vapor pressure across a microporous hydrophobic membrane has demonstrated the potential for concentrating the non volatiles while at the same time recovering volatiles from a solution among various configurations of md vacuum and direct contact md dcmd have been extensively studied the current study compares the performance of dcmd and vacuum md vmd for simultaneous recovery of nh3 and p from wastewater in form of nh3 h2o mixture and struvite respectively the study finds that while both the configuration are equally effective to concentrate p the control over removal efficiency of nh3 in the two configurations becomes the bottleneck for struvite recovery under different ph conditions for wastewater with high ph vmd almost completely removes nh3 before reaching substantial p concentration thereby eliminates the possibility of struvite formation dcmd on other hand only partly removes nh3 while concentrating p therefore for struvite recovery from a high ph wastewater dcmd is better option for low ph wastewater vmd is preferred choice as it recovers nh3 more effectively than dcmd but still leaves ample nh3 in the wastewater for struvite formation keywords wastewater phosphorus ammonia direct contact membrane distillation vacuum membrane distillation 1 introduction nutrient recovery from wastewater is gaining significant interest to meet the goals of sustainable development and circular economy 1 2 nitrogen n and phosphorus p are two important nutrients present in wastewater p represents one of the minerals in high risk of depletion but is essential for the agricultural and industrial production thus its supply in adequate quantities is vital 3 currently the phosphate rocks are the most exploited source of phosphate however there are growing concerns about their sustainable availability in future 4 an estimate based on the current rate of consumption predicts that the phosphate rocks will be depleted by the end of this century 5 it has been estimated that p present in sewage if fully recovered can fulfill up to 20 of the global demand 6 thus p recovery from wastewater can contribute in maintaining sustainable supply of p in wastewater and other waste streams p is usually recovered chemically or biologically and is bound to a sludge phase that is subsequently removed from the water sludge can then be spread in the agricultural fields and thereby used as a fertilizer but this can be problematic due to contamination of sludge by heavy metals pathogens and toxic organic compounds 7 if sludge is incinerated phosphorus can be recovered from the ash but it is expensive and may not be sustainable solution 8 an alternative method is to recover and recycle phosphate directly from the wastewater currently the most practiced method for p recovery directly from the wastewater is its precipitation as struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o where p and total ammonia nitrogen tan present in the wastewater react with externally added mg salt 9 10 it has been shown in literature that p recovery increases by increasing the p concentration in wastewater 11 12 in wastewaters where the tan concentration is significantly higher than the stoichiometric ratio of n to p required for struvite formation the recovery of additional tan in form of nh3 can add more value to wastewater valorization currently nh3 is mainly produced through the haber bosch process which is energy intensive and consumes 1 2 of the total energy produced globally 13 moreover hydrogen required for haber bosch process comes from petroleum products and therefore the process generates co2 as a by product therefore nh3 recovery from wastewater offers a potentially less energy intensive and greener option to partly fulfill the global nh3 demand nh3 recovery in form of nh3 h2o mixture is relevant for numerous applications such as manufacturing of cleaning agents sanitizers and liquid fertilizers nh4oh is the primary active agent in various industrial and household products used for the cleaning and disinfection of nonporous surfaces 14 nh4oh also finds applications as ready to use liquid fertilizer or a raw material for manufacturing of fertilizers membrane distillation md is a relatively less explored membrane process that has recently gained significant attention 15 md concentrates the non volatiles substances from a solution while at the same time strips the volatiles such as nh3 16 17 the main advantages of md include production of a high quality permeate stream i e fresh water or in case of municipal wastewater an ammonia rich stream operation at low temperature and ambient pressure possibility to use low grade energy such as heat from thermophilic digestion low fouling issues and potential to achieve high solution concentrations that is important to maximize p recovery from wastewater 11 18 driving force to mass transport in md is the vapor pressure gradient mainly induced through temperature across a microporous hydrophobic membrane that retains liquid and non volatiles and allows the passage of vapor and gases only 19 traditionally md has been applied for desalination where numerous pilot scale installations have been reported 20 the current literature shows that the process is gaining interest for several other applications including treatment of industrial wastewaters 21 22 municipal wastewater 18 and resource recovery from various liquid streams 23 27 md can be operated in several configurations for instance the transport of the vapor and gas across the membrane can be further enhanced by applying vacuum on permeate side of the membrane vacuum md vmd ensuring a higher vapor pressure gradient for vmd the collected vapor is condensed outside of the membrane module by using a cooling media such as cold water or liquid nitrogen 15 28 29 in so called direct contact md dcmd configuration the vapor is condensed at the vapor liquid interface on the permeate side of the membrane by using a cold stream which is in direct contact with the membrane for a given feed temperature and hydrodynamic conditions the driving force to the vapor transport across the membrane in dcmd and vmd can be increased by decreasing the temperature of condensing stream and by lowering the degree of vacuum on permeate sides respectively however it is important to consider that high degree of vacuum on permeate side in vmd increases the electric energy input to the vacuum pump and the risk of pore wetting 30 for dcmd the condensation of the volatiles passing through the membrane can change the properties of the permeate stream ph composition etc that may affect the trans membrane driving force for the transport of certain volatile species dcmd and vmd have their own advantages and limitations dcmd is relatively simple and easy to build configuration and has been widely applied for separation of water from non volatiles 31 33 however it suffers from high temperature losses due to the heat conduction across the membrane vmd on the other hand is more preferred configuration for the removal of gases and organic volatiles from aqueous solutions faces lower conductive heat losses than dcmd that translates into lower specific thermal energy consumption 35 34 vmd however requires additional equipment such as vacuum pump and condenser and as stated above is more prone to pore wetting use of vmd for recovery of nh3 from wastewater has been well documented in literature 36 38 and it has been found very effective to reduce nh3 concentrations in wastewater for example wu et al 39 recovered more than 99 nh3 from high nh3 content wastewater through vmd applied in a pilot scale experiment in another study el bourawi et al 40 studied the effect of operating variables including temperature vacuum pressure and ph of the wastewater on nh3 recovery efficiency the author reported that up to 90 nh3 can be recovered by tuning the operative conditions dcmd has also been applied to recover nh3 from wastewater however instead of water typically an aqueous acidic solution is used on the permeate side 41 for numerous applications nh3 water mixture instead of nh3 dissolved in an acidic solution is more desirable 42 nonetheless the focus of the studies reported in the literature is to maximize the removal of nh3 from wastewater without considering the p recovery in form of struvite that requires concentration of p and only partial removal of nh3 thus the current literature does not answer the question which of the two configurations is better for simultaneous recovery of struvite and nh3 water mixture from the wastewaters with different ph the current study compares the performance of dcmd and vmd for simultaneous recovery of nh3 and p from wastewater in form of nh3 h2o mixture and struvite respectively the focus is to find better configuration for nh3 recovery under different ph conditions without compromising the formation of struvite nh3 is recovered continuously during the experiment whereas struvite is formed at the end of experiment by adding mgcl2 6h2o into the retentate where p is concentrated the performance of the two configurations has been compared at different operating temperatures and by using synthetic nh4cl solution as well as real wastewater digester centrate 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater used experiments have been carried out by using nh4cl solution containing nh3 only as well as digester centrate from aaby wastewater treatment plant in aarhus denmark that contains nh3 as well as p today the treatment plant recovers p in form of struvite from the digester centrate but further concentration of the digester centrate can improve p recovery as observed in the previous studies 18 43 p concentration was measured in terms of orthophosphate o p according to the procedure given in danish standards 44 all analysis were performed in triplicates ph of the wastewaters was measured using a mettler toledo seven multi with a ph electrode blueline 17 si analytics tan concentration was measured by using the berthelot method where salicylate was used as a substitute for phenol 45 46 the main properties of aqueous nh4cl solution and digester centrate applied in the study have been provided in table 1 2 2 md experiments dcmd and vmd have been carried out using a lab scale setup described in details elsewhere 47 hollow fiber membrane modules used for all the experiments have been prepared using membranes accurel pp s6 2 from membrana gmbh each hollow fiber has outer and inner diameters of 2 7 and 1 8 mm respectively the porosity of the membranes was 73 with a pmi pore size of 0 2 μm the same membrane module with active surface area of 0 055 m2 was used for dcmd and vmd experiments were carried out at feed temperatures of 45 55 and 75 c with a flowrate of 20 l h for both dcmd and vmd permeate temperature for dcmd was set at 20 c for all the tests however it drifted to 21 28 and 40 c for feed temperatures of 45 55 and 75 c respectively the vacuum pressure was set to around 90 mbar in vmd experiments in all the experiments the initial feed volume was 1 1 l while the permeate volume for dcmd was 0 5 l in order to recover p in form of struvite magnesium was added in the molar ratio of 1 3 1 with respect to o p as done in previous studies 18 48 2 3 crystal characterization the crystals were characterized in terms of crystallographic structure by using x ray diffraction xrd analysis the purity of the precipitate was analyzed with inductively coupled plasma icp for this purpose 50 mg of the precipitate was dissolved in 5 ml 7 m hno3 for al cd cr cu fe ni pb zn and ca analysis the samples were diluted 10 times whereas for mg and p analysis the samples were diluted 1000 times the detection limit of icp for these metals is between 0 05 and 0 2 mg l hg was measured with icp ms with 1000 times dilution for hg the detection limit is 0 002 mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 water flux through the membrane a direct contact membrane distillation water flux through the membrane was measured for nh4cl solution and the digester centrate at different feed temperatures and has been shown in fig 1 there was no significant difference in water fluxes for the two types of feed and the fluxes remained stable when the recovery factor ratio of total volume recovered to the initial volume of the solution was increased the water flux increased almost two and four times when feed temperature was increased from 45 c to 60 c and from 45 c to 75 c respectively the observed increase represents an exponential dependence upon the feed temperature see fig a5 a in appendix a which is in line with the literature 49 50 the driving force in md is the vapor pressure difference across the membrane that increases exponentially with temperature therefore the flux exhibits exponential dependence upon feed temperature a stable flux with the recovery factor demonstrates that the degree of possible pore wetting or fouling if any were too low to affect the flux during the process the increase in solid content of the digester centrate does not show any visible effect on the flux in accordance with the literature where decline in flux is only observed at very high concentrations of dissolved solids 200 g l 51 52 b vacuum membrane distillation water flux through the membrane for nh4cl solution and the digester centrate has been shown in fig 2 similar to dcmd nh4cl solution and digester centrate showed the similar water flux that remained stable with recovery factor indicating that the membrane did not undergo possible pore wetting or fouling to the extent where it starts affecting the flux it has been documented in literature that vmd exhibits higher flux than dcmd due to less thermal polarization 53 similar fluxes observed for vmd and dcmd in current study are attributed to relatively lower flux achieved in vmd the flux in vmd is a linear function of applied degree of vacuum on permeate side of the membrane 54 however it has been reported in literature that the specific electric energy consumption increases by almost 50 when pressure on vacuum side is decreased from 100 mbar to 40 mbar 55 low vacuum pressure on permeate side also increases the chances of pore wetting especially for the solutions such as the digester centrate that can also contain surfactants which lower its surface tension 30 therefore the applied vacuum in current study was set at 90 mbar that is more realistic for large scale applications due to the aforementioned reasons for many other studies reported in literature on the other hand the vacuum is as low as 4 40 mbar 49 56 on a study carried out by using the same membranes as applied in the current study criscuoli et al 57 demonstrated that the vmd flux decreased by almost 30 when applied vacuum is lowered from 10 to 40 mbar thus the flux values for vmd reported in literature are higher than those in the current study due to higher degree of vacuum applied in state of the art studies the low degree of vacuum applied in current study brings the vmd flux close to dcmd 3 2 ammonia transport a vacuum membrane distillation tan concentration in retentate of vmd has been measured as function of water recovery factor for the nh4cl solution and the digester centrate fig 3 tan concentration in both the retentates drops with recovery factor overall decrease for retentate of nh4cl solution however was considerably higher final tan concentration 20 ppm than that of digester centrate and declined exponentially before leveling off at high recovery factors 50 the decrease in concentration also showed some temperature dependence for digester centrate the largest decrease in tan concentration was observed at 45 c where the concentration dropped from 1050 ppm to 400 ppm reflecting a better separation of nh3 at 45 c than 60 and 75 c experiments carried out at 60 and 75 c exhibited relatively smaller decrease in tan concentration i e to 500 ppm and 600 ppm at recovery factor of 80 but the difference in concentration at these two temperatures was of the size of measurement error see the size of standard deviation the observed trend of tan concentrations in retentate of nh4cl solution and digester centrate can be explained by the henry s law which states that partial vapor pressure of nh3 is proportional to its concentration in the retentate 58 1 p nh 3 f nh 3 c w k h where f nh3 c w and k h represent the fraction of un ionized ammonia tan concentration mol m3 and henry s law constant respectively f nh3 is a function of ph and temperature of the retentate and can be calculated by using the following correlation 2 f nh 3 1 1 10 pka 0 0324 298 t 0 014 p t ph variations in speciation of tan and partial vapor pressure of nh3 with temperature and recovery factor for nh4cl solution and digester centrate have been shown in table 2 as evident from the table for both the feed solutions concentrations of both speciation of tan in the retentate decrease with recovery factor the partial vapor pressure of nh3 and therefore the driving force to its transport across the membrane also follows the same trend and decreases as the experiment proceeds for nh4cl solution tan is mainly present in form of nh3 at all the temperatures at any time during the experiment due to its high ph however ratio of nh3 to nh4 concentration reduces with recovery factor because of the corresponding decrease in ph of the retentate see table a1 in appendix a tan in digester centrate is mainly present in form of ionized ammonia nh4 due to its relatively low ph for digester centrate the decrease in vapor pressure with experimental time can be attributed mainly to the reduction in tan concentration in the retentate as the corresponding ph does not change significantly see table a1 in case of nh4cl solution the decrease in vapor pressure can be attributed both to the reduction in nh3 concentration and ph of the retentate as shown in the table a1 the leveling off of the concentration observed for nh4cl solution at recovery factors 50 can be attributed to very low tan concentrations 40 ppm left in the solution that lowers partial pressure table 2 of nh3 and therefore driving force to its transport relatively large decrease in tan concentration at 45 c compared to 60 and 75 c for both the solutions is attributed to different equilibrium compositions of nh3 h2o mixture at different temperatures it is important to note that although saturated vapor pressure of water and nh3 increases with temperature yet above temperature of approx 42 c the vapor pressure of water increases more steeply and the difference between vapor pressure of nh3 and water starts diverging immensely with further increase in temperature 59 as a result nh3 h2o mixture obtained by operating the process at 45 c is richer in nh3 than that for 60 and 75 c this is evident from fig a1 appendix a where the ratio of partial vapor pressure of nh3 to h2o has been illustrated at different temperatures it is evident from the figure that for any feed composition the ratio of nh3 h2o partial vapor pressure is the highest at 45 c and the lowest at 75 c indicating better selective removal of nh3 at low temperatures in fact the ratio of nh3 to h2o flux passing through the membrane fig a2 in appendix a at 45 and 75 c is 1 25 for digester centrate and 1 2 for nh4cl solution indicating that the vapor passing through the membrane at 45 c is richer in nh3 content thus leaving behind the retentate lean in nh3 content larger decrease in tan concentration in nh4cl solution compared to digester centrate can be attributed to its relatively higher ph see table a1 which results into higher partial vapor pressure table 2 and therefore driving force across the membrane as stated in eq 1 partial pressure of nh3 is dependent upon free nh3 fraction in the solution which is a function of ph and temperature of the solution as evident from table 2 at low recovery factors 10 the partial vapor pressure of nh3 in nh4cl solution is significantly higher than that of the digester centrate which drives more nh3 across the membrane leaving behind low tan concentrations in the retentate the ratio of partial vapor pressure of nh3 for nh4cl solution and digester centrate has been plotted at different temperatures in fig a3 in appendix a the figure clearly indicates that at recovery factors 20 partial vapor pressure of nh3 in nh4cl solution is significantly higher than that of the wastewater at any given temperature leading to more transport of nh3 from feed to the permeate and therefore its concentration in the retentate drops abruptly even at the low recovery factors when recovery factor exceeds 30 tan concentration in retentate of nh4cl solution drops almost to zero see fig 3 thus diminishing the driving force to further transport of nh3 across the membrane b direct contact membrane distillation tan concentrations in retentate of nh4cl solution and digester centrate as function of water recovery factor for dcmd are shown in fig 4 compared to vmd drop in tan concentration in retentate of digester centrate and nh4cl solution with recovery factor is very modest for nh4cl solutions relatively larger max final concentration approximately 300 ppm drop in concentration was observed however the final concertation in retentate remained much higher than what was achieved for vmd 20 ppm contrary to vmd dcmd operated at 45 c yielded the minimum drop in tan concentration in retentate in fact for digester centrate substantial drop a drop from 1000 ppm to 800 ppm in tan concentration was observed only at higher temperatures 60 and 75 c for nh4cl solution the drop in concentration exceeded 75 at high temperatures tan concentrations in permeates of dcmd have been shown in fig 5 for digester centrate the tan concentration increases steadily at all the temperatures before reaching a plateau at high recovery factors 40 also a relatively higher tan concentration was observed in the permeate obtained at 75 c which agrees well with the corresponding decrease of tan concentration in the retentate fig 4 however for the permeates of nh4cl solution although the largest decrease in tan concentration in retentate was observed at 75 c high tan concentration in permeate was observed for experiment carried out at 45 and 60 c this is due to the different temperature dependence of the partial vapor pressures and therefore flux of water and nh3 through the membrane as explained in section 3 2 a the ratio of average water to nh3 flux passing through the membrane is around 350 at operating temperature of 45 c and increases to 700 at the operating temperature of 75 c thus the permeate passing through the membrane at 75 c is lean in nh3 concentration that brings down the overall nh3 concentration on permeate side nh3 flux through the membrane for dcmd operating at nh4cl solution and digester centrate has been shown in fig 6 a and it is evident from the figure that nh3 flux for nh4cl solution is higher than digester centrate at all the temperatures investigated at relatively low recovery factors 20 30 for instance the flux observed for nh4cl solution at operative temperature of 75 c and 5 recovery factor is 3 times higher than that of the digester centrate however as the recovery factor increases beyond 30 the nh3 flux for nh4cl solution drops below that of the digester centrate similar trends are observed for the other operating temperatures where nh3 flux for nh4cl solution is significantly higher than digester centrate at low recovery factors and drops below that of the digester centrate at high recovery factors the observed trend is attributed to different initial tan concentrations and ph values of the two solutions which affect the concentration of unionized nh3 table 3 across the membrane and therefore its partial vapor pressure that acts as the driving force to nh3 transport across the membrane the ratio of the partial vapor pressure gradients of nh3 for nh4cl solution and digester centrate as function of water recovery factor at different temperature has been shown in fig 6 b it is clear form figure that the ratio of the partial vapor pressure decreases with recovery factor in accordance with the trend observed for the ratio of the flux different behavior of tan concentrations in retentate of vmd and dcmd can be attributed to different conditions on permeate side of the membrane side in dcmd the nh3 h2o mixture passing through the membrane is condensed by the cold water stream on permeate side of the membrane as can be seen in table 3 the transport of nh3 resulted in an increase of ph of the permeate and a decrease of ph in the retentate thus the partial pressure difference of nh3 and therefore driving force to its transport across the membrane for dcmd is expected to be lower than vmd where nh3 is continuously removed from the permeate side by vacuum the driving force for dcmd is expected to be small at low temperatures where partial pressure of nh3 in retentate is low and should increase with increase in feed temperature this is evident from the ratio of nh3 to water flux nh3 h20 flux passing through the membrane fig a4 in appendix a which shows that nh3 h20 flux ratio was the lowest at 45 c and the highest at 75 c for digester centrate thus the highest tan concentration in permeate of digester centrate treated at 75 c through dcmd is due to the higher flux of nh3 compared to water passing through the membrane at 75 c 3 3 p recovery the concentration of o p in the retentate was continuously followed during all the experiments and it was found to be increasing with recovery factor fig 7 in all the samples as md completely rejects all non volatiles including p the final concentrations achieved in all the tests varied slightly due to different final concentration factors or recovery factors achieved in various tests mg salt was added at the end of each experiment after cooling the retentate to room temperature to precipitate p and a fraction of tan as struvite as shown in fig 7 addition of mg to the retentate drastically brings the dissolved p concentrations down due to the formation and settling of struvite the final concentration after precipitation of struvite in retentate appears to be slightly dependent upon temperature and marginally decreases with decrease in operating temperature see the encircled values this observation is not directly linked with the temperature and instead can be attributed to relatively higher final ph of the retentate obtained at low temperatures table a1 it has been shown in several studies that precipitation of struvite is favored by increase in ph up to around 9 5 60 for instance buhiyan et al have stated that solubility of struvite increases by increasing the ph of feed solution from 7 to 8 5 61 similarly liu et al showed that solubility of struvite gradually reduces by increasing the ph and thus promoting the crystallization process 62 thus the maximum p removal 93 achieved at low temperatures in current study can be attributed to the corresponding high ph of the retentate tan balance for dcmd and vmd has been shown in fig 8 the figure indicates that in all the cases major fraction of tan ends up in permeate also at any temperature the amount of nh3 transferred into the permeate is higher for vmd than dcmd for dcmd a significant fraction 10 30 of tan is present in retentate even after formation of struvite and only a small fraction 5 7 is consumed in struvite formation thus remaining tan in the retentate is theoretically sufficient to produce up to 5 times additional struvite if enough p were present in the wastewater thus there is clear potential to further recover nh3 without compromising the formation of struvite from retentate of dcmd for vmd on the other hand the fraction of tan left in retentate after formation of struvite is very small around 4 of the total tan thus the potential to recover further nh3 is very limited in terms of struvite formation the left over tan in vmd is theoretically sufficient to produce up to 80 additional struvite if the corresponding additional p were available in the wastewater thus it can be concluded that for digester centrate considered in the current study vmd will be more suitable candidate for nh3 removal and concentration of p for struvite formation on the other hand for the cases where wastewater has high ph such as nh4cl solution discussed in current study vmd removes almost entire nh3 from wastewater before reaching any substantial concentration of p thus for high ph wastewater dcmd seems more suitable option as it can bring the tan concentration lower without completely removing it while at the same time increasing p concentration in the solution as another option ph of the wastewater can be adjusted to a lower value for the cases where vmd is expected to remove nh3 in excess to what is required for struvite formation however clearly this will demand the use of more chemicals that is not appreciated in designing of wastewater treatment plants of the future to analyze the structure of the obtained crystals four crystal samples at two different temperatures i e 45 and 75 c produced by dcmd and vmd were analyzed by xrd the xrd spectra shows a crystalline structure similar to a reference spectrum of struvite for all the tested samples as illustrated in fig 9 thus it was confirmed that the obtained crystalline product is struvite icp analysis of the precipitate confirms that it is struvite that was recovered table 4 the theoretical content of mg and p in struvite is 99 0 and 126 2 mg g struvite this means that the purity of the precipitate is 92 4 96 9 76 1 94 3 for dcmd 45 c dcmd 75 c vmd 45 c and vmd 75 c respectively even though the purity for vmd 45 was low yet small ionic impurities were observed given the analyzed ions where only ca as 1 01 mg g were observed the content of mg and p in this sample is lower compared to the other samples and therefore it is most likely that organic material has been incorporated into the sample possibly through adsorption in general there were low concentrations of other ions mainly ca incorporated into the crystals or co precipitated with struvite 4 conclusions direct contact and vacuum membrane distillation have been successfully applied for simultaneously recovery of nh3 and p in form of nh3 h2o mixture and struvite respectively from the wastewater irrespective of ph of the wastewater vmd is more efficient for nh3 recovery whereas the efficiency of dcmd is greatly limited due to increase in ph and temperature of the permeate stream for the wastewater with high ph 10 9 vmd eliminates nh3 almost completely before achieving significant p concentration in the wastewater thus either efficiency of p removal is compromised p recovery is proportional to its concentration in the solution or precipitation of p in form of struvite does not remain possible however for low ph 7 4 wastewater vmd was clearly a better option as it brought nh3 concentrations close to the optimum level for simultaneous recovery of nh3 and struvite it was also concluded that for wastewater with low ph operating vmd at low temperature 45 c is more effective in obtaining high concentration of nh3 h2o permeate and in recovering more p from the wastewater declaration of competing

13254,recovery of ammonia nh3 and phosphorous p from municipal wastewater is important to minimize the environmental impact of their discharge and to comply with the concept of circular economy technologies have been established to recover p in form of struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o for its use as a fertilizer nh3 is usually converted to molecular nitrogen and released to the atmosphere however nh3 recovery in form of nh3 h2o mixture is relevant for numerous applications such as manufacturing of cleaning agents sanitizers and liquid fertilizers membrane distillation md a process driven by the partial vapor pressure across a microporous hydrophobic membrane has demonstrated the potential for concentrating the non volatiles while at the same time recovering volatiles from a solution among various configurations of md vacuum and direct contact md dcmd have been extensively studied the current study compares the performance of dcmd and vacuum md vmd for simultaneous recovery of nh3 and p from wastewater in form of nh3 h2o mixture and struvite respectively the study finds that while both the configuration are equally effective to concentrate p the control over removal efficiency of nh3 in the two configurations becomes the bottleneck for struvite recovery under different ph conditions for wastewater with high ph vmd almost completely removes nh3 before reaching substantial p concentration thereby eliminates the possibility of struvite formation dcmd on other hand only partly removes nh3 while concentrating p therefore for struvite recovery from a high ph wastewater dcmd is better option for low ph wastewater vmd is preferred choice as it recovers nh3 more effectively than dcmd but still leaves ample nh3 in the wastewater for struvite formation keywords wastewater phosphorus ammonia direct contact membrane distillation vacuum membrane distillation 1 introduction nutrient recovery from wastewater is gaining significant interest to meet the goals of sustainable development and circular economy 1 2 nitrogen n and phosphorus p are two important nutrients present in wastewater p represents one of the minerals in high risk of depletion but is essential for the agricultural and industrial production thus its supply in adequate quantities is vital 3 currently the phosphate rocks are the most exploited source of phosphate however there are growing concerns about their sustainable availability in future 4 an estimate based on the current rate of consumption predicts that the phosphate rocks will be depleted by the end of this century 5 it has been estimated that p present in sewage if fully recovered can fulfill up to 20 of the global demand 6 thus p recovery from wastewater can contribute in maintaining sustainable supply of p in wastewater and other waste streams p is usually recovered chemically or biologically and is bound to a sludge phase that is subsequently removed from the water sludge can then be spread in the agricultural fields and thereby used as a fertilizer but this can be problematic due to contamination of sludge by heavy metals pathogens and toxic organic compounds 7 if sludge is incinerated phosphorus can be recovered from the ash but it is expensive and may not be sustainable solution 8 an alternative method is to recover and recycle phosphate directly from the wastewater currently the most practiced method for p recovery directly from the wastewater is its precipitation as struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o where p and total ammonia nitrogen tan present in the wastewater react with externally added mg salt 9 10 it has been shown in literature that p recovery increases by increasing the p concentration in wastewater 11 12 in wastewaters where the tan concentration is significantly higher than the stoichiometric ratio of n to p required for struvite formation the recovery of additional tan in form of nh3 can add more value to wastewater valorization currently nh3 is mainly produced through the haber bosch process which is energy intensive and consumes 1 2 of the total energy produced globally 13 moreover hydrogen required for haber bosch process comes from petroleum products and therefore the process generates co2 as a by product therefore nh3 recovery from wastewater offers a potentially less energy intensive and greener option to partly fulfill the global nh3 demand nh3 recovery in form of nh3 h2o mixture is relevant for numerous applications such as manufacturing of cleaning agents sanitizers and liquid fertilizers nh4oh is the primary active agent in various industrial and household products used for the cleaning and disinfection of nonporous surfaces 14 nh4oh also finds applications as ready to use liquid fertilizer or a raw material for manufacturing of fertilizers membrane distillation md is a relatively less explored membrane process that has recently gained significant attention 15 md concentrates the non volatiles substances from a solution while at the same time strips the volatiles such as nh3 16 17 the main advantages of md include production of a high quality permeate stream i e fresh water or in case of municipal wastewater an ammonia rich stream operation at low temperature and ambient pressure possibility to use low grade energy such as heat from thermophilic digestion low fouling issues and potential to achieve high solution concentrations that is important to maximize p recovery from wastewater 11 18 driving force to mass transport in md is the vapor pressure gradient mainly induced through temperature across a microporous hydrophobic membrane that retains liquid and non volatiles and allows the passage of vapor and gases only 19 traditionally md has been applied for desalination where numerous pilot scale installations have been reported 20 the current literature shows that the process is gaining interest for several other applications including treatment of industrial wastewaters 21 22 municipal wastewater 18 and resource recovery from various liquid streams 23 27 md can be operated in several configurations for instance the transport of the vapor and gas across the membrane can be further enhanced by applying vacuum on permeate side of the membrane vacuum md vmd ensuring a higher vapor pressure gradient for vmd the collected vapor is condensed outside of the membrane module by using a cooling media such as cold water or liquid nitrogen 15 28 29 in so called direct contact md dcmd configuration the vapor is condensed at the vapor liquid interface on the permeate side of the membrane by using a cold stream which is in direct contact with the membrane for a given feed temperature and hydrodynamic conditions the driving force to the vapor transport across the membrane in dcmd and vmd can be increased by decreasing the temperature of condensing stream and by lowering the degree of vacuum on permeate sides respectively however it is important to consider that high degree of vacuum on permeate side in vmd increases the electric energy input to the vacuum pump and the risk of pore wetting 30 for dcmd the condensation of the volatiles passing through the membrane can change the properties of the permeate stream ph composition etc that may affect the trans membrane driving force for the transport of certain volatile species dcmd and vmd have their own advantages and limitations dcmd is relatively simple and easy to build configuration and has been widely applied for separation of water from non volatiles 31 33 however it suffers from high temperature losses due to the heat conduction across the membrane vmd on the other hand is more preferred configuration for the removal of gases and organic volatiles from aqueous solutions faces lower conductive heat losses than dcmd that translates into lower specific thermal energy consumption 35 34 vmd however requires additional equipment such as vacuum pump and condenser and as stated above is more prone to pore wetting use of vmd for recovery of nh3 from wastewater has been well documented in literature 36 38 and it has been found very effective to reduce nh3 concentrations in wastewater for example wu et al 39 recovered more than 99 nh3 from high nh3 content wastewater through vmd applied in a pilot scale experiment in another study el bourawi et al 40 studied the effect of operating variables including temperature vacuum pressure and ph of the wastewater on nh3 recovery efficiency the author reported that up to 90 nh3 can be recovered by tuning the operative conditions dcmd has also been applied to recover nh3 from wastewater however instead of water typically an aqueous acidic solution is used on the permeate side 41 for numerous applications nh3 water mixture instead of nh3 dissolved in an acidic solution is more desirable 42 nonetheless the focus of the studies reported in the literature is to maximize the removal of nh3 from wastewater without considering the p recovery in form of struvite that requires concentration of p and only partial removal of nh3 thus the current literature does not answer the question which of the two configurations is better for simultaneous recovery of struvite and nh3 water mixture from the wastewaters with different ph the current study compares the performance of dcmd and vmd for simultaneous recovery of nh3 and p from wastewater in form of nh3 h2o mixture and struvite respectively the focus is to find better configuration for nh3 recovery under different ph conditions without compromising the formation of struvite nh3 is recovered continuously during the experiment whereas struvite is formed at the end of experiment by adding mgcl2 6h2o into the retentate where p is concentrated the performance of the two configurations has been compared at different operating temperatures and by using synthetic nh4cl solution as well as real wastewater digester centrate 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater used experiments have been carried out by using nh4cl solution containing nh3 only as well as digester centrate from aaby wastewater treatment plant in aarhus denmark that contains nh3 as well as p today the treatment plant recovers p in form of struvite from the digester centrate but further concentration of the digester centrate can improve p recovery as observed in the previous studies 18 43 p concentration was measured in terms of orthophosphate o p according to the procedure given in danish standards 44 all analysis were performed in triplicates ph of the wastewaters was measured using a mettler toledo seven multi with a ph electrode blueline 17 si analytics tan concentration was measured by using the berthelot method where salicylate was used as a substitute for phenol 45 46 the main properties of aqueous nh4cl solution and digester centrate applied in the study have been provided in table 1 2 2 md experiments dcmd and vmd have been carried out using a lab scale setup described in details elsewhere 47 hollow fiber membrane modules used for all the experiments have been prepared using membranes accurel pp s6 2 from membrana gmbh each hollow fiber has outer and inner diameters of 2 7 and 1 8 mm respectively the porosity of the membranes was 73 with a pmi pore size of 0 2 μm the same membrane module with active surface area of 0 055 m2 was used for dcmd and vmd experiments were carried out at feed temperatures of 45 55 and 75 c with a flowrate of 20 l h for both dcmd and vmd permeate temperature for dcmd was set at 20 c for all the tests however it drifted to 21 28 and 40 c for feed temperatures of 45 55 and 75 c respectively the vacuum pressure was set to around 90 mbar in vmd experiments in all the experiments the initial feed volume was 1 1 l while the permeate volume for dcmd was 0 5 l in order to recover p in form of struvite magnesium was added in the molar ratio of 1 3 1 with respect to o p as done in previous studies 18 48 2 3 crystal characterization the crystals were characterized in terms of crystallographic structure by using x ray diffraction xrd analysis the purity of the precipitate was analyzed with inductively coupled plasma icp for this purpose 50 mg of the precipitate was dissolved in 5 ml 7 m hno3 for al cd cr cu fe ni pb zn and ca analysis the samples were diluted 10 times whereas for mg and p analysis the samples were diluted 1000 times the detection limit of icp for these metals is between 0 05 and 0 2 mg l hg was measured with icp ms with 1000 times dilution for hg the detection limit is 0 002 mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 water flux through the membrane a direct contact membrane distillation water flux through the membrane was measured for nh4cl solution and the digester centrate at different feed temperatures and has been shown in fig 1 there was no significant difference in water fluxes for the two types of feed and the fluxes remained stable when the recovery factor ratio of total volume recovered to the initial volume of the solution was increased the water flux increased almost two and four times when feed temperature was increased from 45 c to 60 c and from 45 c to 75 c respectively the observed increase represents an exponential dependence upon the feed temperature see fig a5 a in appendix a which is in line with the literature 49 50 the driving force in md is the vapor pressure difference across the membrane that increases exponentially with temperature therefore the flux exhibits exponential dependence upon feed temperature a stable flux with the recovery factor demonstrates that the degree of possible pore wetting or fouling if any were too low to affect the flux during the process the increase in solid content of the digester centrate does not show any visible effect on the flux in accordance with the literature where decline in flux is only observed at very high concentrations of dissolved solids 200 g l 51 52 b vacuum membrane distillation water flux through the membrane for nh4cl solution and the digester centrate has been shown in fig 2 similar to dcmd nh4cl solution and digester centrate showed the similar water flux that remained stable with recovery factor indicating that the membrane did not undergo possible pore wetting or fouling to the extent where it starts affecting the flux it has been documented in literature that vmd exhibits higher flux than dcmd due to less thermal polarization 53 similar fluxes observed for vmd and dcmd in current study are attributed to relatively lower flux achieved in vmd the flux in vmd is a linear function of applied degree of vacuum on permeate side of the membrane 54 however it has been reported in literature that the specific electric energy consumption increases by almost 50 when pressure on vacuum side is decreased from 100 mbar to 40 mbar 55 low vacuum pressure on permeate side also increases the chances of pore wetting especially for the solutions such as the digester centrate that can also contain surfactants which lower its surface tension 30 therefore the applied vacuum in current study was set at 90 mbar that is more realistic for large scale applications due to the aforementioned reasons for many other studies reported in literature on the other hand the vacuum is as low as 4 40 mbar 49 56 on a study carried out by using the same membranes as applied in the current study criscuoli et al 57 demonstrated that the vmd flux decreased by almost 30 when applied vacuum is lowered from 10 to 40 mbar thus the flux values for vmd reported in literature are higher than those in the current study due to higher degree of vacuum applied in state of the art studies the low degree of vacuum applied in current study brings the vmd flux close to dcmd 3 2 ammonia transport a vacuum membrane distillation tan concentration in retentate of vmd has been measured as function of water recovery factor for the nh4cl solution and the digester centrate fig 3 tan concentration in both the retentates drops with recovery factor overall decrease for retentate of nh4cl solution however was considerably higher final tan concentration 20 ppm than that of digester centrate and declined exponentially before leveling off at high recovery factors 50 the decrease in concentration also showed some temperature dependence for digester centrate the largest decrease in tan concentration was observed at 45 c where the concentration dropped from 1050 ppm to 400 ppm reflecting a better separation of nh3 at 45 c than 60 and 75 c experiments carried out at 60 and 75 c exhibited relatively smaller decrease in tan concentration i e to 500 ppm and 600 ppm at recovery factor of 80 but the difference in concentration at these two temperatures was of the size of measurement error see the size of standard deviation the observed trend of tan concentrations in retentate of nh4cl solution and digester centrate can be explained by the henry s law which states that partial vapor pressure of nh3 is proportional to its concentration in the retentate 58 1 p nh 3 f nh 3 c w k h where f nh3 c w and k h represent the fraction of un ionized ammonia tan concentration mol m3 and henry s law constant respectively f nh3 is a function of ph and temperature of the retentate and can be calculated by using the following correlation 2 f nh 3 1 1 10 pka 0 0324 298 t 0 014 p t ph variations in speciation of tan and partial vapor pressure of nh3 with temperature and recovery factor for nh4cl solution and digester centrate have been shown in table 2 as evident from the table for both the feed solutions concentrations of both speciation of tan in the retentate decrease with recovery factor the partial vapor pressure of nh3 and therefore the driving force to its transport across the membrane also follows the same trend and decreases as the experiment proceeds for nh4cl solution tan is mainly present in form of nh3 at all the temperatures at any time during the experiment due to its high ph however ratio of nh3 to nh4 concentration reduces with recovery factor because of the corresponding decrease in ph of the retentate see table a1 in appendix a tan in digester centrate is mainly present in form of ionized ammonia nh4 due to its relatively low ph for digester centrate the decrease in vapor pressure with experimental time can be attributed mainly to the reduction in tan concentration in the retentate as the corresponding ph does not change significantly see table a1 in case of nh4cl solution the decrease in vapor pressure can be attributed both to the reduction in nh3 concentration and ph of the retentate as shown in the table a1 the leveling off of the concentration observed for nh4cl solution at recovery factors 50 can be attributed to very low tan concentrations 40 ppm left in the solution that lowers partial pressure table 2 of nh3 and therefore driving force to its transport relatively large decrease in tan concentration at 45 c compared to 60 and 75 c for both the solutions is attributed to different equilibrium compositions of nh3 h2o mixture at different temperatures it is important to note that although saturated vapor pressure of water and nh3 increases with temperature yet above temperature of approx 42 c the vapor pressure of water increases more steeply and the difference between vapor pressure of nh3 and water starts diverging immensely with further increase in temperature 59 as a result nh3 h2o mixture obtained by operating the process at 45 c is richer in nh3 than that for 60 and 75 c this is evident from fig a1 appendix a where the ratio of partial vapor pressure of nh3 to h2o has been illustrated at different temperatures it is evident from the figure that for any feed composition the ratio of nh3 h2o partial vapor pressure is the highest at 45 c and the lowest at 75 c indicating better selective removal of nh3 at low temperatures in fact the ratio of nh3 to h2o flux passing through the membrane fig a2 in appendix a at 45 and 75 c is 1 25 for digester centrate and 1 2 for nh4cl solution indicating that the vapor passing through the membrane at 45 c is richer in nh3 content thus leaving behind the retentate lean in nh3 content larger decrease in tan concentration in nh4cl solution compared to digester centrate can be attributed to its relatively higher ph see table a1 which results into higher partial vapor pressure table 2 and therefore driving force across the membrane as stated in eq 1 partial pressure of nh3 is dependent upon free nh3 fraction in the solution which is a function of ph and temperature of the solution as evident from table 2 at low recovery factors 10 the partial vapor pressure of nh3 in nh4cl solution is significantly higher than that of the digester centrate which drives more nh3 across the membrane leaving behind low tan concentrations in the retentate the ratio of partial vapor pressure of nh3 for nh4cl solution and digester centrate has been plotted at different temperatures in fig a3 in appendix a the figure clearly indicates that at recovery factors 20 partial vapor pressure of nh3 in nh4cl solution is significantly higher than that of the wastewater at any given temperature leading to more transport of nh3 from feed to the permeate and therefore its concentration in the retentate drops abruptly even at the low recovery factors when recovery factor exceeds 30 tan concentration in retentate of nh4cl solution drops almost to zero see fig 3 thus diminishing the driving force to further transport of nh3 across the membrane b direct contact membrane distillation tan concentrations in retentate of nh4cl solution and digester centrate as function of water recovery factor for dcmd are shown in fig 4 compared to vmd drop in tan concentration in retentate of digester centrate and nh4cl solution with recovery factor is very modest for nh4cl solutions relatively larger max final concentration approximately 300 ppm drop in concentration was observed however the final concertation in retentate remained much higher than what was achieved for vmd 20 ppm contrary to vmd dcmd operated at 45 c yielded the minimum drop in tan concentration in retentate in fact for digester centrate substantial drop a drop from 1000 ppm to 800 ppm in tan concentration was observed only at higher temperatures 60 and 75 c for nh4cl solution the drop in concentration exceeded 75 at high temperatures tan concentrations in permeates of dcmd have been shown in fig 5 for digester centrate the tan concentration increases steadily at all the temperatures before reaching a plateau at high recovery factors 40 also a relatively higher tan concentration was observed in the permeate obtained at 75 c which agrees well with the corresponding decrease of tan concentration in the retentate fig 4 however for the permeates of nh4cl solution although the largest decrease in tan concentration in retentate was observed at 75 c high tan concentration in permeate was observed for experiment carried out at 45 and 60 c this is due to the different temperature dependence of the partial vapor pressures and therefore flux of water and nh3 through the membrane as explained in section 3 2 a the ratio of average water to nh3 flux passing through the membrane is around 350 at operating temperature of 45 c and increases to 700 at the operating temperature of 75 c thus the permeate passing through the membrane at 75 c is lean in nh3 concentration that brings down the overall nh3 concentration on permeate side nh3 flux through the membrane for dcmd operating at nh4cl solution and digester centrate has been shown in fig 6 a and it is evident from the figure that nh3 flux for nh4cl solution is higher than digester centrate at all the temperatures investigated at relatively low recovery factors 20 30 for instance the flux observed for nh4cl solution at operative temperature of 75 c and 5 recovery factor is 3 times higher than that of the digester centrate however as the recovery factor increases beyond 30 the nh3 flux for nh4cl solution drops below that of the digester centrate similar trends are observed for the other operating temperatures where nh3 flux for nh4cl solution is significantly higher than digester centrate at low recovery factors and drops below that of the digester centrate at high recovery factors the observed trend is attributed to different initial tan concentrations and ph values of the two solutions which affect the concentration of unionized nh3 table 3 across the membrane and therefore its partial vapor pressure that acts as the driving force to nh3 transport across the membrane the ratio of the partial vapor pressure gradients of nh3 for nh4cl solution and digester centrate as function of water recovery factor at different temperature has been shown in fig 6 b it is clear form figure that the ratio of the partial vapor pressure decreases with recovery factor in accordance with the trend observed for the ratio of the flux different behavior of tan concentrations in retentate of vmd and dcmd can be attributed to different conditions on permeate side of the membrane side in dcmd the nh3 h2o mixture passing through the membrane is condensed by the cold water stream on permeate side of the membrane as can be seen in table 3 the transport of nh3 resulted in an increase of ph of the permeate and a decrease of ph in the retentate thus the partial pressure difference of nh3 and therefore driving force to its transport across the membrane for dcmd is expected to be lower than vmd where nh3 is continuously removed from the permeate side by vacuum the driving force for dcmd is expected to be small at low temperatures where partial pressure of nh3 in retentate is low and should increase with increase in feed temperature this is evident from the ratio of nh3 to water flux nh3 h20 flux passing through the membrane fig a4 in appendix a which shows that nh3 h20 flux ratio was the lowest at 45 c and the highest at 75 c for digester centrate thus the highest tan concentration in permeate of digester centrate treated at 75 c through dcmd is due to the higher flux of nh3 compared to water passing through the membrane at 75 c 3 3 p recovery the concentration of o p in the retentate was continuously followed during all the experiments and it was found to be increasing with recovery factor fig 7 in all the samples as md completely rejects all non volatiles including p the final concentrations achieved in all the tests varied slightly due to different final concentration factors or recovery factors achieved in various tests mg salt was added at the end of each experiment after cooling the retentate to room temperature to precipitate p and a fraction of tan as struvite as shown in fig 7 addition of mg to the retentate drastically brings the dissolved p concentrations down due to the formation and settling of struvite the final concentration after precipitation of struvite in retentate appears to be slightly dependent upon temperature and marginally decreases with decrease in operating temperature see the encircled values this observation is not directly linked with the temperature and instead can be attributed to relatively higher final ph of the retentate obtained at low temperatures table a1 it has been shown in several studies that precipitation of struvite is favored by increase in ph up to around 9 5 60 for instance buhiyan et al have stated that solubility of struvite increases by increasing the ph of feed solution from 7 to 8 5 61 similarly liu et al showed that solubility of struvite gradually reduces by increasing the ph and thus promoting the crystallization process 62 thus the maximum p removal 93 achieved at low temperatures in current study can be attributed to the corresponding high ph of the retentate tan balance for dcmd and vmd has been shown in fig 8 the figure indicates that in all the cases major fraction of tan ends up in permeate also at any temperature the amount of nh3 transferred into the permeate is higher for vmd than dcmd for dcmd a significant fraction 10 30 of tan is present in retentate even after formation of struvite and only a small fraction 5 7 is consumed in struvite formation thus remaining tan in the retentate is theoretically sufficient to produce up to 5 times additional struvite if enough p were present in the wastewater thus there is clear potential to further recover nh3 without compromising the formation of struvite from retentate of dcmd for vmd on the other hand the fraction of tan left in retentate after formation of struvite is very small around 4 of the total tan thus the potential to recover further nh3 is very limited in terms of struvite formation the left over tan in vmd is theoretically sufficient to produce up to 80 additional struvite if the corresponding additional p were available in the wastewater thus it can be concluded that for digester centrate considered in the current study vmd will be more suitable candidate for nh3 removal and concentration of p for struvite formation on the other hand for the cases where wastewater has high ph such as nh4cl solution discussed in current study vmd removes almost entire nh3 from wastewater before reaching any substantial concentration of p thus for high ph wastewater dcmd seems more suitable option as it can bring the tan concentration lower without completely removing it while at the same time increasing p concentration in the solution as another option ph of the wastewater can be adjusted to a lower value for the cases where vmd is expected to remove nh3 in excess to what is required for struvite formation however clearly this will demand the use of more chemicals that is not appreciated in designing of wastewater treatment plants of the future to analyze the structure of the obtained crystals four crystal samples at two different temperatures i e 45 and 75 c produced by dcmd and vmd were analyzed by xrd the xrd spectra shows a crystalline structure similar to a reference spectrum of struvite for all the tested samples as illustrated in fig 9 thus it was confirmed that the obtained crystalline product is struvite icp analysis of the precipitate confirms that it is struvite that was recovered table 4 the theoretical content of mg and p in struvite is 99 0 and 126 2 mg g struvite this means that the purity of the precipitate is 92 4 96 9 76 1 94 3 for dcmd 45 c dcmd 75 c vmd 45 c and vmd 75 c respectively even though the purity for vmd 45 was low yet small ionic impurities were observed given the analyzed ions where only ca as 1 01 mg g were observed the content of mg and p in this sample is lower compared to the other samples and therefore it is most likely that organic material has been incorporated into the sample possibly through adsorption in general there were low concentrations of other ions mainly ca incorporated into the crystals or co precipitated with struvite 4 conclusions direct contact and vacuum membrane distillation have been successfully applied for simultaneously recovery of nh3 and p in form of nh3 h2o mixture and struvite respectively from the wastewater irrespective of ph of the wastewater vmd is more efficient for nh3 recovery whereas the efficiency of dcmd is greatly limited due to increase in ph and temperature of the permeate stream for the wastewater with high ph 10 9 vmd eliminates nh3 almost completely before achieving significant p concentration in the wastewater thus either efficiency of p removal is compromised p recovery is proportional to its concentration in the solution or precipitation of p in form of struvite does not remain possible however for low ph 7 4 wastewater vmd was clearly a better option as it brought nh3 concentrations close to the optimum level for simultaneous recovery of nh3 and struvite it was also concluded that for wastewater with low ph operating vmd at low temperature 45 c is more effective in obtaining high concentration of nh3 h2o permeate and in recovering more p from the wastewater declaration of competing
