17450,light plays a vital role in shaping the structure of natural biofilms but the effect of light on electroactive biofilm eab has not been systematically studied herein the influence of light on the formation of eab was investigated the eab grown in darkness was more electroactive eab 0 with a peak current of 4 5 a m2 which was 196 and 5556 times higher than eabs formed under light intensities of 600 eab 600 and 1200 lux eab 1200 a thin eab 30 μm with spherical pink aggregates was obtained after 13 days in the darkness comparing to a dense and flat biofilm grown under light conditions although the biomass in eab 1200 38 5 1 6 mg l was 3 times larger than that in eab 0 11 4 1 8 mg l the degradation of substrate was not sufficient eab 0 contained 85 geobacter species while the rhodopseudomonas species made up 66 and 75 of eab 600 and eab 1200 respectively the polysaccharides produced by eab 1200 was 4801 253 mg m2 which were 2 3 times higher than 2073 160 mg m2 of eab 0 resulting in lower electro conductivity of the extracellular polymeric substances eps under light conditions our findings confirmed that the light exposure affected eab performance by altering the microbial components electron transfer capacity and biofilm morphology which can be used in predictions of the formation and properties of engineered eab in outdoor environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electroactive biofilm light exposure bioelectrochemical response extracellular polymeric substance electron transfer capacity 1 introduction microbial electrochemical systems mess are emerging as promising wastewater treatment process for efficient organic pollutants removal with low energy consumption he et al 2019 the formation of electroactive biofilm eab on polarized surfaces is an important part of the construction of mess eab has a unique ability to accelerate pollutants degradation due to the active electron transfer property of electroactive bacteria borole et al 2011 malvankar and lovley 2012 the electroactive bacteria that live in eab use extracellular polymeric substances to form a three dimensional matrix where electron transfer occurs as evidenced by kinetic analysis torres et al 2010 in electrochemical systems the formation of eab is influenced by various factors including electrochemical stimulation yang et al 2019 electrolyte characteristics pandey et al 2016 patil et al 2011 and ambient environmental conditions chiranjeevi and patil 2020 patil et al 2010 however most studies on eab formation have focused only on electrochemical stimulation and electrolyte characteristics while ignoring the effects of ambient environmental conditions low light or dark environments are the most common culturing conditions for laboratory grown microbial electrochemical systems this maximizes microbial growth by reducing environmental stress however light is ubiquitous in natural environments making it a factor which will inevitably affect biofilm formation in outdoor applications gomelsky and hoff 2011 mussi et al 2010 thus when using eab in real world applications light illumination must be considered it has been reported that the eabs exhibit similar electrochemical activities degrenne et al 2012 wang et al 2015 and biofilm morphologies du et al 2018 when model reactors and common laboratory substrates are used furthermore typical electroactive bacteria such as geobacter inoue et al 2010 and shewanella pirbadian et al 2014 strains represented the dominant populations in almost all laboratory eab micro ecosystems however low light or dark environments eliminate the possibility of photoelectric effects on specific microbial cells campbell et al 2015 potentially producing electrochemical behaviors that are not representative of mixed communities in natural environments despite this relatively little research has examined how light interferes with eab function how it may impede eab formation or how it will affect the practical applications of eab xing et al 2009 light is an important environmental signal that can shape the compositions and architectures of biofilms by regulating the physiological and biochemical behaviors of individual cells gomelsky and hoff 2011 and in so doing influence the function of the microbial community van der horst et al 2007 phototropism or negative phototropism are behaviors exhibited by bacteria in which they migrate to or away from light to maximize their growth and metabolism choi et al 1999 zhou et al 2012 it has been observed that when bacteria were exposed to light they were able to sense the direction and intensity of the light and move along the intensity gradient it also induced early attachment of cells on solid substrates bonomi et al 2012 mussi et al 2010 most bacteria belong to phototrophic groups but many studies have also found that chemotrophic groups also exhibit phototropism for example acinetobacter strains responded to blue light by altering their motility and how they formed microcolonies abatedaga et al 2017 recent studies have demonstrated that some phototrophic strains such as prosthecochloris aestaurii ha et al 2017 and rhodopseudomonas palustris guzman et al 2019 were also electroactive but the response of typical electroactive bacteria to light illumination remains relatively unknown several questions remain unanswered can eab micromorphology be shaped by light illumination how does light illumination affect the electrochemical and electro conductivity behaviors of eab does light illumination affect bacterial succession within eab to date no specific research has been conducted to address these questions in this study we investigated how light acts on eab by designing a electrochemical system to test the effects of illumination using indium tin oxide ito glass as the working electrode this study specifically investigated 1 the micromorphology of eabs with or without light exposure 2 the electrochemical behavior of eabs under different light intensities 3 the shift in microbial community composition of eabs in response to light exposure 4 the variation of electro conductivity of eps after light exposure these results have contributed to our understanding of how eab can be shaped by light and provide insights that can help predictions about the formation and properties of engineered eab in outdoor environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 test system construction the test system consisted of a three electrode anaerobic reactor controlled by a potentiostat chi 660e ch instrument usa fig 1 and fig s1 the reactor was made of polymethylmethacrylate with a working volume of 120 ml interior dimensions 5 5 5 cm a silicone gasket was used to seal the reactor a 3 3 cm piece of indium tin oxide ito glass thickness 0 1 cm working area 4 cm2 used as the working electrode was placed in the pre set 3 3 cm slot on the bottom plate where it would not interfere with the transmission of light the ito glass was oriented with the conductive surface towards the electrolyte and the nonconductive surface towards the cold light source xd 302 sibei instrument china with the visible light transmittance of 88 the cold light source 150 w was installed 5 cm away from the ito glass it produced a narrow beam of light within the visible wavelengths from 320 nm to 780 nm prior to use the ito glass was degreased by sonication in acetone for 15 min followed by rinsing with deionized water for 5 min and drying at ambient temperature a piece of hollow squared stainless steel sheet was used as electron receiver and was compressed against the conductive surface of the ito glass the connection of the stainless steel sheet and ito glass was good because of the surrounding contract design and the relatively large contact area ratio 55 6 a 3 3 cm piece of graphite sheet thickness 0 5 cm was used as the counter electrode facing towards the ito electrode the ag agcl 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode reference electrode was held near the ito electrode the distance between the graphite and ito electrodes was 4 2 cm but between the ito and reference electrodes was 2 6 cm 2 2 inoculation and operation the test system was inoculated with the supernatant of domestic wastewater from preliminary sedimentation tank after removing large flocs which might influence the formation of microcolonies on the ito glass the medium contained anhydrous sodium acetate 1 g l in 50 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs containing trace minerals and vitamins kcl 0 13 g l nh4cl 0 31 g l nah2po4 2h2o 3 32 g l na2hpo4 12 h2o 10 32 g l vitamins 5 ml l and trace minerals 12 5 ml l dong et al 2015 before being injected into the reactor the electrolyte was deoxygenated using pure argon gas to avoid oxygen reduction reactions on the electrode the tests were performed in constant potential mode at 0 2 v vs ag agcl as previously described matsuda et al 2011 and the current was recorded every 100 s the light intensities were set to 0 lux 600 lux and 1200 lux corresponding to the eabs named eab 0 eab 600 and eab 1200 respectively all tests were conducted in triplicate at 30 c to avoid the influence of temperature on electricity generation the tests were terminated after the current decreased to a stable state 2 3 cod measurement and electrochemical characterization the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod was measured using the apha standard method apha 2005 before measurement samples were first filtered through 0 45 μm pore diameter syringe filters the electrochemical characteristics of the biofilms were examined using cyclic voltammetry cv at the end of each test the working counter and reference electrodes were the same as previously described and the electrolyte contained acetate 1 g l the cv was performed from 0 6 to 0 4 v vs ag agcl at multiple scan rates i e 1 5 20 50 mv s to examine the effect of scan rate on current generation the first derivative cv dcv was calculated from cv data by plotting the slope of each cv data point against the electrode potential v which determined the changes in each peak value linear sweep voltammetry lsv was conducted to examine the electrochemical activity of the eabs under different illumination levels and was performed at a scan rate of 0 5 mv s from 0 6 to 0 4 v electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis of eabs was conducted at polarized potential 0 2 v vs ag agcl over the frequency range from 100 khz to 0 01 hz in the corresponding light environment for the analysis of the internal resistance each biofilm was stabilized at the polarized potential for 1 h before the eis tests nyquist plots were fitted according to the equivalent circuit described in a previous study li et al 2020 2 4 eab micromorphology observation true color photography of eab was obtained using an optical microscope stereo discovery v20 carl zeiss germany through the 10x objective the micromorphology of the eab was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope sem fei quanta 200f prior to imaging an electronically conductive au coating was applied to each eab sample to reduce charging in the sem confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was used to visualize the spatial distribution of proteins in the interior eab layers because electron transfer was closely associated with the outer membrane and extracellular redox active proteins in the region closer to electrode liu and bond 2012 the interior eab samples were first taken from the ito glass and placed on slides fig s2 and fig s3 the samples were then fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 12 h followed by fluorescent staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma st louis mo to visualize proteins in brief nahco3 buffer 0 1 m was added to the samples to retain the amine groups in their non protonated forms thereafter fitc 1 g l dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide was added and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 1 h after the samples were stained they were washed with pbs ph 7 2 to remove excess stain the stained samples were observed through a clsm lsm880 carl zeiss germany the excitation emission wavelengths used to observe fitc were 488 520 nm green 2 5 biomass and microbial community analyses proteins were extracted from the eab samples and measured using a bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china according to the manufacturer s instructions the eab samples under different light intensities were collected by scraping the surface of ito glass total genomic dna was extracted from all samples using a bacteria dna mini kit w6511 watson biotechnologies inc china according to the manufacturer s instructions and assessed by electrophoresis in 1 agarose gels the bacterial 16s rdna pcr was performed using 515f and 806r primers targeting the variable region v4 forward primer 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 reverse primer 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the amplicons were subsequently determined on an illumina miseq sequencing platform by novogene beijing china the sequencing data were then processed using the dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 including trimming sequencing error correction filtering abundance estimation and taxonomy assignment as open source package dada2 is derived from the divisive amplicon denoising algorithm dada which corrects illumina sequenced amplicon errors after that the shared and unique otus were compared between the samples from different light conditions lu et al 2012 these data were used to calculate species richness and diversity using the chao 1 and shannon diversity indices results were reported based on the averages of three samples collected from within trisected regions of the ito glass 2 6 eps analysis and measurement of redox properties the eps was extracted from the eabs using previously reported methods frolund et al 1996 firstly the eabs were stirred for 2 h at 4 c with resin the eps was then harvested by centrifugation for 30 min at 4000 g and filtering the supernatant by 0 45 μm filtration membrane the total protein content of the eps was measured using bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china polysaccharose content was evaluated using the anthrone method loewus 1952 the redox states of the eps were established by determining their electron accepting capacity eac mediated by the electrochemical reduction mer method and electron donating capacity edc mediated by the electrochemical oxidation meo method aeschbacher et al 2010 these were measured by chronoamperometry using an electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instrument usa a glassy carbon cylinder with an effective volume of 20 ml served both as electrochemical reaction vessel and the working electrode we a platinum sheet 1 2 cm and ag agcl were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode respectively the electrochemical test was conducted in a buffer solution 0 05 m pbs kcl 0 13 g l nah2po4 2h2o 3 32 g l and na2hpo4 12 h2o 10 32 g l adjust to ph 7 0 under constant stirring and n2 flow the mer and meo were performed with an applied potential of 0 49 v and 0 61 v vs she diquat dibromide monohydrate dq and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium salt abts were used as electron shuttles in the mer and meo experiments respectively the specific potentials of 0 49 v and 0 61 v were chosen due to the stability of dq and abts at potentials sufficiently low mediator in mer or high mediator in meo to cover the potential range that triggering electron transfer from the redox active moieties in the eps aeschbacher et al 2010 spiking the mediators dq for mer and abts for meo can result in reductive and oxidative currents respectively the eps concentrates containing 0 2 mg 0 3 mg 0 4 mg and 0 5 mg of eps were successively added to the vessel after the background current stabilized fig s4 and table s1 before being injected into the vessel the eps concentrate was temporarily stored in refrigerator 4 c to minimize activity change over time 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical characteristics of eab current generation by eab 0 lasted 13 days and it peaked after 5 5 days reaching a current of 4 5 a m2 after which the current decreased gradually and neared zero after 11 days in light treatments however observed currents were orders of magnitude lower with the current peaking at 2 3 10 2 a m2 eab 600 and 8 1 10 4 a m2 eab 1200 with light illumination the cycle time was much shorter than in darkness 9 and 7 days for 600 and 1200 lux respectively fig s5a c the peak current in these treatments were attained earlier on the 5th and 3rd days respectively notably the higher biomass yield obtained in the light treatments did not translate into improved current output although it accelerated the rate of current increase the specific biofilm electroactivity be ma g protein was used to character the electroactivity of eab which was calculated by normalizing the current to the measured protein content of biomass on the ito glass b biomass the be for eab 0 was 1 45 103 ma g protein which was significantly higher than 5 56 and 0 18 ma g protein for eab 600 and eab 1200 p 0 01 student s t test this suggested that a major portion of the protein components in the eab under light conditions was poorly correlated with the electron transfer process during the experimental period the eabs exhibited a variety of scod removal abilities fig s6 in the eab 0 the scod removal efficiency was 97 1 resulting in an effluent containing a scod of 22 3 6 1 mg l however the electrochemical systems experiencing 600 and 1200 lux illumination only achieved scod removal efficiencies of 63 1 and 41 1 with corresponding effluent scod concentrations of 300 7 12 5 and 486 3 10 5 mg l the maximum scod removal rate was 61 4 1 5 g m3 day by eab 0 which was 18 and 40 higher than those by eab 600 51 9 2 1 g m3 day and by eab 1200 43 9 1 5 g m3 day respectively the average current efficiency of the electrochemical system was relatively low only 67 1 due to the relatively small working electrode area to reactor volume ratio 0 03 cm2 ml which resulted in notable proportions of scod being removed by anaerobic respiration however the current efficiencies were reduced to almost zero 0 5 when illuminated indicating that the scod removal process did not rely on the electrochemical process cyclic voltammetry cv was used to examine the electron transfer performance of eabs under different operational conditions fig 2 a there were no redox peaks in the blank biofilm less ito electrode and the peak currents all increased with the increase of scan rate as previous reported fig s7 the similar sigmoidal waves at different scan rates were obtained from eab 0 showing that the eab followed a typical electron transfer model of geobacter dominated eabs fig s7a patil et al 2010 however there were no significant sigmoidal waves at different scan rates for both eab 600 and eab 1200 fig s7b and s7c the peak currents of eab 1200 at each scan rate were similar with those for the blank ito electrode implying the low electroactivity of biofilm under intense light exposure a dominant electrochemical active range centered at 0 372 0 004 v was detected in the oxidation dcv curve and the only main peak was centered at 0 378 0 003 v in the reduction dcv curve fig 2b and s8 these two inflection points in the oxidative and reductive processes were also observed in other studies fricke et al 2008 the dcv curve also revealed inflection points for the oxidation and reduction potentials for eab 600 but these inflection points had all but disappeared for eab 1200 the lsv curve indicated that there was no significant current output for the blank ito glass in darkness or under light conditions the current sharply increased to 0 119 ma after enrichment of electroactive bacteria in darkness however the currents only increased to 0 013 ma and 0 007 ma for eab 600 and eab 1200 this lsv result further demonstrated that the light exposure interfered with eab enrichment and led to deteriorated electroactivity fig s5d it has been reported that the electron transfer from geobacter species to electrodes is accomplished by outer membrane cytochromes such as omce omcs and omcz with the main redox peak centered at 0 363 0 003 v pessanha et al 2006 the dominant redox peak found at 0 372 0 004 v in this study most likely corresponded to the reported value 0 363 0 003 v other electrochemical behavior included peaks 1 3 and 4 centered at 0 481 0 003 v 0 331 002 v and 0 125 002 v respectively fig 2b these values were all within the reported potentials for omcs ranging from 0 570 to 0 250 v leang et al 2010 and potentials for omcz ranging from 0 630 to 0 270 v inoue et al 2010 thus it is likely that these redox peaks were derived from a combination of different outer membrane cytochromes in the eab exposed to light however the main redox peaks were blurred and the minor peaks had disappeared this demonstrated the degradation caused by light exposure on the overall electrochemical performance this may have been caused by a reduction in the outer membrane cytochromes which facilitate the electron exchange between the electrode and bacteria possibly due to decreased cytochrome activity or reduced quantity of electroactive bacteria 3 2 eab characterization sem was used to examine how the micromorphology of eabs changed under different light intensities fig 3 the ito glass had been uniformly covered by biofilm after one cycle in batch mode with the duration time of 13 9 and 7 days for eab 0 eab 600 and eab 1200 there were obvious differences in bacterial attachment at different light illumination levels the eab 0 was composed of uniform well ordered rod shaped bacteria fig 3a 1 and a 2 however the arrangement of the bacteria in eab 600 and eab 1200 became disorganized and the shapes of bacteria became heterogeneous for example the size of the bacteria significantly decreased in eab 1200 and the boundaries between bacteria became indistinct compared with that in eab 0 fig 3c 1 and c 2 notably the filament like structures that span between bacteria were observed in eab 0 but their presence was reduced significantly when the culture was exposed to light these filament like structures have been found in other biofilms serving functions related to motility adhesion to solid surfaces and environmental sensing anderson et al 2010 however many studies have noted that the filament like structures were more common in eab kouzuma et al 2015 making it reasonable to speculate that the filament like structures in eab may help electroactive bacteria to recognize and communicate with conspecifics or those bacteria occupying a similar ecological niche besides the electrons produced by the electroactive bacteria could be directly transferred to the electrode via this filament like structures as previous reported fig 3a 3 patil et al 2012 the thickness of eab 0 was only 30 μm after 13 days of culture fig 3a 4 however the thickness of eab 600 and eab 1200 increased to about 300 μm in just 9 and 7 days fig 3b 4 and c 4 respectively and the space between the bacteria and ito glass was occupied by extracellular viscous substance this result indicated the adhesion mechanism of bacteria to ito glass changed when experiencing the combined effects of electrochemical stimulation and light exposure the biomass densities were considerably different when viewed at the macroscopic level fig s9 the total biomass t biomass increased from 11 4 1 8 to 38 5 1 6 mg l n 3 with increases in light intensity there were significant differences between the t biomass p 0 01 student s t test of different systems the biomass in the solution s biomass also differed significantly between the light illumination treatments p 0 01 student s t test the s biomass of the system under light illumination of 1200 lux was 22 7 1 5 mg l which was 22 fold higher than that without illumination 1 0 0 3 mg l the dynamic development of eabs was monitored by measuring the biomass on the ito glass b biomass during the batch mode fig s10 the biomass yield of eab 0 increased slowly to 0 8 0 1 mg l in the initial 2 days of adaptation phase and then it sharply increased to 9 5 0 8 mg l in the following 8 days finally stabilized around 10 5 1 1 mg l the light exposure accelerated the biomass accumulation of eab 600 and eab 1200 compared with eab 0 due to the rapid multiplication of bacteria bacterial cells in the test system existed in one of two forms planktonic or sessile the ratio of b biomass sessile to t biomass sessile planktonic decreased from 91 to 41 demonstrating that 1 the majority of biomass had attached to the surface of ito glass in darkness and 2 the introduction of light induced increases in metabolism of the bacteria in solution true color photographs were taken to show the actual states of eabs under the different light intensities fig 4 a 1 b 1 and c 1 the photographs revealed the formation of spherical aggregates on the ito glass the spherical aggregates were pink with diameters ranging between 30 and 100 μm however as the light intensity increased the spherical aggregates were gradually replaced by a dense and flat biofilm at the highest light intensity eab 1200 the color of the eab was reddish and no spherical aggregates were observed this reddish color was associated with the accumulation of cytochromes of the bacteria seeliger et al 1998 spherical aggregates have also been reported in other studies in which the electrochemical environment they used promoted eab development du et al 2018 this spherical aggregate type growth pattern was likely determined by a combination of factors here that included plate electrode moderate electrochemical stimulation intercellular electrostatic interaction and cell condensation by eps secretion the images obtained through the protein staining and clsm showed that the eab was morphologically heterogenous with proteins being clearly detectable in the interior layers of all eabs fig 4a 2 b 2 and c 2 proteins were dispersed throughout the field of view in the eab 0 when exposed to light however the protein content was reduced relative to the dark treatment from the perspective of spatial distributions proteins were uniformly distributed throughout the depth of the biofilm in darkness but were sporadically distributed in the light treatments the higher protein content in the interior layer eps of eab 0 was due to the secretion of redox active proteins by electroactive bacteria which accelerated the electron transfer between bacteria and electrode resulting in the higher electroactivity of eab 0 however the interior layer protein content decreased in eab 600 and eab 1200 demonstrated relatively lower electron transfer efficiency in the region closer to the electrode which agreed with the poor current generation performance this eps data see section 3 4 showed that eab grown under light condition preferentially stored polysaccharides over proteins this result might be attributed to the succession of dominant species in eab from geobacter species in darkness to rhodopseudomonas species under light conditions see section 3 3 accompanied by reduced secretion of eps associated redox active proteins liu and bond 2012 3 3 microbial analysis based on α diversity statistics it could be inferred that light exposure had a large impact on the structure of the microbial communities in the eabs from 164 465 sequences we saw that the eab 0 and eab 600 had 214 otus in common with 249 and 181 unique otus respectively the eab 0 and eab 1200 shared 231 otus and 236 otus were shared between eab 600 and eab 1200 there were 157 otus that were shared among all three eabs fig 5 most otus belonged to the class proteobacteria accounting for 90 82 and 92 of the sequences in the eab 0 eab 600 eab 1200 respectively most confirmed electroactive bacteria belong to proteobacteria logan 2009 bacteroidetes a putative phylum of exoelectrogens xing et al 2009 also represented a dominant phyla in the eabs by calculating the chao 1 and shannon diversity indices clear differences were found among the eab samples table s2 for example according to the chao 1 index the microbial species richness of the eab in darkness was higher than those exposed to light 0 01 p 0 05 student s t test however the microbial species evenness of eabs exposed to light was relatively higher compared to the eab cultured in darkness 0 01 p 0 05 student s t test these α diversity statistics demonstrated that the introduction of light increased interspecific homogeneity at the cost of there being fewer species at the genus level electroactive bacteria were found in all the eab samples but at different abundances geobacter species which are model exoelectrogens inoue et al 2010 accounted for 85 of the bacteria in the eab 0 however that percentage was drastically lower i e 1 in eabs exposed to light aminiphilus species members of the synergistetes phylum were present in relatively high abundances 4 eab 0 these have been previously reported as a stable core genus in acetate fed microelectrochemical systems lesnik and liu 2014 another model exoelectrogens shewanella species was also detected at the relatively high abundance of 2 in eab 0 but in this case that percentage increased to 9 in the eab 1200 the higher proportion of shewanella species under strong light illumination may indicate they have a symbiotic relationship with another species based on the species level analysis rhodopseudomonas palustris was the bacteria most positively influenced by light exposure as its abundances were 66 and 75 in the eab 600 and eab 1200 respectively there was a significant positive correlation between light intensity and the abundance of r palustris pearson s r 0 918 r palustris is an iron oxidizing photoautotrophic bacteria which can fix co2 in the presence of light using ferrous iron fe ii as the electron source jiao and newman 2007 previous studies have shown that r palustris can accept electrons from a solid electrode or electron donating bacteria such as geobacter sulfurreducens guzman et al 2019 this metabolic pathway with r palustris facilitating electron exchange could explain the success of shewanella species in eab exposed to light with syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis proceeding via direct interspecies electron transfer fig 6 however why this facilitation would benefit shewanella species and not geobacter species remains unclear an abundance variation analysis at the genus level was performed to reveal how light exposure shaped the microbial communities of the eab fig 7 the analysis showed that there were obvious differences between eabs developed in darkness vs those developed in light but the difference between the different light intensities 600 and 1200 lux was not significant taking geobacter species as an example of a typical exoelectrogens we see that the differences between eab 0 and eab 600 and between eab 0 and eab 1200 were both significant 95 confidence interval this showed that typical exoelectrogens were depleted in illuminated conditions similarly there were significant differences in rhodopseudomonas species between eab 0 and both eab 600 and eab 1200 p 0 05 however no statistical difference was observed between eab 600 and eab 1200 for any of the genera with abundances 0 5 including rhodopseudomonas species aminiphilus species shewanella species aeromonas species pseudomonas species fusibacter species dysgonomonas species and rhodobacter species therefore based on the abundance variation analysis light exposure resulted in the high abundance of rhodopseudomonas species while a completely dark environment was more suitable for geobacter species 3 4 discussion using an inoculum from a domestic wastewater system this study demonstrated that the microbial communities within eab with electrochemical stimulation changed significantly when exposed to light the sem and true color photography images of the eabs showed that a thinner electroactive biofilm had developed in darkness despite the longer acclimation period in darkness the eab consisted of spherical pink aggregates uniformly distributed on the ito glass while under lighted conditions the eab was denser and no spherical aggregates formed the change in biomass content showed that light accelerated the accumulation of biomass accumulation on the ito glass as well as in solution the 16s rdna sequencing data revealed that geobacter species and rhodopseudomonas species were the dominant genera in the eab 0 and eab 600 1200 respectively when considering both the relative abundances and biomass productions in the test system the absolute quantities of rhodopseudomonas species in both eab 600 and eab 1200 were much higher than geobacter species in eab 0 p 0 01 student s t test therefore it can be concluded that the illuminated environment overwhelmingly benefitted rhodopseudomonas species the eps which primarily consists of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides plays an important role in determining the structure of biofilms so the components of the eps were measured to investigate the eab construction strategy fig s11 in this research the eps produced by eab 0 had 2073 160 mg m2 polysaccharides which was nearly twice as much as the protein 1083 85 mg m2 however the polysaccharide protein ratio in the eab 1200 treatment was 3 3 with an absolute quantity of polysaccharides of 4801 253 mg m2 this eps data showed that eab grown in light preferentially stored polysaccharides over proteins the three possible mechanism by which polysaccharides were accumulated were 1 the substrate was sufficiently abundant for rhodopseudomonas species to store energy 2 the thicker eab matrix when exposed to light requires the support of polysaccharides or 3 the colonization and aggregation of rhodopseudomonas species on the ito surface relied more heavily on polysaccharides in contrast to the filament like structures that were abundant in colonies of geobacter species however the higher secretion of eps did not appear to contribute to current output and consequently prevented the complete mineralization of the substrate the thin eab observed in darkness was believed to favor electron transfer between electroactive bacteria and the electrode while the thick eab likely limited current output by interfering with the mass transfer process eps in thick eab has been shown to function as a conductive network that transfers electrons by utilizing the extracellular proteinaceous substance yang et al 2019 therefore the capacity of eps to transfer electrons both accepting and donating was evaluated by mer and meo analyses fig 8 the meo results returned edcs of 0 068 0 012 0 018 0 004 0 016 0 003 μmol e mg eps for eab 0 eab 600 and eab 1200 respectively correspondingly the maximum eac was found in the eps of eab 0 0 152 0 029 μmol e mg eps followed by the eab 600 0 079 0 015 μmol e mg eps and the eab 1200 0 060 0 003 μmol e mg eps the elevated eac and edc in eab 0 reflected the excellent electron exchange capability of the eps which was capable of assisting distant bio electron transfer which was consistent with the current output considering the polysaccharide protein ratio the over secretion of insulative polysaccharides in the eab 600 and eab 1200 generated great resistance resulting in low electron transfer capacity polysaccharide production has been shown to be closely associated with environmental stress and may serve as a protective layer for cells in addition to energy storage han et al 2017 the accumulation of polysaccharides in the eab 600 and eab 1200 was likely a response to light exposure which may be an ecological strategy to increase survival in high light environments at the cost of decreasing electron transfer capacity besides the thicker eab 600 and eab 1200 also impeded the substrate diffusion inside the biofilm evidenced by the higher internal resistance fig s12 which also reduced the electroactivity of eabs under light conditions light exposure can shape the structure and function of biofilms though it has been observed before the effect of light on the growth of bacteria from wastewater on polarized surfaces has rarely been studied in this study light exposure was found to completely alter the micromorphology and electrochemical performance of eab low light or dark environments appeared to increase the electroactivity of eab while light exposure had the opposite effect the deteriorated electroactivity of eab after light exposure was due to a combination of factors here that included substrate diffusion limitation through the thicker biofilm depletion of geobacter species interception of electrons by rhodopseudomonas species lower electro conductivity of eps according these results low light or dark environments should be maintained in order to accumulate communities of electroactive bacteria in thin eab creating biofilms with lower biomass but more efficient pollutant removal performance which will perform better in engineered systems 4 conclusion this study comprehensively elucidated the responses of eab to light exposure based on the results it can be concluded that 1 a thin eab 30 μm with spherical pink aggregates was obtained in the darkness which exhibited much higher electrochemical activity compared with the dense and flat eabs grown under light exposure 2 completely dark environment was more suitable for geobacter species 85 while rhodopseudomonas species were preferentially enriched with geobacter species sharply decreased to 1 under lighted conditions 3 the electro conductivity of eab decreased after light exposure due to over secretion of nonconductive extracellular polysaccharide in the eps 4 finally to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to gain full insight into eab enrichment by taking the light exposure into consideration our results suggested the low light or dark environments should be provided for highly active engineered eab development in

17450,light plays a vital role in shaping the structure of natural biofilms but the effect of light on electroactive biofilm eab has not been systematically studied herein the influence of light on the formation of eab was investigated the eab grown in darkness was more electroactive eab 0 with a peak current of 4 5 a m2 which was 196 and 5556 times higher than eabs formed under light intensities of 600 eab 600 and 1200 lux eab 1200 a thin eab 30 μm with spherical pink aggregates was obtained after 13 days in the darkness comparing to a dense and flat biofilm grown under light conditions although the biomass in eab 1200 38 5 1 6 mg l was 3 times larger than that in eab 0 11 4 1 8 mg l the degradation of substrate was not sufficient eab 0 contained 85 geobacter species while the rhodopseudomonas species made up 66 and 75 of eab 600 and eab 1200 respectively the polysaccharides produced by eab 1200 was 4801 253 mg m2 which were 2 3 times higher than 2073 160 mg m2 of eab 0 resulting in lower electro conductivity of the extracellular polymeric substances eps under light conditions our findings confirmed that the light exposure affected eab performance by altering the microbial components electron transfer capacity and biofilm morphology which can be used in predictions of the formation and properties of engineered eab in outdoor environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electroactive biofilm light exposure bioelectrochemical response extracellular polymeric substance electron transfer capacity 1 introduction microbial electrochemical systems mess are emerging as promising wastewater treatment process for efficient organic pollutants removal with low energy consumption he et al 2019 the formation of electroactive biofilm eab on polarized surfaces is an important part of the construction of mess eab has a unique ability to accelerate pollutants degradation due to the active electron transfer property of electroactive bacteria borole et al 2011 malvankar and lovley 2012 the electroactive bacteria that live in eab use extracellular polymeric substances to form a three dimensional matrix where electron transfer occurs as evidenced by kinetic analysis torres et al 2010 in electrochemical systems the formation of eab is influenced by various factors including electrochemical stimulation yang et al 2019 electrolyte characteristics pandey et al 2016 patil et al 2011 and ambient environmental conditions chiranjeevi and patil 2020 patil et al 2010 however most studies on eab formation have focused only on electrochemical stimulation and electrolyte characteristics while ignoring the effects of ambient environmental conditions low light or dark environments are the most common culturing conditions for laboratory grown microbial electrochemical systems this maximizes microbial growth by reducing environmental stress however light is ubiquitous in natural environments making it a factor which will inevitably affect biofilm formation in outdoor applications gomelsky and hoff 2011 mussi et al 2010 thus when using eab in real world applications light illumination must be considered it has been reported that the eabs exhibit similar electrochemical activities degrenne et al 2012 wang et al 2015 and biofilm morphologies du et al 2018 when model reactors and common laboratory substrates are used furthermore typical electroactive bacteria such as geobacter inoue et al 2010 and shewanella pirbadian et al 2014 strains represented the dominant populations in almost all laboratory eab micro ecosystems however low light or dark environments eliminate the possibility of photoelectric effects on specific microbial cells campbell et al 2015 potentially producing electrochemical behaviors that are not representative of mixed communities in natural environments despite this relatively little research has examined how light interferes with eab function how it may impede eab formation or how it will affect the practical applications of eab xing et al 2009 light is an important environmental signal that can shape the compositions and architectures of biofilms by regulating the physiological and biochemical behaviors of individual cells gomelsky and hoff 2011 and in so doing influence the function of the microbial community van der horst et al 2007 phototropism or negative phototropism are behaviors exhibited by bacteria in which they migrate to or away from light to maximize their growth and metabolism choi et al 1999 zhou et al 2012 it has been observed that when bacteria were exposed to light they were able to sense the direction and intensity of the light and move along the intensity gradient it also induced early attachment of cells on solid substrates bonomi et al 2012 mussi et al 2010 most bacteria belong to phototrophic groups but many studies have also found that chemotrophic groups also exhibit phototropism for example acinetobacter strains responded to blue light by altering their motility and how they formed microcolonies abatedaga et al 2017 recent studies have demonstrated that some phototrophic strains such as prosthecochloris aestaurii ha et al 2017 and rhodopseudomonas palustris guzman et al 2019 were also electroactive but the response of typical electroactive bacteria to light illumination remains relatively unknown several questions remain unanswered can eab micromorphology be shaped by light illumination how does light illumination affect the electrochemical and electro conductivity behaviors of eab does light illumination affect bacterial succession within eab to date no specific research has been conducted to address these questions in this study we investigated how light acts on eab by designing a electrochemical system to test the effects of illumination using indium tin oxide ito glass as the working electrode this study specifically investigated 1 the micromorphology of eabs with or without light exposure 2 the electrochemical behavior of eabs under different light intensities 3 the shift in microbial community composition of eabs in response to light exposure 4 the variation of electro conductivity of eps after light exposure these results have contributed to our understanding of how eab can be shaped by light and provide insights that can help predictions about the formation and properties of engineered eab in outdoor environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 test system construction the test system consisted of a three electrode anaerobic reactor controlled by a potentiostat chi 660e ch instrument usa fig 1 and fig s1 the reactor was made of polymethylmethacrylate with a working volume of 120 ml interior dimensions 5 5 5 cm a silicone gasket was used to seal the reactor a 3 3 cm piece of indium tin oxide ito glass thickness 0 1 cm working area 4 cm2 used as the working electrode was placed in the pre set 3 3 cm slot on the bottom plate where it would not interfere with the transmission of light the ito glass was oriented with the conductive surface towards the electrolyte and the nonconductive surface towards the cold light source xd 302 sibei instrument china with the visible light transmittance of 88 the cold light source 150 w was installed 5 cm away from the ito glass it produced a narrow beam of light within the visible wavelengths from 320 nm to 780 nm prior to use the ito glass was degreased by sonication in acetone for 15 min followed by rinsing with deionized water for 5 min and drying at ambient temperature a piece of hollow squared stainless steel sheet was used as electron receiver and was compressed against the conductive surface of the ito glass the connection of the stainless steel sheet and ito glass was good because of the surrounding contract design and the relatively large contact area ratio 55 6 a 3 3 cm piece of graphite sheet thickness 0 5 cm was used as the counter electrode facing towards the ito electrode the ag agcl 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode reference electrode was held near the ito electrode the distance between the graphite and ito electrodes was 4 2 cm but between the ito and reference electrodes was 2 6 cm 2 2 inoculation and operation the test system was inoculated with the supernatant of domestic wastewater from preliminary sedimentation tank after removing large flocs which might influence the formation of microcolonies on the ito glass the medium contained anhydrous sodium acetate 1 g l in 50 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs containing trace minerals and vitamins kcl 0 13 g l nh4cl 0 31 g l nah2po4 2h2o 3 32 g l na2hpo4 12 h2o 10 32 g l vitamins 5 ml l and trace minerals 12 5 ml l dong et al 2015 before being injected into the reactor the electrolyte was deoxygenated using pure argon gas to avoid oxygen reduction reactions on the electrode the tests were performed in constant potential mode at 0 2 v vs ag agcl as previously described matsuda et al 2011 and the current was recorded every 100 s the light intensities were set to 0 lux 600 lux and 1200 lux corresponding to the eabs named eab 0 eab 600 and eab 1200 respectively all tests were conducted in triplicate at 30 c to avoid the influence of temperature on electricity generation the tests were terminated after the current decreased to a stable state 2 3 cod measurement and electrochemical characterization the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod was measured using the apha standard method apha 2005 before measurement samples were first filtered through 0 45 μm pore diameter syringe filters the electrochemical characteristics of the biofilms were examined using cyclic voltammetry cv at the end of each test the working counter and reference electrodes were the same as previously described and the electrolyte contained acetate 1 g l the cv was performed from 0 6 to 0 4 v vs ag agcl at multiple scan rates i e 1 5 20 50 mv s to examine the effect of scan rate on current generation the first derivative cv dcv was calculated from cv data by plotting the slope of each cv data point against the electrode potential v which determined the changes in each peak value linear sweep voltammetry lsv was conducted to examine the electrochemical activity of the eabs under different illumination levels and was performed at a scan rate of 0 5 mv s from 0 6 to 0 4 v electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis of eabs was conducted at polarized potential 0 2 v vs ag agcl over the frequency range from 100 khz to 0 01 hz in the corresponding light environment for the analysis of the internal resistance each biofilm was stabilized at the polarized potential for 1 h before the eis tests nyquist plots were fitted according to the equivalent circuit described in a previous study li et al 2020 2 4 eab micromorphology observation true color photography of eab was obtained using an optical microscope stereo discovery v20 carl zeiss germany through the 10x objective the micromorphology of the eab was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope sem fei quanta 200f prior to imaging an electronically conductive au coating was applied to each eab sample to reduce charging in the sem confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was used to visualize the spatial distribution of proteins in the interior eab layers because electron transfer was closely associated with the outer membrane and extracellular redox active proteins in the region closer to electrode liu and bond 2012 the interior eab samples were first taken from the ito glass and placed on slides fig s2 and fig s3 the samples were then fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 12 h followed by fluorescent staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma st louis mo to visualize proteins in brief nahco3 buffer 0 1 m was added to the samples to retain the amine groups in their non protonated forms thereafter fitc 1 g l dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide was added and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 1 h after the samples were stained they were washed with pbs ph 7 2 to remove excess stain the stained samples were observed through a clsm lsm880 carl zeiss germany the excitation emission wavelengths used to observe fitc were 488 520 nm green 2 5 biomass and microbial community analyses proteins were extracted from the eab samples and measured using a bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china according to the manufacturer s instructions the eab samples under different light intensities were collected by scraping the surface of ito glass total genomic dna was extracted from all samples using a bacteria dna mini kit w6511 watson biotechnologies inc china according to the manufacturer s instructions and assessed by electrophoresis in 1 agarose gels the bacterial 16s rdna pcr was performed using 515f and 806r primers targeting the variable region v4 forward primer 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 reverse primer 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the amplicons were subsequently determined on an illumina miseq sequencing platform by novogene beijing china the sequencing data were then processed using the dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 including trimming sequencing error correction filtering abundance estimation and taxonomy assignment as open source package dada2 is derived from the divisive amplicon denoising algorithm dada which corrects illumina sequenced amplicon errors after that the shared and unique otus were compared between the samples from different light conditions lu et al 2012 these data were used to calculate species richness and diversity using the chao 1 and shannon diversity indices results were reported based on the averages of three samples collected from within trisected regions of the ito glass 2 6 eps analysis and measurement of redox properties the eps was extracted from the eabs using previously reported methods frolund et al 1996 firstly the eabs were stirred for 2 h at 4 c with resin the eps was then harvested by centrifugation for 30 min at 4000 g and filtering the supernatant by 0 45 μm filtration membrane the total protein content of the eps was measured using bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china polysaccharose content was evaluated using the anthrone method loewus 1952 the redox states of the eps were established by determining their electron accepting capacity eac mediated by the electrochemical reduction mer method and electron donating capacity edc mediated by the electrochemical oxidation meo method aeschbacher et al 2010 these were measured by chronoamperometry using an electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instrument usa a glassy carbon cylinder with an effective volume of 20 ml served both as electrochemical reaction vessel and the working electrode we a platinum sheet 1 2 cm and ag agcl were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode respectively the electrochemical test was conducted in a buffer solution 0 05 m pbs kcl 0 13 g l nah2po4 2h2o 3 32 g l and na2hpo4 12 h2o 10 32 g l adjust to ph 7 0 under constant stirring and n2 flow the mer and meo were performed with an applied potential of 0 49 v and 0 61 v vs she diquat dibromide monohydrate dq and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium salt abts were used as electron shuttles in the mer and meo experiments respectively the specific potentials of 0 49 v and 0 61 v were chosen due to the stability of dq and abts at potentials sufficiently low mediator in mer or high mediator in meo to cover the potential range that triggering electron transfer from the redox active moieties in the eps aeschbacher et al 2010 spiking the mediators dq for mer and abts for meo can result in reductive and oxidative currents respectively the eps concentrates containing 0 2 mg 0 3 mg 0 4 mg and 0 5 mg of eps were successively added to the vessel after the background current stabilized fig s4 and table s1 before being injected into the vessel the eps concentrate was temporarily stored in refrigerator 4 c to minimize activity change over time 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical characteristics of eab current generation by eab 0 lasted 13 days and it peaked after 5 5 days reaching a current of 4 5 a m2 after which the current decreased gradually and neared zero after 11 days in light treatments however observed currents were orders of magnitude lower with the current peaking at 2 3 10 2 a m2 eab 600 and 8 1 10 4 a m2 eab 1200 with light illumination the cycle time was much shorter than in darkness 9 and 7 days for 600 and 1200 lux respectively fig s5a c the peak current in these treatments were attained earlier on the 5th and 3rd days respectively notably the higher biomass yield obtained in the light treatments did not translate into improved current output although it accelerated the rate of current increase the specific biofilm electroactivity be ma g protein was used to character the electroactivity of eab which was calculated by normalizing the current to the measured protein content of biomass on the ito glass b biomass the be for eab 0 was 1 45 103 ma g protein which was significantly higher than 5 56 and 0 18 ma g protein for eab 600 and eab 1200 p 0 01 student s t test this suggested that a major portion of the protein components in the eab under light conditions was poorly correlated with the electron transfer process during the experimental period the eabs exhibited a variety of scod removal abilities fig s6 in the eab 0 the scod removal efficiency was 97 1 resulting in an effluent containing a scod of 22 3 6 1 mg l however the electrochemical systems experiencing 600 and 1200 lux illumination only achieved scod removal efficiencies of 63 1 and 41 1 with corresponding effluent scod concentrations of 300 7 12 5 and 486 3 10 5 mg l the maximum scod removal rate was 61 4 1 5 g m3 day by eab 0 which was 18 and 40 higher than those by eab 600 51 9 2 1 g m3 day and by eab 1200 43 9 1 5 g m3 day respectively the average current efficiency of the electrochemical system was relatively low only 67 1 due to the relatively small working electrode area to reactor volume ratio 0 03 cm2 ml which resulted in notable proportions of scod being removed by anaerobic respiration however the current efficiencies were reduced to almost zero 0 5 when illuminated indicating that the scod removal process did not rely on the electrochemical process cyclic voltammetry cv was used to examine the electron transfer performance of eabs under different operational conditions fig 2 a there were no redox peaks in the blank biofilm less ito electrode and the peak currents all increased with the increase of scan rate as previous reported fig s7 the similar sigmoidal waves at different scan rates were obtained from eab 0 showing that the eab followed a typical electron transfer model of geobacter dominated eabs fig s7a patil et al 2010 however there were no significant sigmoidal waves at different scan rates for both eab 600 and eab 1200 fig s7b and s7c the peak currents of eab 1200 at each scan rate were similar with those for the blank ito electrode implying the low electroactivity of biofilm under intense light exposure a dominant electrochemical active range centered at 0 372 0 004 v was detected in the oxidation dcv curve and the only main peak was centered at 0 378 0 003 v in the reduction dcv curve fig 2b and s8 these two inflection points in the oxidative and reductive processes were also observed in other studies fricke et al 2008 the dcv curve also revealed inflection points for the oxidation and reduction potentials for eab 600 but these inflection points had all but disappeared for eab 1200 the lsv curve indicated that there was no significant current output for the blank ito glass in darkness or under light conditions the current sharply increased to 0 119 ma after enrichment of electroactive bacteria in darkness however the currents only increased to 0 013 ma and 0 007 ma for eab 600 and eab 1200 this lsv result further demonstrated that the light exposure interfered with eab enrichment and led to deteriorated electroactivity fig s5d it has been reported that the electron transfer from geobacter species to electrodes is accomplished by outer membrane cytochromes such as omce omcs and omcz with the main redox peak centered at 0 363 0 003 v pessanha et al 2006 the dominant redox peak found at 0 372 0 004 v in this study most likely corresponded to the reported value 0 363 0 003 v other electrochemical behavior included peaks 1 3 and 4 centered at 0 481 0 003 v 0 331 002 v and 0 125 002 v respectively fig 2b these values were all within the reported potentials for omcs ranging from 0 570 to 0 250 v leang et al 2010 and potentials for omcz ranging from 0 630 to 0 270 v inoue et al 2010 thus it is likely that these redox peaks were derived from a combination of different outer membrane cytochromes in the eab exposed to light however the main redox peaks were blurred and the minor peaks had disappeared this demonstrated the degradation caused by light exposure on the overall electrochemical performance this may have been caused by a reduction in the outer membrane cytochromes which facilitate the electron exchange between the electrode and bacteria possibly due to decreased cytochrome activity or reduced quantity of electroactive bacteria 3 2 eab characterization sem was used to examine how the micromorphology of eabs changed under different light intensities fig 3 the ito glass had been uniformly covered by biofilm after one cycle in batch mode with the duration time of 13 9 and 7 days for eab 0 eab 600 and eab 1200 there were obvious differences in bacterial attachment at different light illumination levels the eab 0 was composed of uniform well ordered rod shaped bacteria fig 3a 1 and a 2 however the arrangement of the bacteria in eab 600 and eab 1200 became disorganized and the shapes of bacteria became heterogeneous for example the size of the bacteria significantly decreased in eab 1200 and the boundaries between bacteria became indistinct compared with that in eab 0 fig 3c 1 and c 2 notably the filament like structures that span between bacteria were observed in eab 0 but their presence was reduced significantly when the culture was exposed to light these filament like structures have been found in other biofilms serving functions related to motility adhesion to solid surfaces and environmental sensing anderson et al 2010 however many studies have noted that the filament like structures were more common in eab kouzuma et al 2015 making it reasonable to speculate that the filament like structures in eab may help electroactive bacteria to recognize and communicate with conspecifics or those bacteria occupying a similar ecological niche besides the electrons produced by the electroactive bacteria could be directly transferred to the electrode via this filament like structures as previous reported fig 3a 3 patil et al 2012 the thickness of eab 0 was only 30 μm after 13 days of culture fig 3a 4 however the thickness of eab 600 and eab 1200 increased to about 300 μm in just 9 and 7 days fig 3b 4 and c 4 respectively and the space between the bacteria and ito glass was occupied by extracellular viscous substance this result indicated the adhesion mechanism of bacteria to ito glass changed when experiencing the combined effects of electrochemical stimulation and light exposure the biomass densities were considerably different when viewed at the macroscopic level fig s9 the total biomass t biomass increased from 11 4 1 8 to 38 5 1 6 mg l n 3 with increases in light intensity there were significant differences between the t biomass p 0 01 student s t test of different systems the biomass in the solution s biomass also differed significantly between the light illumination treatments p 0 01 student s t test the s biomass of the system under light illumination of 1200 lux was 22 7 1 5 mg l which was 22 fold higher than that without illumination 1 0 0 3 mg l the dynamic development of eabs was monitored by measuring the biomass on the ito glass b biomass during the batch mode fig s10 the biomass yield of eab 0 increased slowly to 0 8 0 1 mg l in the initial 2 days of adaptation phase and then it sharply increased to 9 5 0 8 mg l in the following 8 days finally stabilized around 10 5 1 1 mg l the light exposure accelerated the biomass accumulation of eab 600 and eab 1200 compared with eab 0 due to the rapid multiplication of bacteria bacterial cells in the test system existed in one of two forms planktonic or sessile the ratio of b biomass sessile to t biomass sessile planktonic decreased from 91 to 41 demonstrating that 1 the majority of biomass had attached to the surface of ito glass in darkness and 2 the introduction of light induced increases in metabolism of the bacteria in solution true color photographs were taken to show the actual states of eabs under the different light intensities fig 4 a 1 b 1 and c 1 the photographs revealed the formation of spherical aggregates on the ito glass the spherical aggregates were pink with diameters ranging between 30 and 100 μm however as the light intensity increased the spherical aggregates were gradually replaced by a dense and flat biofilm at the highest light intensity eab 1200 the color of the eab was reddish and no spherical aggregates were observed this reddish color was associated with the accumulation of cytochromes of the bacteria seeliger et al 1998 spherical aggregates have also been reported in other studies in which the electrochemical environment they used promoted eab development du et al 2018 this spherical aggregate type growth pattern was likely determined by a combination of factors here that included plate electrode moderate electrochemical stimulation intercellular electrostatic interaction and cell condensation by eps secretion the images obtained through the protein staining and clsm showed that the eab was morphologically heterogenous with proteins being clearly detectable in the interior layers of all eabs fig 4a 2 b 2 and c 2 proteins were dispersed throughout the field of view in the eab 0 when exposed to light however the protein content was reduced relative to the dark treatment from the perspective of spatial distributions proteins were uniformly distributed throughout the depth of the biofilm in darkness but were sporadically distributed in the light treatments the higher protein content in the interior layer eps of eab 0 was due to the secretion of redox active proteins by electroactive bacteria which accelerated the electron transfer between bacteria and electrode resulting in the higher electroactivity of eab 0 however the interior layer protein content decreased in eab 600 and eab 1200 demonstrated relatively lower electron transfer efficiency in the region closer to the electrode which agreed with the poor current generation performance this eps data see section 3 4 showed that eab grown under light condition preferentially stored polysaccharides over proteins this result might be attributed to the succession of dominant species in eab from geobacter species in darkness to rhodopseudomonas species under light conditions see section 3 3 accompanied by reduced secretion of eps associated redox active proteins liu and bond 2012 3 3 microbial analysis based on α diversity statistics it could be inferred that light exposure had a large impact on the structure of the microbial communities in the eabs from 164 465 sequences we saw that the eab 0 and eab 600 had 214 otus in common with 249 and 181 unique otus respectively the eab 0 and eab 1200 shared 231 otus and 236 otus were shared between eab 600 and eab 1200 there were 157 otus that were shared among all three eabs fig 5 most otus belonged to the class proteobacteria accounting for 90 82 and 92 of the sequences in the eab 0 eab 600 eab 1200 respectively most confirmed electroactive bacteria belong to proteobacteria logan 2009 bacteroidetes a putative phylum of exoelectrogens xing et al 2009 also represented a dominant phyla in the eabs by calculating the chao 1 and shannon diversity indices clear differences were found among the eab samples table s2 for example according to the chao 1 index the microbial species richness of the eab in darkness was higher than those exposed to light 0 01 p 0 05 student s t test however the microbial species evenness of eabs exposed to light was relatively higher compared to the eab cultured in darkness 0 01 p 0 05 student s t test these α diversity statistics demonstrated that the introduction of light increased interspecific homogeneity at the cost of there being fewer species at the genus level electroactive bacteria were found in all the eab samples but at different abundances geobacter species which are model exoelectrogens inoue et al 2010 accounted for 85 of the bacteria in the eab 0 however that percentage was drastically lower i e 1 in eabs exposed to light aminiphilus species members of the synergistetes phylum were present in relatively high abundances 4 eab 0 these have been previously reported as a stable core genus in acetate fed microelectrochemical systems lesnik and liu 2014 another model exoelectrogens shewanella species was also detected at the relatively high abundance of 2 in eab 0 but in this case that percentage increased to 9 in the eab 1200 the higher proportion of shewanella species under strong light illumination may indicate they have a symbiotic relationship with another species based on the species level analysis rhodopseudomonas palustris was the bacteria most positively influenced by light exposure as its abundances were 66 and 75 in the eab 600 and eab 1200 respectively there was a significant positive correlation between light intensity and the abundance of r palustris pearson s r 0 918 r palustris is an iron oxidizing photoautotrophic bacteria which can fix co2 in the presence of light using ferrous iron fe ii as the electron source jiao and newman 2007 previous studies have shown that r palustris can accept electrons from a solid electrode or electron donating bacteria such as geobacter sulfurreducens guzman et al 2019 this metabolic pathway with r palustris facilitating electron exchange could explain the success of shewanella species in eab exposed to light with syntrophic anaerobic photosynthesis proceeding via direct interspecies electron transfer fig 6 however why this facilitation would benefit shewanella species and not geobacter species remains unclear an abundance variation analysis at the genus level was performed to reveal how light exposure shaped the microbial communities of the eab fig 7 the analysis showed that there were obvious differences between eabs developed in darkness vs those developed in light but the difference between the different light intensities 600 and 1200 lux was not significant taking geobacter species as an example of a typical exoelectrogens we see that the differences between eab 0 and eab 600 and between eab 0 and eab 1200 were both significant 95 confidence interval this showed that typical exoelectrogens were depleted in illuminated conditions similarly there were significant differences in rhodopseudomonas species between eab 0 and both eab 600 and eab 1200 p 0 05 however no statistical difference was observed between eab 600 and eab 1200 for any of the genera with abundances 0 5 including rhodopseudomonas species aminiphilus species shewanella species aeromonas species pseudomonas species fusibacter species dysgonomonas species and rhodobacter species therefore based on the abundance variation analysis light exposure resulted in the high abundance of rhodopseudomonas species while a completely dark environment was more suitable for geobacter species 3 4 discussion using an inoculum from a domestic wastewater system this study demonstrated that the microbial communities within eab with electrochemical stimulation changed significantly when exposed to light the sem and true color photography images of the eabs showed that a thinner electroactive biofilm had developed in darkness despite the longer acclimation period in darkness the eab consisted of spherical pink aggregates uniformly distributed on the ito glass while under lighted conditions the eab was denser and no spherical aggregates formed the change in biomass content showed that light accelerated the accumulation of biomass accumulation on the ito glass as well as in solution the 16s rdna sequencing data revealed that geobacter species and rhodopseudomonas species were the dominant genera in the eab 0 and eab 600 1200 respectively when considering both the relative abundances and biomass productions in the test system the absolute quantities of rhodopseudomonas species in both eab 600 and eab 1200 were much higher than geobacter species in eab 0 p 0 01 student s t test therefore it can be concluded that the illuminated environment overwhelmingly benefitted rhodopseudomonas species the eps which primarily consists of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides plays an important role in determining the structure of biofilms so the components of the eps were measured to investigate the eab construction strategy fig s11 in this research the eps produced by eab 0 had 2073 160 mg m2 polysaccharides which was nearly twice as much as the protein 1083 85 mg m2 however the polysaccharide protein ratio in the eab 1200 treatment was 3 3 with an absolute quantity of polysaccharides of 4801 253 mg m2 this eps data showed that eab grown in light preferentially stored polysaccharides over proteins the three possible mechanism by which polysaccharides were accumulated were 1 the substrate was sufficiently abundant for rhodopseudomonas species to store energy 2 the thicker eab matrix when exposed to light requires the support of polysaccharides or 3 the colonization and aggregation of rhodopseudomonas species on the ito surface relied more heavily on polysaccharides in contrast to the filament like structures that were abundant in colonies of geobacter species however the higher secretion of eps did not appear to contribute to current output and consequently prevented the complete mineralization of the substrate the thin eab observed in darkness was believed to favor electron transfer between electroactive bacteria and the electrode while the thick eab likely limited current output by interfering with the mass transfer process eps in thick eab has been shown to function as a conductive network that transfers electrons by utilizing the extracellular proteinaceous substance yang et al 2019 therefore the capacity of eps to transfer electrons both accepting and donating was evaluated by mer and meo analyses fig 8 the meo results returned edcs of 0 068 0 012 0 018 0 004 0 016 0 003 μmol e mg eps for eab 0 eab 600 and eab 1200 respectively correspondingly the maximum eac was found in the eps of eab 0 0 152 0 029 μmol e mg eps followed by the eab 600 0 079 0 015 μmol e mg eps and the eab 1200 0 060 0 003 μmol e mg eps the elevated eac and edc in eab 0 reflected the excellent electron exchange capability of the eps which was capable of assisting distant bio electron transfer which was consistent with the current output considering the polysaccharide protein ratio the over secretion of insulative polysaccharides in the eab 600 and eab 1200 generated great resistance resulting in low electron transfer capacity polysaccharide production has been shown to be closely associated with environmental stress and may serve as a protective layer for cells in addition to energy storage han et al 2017 the accumulation of polysaccharides in the eab 600 and eab 1200 was likely a response to light exposure which may be an ecological strategy to increase survival in high light environments at the cost of decreasing electron transfer capacity besides the thicker eab 600 and eab 1200 also impeded the substrate diffusion inside the biofilm evidenced by the higher internal resistance fig s12 which also reduced the electroactivity of eabs under light conditions light exposure can shape the structure and function of biofilms though it has been observed before the effect of light on the growth of bacteria from wastewater on polarized surfaces has rarely been studied in this study light exposure was found to completely alter the micromorphology and electrochemical performance of eab low light or dark environments appeared to increase the electroactivity of eab while light exposure had the opposite effect the deteriorated electroactivity of eab after light exposure was due to a combination of factors here that included substrate diffusion limitation through the thicker biofilm depletion of geobacter species interception of electrons by rhodopseudomonas species lower electro conductivity of eps according these results low light or dark environments should be maintained in order to accumulate communities of electroactive bacteria in thin eab creating biofilms with lower biomass but more efficient pollutant removal performance which will perform better in engineered systems 4 conclusion this study comprehensively elucidated the responses of eab to light exposure based on the results it can be concluded that 1 a thin eab 30 μm with spherical pink aggregates was obtained in the darkness which exhibited much higher electrochemical activity compared with the dense and flat eabs grown under light exposure 2 completely dark environment was more suitable for geobacter species 85 while rhodopseudomonas species were preferentially enriched with geobacter species sharply decreased to 1 under lighted conditions 3 the electro conductivity of eab decreased after light exposure due to over secretion of nonconductive extracellular polysaccharide in the eps 4 finally to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to gain full insight into eab enrichment by taking the light exposure into consideration our results suggested the low light or dark environments should be provided for highly active engineered eab development in

17451,comprehensive identification of byproducts including intermediate transformation products tps of micropollutants in source water is challenging and paramount for assessment of drinking water quality and treatment technologies here we have developed a nontargeted analysis strategy coupled with computational toxicity assessment to identify indistinguishable tps including isomers with large differences in toxicity the new strategy was applied to study the uv treatment of water containing micropollutant 2 mercaptobenzothiazole 2 mbt and it enabled successful identification of a total of 22 organic tps particularly the structures of nine new tps were identified for the first time in addition three isomers p2 p3 and p4 were distinguished from the toxic contaminant 2 hydroxybenzothiazole 2 oh bt computational assessments indicate that estrogenic activity of the three isomers p2 p4 is higher than that of 2 oh bt mass balance study shows that the 22 organic products accounted for 70 of the 2 mbt degraded while 30 may degrade to inorganic products most tps are resistant to uv photolysis computational toxicity assessment predicted the tps to increase inhibition of human thyroperoxidase activity although they have lower aquatic toxicity compared to original 2 mbt this study emphasizes the importance of monitoring the 2 mbt photodegradation products and the overall toxicity of finished water whose production included a uv light based treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nontargeted analysis disinfection byproducts dbps transformation product benzothiazole photochemical degradation computational toxicity 1 introduction micropollutants present in both source water and recycled water for potable reuse remain a health concern alsbaiee et al 2016 merle et al 2020 during water disinfection processes micropollutants can transform into a number of disinfection byproducts dbps that may have higher persistence and or toxicity than their parent compounds richardson and kimura 2017 recent studies have shown that mixtures of different dbps can produce additive effects of cytotoxicity genotoxicity and or other biological effects lau et al 2020 mestankova et al 2016 advanced engineering solutions are required to remove micropollutants and their byproducts bond et al 2020 therefore it is insufficient to identify only parent micropollutants for controlling drinking water quality instead a rather comprehensive identification of the trace levels of transformation products tps produced during the treatment of water containing micropollutants is advisable comprehensive identification of tps is analytically challenging because of their trace levels and lack of standards and instrumental sensitivity benzothiazoles an important group of heterocyclic compounds have multiple uses among which as fungicides in a variety of consumer products e g tires and food avagyan et al 2014 he et al 2011 margenat et al 2018 and as vulcanization accelerators in rubber manufacturing luongo et al 2016 reddy and quinn 1997 due to their widespread use benzothiazoles are listed as high production volume chemicals particularly 2 mercaptobenzothiazole is most widely used in rubber plumbing components that are in contact with drinking water the estimated annual production in the early 2000s exceeded 40 000 tons in western europe alone consequently benzothiazoles have been widely detected at concentrations ranging from sub ng l to mg l levels in tap water groundwater and surface waters liao et al 2018 seel and et al 2012 wang et al 2016 for instance the occurrence of 2 mbt was reported in the drinking water of ahvaz city in water samples collected from the karun river esmaile et al 2020 and the riverine runoff of the pearl river delta with average concentrations of 24 3 87 4 ng l ni et al 2008 toxicity studies of benzothiazoles have shown potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms and human health avagyan et al 2014 fries 2011 rodríguez et al 2004 wang et al 2016 including genotoxicity cytotoxicity carcinogenicity as well as modulation of the thyroid hormone liao et al 2018 the predicted no effect concentration pnec and lowest observed effect concentration loec were reported as 0 82 µg l and 78 µg l respectively european union eu 2008 additionally occupational exposure to 2 mbt is potentially associated with an increased risk of developing bladder cancer in workers sorahan 2009 usepa 2016 current wastewater treatment processes such as uv disinfection chlorination and ozonation either do not result in the efficient removal of micropollutants containing the benzothiazole structural entity liao et al 2018 or can lead to byproducts preserving the benzothiazole ring such as 2 hydroxybenzothiazole and benzothiazole bt in the treated water fiehn et al 1998 existing studies indicate that benzothiazoles can transform to other products during water treatment but comprehensive identification of their transformation products is still desirable understanding the formation of tps during the water treatment and their impact on water quality as a whole is critical for ensuring safe water for people and the aquatic species uv light based advanced oxidation processes uv aops were widely implemented to remediate natural waters or recycled water from persistent micropollutants while achieving enhanced disinfection for the purpose of potable water production stefan 2018 several studies have reported that uv based aops are efficient at degrading benzothiazoles in water andreozzi et al 2001 habibi et al 2001 malouki et al 2004 redouane salah et al 2018 serdechnova et al 2014 zajíčková and párkányi 2008 the photodegradation kinetics of several benzothiazoles were also reported bahnmüller et al 2015 serdechnova et al 2014 zajíčková and párkányi 2008 but their transformation products largely remain unknown for instance previous studies reported that the photochemical degradation of 2 mbt mainly resulted in the formation of bt and 2 oh bt while up to 68 of products were unidentified primarily due to the inability of the employed methods to detect accurately low analyte concentrations brownlee et al 1992 therefore highly sensitive methods are required for comprehensive identification and quantification of the tps of benzothiazoles han and zhang 2018 jiang et al 2020 recent studies highlighted the ability of nontargeted analysis using high resolution mass spectrometry hrms to obtain comprehensive information about the unknown tps at trace levels in wastewater and drinking water fu et al 2017 liberatore et al 2017 tang et al 2020 tang et al 2016 herein we report on the development of a novel nontargeted strategy using high performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry hplc hrms to comprehensively identify molecular structures of the unknown products of 2 mbt in water upon uv treatment the identified tps were confirmed when standards were available the mass balance of tps was analysed over the uv degradation of 2 mbt based on the identified tps and their patterns over the uv exposure times we postulated the mechanism of 2 mbt photodegradation lastly we applied established computational assessment methods to evaluate potential aquatic toxicity and the effects of 2 mbt and its tps on the enzyme hormones regulating the thyroid function to identify the tps of toxicological relevance to the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting on mass balance in combination with the computational toxicity estimates for unknown tps and their isomers generated during uv photolysis of benzothiazoles in water the outcomes of this study on 2 mbt photolysis raise the awareness on the need for a comprehensive approach to the examination of micropollutant treatment in water and on potential unintended consequences on the treated water quality 2 materials and

fisher scientific ottawa on canada phosphoric acid h3po4 85 was obtained from caledon laboratories ltd georgetown on canada the 2 mbt 10 mg ml stock solution was prepared in acn every two weeks and kept in amber glass vials with minimum headspace to reduce eliminate the slow oxidation of 2 mbt in the dark by the oxygen present at ambient conditions stock solutions for other bt derivatives and 2 aminobenzaldehyde 0 33 20 mg ml were prepared individually in acn all stock solutions were stored in amber glass vials in the refrigerator at 4 c the stock solutions of kh2po4 50 mm naoh 100 mm and h3po4 100 mm were prepared separately in optima water phosphate buffer 0 5 mm was prepared by diluting the concentrated stock kh2po4 solution and adjusting ph to the required value using naoh or h3po4 stock solutions 2 2 uv experimental set up uv photolysis of 2 mbt was performed with a bench scale collimated beam device as shown in fig s1 two 8w uvc germicidal lamps lzc uvc 01 luzchem research inc ottawa on canada emitting primarily at 253 7 nm were mounted at the top center of the photoreactor luzchem lzc 4v the aperture diameter for the collimated uv light beam was 11 5 cm sample aliquots of 46 ml were transferred to a crystallizing dish 60 mm diameter 35 mm depth vwr radnor pa usa and exposed to the uv radiation for predetermined periods of time the distance from the lamps to the solution surface was 17 9 cm and the sample depth was 2 1 cm the uv irradiance at the surface of water was measured with a uvx model digital radiometer during the irradiation the water sample was stirred continuously the average uv fluence was calculated according to the standardized method reported by bolton and linden bolton and linden 2003 details on the uv fluence calculations are given in section s1 and table s1 in this study the target uv fluences were set at 500 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 and 6000 mj cm2 for the uv irradiation experiments the 2 mbt about 500 µg l working solution was prepared by adding 50 µl of 2 mbt stock solution 10 mg ml in acn to 1 l volumetric flask with phosphate buffer 0 5 mm at ph 7 6 the acn content in the working solution was 0 005 the working solution was protected from the ambient light with aluminum foil over the duration of the experiments the uv absorbance of the working solution was measured in triplicate within 1 h before irradiation to confirm the complete dissolution and stability of 2 mbt and an average value was considered for uv fluence calculation at the end of each exposure a 10 ml aliquot of uv irradiated 2 mbt solution was taken for immediate uv absorbance measurement a 2 ml aliquot was taken for hplc ms analysis without pretreatment the remaining irradiated solution was kept for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and ic analysis all aliquots were kept in amber glass vials without headspace 2 3 nontargeted hplc hrms analysis the analytes in the 2 mbt solutions before and after uv irradiation were separated on an accucore c18 column 150 2 1 mm i d 2 6 μm pore size 80 å thermo scientific waltham ma usa using an agilent hplc system agilent 1290 hplc a quadrupole time of flight qtof high resolution mass spectrometer sciex x500r sciex concord on canada with a turbo v electrospray ionization esi source was used in positive and negative modes to obtain accurate mass measurements of the m h or m h ions the details of the hplc hrms conditions were described in section s2 tandem mass ms ms spectra were collected for each sample using information dependent acquisition ida mode the scan cycle of ida contained two experiments the first experiment was designed to run a full scan analysis and the second experiment was used to collect ms ms spectra of 10 most intense molecular ions whose intensity exceeded a designated value i e 1000 cps in this study the ida parameters were presented in section s3 qualitative and quantitative data analysis was performed using sciex os software a nontargeted strategy was used for identification of 2 mbt and its degradation products in detail each solution before and after uv treatment for 1 5 min to 25 min was analyzed using nontargeted analysis of the hplc hrms under predefined parameters the acquired hplc hrms data file contained the retention time m h from positive esi or m h from negative esi and peak intensity by comparing the data from the sample 2 mbt solutions exposed to the uv radiation to the control 2 mbt solutions kept in the dark we identified peaks that were detected exclusively in the sample but not in the control a peak was considered as a newly formed product when its signal intensity in the sample was 10 times higher than the background for the identification of the degradation products generated during the uv exposure of 2 mbt solutions we acquired the accurate m z m h or m h and ms ms spectra of the products using the ida experiments commercial authentic standards when available were purchased for confirmation of the products additionally the quantitation of the new compounds was performed using external calibration curves 2 4 analysis of inorganic anions ion chromatography dionex dx 600 was used to examine the generation of inorganic degradation products i e no2 no3 and so4 2 from uv irradiation of 2 mbt solutions the work was done in the biogeochemical analytical service laboratory basl at the university of alberta using the us epa method 300 1 the total of no2 and no3 was measured using a lachat quickchem qc8500 flow injection analysis automated ion analyzer at basl as described in the us epa method 353 2 2 5 computational assessment of aquatic toxicity and effects on thyroid enzyme function the aquatic toxicity of 2 mbt and its tps was assessed using the ecological structure activity relationships ecosar model usepa 2020 herein fish was selected as a target aquatic species due to the significance as food for many species including humans the aquatic toxicity to fish is expressed as median lethal concentration lc50 after fish 96 h exposure the lowest effect concentration was reported considering the conservative prediction for the precautionary principle to assess potential human health effects we examined effects of 2 mbt and its tps on thyroid hormones using danish qsar database consisting of over 650 000 compounds danish q sar 2015 rosenberg et al 2016 thyroperoxidase tpo is the key enzyme for synthesise of thyroid hormones thus we focused on the inhibition effect of 2 mbt and tps on tpo activity the danish qsar model predicts probability p value between 0 and 1 for a test compound to inhibit tpo activity as the p value close to 1 the ability of the test compound to inhibit tpo activity is higher in addition to the tests described above the estrogenic activity of transformation products was evaluated using virtualtoxlab package vedani et al 2015 vedani et al 2012 vedani and smiesko 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 nontargeted identification of tps positive esi initial uv spectrometry measurements of the samples before and after uv irradiation indicated the photodegradation of 2 mbt supported by the appearance of a new product peak at 217 nm and a significant change in the uv spectrum fig s2 total ion chromatographs recorded during hplc ms analysis only show the disappearance of 2 mbt but no information on byproducts fig s3 the details are described in section s4 5 of supplementary information in order to identify the 2 mbt transformation products and characterize their dynamics upon uv exposure we have developed and applied a nontargeted comprehensive analytical approach the nontargeted strategy involves acquisition of full scan ms data m z 50 500 of the treated and untreated samples comparing the full scan data of the sample with the control to identify new products and followed by a second run in ida mode to acquire ms ms spectra of the new products through comparison of the ms data m z 50 500 of the treated samples with the control sample without uv irradiation twelve unknown peaks were consistently detected in the uv treated samples using hplc qtof ms in positive esi mode fig 1 shows the extracted ion chromatograms eics of the unknowns peaks p1 p12 discovered using the nontargeted strategy among the unknowns peaks p2 p5 had the same m z value of 152 0176 but eluted at different retention times indicating that they are isomers similarly peaks p8 p12 are isomers of m z value of 168 0125 table 1 summarizes the m z values retention times predicted molecular formulas and the corresponding mass errors of the twelve tps peaks p1 12 as well as their confidence levels according to schymanski scale schymanski et al 2014 the determination of the accurate masses of the detected tps enabled the prediction of their molecular formulas the difference between the theoretical and measured molecular weights of the tps was less than 10 ppm supporting their tentative identification to further elucidate the structures of the detected 12 tps table 1 and fig 1 we used the method of hplc qtof ms in ida mode the ida method acquired the accurate mass of precursor ions by tof full scans followed by the ms ms spectra of the product ions p7 was detected as one of the major products the protonated molecular ion of p7 m z 136 0226 predicted its molecular formula as c7h5ns that matched with benzothiazole bt next p7 was confirmed by matching its retention time fig 1 ms and ms ms spectra with those of the benzothiazole standard fig 2 thus p7 was confirmed as benzothiazole furthermore p1 differed from p7 with a unit of so3 as well as a fragment ion matched with m so3 fig 2 after comparing the retention time and ms ms spectrum of p1 with the standard bt so3 we confirmed p1 as benzothiazole 2 sulfonic acid 2 so3 bt peaks p2 p5 had a protonated molecular mass of 152 0176 which differed from benzothiazole p7 by an oxygen atom indicating an oxygen atom added to the benzothiazole structure in the ms ms spectra of p2 p5 a characteristic fragment ion of m z 134 0056 134 0067 was detected corresponding to the loss of the oh group from the precursor molecule i e m oh this observation strongly suggested that p2 p5 were mono hydroxylated benzothiazole isomers to confirm the identity of each isomer we compared p2 p5 with commercially available standards as shown in figs 1 2 the retention times and ms ms spectra of p2 p5 matched those of standards 6 oh bt 5 oh bt 4 oh bt and 2 oh bt respectively 2 oh bt was confirmed with the standard 2 hydroxybenzothiazole additionally the product 2 oh bt can exist in two tautomeric forms as shown in fig s4 similarly p6 had a predicted molecular formula of c7h7no table 1 without any s atoms upon examination of the ms ms spectrum and comparison with the standards p6 was confirmed as 2 aminobenzaldehyde section s6 and figs 1 and 2 low intensity peaks were also detected using the nontargeted strategy for example five peaks were detected with retention time values of 1 99 2 23 2 52 2 96 and 3 67 min due to the low intensity of the ms signals acquisition of the ms ms spectra of these peaks was difficult however based on the one ms ms spectrum collected fig s5 we observed two equivalent mass losses 18 0121 and 17 9986 suggesting that this compound possibly contains two hydroxyl groups the fragment 132 0041 also matched with bt 2h indicating that the parent molecule may contain the bt core structure thus it is reasonable to tentatively identify p8 p12 as the isomers bt oh 2 of di hydroxy bts and their tautomers because of the lack of authentic standards the confirmation of these structures was not possible at this time 3 2 nontargeted identification of tps negative esi using negative esi the nontargeted lc hr ms ms strategy revealed two additional unknowns in the irradiated 500 μg l 2 mbt solution table 1 fig 3a shows the eics of the two unknowns p13 and p14 the intensity of these two peaks was too weak to identify their structures to obtain better quality ms ms spectra fig 3b c for the structure identification we performed the uv irradiation of a 2 mg l 2 mbt solution the accurate mass of p13 181 9913 predicted its molecular formula as c7h5no3s the mass difference between its deprotonated molecular mass 181 9913 and fragment ion m z 118 0296 is 63 9617 corresponding to the loss of an so2 calculated mass 63 9618 group additional loss of a co calculated mass 27 9949 group and a c7h4n calculated mass 102 0344 fragment were observed from 118 0296 to 90 0346 observed mass loss 27 9950 and 181 9913 to 79 9567 observed mass loss 102 0346 respectively furthermore a fragment of 79 9567 matched with so3 calculated mass 79 9573 based on these ms ms fragments and mass losses we proposed two possible structures namely benzo d thiazol 2 3h one 1 1 dioxide a and 2 oxa 2h 1 4 benzothiazine 1 1 dioxide b as depicted in fig s6 the simulated ms ms spectra of the proposed structures were obtained using the sciex os software which were further compared with the experimental spectrum of p13 fig 3b the simulated spectra of structures a and b matched that shown in fig 3b at 61 6 and 93 5 indicating that p13 has a closer resemblance to structure b i e 2 oxa 2h 1 4 benzothiazine 1 1 dioxide similarly the accurate mass of p14 predicted its molecular formula of c7h5no3s3 and its characteristic fragment ions of m z 134 0067 and 165 9790 corresponded to bt and deprotonated mbt respectively the detection of mbt fragment of m z 165 9790 indicated that an s atom was within the bt core structure the mass difference between the parent ion of m z 245 9365 and a fragment ion of m z 165 9790 was 79 9575 corresponding to a neutral loss of so3 therefore p14 was rationally identified as mbt so3 the uv irradiation of 2 mbt at higher concentration 2 mg l enabled the detection of additional unknown products associated with peaks p15 p22 in fig s7 under the original lc conditions these new peaks overlapped making their identities ambiguous to clarify whether these peaks were degradation products or fragments of larger molecules produced in the esi source we modified the lc method to improve their separation as shown in figs s8 s9 these peaks between the two red lines were resolved from each other under the optimized lc conditions of fig s9 this supports that these peaks resulted from uv degradation not fragments in the ion source table s2 presents the accurate masses and the molecular formula of these tps including the eight compounds detected in fig s7 the ms ms spectra figs s10 s13 were also acquired for the peaks listed in table s2 the two spectra in figs s10 s13 are very similar indicating that these are structure isomers for example in fig s10a b the presence of fragments of 134 0057 a and b and 165 9789 a 165 9815 b suggested that both p15 and p16 had the m h of 245 9350 and molecular formula of c7h5ns3o3 and contained the 2 mbt structure meanwhile the mass difference between the fragment ion 181 9 and the parent ion 245 9 matched with the loss of an so2 unit the mass difference between the fragment ion 165 9 and parent ion 245 9 matched with the loss of an so3 unit therefore the p15 and p16 were rationally identified as 2 mbt derivatives with a o so2h group p17 and p18 had similar ms ms spectra suggesting them as isomers as shown in fig s11 a and b for instance the mass difference between m z 229 9620 and m z 165 9973 matched with the loss of an so2 unit while the mass difference between m z 229 9620 and 201 9664 corresponded to the loss of co in addition the fragment ions of m z 150 0031 150 0045 matched with the deprotonated hydroxylated bt thus p17 and p18 were identified as bt derivatives substituted with two oh groups and one so2 group similarly the ms ms spectra of p19 and p20 fig s12a b suggested them as bt derivatives substituted with one oh group and one so2 group the accurate masses of the unknowns p21 and p22 predicted their molecular formula of c6h7ns2o3 indicating the opening of the bt core structure the mass shift from 203 9790 to 171 0019 was 32 9771 in agreement with the loss of an sh group the mass shift from 203 9790 to 124 0234 is 79 9556 matched with the loss of an so3 unit these suggested that p21 and p22 resulted from the opening of a thiazole ring and with the loss of a carbon i e the 2 aminothiophenol structure p21 and p22 were identified as 2 aminothiophenol so3 the accurate mass and ms ms spectra of the unknowns p15 22 suggested their structures as shown in scheme 1 in short the nontargeted hplc hrms approach enabled the identification of the nine new products p2 p4 p13 p16 p21 p22 for the first time adding new information about the photodegradation of 2 mbt to previously reported products including benzothiazole 2 sulfonate p1 2 hydroxybenzothiazole p5 benzothiazole p7 in wastewater effluents and surface water summarized in table s3 li et al 2006 malouki et al 2004 serdechnova et al 2014 zajíčková and párkányi 2008 2009 the occurrence of these products p1 p5 p7 was also reported during the biological treatment of wastewater in germany kloepfer et al 2004 reemtsma 2000 showed that the concentrations of p1 and p5 in the wastewater effluent were 2 6 and 20 times higher than their concentrations at the plant intake respectively indicating the formation of these products during the treatment processes particularly identification of isomeric new products p2 p4 of 2 hydroxybenzothiazole p5 demonstrates the capability of the new nontargeted hplc hrms strategy developed and implemented in this study these new tps were further evaluated for their toxicological relevance as described in section 3 5 3 3 quantification of organic and inorganic tps fig 4 shows the intensities of the major and minor uv degradation products of 2 mbt in a solution of ph 7 6 with varying uv fluence as the uv fluence increases from 500 to 6000 mj cm2 2 mbt decreased rapidly the majority of the tps increased with the increasing uv fluence whereas five of the tps p12 and p14 16 first increased and then decreased indicating that they are susceptible to uv photolysis on the contrary the majority of formed tps e g p1 p2 p4 p5 p8 p10 p18 appear to accumulate in the solution which indicates that they are relatively resistant to uv degradation as compared to the original 2 mbt 2 aminobenzaldehyde p6 was not detected until the uv fluence reached 1000 2000 mj cm2 this suggested that 2 aminobenzaldehyde was likely a secondary product using the available standards and external calibration curves we quantified 2 mbt and the major degradation products generated during the uv 253 7 nm irradiation of 2 mbt solutions the results are summarized in fig s14 because all the major transformation products scheme 1 p1 5 and p7 contained the bt core structure we rationally proposed that one 2 mbt molecule produced one molecule of the degradation product fig s15 shows the molar fraction of remaining 2 mbt and each degradation product as a function of uv fluence at an uv fluence of 3000 mj cm2 approximately 13 of 2 mbt remained while the sum of the major degradation products accounted for approximately 57 of the original 2 mbt in total approximately 70 of the original 2 mbt can be tracked using our lc ms method while 30 is missing at an uv fluence of 6000 mj cm2 the missing mass balance increased to 40 table s4 the missing balance could be represented by the tps that were not quantified due to the lack of commercially available standards alternatively 2 mbt could have been partly mineralized to inorganic products at a uv fluence of 40 mj cm2 which is typically employed for drinking water disinfection no noticeable degradation of 2 mbt was observed fig s15 at a uv fluence of 1000 mj cm2 which would degrade 90 of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma in potable reuse applications approximately 50 2 mbt was photolyzed to the major product bt along with minor products 2 so3 bt and 2 oh bt fig s16 of note both 2 mbt and its byproducts are very efficiently treated via hydroxyl radical initiated oxidations in the uv h2o2 aop bahnmüller et al 2015 andreozzi et al 2001 which is largely practiced at drinking water and potable reuse water treatment plants around the world to investigate the inorganic degradation products we carried out icp analysis of the total sulfur s content in the 2 mbt solutions before and after uv treatment without pretreatment of the samples fig s17 the s content in the irradiated sample did not change significantly compared to the initial 2 mbt solution indicating that all the sulfur from 2 mbt remained in the sample after uv radiation furthermore to track the missing sulfur content we hypothesized that other s containing organic compounds or s containing inorganic ions such as so4 2 are also formed ic experiments provided a limit of detection of 0 04 mg l for so4 2 and 6 µg l for n in no2 no3 figure s18 shows that increasing uv fluence for treatment of 2 mbt increased the concentrations of so4 2 and no2 no3 formed the formation of so4 2 likely resulted from the oxidation of the thiol group of 2 mbt additionally the opening of the thiazole ring to form 2 aminobenzaldehyde involved the loss of s which can lead to the formation of so4 2 the formation of so4 2 has also been observed from the gamma radiation process of 2 mbt bao et al 2016 it is unclear how photodegradation of 2 mbt led to the formation of no2 no3 but it may have resulted from the oxidation of the thiazole ring of 2 mbt and or the tps containing the n atom 3 4 proposed uv degradation pathways of 2 mbt based on the structures of the identified tps and mass balance results the degradation pathways of 2 mbt with the uv 253 7 nm radiation is tentatively proposed as shown in scheme 1 the excited singlet state of 2 mbt 1mbt is initially formed upon the absorption of uv radiation by 2 mbt the excited singlet state likely deactivates rapidly to the longer lived excited triplet state 3mbt koyama and orr ewing 2016 the main product p7 could be formed via c sh bond cleavage further resulting in the formation of hydroxylated products p2 p5 p8 p12 the photooxidation of sh group could be the route to the sulfonic products p1 p14 p16 which in turn are the precursors of products p17 p20 thiazole ring opening likely occurring at higher uv energies delivered to the samples would explain the formation of the observed products p6 p13 p21 p22 as well as of the inorganic ions the extensive investigation of ph effect on 2 mbt photolysis and on byproduct formation and characterization was beyond the scope of this work only two tests were performed at ph 3 and ph 10 for the purpose of observing the ph impact on 2 mbt degradation and major primary byproduct profiles the trends are shown in fig s19 at ph 3 a minimal degradation of 2 mbt was observed over the entire uv fluence range this observation is consistent with the low quantum yield φ 0 01 and small molar absorption coefficient ε 550 m2 mol of 2 mbt at 254 nm at ph 3 as compared to the values of these photochemical parameters at ph 8 10 φ 0 025 ε 800 m2 mol bahnmüller et al 2015 the major primary byproducts were identical at the three ph values tested with bt 2 oh bt and 2 so3 bt concentrations increasing with the ph increase 3 5 computational toxicity assessment of 2 mbt and its organic tps to evaluate toxicological relevance of the twenty two tps of 2 mbt we conducted computational quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis using the established models including ecosar danish qsar database and virtualtoxlab package as previously described danish q sar 2015 gao et al 2015 gao et al 2014 rosenberg et al 2016 usepa 2020 these qsar predictive results as shown in table s5 figs s20 22 and section s7 include fish lc50 indicating aquatic toxicity and inhibition of thyroperoxidase tpo indicating potential effects on human health the aquatic toxicity of the tps is lower than that of 2 mbt interestingly the tps are predicted to increase inhibition of tpo activity compared to 2 mbt the lc50 value of original 2 mbt to fish was predicted to be 1 57 mg l 1 according to the toxicity criteria by european union directive 67 548 eec 2 mbt is classified as toxic level 1 0 lc50 10 0 mg l 1 four tps p5 and p8 p10 were predicted to have lc50 3 79 9 48 mg l 1 slightly higher than 2 mbt fig s20 but within the toxic level defined by euc similarly other seven tps p2 p4 p6 p7 p11 p12 were classed as harmful to fish 10 0 lc50 100 0 mg l 1 and the remaining tps were non harmful lc50 100 0 mg l 1 thus the adverse effects of four products p5 and p8 p10 on aquatic organisms should not be ignored although their aquatic toxicity decreased with the uv degradation of 2 mbt 2 mbt has been reported to disrupt thyroid hormones by inhibiting thyroxine release tpo is the enzyme that synthesizes thyroid hormones computational predictions of tps as compared to 2 mbt are shown in fig s21 herein the probability p rosenberg et al 2017 between 0 and 1 was predicted for a tested compound to inhibit the key enzyme tpo except for four tps p1 p5 p7 p13 the remaining 18 tps could increase the probability of inhibition activity of tpo in particular most tps p2 p3 p4 p6 p9 p12 p15 p22 show distinct probability for disrupting thyroid hormones with the probability values greater than 0 70 of course in vitro in vivo experimental research is necessary to further confirm the accurate toxicity value of these tps additionally the four hydroxylated products p2 p5 are isomers and confirmed by commercially available standards other studies have observed hydroxylated products of micropollutants that show increased estrogenic effects due to potential interaction of their hydroxyl group with estrogen receptor cao et al 2018 mboula et al 2015 thus the estrogenic activity of these products were analyzed section s7 showing the higher estrogenic activity of the three isomers p2 4 than p5 these predictive results indicate the toxicological importance of the tps therefore simple reducing concentration and aquatic toxicity of 2 mbt is not sufficient to reduce potential adverse effects on human health 4 conclusions this study demonstrates the ability of the developed nontargeted analysis method to identify accurately the structures of 9 new and 13 known organic tps resulting from uv treatment of water containing 2 mbt the molar based mass balance study accounted for 70 of the organic tps and 30 of inorganic products the comprehensive chemical structure information acquired on the identified products and their uv fluence based dynamic patterns suggested potential multiple pathways of uv degradation of 2 mbt in water via photo induced bond cleavage hydroxylation and oxidation in addition the structure identification of the new tps enabled qsar predictions on their potential toxicity on aquatic organisms and human health whereas the predicted higher estrogenic activity of the identified isomeric tps p2 p4 than that of 2 hydroxybenzothiazole p5 a well known toxic contaminant indicated the potential toxicological relevance of the new tps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17451,comprehensive identification of byproducts including intermediate transformation products tps of micropollutants in source water is challenging and paramount for assessment of drinking water quality and treatment technologies here we have developed a nontargeted analysis strategy coupled with computational toxicity assessment to identify indistinguishable tps including isomers with large differences in toxicity the new strategy was applied to study the uv treatment of water containing micropollutant 2 mercaptobenzothiazole 2 mbt and it enabled successful identification of a total of 22 organic tps particularly the structures of nine new tps were identified for the first time in addition three isomers p2 p3 and p4 were distinguished from the toxic contaminant 2 hydroxybenzothiazole 2 oh bt computational assessments indicate that estrogenic activity of the three isomers p2 p4 is higher than that of 2 oh bt mass balance study shows that the 22 organic products accounted for 70 of the 2 mbt degraded while 30 may degrade to inorganic products most tps are resistant to uv photolysis computational toxicity assessment predicted the tps to increase inhibition of human thyroperoxidase activity although they have lower aquatic toxicity compared to original 2 mbt this study emphasizes the importance of monitoring the 2 mbt photodegradation products and the overall toxicity of finished water whose production included a uv light based treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nontargeted analysis disinfection byproducts dbps transformation product benzothiazole photochemical degradation computational toxicity 1 introduction micropollutants present in both source water and recycled water for potable reuse remain a health concern alsbaiee et al 2016 merle et al 2020 during water disinfection processes micropollutants can transform into a number of disinfection byproducts dbps that may have higher persistence and or toxicity than their parent compounds richardson and kimura 2017 recent studies have shown that mixtures of different dbps can produce additive effects of cytotoxicity genotoxicity and or other biological effects lau et al 2020 mestankova et al 2016 advanced engineering solutions are required to remove micropollutants and their byproducts bond et al 2020 therefore it is insufficient to identify only parent micropollutants for controlling drinking water quality instead a rather comprehensive identification of the trace levels of transformation products tps produced during the treatment of water containing micropollutants is advisable comprehensive identification of tps is analytically challenging because of their trace levels and lack of standards and instrumental sensitivity benzothiazoles an important group of heterocyclic compounds have multiple uses among which as fungicides in a variety of consumer products e g tires and food avagyan et al 2014 he et al 2011 margenat et al 2018 and as vulcanization accelerators in rubber manufacturing luongo et al 2016 reddy and quinn 1997 due to their widespread use benzothiazoles are listed as high production volume chemicals particularly 2 mercaptobenzothiazole is most widely used in rubber plumbing components that are in contact with drinking water the estimated annual production in the early 2000s exceeded 40 000 tons in western europe alone consequently benzothiazoles have been widely detected at concentrations ranging from sub ng l to mg l levels in tap water groundwater and surface waters liao et al 2018 seel and et al 2012 wang et al 2016 for instance the occurrence of 2 mbt was reported in the drinking water of ahvaz city in water samples collected from the karun river esmaile et al 2020 and the riverine runoff of the pearl river delta with average concentrations of 24 3 87 4 ng l ni et al 2008 toxicity studies of benzothiazoles have shown potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms and human health avagyan et al 2014 fries 2011 rodríguez et al 2004 wang et al 2016 including genotoxicity cytotoxicity carcinogenicity as well as modulation of the thyroid hormone liao et al 2018 the predicted no effect concentration pnec and lowest observed effect concentration loec were reported as 0 82 µg l and 78 µg l respectively european union eu 2008 additionally occupational exposure to 2 mbt is potentially associated with an increased risk of developing bladder cancer in workers sorahan 2009 usepa 2016 current wastewater treatment processes such as uv disinfection chlorination and ozonation either do not result in the efficient removal of micropollutants containing the benzothiazole structural entity liao et al 2018 or can lead to byproducts preserving the benzothiazole ring such as 2 hydroxybenzothiazole and benzothiazole bt in the treated water fiehn et al 1998 existing studies indicate that benzothiazoles can transform to other products during water treatment but comprehensive identification of their transformation products is still desirable understanding the formation of tps during the water treatment and their impact on water quality as a whole is critical for ensuring safe water for people and the aquatic species uv light based advanced oxidation processes uv aops were widely implemented to remediate natural waters or recycled water from persistent micropollutants while achieving enhanced disinfection for the purpose of potable water production stefan 2018 several studies have reported that uv based aops are efficient at degrading benzothiazoles in water andreozzi et al 2001 habibi et al 2001 malouki et al 2004 redouane salah et al 2018 serdechnova et al 2014 zajíčková and párkányi 2008 the photodegradation kinetics of several benzothiazoles were also reported bahnmüller et al 2015 serdechnova et al 2014 zajíčková and párkányi 2008 but their transformation products largely remain unknown for instance previous studies reported that the photochemical degradation of 2 mbt mainly resulted in the formation of bt and 2 oh bt while up to 68 of products were unidentified primarily due to the inability of the employed methods to detect accurately low analyte concentrations brownlee et al 1992 therefore highly sensitive methods are required for comprehensive identification and quantification of the tps of benzothiazoles han and zhang 2018 jiang et al 2020 recent studies highlighted the ability of nontargeted analysis using high resolution mass spectrometry hrms to obtain comprehensive information about the unknown tps at trace levels in wastewater and drinking water fu et al 2017 liberatore et al 2017 tang et al 2020 tang et al 2016 herein we report on the development of a novel nontargeted strategy using high performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry hplc hrms to comprehensively identify molecular structures of the unknown products of 2 mbt in water upon uv treatment the identified tps were confirmed when standards were available the mass balance of tps was analysed over the uv degradation of 2 mbt based on the identified tps and their patterns over the uv exposure times we postulated the mechanism of 2 mbt photodegradation lastly we applied established computational assessment methods to evaluate potential aquatic toxicity and the effects of 2 mbt and its tps on the enzyme hormones regulating the thyroid function to identify the tps of toxicological relevance to the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting on mass balance in combination with the computational toxicity estimates for unknown tps and their isomers generated during uv photolysis of benzothiazoles in water the outcomes of this study on 2 mbt photolysis raise the awareness on the need for a comprehensive approach to the examination of micropollutant treatment in water and on potential unintended consequences on the treated water quality 2 materials and

fisher scientific ottawa on canada phosphoric acid h3po4 85 was obtained from caledon laboratories ltd georgetown on canada the 2 mbt 10 mg ml stock solution was prepared in acn every two weeks and kept in amber glass vials with minimum headspace to reduce eliminate the slow oxidation of 2 mbt in the dark by the oxygen present at ambient conditions stock solutions for other bt derivatives and 2 aminobenzaldehyde 0 33 20 mg ml were prepared individually in acn all stock solutions were stored in amber glass vials in the refrigerator at 4 c the stock solutions of kh2po4 50 mm naoh 100 mm and h3po4 100 mm were prepared separately in optima water phosphate buffer 0 5 mm was prepared by diluting the concentrated stock kh2po4 solution and adjusting ph to the required value using naoh or h3po4 stock solutions 2 2 uv experimental set up uv photolysis of 2 mbt was performed with a bench scale collimated beam device as shown in fig s1 two 8w uvc germicidal lamps lzc uvc 01 luzchem research inc ottawa on canada emitting primarily at 253 7 nm were mounted at the top center of the photoreactor luzchem lzc 4v the aperture diameter for the collimated uv light beam was 11 5 cm sample aliquots of 46 ml were transferred to a crystallizing dish 60 mm diameter 35 mm depth vwr radnor pa usa and exposed to the uv radiation for predetermined periods of time the distance from the lamps to the solution surface was 17 9 cm and the sample depth was 2 1 cm the uv irradiance at the surface of water was measured with a uvx model digital radiometer during the irradiation the water sample was stirred continuously the average uv fluence was calculated according to the standardized method reported by bolton and linden bolton and linden 2003 details on the uv fluence calculations are given in section s1 and table s1 in this study the target uv fluences were set at 500 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 and 6000 mj cm2 for the uv irradiation experiments the 2 mbt about 500 µg l working solution was prepared by adding 50 µl of 2 mbt stock solution 10 mg ml in acn to 1 l volumetric flask with phosphate buffer 0 5 mm at ph 7 6 the acn content in the working solution was 0 005 the working solution was protected from the ambient light with aluminum foil over the duration of the experiments the uv absorbance of the working solution was measured in triplicate within 1 h before irradiation to confirm the complete dissolution and stability of 2 mbt and an average value was considered for uv fluence calculation at the end of each exposure a 10 ml aliquot of uv irradiated 2 mbt solution was taken for immediate uv absorbance measurement a 2 ml aliquot was taken for hplc ms analysis without pretreatment the remaining irradiated solution was kept for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and ic analysis all aliquots were kept in amber glass vials without headspace 2 3 nontargeted hplc hrms analysis the analytes in the 2 mbt solutions before and after uv irradiation were separated on an accucore c18 column 150 2 1 mm i d 2 6 μm pore size 80 å thermo scientific waltham ma usa using an agilent hplc system agilent 1290 hplc a quadrupole time of flight qtof high resolution mass spectrometer sciex x500r sciex concord on canada with a turbo v electrospray ionization esi source was used in positive and negative modes to obtain accurate mass measurements of the m h or m h ions the details of the hplc hrms conditions were described in section s2 tandem mass ms ms spectra were collected for each sample using information dependent acquisition ida mode the scan cycle of ida contained two experiments the first experiment was designed to run a full scan analysis and the second experiment was used to collect ms ms spectra of 10 most intense molecular ions whose intensity exceeded a designated value i e 1000 cps in this study the ida parameters were presented in section s3 qualitative and quantitative data analysis was performed using sciex os software a nontargeted strategy was used for identification of 2 mbt and its degradation products in detail each solution before and after uv treatment for 1 5 min to 25 min was analyzed using nontargeted analysis of the hplc hrms under predefined parameters the acquired hplc hrms data file contained the retention time m h from positive esi or m h from negative esi and peak intensity by comparing the data from the sample 2 mbt solutions exposed to the uv radiation to the control 2 mbt solutions kept in the dark we identified peaks that were detected exclusively in the sample but not in the control a peak was considered as a newly formed product when its signal intensity in the sample was 10 times higher than the background for the identification of the degradation products generated during the uv exposure of 2 mbt solutions we acquired the accurate m z m h or m h and ms ms spectra of the products using the ida experiments commercial authentic standards when available were purchased for confirmation of the products additionally the quantitation of the new compounds was performed using external calibration curves 2 4 analysis of inorganic anions ion chromatography dionex dx 600 was used to examine the generation of inorganic degradation products i e no2 no3 and so4 2 from uv irradiation of 2 mbt solutions the work was done in the biogeochemical analytical service laboratory basl at the university of alberta using the us epa method 300 1 the total of no2 and no3 was measured using a lachat quickchem qc8500 flow injection analysis automated ion analyzer at basl as described in the us epa method 353 2 2 5 computational assessment of aquatic toxicity and effects on thyroid enzyme function the aquatic toxicity of 2 mbt and its tps was assessed using the ecological structure activity relationships ecosar model usepa 2020 herein fish was selected as a target aquatic species due to the significance as food for many species including humans the aquatic toxicity to fish is expressed as median lethal concentration lc50 after fish 96 h exposure the lowest effect concentration was reported considering the conservative prediction for the precautionary principle to assess potential human health effects we examined effects of 2 mbt and its tps on thyroid hormones using danish qsar database consisting of over 650 000 compounds danish q sar 2015 rosenberg et al 2016 thyroperoxidase tpo is the key enzyme for synthesise of thyroid hormones thus we focused on the inhibition effect of 2 mbt and tps on tpo activity the danish qsar model predicts probability p value between 0 and 1 for a test compound to inhibit tpo activity as the p value close to 1 the ability of the test compound to inhibit tpo activity is higher in addition to the tests described above the estrogenic activity of transformation products was evaluated using virtualtoxlab package vedani et al 2015 vedani et al 2012 vedani and smiesko 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 nontargeted identification of tps positive esi initial uv spectrometry measurements of the samples before and after uv irradiation indicated the photodegradation of 2 mbt supported by the appearance of a new product peak at 217 nm and a significant change in the uv spectrum fig s2 total ion chromatographs recorded during hplc ms analysis only show the disappearance of 2 mbt but no information on byproducts fig s3 the details are described in section s4 5 of supplementary information in order to identify the 2 mbt transformation products and characterize their dynamics upon uv exposure we have developed and applied a nontargeted comprehensive analytical approach the nontargeted strategy involves acquisition of full scan ms data m z 50 500 of the treated and untreated samples comparing the full scan data of the sample with the control to identify new products and followed by a second run in ida mode to acquire ms ms spectra of the new products through comparison of the ms data m z 50 500 of the treated samples with the control sample without uv irradiation twelve unknown peaks were consistently detected in the uv treated samples using hplc qtof ms in positive esi mode fig 1 shows the extracted ion chromatograms eics of the unknowns peaks p1 p12 discovered using the nontargeted strategy among the unknowns peaks p2 p5 had the same m z value of 152 0176 but eluted at different retention times indicating that they are isomers similarly peaks p8 p12 are isomers of m z value of 168 0125 table 1 summarizes the m z values retention times predicted molecular formulas and the corresponding mass errors of the twelve tps peaks p1 12 as well as their confidence levels according to schymanski scale schymanski et al 2014 the determination of the accurate masses of the detected tps enabled the prediction of their molecular formulas the difference between the theoretical and measured molecular weights of the tps was less than 10 ppm supporting their tentative identification to further elucidate the structures of the detected 12 tps table 1 and fig 1 we used the method of hplc qtof ms in ida mode the ida method acquired the accurate mass of precursor ions by tof full scans followed by the ms ms spectra of the product ions p7 was detected as one of the major products the protonated molecular ion of p7 m z 136 0226 predicted its molecular formula as c7h5ns that matched with benzothiazole bt next p7 was confirmed by matching its retention time fig 1 ms and ms ms spectra with those of the benzothiazole standard fig 2 thus p7 was confirmed as benzothiazole furthermore p1 differed from p7 with a unit of so3 as well as a fragment ion matched with m so3 fig 2 after comparing the retention time and ms ms spectrum of p1 with the standard bt so3 we confirmed p1 as benzothiazole 2 sulfonic acid 2 so3 bt peaks p2 p5 had a protonated molecular mass of 152 0176 which differed from benzothiazole p7 by an oxygen atom indicating an oxygen atom added to the benzothiazole structure in the ms ms spectra of p2 p5 a characteristic fragment ion of m z 134 0056 134 0067 was detected corresponding to the loss of the oh group from the precursor molecule i e m oh this observation strongly suggested that p2 p5 were mono hydroxylated benzothiazole isomers to confirm the identity of each isomer we compared p2 p5 with commercially available standards as shown in figs 1 2 the retention times and ms ms spectra of p2 p5 matched those of standards 6 oh bt 5 oh bt 4 oh bt and 2 oh bt respectively 2 oh bt was confirmed with the standard 2 hydroxybenzothiazole additionally the product 2 oh bt can exist in two tautomeric forms as shown in fig s4 similarly p6 had a predicted molecular formula of c7h7no table 1 without any s atoms upon examination of the ms ms spectrum and comparison with the standards p6 was confirmed as 2 aminobenzaldehyde section s6 and figs 1 and 2 low intensity peaks were also detected using the nontargeted strategy for example five peaks were detected with retention time values of 1 99 2 23 2 52 2 96 and 3 67 min due to the low intensity of the ms signals acquisition of the ms ms spectra of these peaks was difficult however based on the one ms ms spectrum collected fig s5 we observed two equivalent mass losses 18 0121 and 17 9986 suggesting that this compound possibly contains two hydroxyl groups the fragment 132 0041 also matched with bt 2h indicating that the parent molecule may contain the bt core structure thus it is reasonable to tentatively identify p8 p12 as the isomers bt oh 2 of di hydroxy bts and their tautomers because of the lack of authentic standards the confirmation of these structures was not possible at this time 3 2 nontargeted identification of tps negative esi using negative esi the nontargeted lc hr ms ms strategy revealed two additional unknowns in the irradiated 500 μg l 2 mbt solution table 1 fig 3a shows the eics of the two unknowns p13 and p14 the intensity of these two peaks was too weak to identify their structures to obtain better quality ms ms spectra fig 3b c for the structure identification we performed the uv irradiation of a 2 mg l 2 mbt solution the accurate mass of p13 181 9913 predicted its molecular formula as c7h5no3s the mass difference between its deprotonated molecular mass 181 9913 and fragment ion m z 118 0296 is 63 9617 corresponding to the loss of an so2 calculated mass 63 9618 group additional loss of a co calculated mass 27 9949 group and a c7h4n calculated mass 102 0344 fragment were observed from 118 0296 to 90 0346 observed mass loss 27 9950 and 181 9913 to 79 9567 observed mass loss 102 0346 respectively furthermore a fragment of 79 9567 matched with so3 calculated mass 79 9573 based on these ms ms fragments and mass losses we proposed two possible structures namely benzo d thiazol 2 3h one 1 1 dioxide a and 2 oxa 2h 1 4 benzothiazine 1 1 dioxide b as depicted in fig s6 the simulated ms ms spectra of the proposed structures were obtained using the sciex os software which were further compared with the experimental spectrum of p13 fig 3b the simulated spectra of structures a and b matched that shown in fig 3b at 61 6 and 93 5 indicating that p13 has a closer resemblance to structure b i e 2 oxa 2h 1 4 benzothiazine 1 1 dioxide similarly the accurate mass of p14 predicted its molecular formula of c7h5no3s3 and its characteristic fragment ions of m z 134 0067 and 165 9790 corresponded to bt and deprotonated mbt respectively the detection of mbt fragment of m z 165 9790 indicated that an s atom was within the bt core structure the mass difference between the parent ion of m z 245 9365 and a fragment ion of m z 165 9790 was 79 9575 corresponding to a neutral loss of so3 therefore p14 was rationally identified as mbt so3 the uv irradiation of 2 mbt at higher concentration 2 mg l enabled the detection of additional unknown products associated with peaks p15 p22 in fig s7 under the original lc conditions these new peaks overlapped making their identities ambiguous to clarify whether these peaks were degradation products or fragments of larger molecules produced in the esi source we modified the lc method to improve their separation as shown in figs s8 s9 these peaks between the two red lines were resolved from each other under the optimized lc conditions of fig s9 this supports that these peaks resulted from uv degradation not fragments in the ion source table s2 presents the accurate masses and the molecular formula of these tps including the eight compounds detected in fig s7 the ms ms spectra figs s10 s13 were also acquired for the peaks listed in table s2 the two spectra in figs s10 s13 are very similar indicating that these are structure isomers for example in fig s10a b the presence of fragments of 134 0057 a and b and 165 9789 a 165 9815 b suggested that both p15 and p16 had the m h of 245 9350 and molecular formula of c7h5ns3o3 and contained the 2 mbt structure meanwhile the mass difference between the fragment ion 181 9 and the parent ion 245 9 matched with the loss of an so2 unit the mass difference between the fragment ion 165 9 and parent ion 245 9 matched with the loss of an so3 unit therefore the p15 and p16 were rationally identified as 2 mbt derivatives with a o so2h group p17 and p18 had similar ms ms spectra suggesting them as isomers as shown in fig s11 a and b for instance the mass difference between m z 229 9620 and m z 165 9973 matched with the loss of an so2 unit while the mass difference between m z 229 9620 and 201 9664 corresponded to the loss of co in addition the fragment ions of m z 150 0031 150 0045 matched with the deprotonated hydroxylated bt thus p17 and p18 were identified as bt derivatives substituted with two oh groups and one so2 group similarly the ms ms spectra of p19 and p20 fig s12a b suggested them as bt derivatives substituted with one oh group and one so2 group the accurate masses of the unknowns p21 and p22 predicted their molecular formula of c6h7ns2o3 indicating the opening of the bt core structure the mass shift from 203 9790 to 171 0019 was 32 9771 in agreement with the loss of an sh group the mass shift from 203 9790 to 124 0234 is 79 9556 matched with the loss of an so3 unit these suggested that p21 and p22 resulted from the opening of a thiazole ring and with the loss of a carbon i e the 2 aminothiophenol structure p21 and p22 were identified as 2 aminothiophenol so3 the accurate mass and ms ms spectra of the unknowns p15 22 suggested their structures as shown in scheme 1 in short the nontargeted hplc hrms approach enabled the identification of the nine new products p2 p4 p13 p16 p21 p22 for the first time adding new information about the photodegradation of 2 mbt to previously reported products including benzothiazole 2 sulfonate p1 2 hydroxybenzothiazole p5 benzothiazole p7 in wastewater effluents and surface water summarized in table s3 li et al 2006 malouki et al 2004 serdechnova et al 2014 zajíčková and párkányi 2008 2009 the occurrence of these products p1 p5 p7 was also reported during the biological treatment of wastewater in germany kloepfer et al 2004 reemtsma 2000 showed that the concentrations of p1 and p5 in the wastewater effluent were 2 6 and 20 times higher than their concentrations at the plant intake respectively indicating the formation of these products during the treatment processes particularly identification of isomeric new products p2 p4 of 2 hydroxybenzothiazole p5 demonstrates the capability of the new nontargeted hplc hrms strategy developed and implemented in this study these new tps were further evaluated for their toxicological relevance as described in section 3 5 3 3 quantification of organic and inorganic tps fig 4 shows the intensities of the major and minor uv degradation products of 2 mbt in a solution of ph 7 6 with varying uv fluence as the uv fluence increases from 500 to 6000 mj cm2 2 mbt decreased rapidly the majority of the tps increased with the increasing uv fluence whereas five of the tps p12 and p14 16 first increased and then decreased indicating that they are susceptible to uv photolysis on the contrary the majority of formed tps e g p1 p2 p4 p5 p8 p10 p18 appear to accumulate in the solution which indicates that they are relatively resistant to uv degradation as compared to the original 2 mbt 2 aminobenzaldehyde p6 was not detected until the uv fluence reached 1000 2000 mj cm2 this suggested that 2 aminobenzaldehyde was likely a secondary product using the available standards and external calibration curves we quantified 2 mbt and the major degradation products generated during the uv 253 7 nm irradiation of 2 mbt solutions the results are summarized in fig s14 because all the major transformation products scheme 1 p1 5 and p7 contained the bt core structure we rationally proposed that one 2 mbt molecule produced one molecule of the degradation product fig s15 shows the molar fraction of remaining 2 mbt and each degradation product as a function of uv fluence at an uv fluence of 3000 mj cm2 approximately 13 of 2 mbt remained while the sum of the major degradation products accounted for approximately 57 of the original 2 mbt in total approximately 70 of the original 2 mbt can be tracked using our lc ms method while 30 is missing at an uv fluence of 6000 mj cm2 the missing mass balance increased to 40 table s4 the missing balance could be represented by the tps that were not quantified due to the lack of commercially available standards alternatively 2 mbt could have been partly mineralized to inorganic products at a uv fluence of 40 mj cm2 which is typically employed for drinking water disinfection no noticeable degradation of 2 mbt was observed fig s15 at a uv fluence of 1000 mj cm2 which would degrade 90 of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma in potable reuse applications approximately 50 2 mbt was photolyzed to the major product bt along with minor products 2 so3 bt and 2 oh bt fig s16 of note both 2 mbt and its byproducts are very efficiently treated via hydroxyl radical initiated oxidations in the uv h2o2 aop bahnmüller et al 2015 andreozzi et al 2001 which is largely practiced at drinking water and potable reuse water treatment plants around the world to investigate the inorganic degradation products we carried out icp analysis of the total sulfur s content in the 2 mbt solutions before and after uv treatment without pretreatment of the samples fig s17 the s content in the irradiated sample did not change significantly compared to the initial 2 mbt solution indicating that all the sulfur from 2 mbt remained in the sample after uv radiation furthermore to track the missing sulfur content we hypothesized that other s containing organic compounds or s containing inorganic ions such as so4 2 are also formed ic experiments provided a limit of detection of 0 04 mg l for so4 2 and 6 µg l for n in no2 no3 figure s18 shows that increasing uv fluence for treatment of 2 mbt increased the concentrations of so4 2 and no2 no3 formed the formation of so4 2 likely resulted from the oxidation of the thiol group of 2 mbt additionally the opening of the thiazole ring to form 2 aminobenzaldehyde involved the loss of s which can lead to the formation of so4 2 the formation of so4 2 has also been observed from the gamma radiation process of 2 mbt bao et al 2016 it is unclear how photodegradation of 2 mbt led to the formation of no2 no3 but it may have resulted from the oxidation of the thiazole ring of 2 mbt and or the tps containing the n atom 3 4 proposed uv degradation pathways of 2 mbt based on the structures of the identified tps and mass balance results the degradation pathways of 2 mbt with the uv 253 7 nm radiation is tentatively proposed as shown in scheme 1 the excited singlet state of 2 mbt 1mbt is initially formed upon the absorption of uv radiation by 2 mbt the excited singlet state likely deactivates rapidly to the longer lived excited triplet state 3mbt koyama and orr ewing 2016 the main product p7 could be formed via c sh bond cleavage further resulting in the formation of hydroxylated products p2 p5 p8 p12 the photooxidation of sh group could be the route to the sulfonic products p1 p14 p16 which in turn are the precursors of products p17 p20 thiazole ring opening likely occurring at higher uv energies delivered to the samples would explain the formation of the observed products p6 p13 p21 p22 as well as of the inorganic ions the extensive investigation of ph effect on 2 mbt photolysis and on byproduct formation and characterization was beyond the scope of this work only two tests were performed at ph 3 and ph 10 for the purpose of observing the ph impact on 2 mbt degradation and major primary byproduct profiles the trends are shown in fig s19 at ph 3 a minimal degradation of 2 mbt was observed over the entire uv fluence range this observation is consistent with the low quantum yield φ 0 01 and small molar absorption coefficient ε 550 m2 mol of 2 mbt at 254 nm at ph 3 as compared to the values of these photochemical parameters at ph 8 10 φ 0 025 ε 800 m2 mol bahnmüller et al 2015 the major primary byproducts were identical at the three ph values tested with bt 2 oh bt and 2 so3 bt concentrations increasing with the ph increase 3 5 computational toxicity assessment of 2 mbt and its organic tps to evaluate toxicological relevance of the twenty two tps of 2 mbt we conducted computational quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis using the established models including ecosar danish qsar database and virtualtoxlab package as previously described danish q sar 2015 gao et al 2015 gao et al 2014 rosenberg et al 2016 usepa 2020 these qsar predictive results as shown in table s5 figs s20 22 and section s7 include fish lc50 indicating aquatic toxicity and inhibition of thyroperoxidase tpo indicating potential effects on human health the aquatic toxicity of the tps is lower than that of 2 mbt interestingly the tps are predicted to increase inhibition of tpo activity compared to 2 mbt the lc50 value of original 2 mbt to fish was predicted to be 1 57 mg l 1 according to the toxicity criteria by european union directive 67 548 eec 2 mbt is classified as toxic level 1 0 lc50 10 0 mg l 1 four tps p5 and p8 p10 were predicted to have lc50 3 79 9 48 mg l 1 slightly higher than 2 mbt fig s20 but within the toxic level defined by euc similarly other seven tps p2 p4 p6 p7 p11 p12 were classed as harmful to fish 10 0 lc50 100 0 mg l 1 and the remaining tps were non harmful lc50 100 0 mg l 1 thus the adverse effects of four products p5 and p8 p10 on aquatic organisms should not be ignored although their aquatic toxicity decreased with the uv degradation of 2 mbt 2 mbt has been reported to disrupt thyroid hormones by inhibiting thyroxine release tpo is the enzyme that synthesizes thyroid hormones computational predictions of tps as compared to 2 mbt are shown in fig s21 herein the probability p rosenberg et al 2017 between 0 and 1 was predicted for a tested compound to inhibit the key enzyme tpo except for four tps p1 p5 p7 p13 the remaining 18 tps could increase the probability of inhibition activity of tpo in particular most tps p2 p3 p4 p6 p9 p12 p15 p22 show distinct probability for disrupting thyroid hormones with the probability values greater than 0 70 of course in vitro in vivo experimental research is necessary to further confirm the accurate toxicity value of these tps additionally the four hydroxylated products p2 p5 are isomers and confirmed by commercially available standards other studies have observed hydroxylated products of micropollutants that show increased estrogenic effects due to potential interaction of their hydroxyl group with estrogen receptor cao et al 2018 mboula et al 2015 thus the estrogenic activity of these products were analyzed section s7 showing the higher estrogenic activity of the three isomers p2 4 than p5 these predictive results indicate the toxicological importance of the tps therefore simple reducing concentration and aquatic toxicity of 2 mbt is not sufficient to reduce potential adverse effects on human health 4 conclusions this study demonstrates the ability of the developed nontargeted analysis method to identify accurately the structures of 9 new and 13 known organic tps resulting from uv treatment of water containing 2 mbt the molar based mass balance study accounted for 70 of the organic tps and 30 of inorganic products the comprehensive chemical structure information acquired on the identified products and their uv fluence based dynamic patterns suggested potential multiple pathways of uv degradation of 2 mbt in water via photo induced bond cleavage hydroxylation and oxidation in addition the structure identification of the new tps enabled qsar predictions on their potential toxicity on aquatic organisms and human health whereas the predicted higher estrogenic activity of the identified isomeric tps p2 p4 than that of 2 hydroxybenzothiazole p5 a well known toxic contaminant indicated the potential toxicological relevance of the new tps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17452,lead dioxide pbo2 is an important form of lead mineral scales in drinking water pipes iodide i widely presents in source waters and can be thermodynamically oxidized by pbo2 to the reactive iodine species i2 hoi biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps are nonnegligible precursors of disinfection byproducts dbps the aim was to study the oxidation of i by pbo2 and formation of iodinated dbps i dbps from eps at a high molar ratio of pbo2 to i 100 the observed rate constants of i oxidation decreased as ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 with an h dependence of 0 79 and the rate constant k was 1 6 1011 m 2 79 s 1 most of formed i2 hoi 92 was transformed to organic iodine in the presence of eps eps had a lower formation potential fp of carbonaceous i dbps c idbps while a higher that of nitrogenous i dbps n idbps than ha resulting in a higher chinese hamster ovary cell cytotoxicity generally the formation of i dbps decreased with the increase of ph due to the reduction of surface positive charge and electrochemical driving force pbo2 dose and i concentration also had a significant effect on the i dbps formation eps proteins had a higher fp of both c and n idbps than polysaccharides on account of more electrophilic sites and higher nitrogen content in proteins aspartic acid was the main contributor to triiodomethane and iodoacetic acids formation whereas aspartic acid asparagine and tyrosine were the major precursors of diiodoacetonitrile and diiodoacetamide the study helps to improve the control strategy of i dbps when biofilm outbreaks in lead containing water pipes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lead dioxide iodinated disinfection byproducts extracellular polymeric substances proteins polysaccharides 1 introduction lead pb is often released from lead pipes solder and brass fittings into drinking water li et al 2020 the dissolved ionic pb and surface metallic pb can be oxidized to insoluble lead dioxide pbo2 which stably exists in the drinking water distribution system dwdss with chlorination for disinfection lytle and schock 2005 kim and herrera 2010 zhang and lin 2013 the stability of pbo2 decreased as free chlorine was switched to chloramines which indicates that pbo2 is a weaker oxidant than free chlorine but a stronger one than chloramines edwards and dudi 2004 thereby the iodine i in water can be oxidized by pbo2 to form reactive iodine species iodine i2 and hypoiodous acid hoi in a previous study of lin et al 2008 i was selected as the probe reductant to investigate the reactivity of pbo2 and the kinetics of triiodide i3 formation was described under the condition that i was far in excess however such a high i concentration 63 5 mg l 1 is not corresponded with its level in the drinking water 0 4 104 2 µg l 1 richardson et al 2008 at a low i concentration i2 hoi is not further transformed to i3 thus it is supposed to revise the kinetics of i oxidation to i2 hoi by pbo2 in the presence of organic matter i2 hoi rapidly reacts with the active moieties to form iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps which are much more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues dong et al 2019 i2 hoi can also be converted to nontoxic iodate io3 bürgi et al 2001 allard et al 2013 via the oxidation by metal oxide allard et al 2009 or its disproportionation reaction bichsel and von gunten 1999 to date no report focused on the formation of i dbps and io3 when i containing waters are in contact with pbo2 it seems insufficient to offer a comprehensive understanding even though iodoform formation was mentioned in a previous study lin et al 2008 the precursors of i dbps were mainly focused on natural organic matter nom while biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps were seriously ignored biofilm is ubiquitous in dwdss and composed of various biomolecules such as proteins and polysaccharides wingender et al 1999 the biomolecules are usually rich in nitrogen and have a small molecular weight which may drastically alter the formation rate and species of i dbps hu et al 2020 it was always reported that the biomolecules from aquatic organisms pose a great health risk on account of a higher toxicity of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps than carbonaceous disinfection byproducts c dbps richardson et al 2007 fang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 2013 investigated the formation of c and n dbps from eps and proposed that biofilm is a nonnegligible precursor and its elimination should be seriously considered the study was to investigate the oxidation of i by pbo2 and formation of i dbps iodinated trihalomethanes i thms iodinated haloacetic acids i haas iodinated haloacetonitriles i hans iodinated haloacetamides i hacams with biofilm eps and its components proteins and polysaccharides as precursors the issues mainly focused on 1 illustrating the kinetics of i oxidation to i2 hoi when pbo2 was far in excess 2 comparing the formation

revealing the contributions of two major components proteins and polysaccharides and protein monomers twenty amino acids to the formation of i dbps this study helps to deeply understand the i dbps formation from biofilm eps by the oxidation of i containing waters with pbo2 and to improve corresponding countermeasures for biofilm outbreaks in dwdss 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals pbo2 particles were prepared by the coprecipitation method with a phpzc ph at the point of zero charge and specific surface area of 6 9 and 11 9 m2 g 1 respectively text s1 lin and valentine 2008 biofilm was scraped carefully from the internal surface of a water distribution pipe hangzhou and cultivated with the luria bertani medium after rapid delivery to the lab cultures were harvested at the late exponential phase centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min and then rinsed with phosphate buffer 1 0 mm ph 7 0 for 3 times eps were extracted from the obtained cultures by the cation exchange resin method frølund et al 1996 eps proteins and polysaccharides were extracted by the trichloroacetic acid and ethanol precipitation methods respectively text s2 hu et al 2020 natural organic matter nom was spiked as humic acid ha aladdin shanghai the ratios of carbon to nitrogen c n for eps and ha were 2 6 and 9 4 respectively twenty amino acids sangon biotech shanghai included alanine ala arginine arg

cysteine cys methionine met tyrosine tyr and valine val table s1 2 2 analytical methods i thms i hans and i hacams were extracted by the epa method 551 1 and i haas were extracted by the epa method 552 3 usepa 1995 2003 all i dbps were quantified by a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector gc ecd agilent 6890n and db 5m separation column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm i and io3 were analyzed by an ion chromatograph dionex ics2000 with an ionpac as19 column 250 mm 4 0 mm 5 0 μm i2 hoi were quenched with excess phenol and analyzed as iodophenol by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc waters 2695 with an atlantis dc18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 0 μm for the amino acid contents eps proteins were enzymatically digested and then analyzed as peptides by an ultra performance liquid

plasma mass spectrometer thermo icap 7000 the phpzc of pbo2 was measured by the potentiometric titration method liu et al 2012 the chronic cytotoxicity was tested by chinese hamster ovary cho cells dong et al 2016 all details were described in text s3 2 3 reaction system all experiments were conducted under the conditions of dark magnetic agitation and ambient temperature 25 2 c the reaction ph was controlled with phosphate buffer solution 10 mm to apparently observe the formation of i dbps the doses of pbo2 i and eps were synchronously increased to 0 2 g l 1 1 0 mg l 1 and 2 0 mg c l 1 respectively richardson et al 2008 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2017a after 72 h reaction water samples were withdrawn and filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters rapidly and then added with excess ascorbic acid quickly to quench i2 hoi for subsequent analysis of io3 and i dbps it should be noted that ascorbic acid cannot be spiked before the analysis of i and i2 hoi to prevent the reduction of i2 hoi to i for cho chronic cytotoxicity assay the organic matter in the filtered water samples were successively through adsorption onto soxhlet cleaned xad resins eluttion with ethyl acetate and concentration by a rotary evaporator dong et al 2016 importantly the kinetics of i oxidation was conducted in the presence of benzene on account of its capacity to rapidly extract the formed i2 allard et al 2009 the aqueous and organic phases were separated and quickly filtered through 0 22 membrane filters before the analysis of ionic iodine i e i and io3 and reactive iodine i e i2 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation of i by pbo2 lin et al 2008 have reported the oxidation of i to i3 by pbo2 with a quite low molar ratio of pbo2 to i rpb i 0 1 via the following reactions eqs 1 3 1 pb o 2 2 i 4 h p b 2 i 2 2 h 2 o 2 i 2 h 2 o i hoi h 3 i 2 i i 3 however in this study the oxidation of i by pbo2 was investigated with a high value of rpb i 100 i2 hoi in water can be further oxidized to form io3 the end product of i oxidation by mno2 with a lower oxidation reduction potential of pbo2 allard et al 2009 theoretically 1 mol i is expected to be completely oxidized by 3 mol pbo2 eqs 4 thus the formation of i3 was unlikely in our condition that pbo2 was far in excess based on this the study focused the i oxidation on the formation of i2 hoi 4 3 pb o 2 i 6 h 3 p b 2 i o 3 3 h 2 o for the above purpose benzene was applied as a rapid extraction solvent of i2 i and i2 were tracked in the aqueous and organic phases respectively the consumption rate of i and the corresponding formation rate of i2 decreased with the increasing ph fig 1 after 15 min reaction the concentrations of i i w and i2 i2 b varied from 0 1 and 3 7 µm to 7 3 and 0 2 µm respectively as ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 the io3 formation in the aqueous phase was only observed with a concentration io3 w of 0 07 µm at ph 6 0 after 15 min reaction the mass balance was always calculated at in the range of 94 0 99 1 eq 5 5 i 0 i w i o 3 w 2 i 2 b the i oxidation was assumed to follow the pseudo second order kinetics eq 6 which was verified by plotting 1 i 1 i 0 as a function of reaction time t with the slope equals the k obs value fig 2 it was observed that even at ph 6 0 only 0 04 of pb was dissolved into water so the dose of pbo2 pbo2 was considered constant the k obs was obtained from k obs divided by pbo2 with values of 2 6 106 8 0 105 4 6 104 and 1 6 104 m 2 s 1 at phs 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 respectively the reaction order for h was measured as the slope of the straight line log k obs f ph and was equals to 0 79 the k value was calculated to be 1 6 1011 m 2 79 s 1 6 d i dt k obs i 2 k obs pb o 2 i 2 k pb o 2 i 2 h n in the waters containing reactive organic matter the formed i2 hoi was further transformed to organic iodine via its reactions with organic matter and io3 through the oxidation by metal oxide or its disproportionation the transformation of i in the presence of pbo2 and eps was investigated by the simultaneous analysis of i io3 and i2 hoi in water due to the unavailability of instrument the concentration of total organic iodine toi was calculated by subtracting i io3 and i2 hoi from i 0 it was observed that io3 was slightly formed during the transformation of i and most of i was converted to toi in the presence of eps implying that the reaction rate of i2 hoi with eps was much higher than that of its disproportionation or oxidation by pbo2 after 2 h reaction the values of io3 i2 hoi and toi were 0 3 0 1 and 7 3 µm respectively fig 3 3 2 formation of i dbps from biofilm eps the i dbps formation attracted attention due to the significant generation of toi fig 4 a shows the i dbps formation with eps and ha as precursors only five species were identified including triiodomethane tim iodoacetic acid iaa diiodoacetic acid diaa diiodoacetonitrile dian and diiodoacetamide diacam evidently ha showed a higher formation potential fp of c idbps i e the sum of tim iaa and diaa than eps with values of 128 6 and 78 1 µg l 1 respectively however eps exhibited a higher fp of n idbps i e the sum of dian and diacam than ha with values of 16 4 and 7 2 µg l 1 respectively the formed i dbps was concentrated by 100 times and then diluted by 5 70 times to compare the chronic cytotoxicity of i dbps from eps and ha as shown in fig 4b the cho cell survival rates i e mean cell density as the percent of the negative control with eps were lower than those with ha as a precursor at different dilution ratios for example the survival rates were 23 8 and 28 1 with eps and ha as precursors at a dilution ratio of 10 respectively it was reported that hans and hacams were nearly 100 times more cytotoxic than haloacetic acids in the cho cell assays muellner et al 2007 therefore the health risk posed by biofilm eps as a precursor cannot be ignored even if its amount is relatively lower than that of nom in the bulk water 3 3 influence factors 3 3 1 ph a ph range of 6 0 9 0 was tested to clarify the impact of ph on the formation of i dbps the formation of i thms i haas and i hans decreased with the increase of ph fig 5 for example the fps of tim were 81 5 53 9 34 9 and 13 3 µg l 1 at phs 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 respectively the ph dependent formation of i dbps can be attributed to the following aspects first similar to mno2 pbo2 was considered as a lewis acid by receiving two electrons from i or i2 hoi fox et al 2009 gallard et al 2009 the complexation of i2 hoi by pbo2 polarized the i atoms increasing its electrophilicity and reactivity with organic compounds stavber et al 2008 a higher ph decreased the positive charge on pbo2 surface and thus weakened its electrostatic interaction and polarization effect on i2 hoi and i second according to the nernst equation an alkaline ph decreased the electrochemical driving force δeh for the i oxidation by pbo2 which retarded the formation of i2 hoi eq 1 third at phs 6 0 and 7 0 i2 hoi existed in molecular form only a small fraction 5 was converted to ionic form oi as ph increased to 9 0 fig s1 criquet et al 2012 hence it is deemed that the deprotonation of hoi cannot significantly account for the decreasing formation of i dbps specifically the fp of i hacams maximized at ph 7 0 with a diacam concentration of 11 5 µg l 1 which can be ascribed to two aspects on the one hand similar to the other three species of dbps an acidic condition facilitated the formation of i hacams on account of the increasing positive charge of pbo2 surface and electrochemical driving force for i oxidation on the other hand hacams are in a metastable state which are primarily hydrolyzed from hans and decomposed into haas chu et al 2010 yu and reckhow 2017 it was found that dichloroacetamide formation reached the maximum at ph 8 0 during the chlorination of a tyr containing water because the difference between the hydrolysis rates of dichloroacetonitrile and dichloroacetamide at ph 7 8 was higher than that at other ph levels chu et al 2012 previous literatures reported that both the hydrolysis rate of hans and decomposition rate of hacams with the same number of halogens in the substituents decreased as the halogens shifted from chlorine to iodine yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018 thus the maximum difference probably achieved at a ph higher than 8 0 considering their higher stability of dian and diacam given the two opposite effects of ph the net formation of i hacams maximized at ph 7 0 in this study 3 3 2 pbo2 dose and i concentration fig 6 illustrates the effect of pbo2 dose and i concentration on the formation of i dbps in the concentration range of 0 05 1 0 g l 1 and 0 1 3 0 mg l 1 respectively the i dbps formation decreased with the increase of pbo2 dose fig 6a for example the fps of tim were 76 1 64 9 56 5 50 8 and 39 3 µg l 1 with a pbo2 dose of 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 respectively the impact of pbo2 dose on the formation of i dbps was mainly ascribed to three aspects first the increase of pbo2 dose enhanced the electrochemical driving force δeh for i oxidation as a consequence accelerating the formation of i2 hoi second the increase of pbo2 dose amplified the polarization effect on the i atoms in i2 hoi which facilitating its reaction towards eps third the increase of pbo2 dose was beneficial to the oxidation of i2 hoi to io3 thus decreasing the formation of i dbps after 72 h reaction the concentration of io3 increased from 23 2 to 214 4 µg l 1 as pbo2 dose increased from 0 05 to 1 0 g l 1 it implies that the positive effect was overwhelmed by the negative effect on the formation of i dbps at a high pbo2 dose gallard et al 2009 illustrated that the formation of tim decreased as the dose of mno2 was higher than 0 5 g l 1 in a mno2 i nom system the formation of i dbps increased significantly as i concentration increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 and remained almost unchanged as i concentration further increased to 3 0 mg l 1 fig 6b for example the fps of diacam were 1 4 8 6 and 9 4 µg l 1 with an i concentration of 0 1 1 0 and 3 0 mg l 1 respectively the result indicates that the i2 hoi reacted with eps reached saturation and the excess fraction was further oxidized to io3 after 72 h reaction the concentration of io3 increased from 14 3 to 67 9 and 280 5 µg l 1 as i concentration increased from 0 1 to 1 0 and 3 0 mg l 1 3 4 formation of i dbps from eps proteins and polysaccharides proteins and polysaccharides were reported as the major components ca 80 of eps comte et al 2006 the two biomolecules were extracted and used as precursors to further elucidate the i dbps formation proteins presented a higher fp of c idbps than polysaccharides with values of 201 8 and 52 7 µg l 1 respectively fig 7 hong et al 2008 illustrated that proteins were the most important precursors of both thms and haas among three biomolecules i e proteins polysaccharides and lipids in the biofilms it can be interpreted as the influence of electron withdrawing groups on the electrophilic substitution reactivity of organic compounds proteins are primarily made up of the amino acids containing unsaturated conjugated bonds or phenolic structures while polysaccharides are mainly composed of the carbohydrates containing saturated carbon ring structures wingender et al 1999 the unsaturated conjugated bonds or phenolic structures were more capable of withdrawing electrons from α carbon than the saturated carbon ring structures which was beneficial to the electrophilic iodination it was reported that the homogeneous distribution of electron density was not conducive to the occurrence of electrophilic substitution gallard et al 2009 liu et al 2017b compared to polysaccharides proteins also had a higher fp of n idbps with values of 2 5 and 41 8 µg l 1 respectively it was in accordance with a previous study of wang et al 2012 in which p putida eps mainly contains proteins showed a higher fp of hans than p aeruginosa eps mainly contains polysaccharides during chlorination the results can be explained by that proteins provided a higher content of n and more reaction sites for electrophilic iodination than polysaccharides galactose glucosamine glucose mannose glucuronic acid and rhamnose have been reported as the main eps polysaccharide monomers which contain no organic n except glucosamine flemming and wingender 2010 wang et al 2013 as expected the cho cell cytotoxicity of i dbps from proteins was higher than that from polysaccharides with a cell survival rate of 30 8 and 36 9 respectively at a dilution ratio of 1 30 fig s2 3 5 formation of i dbps from amino acids as mentioned above eps proteins were considered as the main precursors for the i dbps formation twenty amino acids contained in proteins were identified and used as precursors with a concentration of 2 0 mg c l 1 each to investigate the impact of chemical structures on the formation of i dbps table 1 for i thms asp trp and his had a considerably high fp of tim with values of 436 0 281 9 and 133 3 μg l 1 respectively hong et al 2009 reported that trp had the highest fp of thms during chlorination the formation mechanism of thms from trp included decarboxylation and substitution to successively generate tryptamine and 3 chloroindole intermediates followed by the cleavage of five membered heterocyclic ring li et al 2019 the formation pathway of i thms was similar to that of thms however it was asp that presented the highest fp of i thms in this study liu et al 2017b reported that asp had a higher fp of i thms than ala gly his phe pro and tyr during the chloramination of i containing waters while the comparison between asp and trp was unavailable chen 2017 proposed that the formation of thms from asp was possibly via the generation of chloroacetaldehyde which was prone to occur the elimination of acetaldehyde unfortunately the mechanism is not supported by the detection of chloroacetaldehyde because of its low formation and unstable structure therefore it remains unknown why asp had a higher fp of i thms than trp which needs further investigation another difference from the previous literature is that his had a relatively higher fp of i thms except asp and trp which may be interpreted as a similar iodination mechanism of trp decarboxylation and substitution to generate 3 iodoimidazole followed by the cleavage of imidazole ring li 2011 for i haas it was observed that only asp asn and trp presented a fp of diaa wang et al 2013 demonstrated the importance of amine group for the high level of haas formation during chlorination by comparing the chemical composition of asp and succinic acid which lacks an amino group on α carbons however in this study it is believed that the two carboxyl groups in asp is another reason for the high fp of i haas the formed nitriles r ch2 cn were deemed as the critical intermediates for the initial reactions of amino acids the h atoms on the α carbons were substituted by i atoms to generate diiodonitriles r ci2 cn the elimination of side chain r occurred to produce diiodoacetonitrile chi2 cn subsequently the addition of hoi to the nitrile group induced the formation of n iodoamides chi2 co nhi which were quickly hydrolyzed to diaa liu et al 2017b the r group in asp is carboxyl with an electron withdrawing effect which facilitated its elimination asp had a much higher fp of diaa than asn and trp the r groups of acyl and indolyl with a weaker electron withdrawing capacity than carboxyl with values of 50 5 10 3 and 6 7 μg l 1 respectively an unobserved formation of i haas from leu ser and phe the r groups of alkyl hydroxyl and phenyl with an electron donating capacity further confirms the promotion effect of the carboxyl groups in asp on the formation of i haas for i hans and i hacams asp asn and tyr had a relatively high fps of both dian and diacam with values of 8 8 and 11 8 8 2 and 9 2 and 7 6 and 9 4 μg l 1 respectively the consistent formation of i hans and i hacams can be explained by the fact that i hacams are mainly hydrolyzed from i hans it was reported that both asp and asn primarily contributed to the formation of hans through the elimination of r groups carboxyl and acyl for asp and asn respectively from dichloronitriles r ccl2 cn wang et al 2013 as for tyr the benzyl cyanide c6h5 ch2 cn was also substituted by the i atoms on the α carbon to form dian after dephenylation except for 4 hydroxyl benzyl cyanide hoc6h5 ch2 cn intermediate chu et al 2012 in a word asp exhibited a high fp of both c and n idbps which can be partly account for its highest chronic cytotoxicity fig s3 considering the proportions of amino acids and the fps of i dbps asp was the primary contributor to the formation of i thms and i haas while all of asp asn and tyr were the important precursors of i hans and i hacams table 1 3 6 control strategy several countermeasures were proposed for i dbps control when biofilm outbreaks in lead containing water pipes 1 increasing water alkalinity and hardness to some extent ph increases with increasing alkalinity decreasing the electrochemical driving force δeh for i dbps formation in addition the increase of alkalinity and hardness facilitates the precipitation of calcium carbonate caco3 which covers the corroded surface and thus reduces the contact area between pbo2 and bulk water 2 disinfection by free chlorine and maintain a high residue the vast majority of i was oxidized to io3 in the presence of excess free chlorine however a large amount of free chlorine is likely to induce the increase of cl dbps which should also be paid attention to 3 hydraulic removal of biofilm hydraulic scour is known as an effective way for biofilm shedding from pipe interface a drawback of hydraulic scour is that pb will be released into the bulk water when biofilm is removed therein hydraulic flow rate is a critical factor and needed to be selected prudently 4 conclusions this study investigated the oxidation of i by pbo2 and formation of i dbps with biofilm eps and its components proteins and polysaccharides as precursors based on the experimental data the following conclusions are drawn at a high rpb i 100 the k obs and kobs of i oxidation decreased as ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 with an h dependence of 0 79 and the k value was determined to be 1 6 1011 m 2 79 s 1 most of i2 hoi 92 was further converted to toi in the presence of eps compared with ha the i dbps from eps showed a stronger chronic cytotoxicity due to the higher fp of n idbps the formation of i thms i haas and i hans was facilitated at an acidic ph whereas that of i hacams achieved maximum under a neutral condition pbo2 dose and i concentration also had a significant impact on the formation of i dbps proteins showed a higher fp of both c and n idbps than polysaccharides due to the more sites for electrophilic iodination and higher content of n considering the contents in proteins asp was the main contributor to the formation of i thms and i haas while asp asn and tyr were the important precursors of i hans and i hacams declaration of competing interest all authors declare no conflict of interest for the manuscript entitled formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous iodinated

17452,lead dioxide pbo2 is an important form of lead mineral scales in drinking water pipes iodide i widely presents in source waters and can be thermodynamically oxidized by pbo2 to the reactive iodine species i2 hoi biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps are nonnegligible precursors of disinfection byproducts dbps the aim was to study the oxidation of i by pbo2 and formation of iodinated dbps i dbps from eps at a high molar ratio of pbo2 to i 100 the observed rate constants of i oxidation decreased as ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 with an h dependence of 0 79 and the rate constant k was 1 6 1011 m 2 79 s 1 most of formed i2 hoi 92 was transformed to organic iodine in the presence of eps eps had a lower formation potential fp of carbonaceous i dbps c idbps while a higher that of nitrogenous i dbps n idbps than ha resulting in a higher chinese hamster ovary cell cytotoxicity generally the formation of i dbps decreased with the increase of ph due to the reduction of surface positive charge and electrochemical driving force pbo2 dose and i concentration also had a significant effect on the i dbps formation eps proteins had a higher fp of both c and n idbps than polysaccharides on account of more electrophilic sites and higher nitrogen content in proteins aspartic acid was the main contributor to triiodomethane and iodoacetic acids formation whereas aspartic acid asparagine and tyrosine were the major precursors of diiodoacetonitrile and diiodoacetamide the study helps to improve the control strategy of i dbps when biofilm outbreaks in lead containing water pipes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lead dioxide iodinated disinfection byproducts extracellular polymeric substances proteins polysaccharides 1 introduction lead pb is often released from lead pipes solder and brass fittings into drinking water li et al 2020 the dissolved ionic pb and surface metallic pb can be oxidized to insoluble lead dioxide pbo2 which stably exists in the drinking water distribution system dwdss with chlorination for disinfection lytle and schock 2005 kim and herrera 2010 zhang and lin 2013 the stability of pbo2 decreased as free chlorine was switched to chloramines which indicates that pbo2 is a weaker oxidant than free chlorine but a stronger one than chloramines edwards and dudi 2004 thereby the iodine i in water can be oxidized by pbo2 to form reactive iodine species iodine i2 and hypoiodous acid hoi in a previous study of lin et al 2008 i was selected as the probe reductant to investigate the reactivity of pbo2 and the kinetics of triiodide i3 formation was described under the condition that i was far in excess however such a high i concentration 63 5 mg l 1 is not corresponded with its level in the drinking water 0 4 104 2 µg l 1 richardson et al 2008 at a low i concentration i2 hoi is not further transformed to i3 thus it is supposed to revise the kinetics of i oxidation to i2 hoi by pbo2 in the presence of organic matter i2 hoi rapidly reacts with the active moieties to form iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps which are much more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues dong et al 2019 i2 hoi can also be converted to nontoxic iodate io3 bürgi et al 2001 allard et al 2013 via the oxidation by metal oxide allard et al 2009 or its disproportionation reaction bichsel and von gunten 1999 to date no report focused on the formation of i dbps and io3 when i containing waters are in contact with pbo2 it seems insufficient to offer a comprehensive understanding even though iodoform formation was mentioned in a previous study lin et al 2008 the precursors of i dbps were mainly focused on natural organic matter nom while biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps were seriously ignored biofilm is ubiquitous in dwdss and composed of various biomolecules such as proteins and polysaccharides wingender et al 1999 the biomolecules are usually rich in nitrogen and have a small molecular weight which may drastically alter the formation rate and species of i dbps hu et al 2020 it was always reported that the biomolecules from aquatic organisms pose a great health risk on account of a higher toxicity of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps than carbonaceous disinfection byproducts c dbps richardson et al 2007 fang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 2013 investigated the formation of c and n dbps from eps and proposed that biofilm is a nonnegligible precursor and its elimination should be seriously considered the study was to investigate the oxidation of i by pbo2 and formation of i dbps iodinated trihalomethanes i thms iodinated haloacetic acids i haas iodinated haloacetonitriles i hans iodinated haloacetamides i hacams with biofilm eps and its components proteins and polysaccharides as precursors the issues mainly focused on 1 illustrating the kinetics of i oxidation to i2 hoi when pbo2 was far in excess 2 comparing the formation

revealing the contributions of two major components proteins and polysaccharides and protein monomers twenty amino acids to the formation of i dbps this study helps to deeply understand the i dbps formation from biofilm eps by the oxidation of i containing waters with pbo2 and to improve corresponding countermeasures for biofilm outbreaks in dwdss 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals pbo2 particles were prepared by the coprecipitation method with a phpzc ph at the point of zero charge and specific surface area of 6 9 and 11 9 m2 g 1 respectively text s1 lin and valentine 2008 biofilm was scraped carefully from the internal surface of a water distribution pipe hangzhou and cultivated with the luria bertani medium after rapid delivery to the lab cultures were harvested at the late exponential phase centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min and then rinsed with phosphate buffer 1 0 mm ph 7 0 for 3 times eps were extracted from the obtained cultures by the cation exchange resin method frølund et al 1996 eps proteins and polysaccharides were extracted by the trichloroacetic acid and ethanol precipitation methods respectively text s2 hu et al 2020 natural organic matter nom was spiked as humic acid ha aladdin shanghai the ratios of carbon to nitrogen c n for eps and ha were 2 6 and 9 4 respectively twenty amino acids sangon biotech shanghai included alanine ala arginine arg

cysteine cys methionine met tyrosine tyr and valine val table s1 2 2 analytical methods i thms i hans and i hacams were extracted by the epa method 551 1 and i haas were extracted by the epa method 552 3 usepa 1995 2003 all i dbps were quantified by a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector gc ecd agilent 6890n and db 5m separation column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm i and io3 were analyzed by an ion chromatograph dionex ics2000 with an ionpac as19 column 250 mm 4 0 mm 5 0 μm i2 hoi were quenched with excess phenol and analyzed as iodophenol by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc waters 2695 with an atlantis dc18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 0 μm for the amino acid contents eps proteins were enzymatically digested and then analyzed as peptides by an ultra performance liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms thermo ultimate 3000 lc thermo q exactive hf ms with a c18 column 25 cm 75 0 μm 3 0 μm total nitrogen tn and organic carbon toc were determined by a

plasma mass spectrometer thermo icap 7000 the phpzc of pbo2 was measured by the potentiometric titration method liu et al 2012 the chronic cytotoxicity was tested by chinese hamster ovary cho cells dong et al 2016 all details were described in text s3 2 3 reaction system all experiments were conducted under the conditions of dark magnetic agitation and ambient temperature 25 2 c the reaction ph was controlled with phosphate buffer solution 10 mm to apparently observe the formation of i dbps the doses of pbo2 i and eps were synchronously increased to 0 2 g l 1 1 0 mg l 1 and 2 0 mg c l 1 respectively richardson et al 2008 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2017a after 72 h reaction water samples were withdrawn and filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters rapidly and then added with excess ascorbic acid quickly to quench i2 hoi for subsequent analysis of io3 and i dbps it should be noted that ascorbic acid cannot be spiked before the analysis of i and i2 hoi to prevent the reduction of i2 hoi to i for cho chronic cytotoxicity assay the organic matter in the filtered water samples were successively through adsorption onto soxhlet cleaned xad resins eluttion with ethyl acetate and concentration by a rotary evaporator dong et al 2016 importantly the kinetics of i oxidation was conducted in the presence of benzene on account of its capacity to rapidly extract the formed i2 allard et al 2009 the aqueous and organic phases were separated and quickly filtered through 0 22 membrane filters before the analysis of ionic iodine i e i and io3 and reactive iodine i e i2 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation of i by pbo2 lin et al 2008 have reported the oxidation of i to i3 by pbo2 with a quite low molar ratio of pbo2 to i rpb i 0 1 via the following reactions eqs 1 3 1 pb o 2 2 i 4 h p b 2 i 2 2 h 2 o 2 i 2 h 2 o i hoi h 3 i 2 i i 3 however in this study the oxidation of i by pbo2 was investigated with a high value of rpb i 100 i2 hoi in water can be further oxidized to form io3 the end product of i oxidation by mno2 with a lower oxidation reduction potential of pbo2 allard et al 2009 theoretically 1 mol i is expected to be completely oxidized by 3 mol pbo2 eqs 4 thus the formation of i3 was unlikely in our condition that pbo2 was far in excess based on this the study focused the i oxidation on the formation of i2 hoi 4 3 pb o 2 i 6 h 3 p b 2 i o 3 3 h 2 o for the above purpose benzene was applied as a rapid extraction solvent of i2 i and i2 were tracked in the aqueous and organic phases respectively the consumption rate of i and the corresponding formation rate of i2 decreased with the increasing ph fig 1 after 15 min reaction the concentrations of i i w and i2 i2 b varied from 0 1 and 3 7 µm to 7 3 and 0 2 µm respectively as ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 the io3 formation in the aqueous phase was only observed with a concentration io3 w of 0 07 µm at ph 6 0 after 15 min reaction the mass balance was always calculated at in the range of 94 0 99 1 eq 5 5 i 0 i w i o 3 w 2 i 2 b the i oxidation was assumed to follow the pseudo second order kinetics eq 6 which was verified by plotting 1 i 1 i 0 as a function of reaction time t with the slope equals the k obs value fig 2 it was observed that even at ph 6 0 only 0 04 of pb was dissolved into water so the dose of pbo2 pbo2 was considered constant the k obs was obtained from k obs divided by pbo2 with values of 2 6 106 8 0 105 4 6 104 and 1 6 104 m 2 s 1 at phs 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 respectively the reaction order for h was measured as the slope of the straight line log k obs f ph and was equals to 0 79 the k value was calculated to be 1 6 1011 m 2 79 s 1 6 d i dt k obs i 2 k obs pb o 2 i 2 k pb o 2 i 2 h n in the waters containing reactive organic matter the formed i2 hoi was further transformed to organic iodine via its reactions with organic matter and io3 through the oxidation by metal oxide or its disproportionation the transformation of i in the presence of pbo2 and eps was investigated by the simultaneous analysis of i io3 and i2 hoi in water due to the unavailability of instrument the concentration of total organic iodine toi was calculated by subtracting i io3 and i2 hoi from i 0 it was observed that io3 was slightly formed during the transformation of i and most of i was converted to toi in the presence of eps implying that the reaction rate of i2 hoi with eps was much higher than that of its disproportionation or oxidation by pbo2 after 2 h reaction the values of io3 i2 hoi and toi were 0 3 0 1 and 7 3 µm respectively fig 3 3 2 formation of i dbps from biofilm eps the i dbps formation attracted attention due to the significant generation of toi fig 4 a shows the i dbps formation with eps and ha as precursors only five species were identified including triiodomethane tim iodoacetic acid iaa diiodoacetic acid diaa diiodoacetonitrile dian and diiodoacetamide diacam evidently ha showed a higher formation potential fp of c idbps i e the sum of tim iaa and diaa than eps with values of 128 6 and 78 1 µg l 1 respectively however eps exhibited a higher fp of n idbps i e the sum of dian and diacam than ha with values of 16 4 and 7 2 µg l 1 respectively the formed i dbps was concentrated by 100 times and then diluted by 5 70 times to compare the chronic cytotoxicity of i dbps from eps and ha as shown in fig 4b the cho cell survival rates i e mean cell density as the percent of the negative control with eps were lower than those with ha as a precursor at different dilution ratios for example the survival rates were 23 8 and 28 1 with eps and ha as precursors at a dilution ratio of 10 respectively it was reported that hans and hacams were nearly 100 times more cytotoxic than haloacetic acids in the cho cell assays muellner et al 2007 therefore the health risk posed by biofilm eps as a precursor cannot be ignored even if its amount is relatively lower than that of nom in the bulk water 3 3 influence factors 3 3 1 ph a ph range of 6 0 9 0 was tested to clarify the impact of ph on the formation of i dbps the formation of i thms i haas and i hans decreased with the increase of ph fig 5 for example the fps of tim were 81 5 53 9 34 9 and 13 3 µg l 1 at phs 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 respectively the ph dependent formation of i dbps can be attributed to the following aspects first similar to mno2 pbo2 was considered as a lewis acid by receiving two electrons from i or i2 hoi fox et al 2009 gallard et al 2009 the complexation of i2 hoi by pbo2 polarized the i atoms increasing its electrophilicity and reactivity with organic compounds stavber et al 2008 a higher ph decreased the positive charge on pbo2 surface and thus weakened its electrostatic interaction and polarization effect on i2 hoi and i second according to the nernst equation an alkaline ph decreased the electrochemical driving force δeh for the i oxidation by pbo2 which retarded the formation of i2 hoi eq 1 third at phs 6 0 and 7 0 i2 hoi existed in molecular form only a small fraction 5 was converted to ionic form oi as ph increased to 9 0 fig s1 criquet et al 2012 hence it is deemed that the deprotonation of hoi cannot significantly account for the decreasing formation of i dbps specifically the fp of i hacams maximized at ph 7 0 with a diacam concentration of 11 5 µg l 1 which can be ascribed to two aspects on the one hand similar to the other three species of dbps an acidic condition facilitated the formation of i hacams on account of the increasing positive charge of pbo2 surface and electrochemical driving force for i oxidation on the other hand hacams are in a metastable state which are primarily hydrolyzed from hans and decomposed into haas chu et al 2010 yu and reckhow 2017 it was found that dichloroacetamide formation reached the maximum at ph 8 0 during the chlorination of a tyr containing water because the difference between the hydrolysis rates of dichloroacetonitrile and dichloroacetamide at ph 7 8 was higher than that at other ph levels chu et al 2012 previous literatures reported that both the hydrolysis rate of hans and decomposition rate of hacams with the same number of halogens in the substituents decreased as the halogens shifted from chlorine to iodine yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018 thus the maximum difference probably achieved at a ph higher than 8 0 considering their higher stability of dian and diacam given the two opposite effects of ph the net formation of i hacams maximized at ph 7 0 in this study 3 3 2 pbo2 dose and i concentration fig 6 illustrates the effect of pbo2 dose and i concentration on the formation of i dbps in the concentration range of 0 05 1 0 g l 1 and 0 1 3 0 mg l 1 respectively the i dbps formation decreased with the increase of pbo2 dose fig 6a for example the fps of tim were 76 1 64 9 56 5 50 8 and 39 3 µg l 1 with a pbo2 dose of 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 respectively the impact of pbo2 dose on the formation of i dbps was mainly ascribed to three aspects first the increase of pbo2 dose enhanced the electrochemical driving force δeh for i oxidation as a consequence accelerating the formation of i2 hoi second the increase of pbo2 dose amplified the polarization effect on the i atoms in i2 hoi which facilitating its reaction towards eps third the increase of pbo2 dose was beneficial to the oxidation of i2 hoi to io3 thus decreasing the formation of i dbps after 72 h reaction the concentration of io3 increased from 23 2 to 214 4 µg l 1 as pbo2 dose increased from 0 05 to 1 0 g l 1 it implies that the positive effect was overwhelmed by the negative effect on the formation of i dbps at a high pbo2 dose gallard et al 2009 illustrated that the formation of tim decreased as the dose of mno2 was higher than 0 5 g l 1 in a mno2 i nom system the formation of i dbps increased significantly as i concentration increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 and remained almost unchanged as i concentration further increased to 3 0 mg l 1 fig 6b for example the fps of diacam were 1 4 8 6 and 9 4 µg l 1 with an i concentration of 0 1 1 0 and 3 0 mg l 1 respectively the result indicates that the i2 hoi reacted with eps reached saturation and the excess fraction was further oxidized to io3 after 72 h reaction the concentration of io3 increased from 14 3 to 67 9 and 280 5 µg l 1 as i concentration increased from 0 1 to 1 0 and 3 0 mg l 1 3 4 formation of i dbps from eps proteins and polysaccharides proteins and polysaccharides were reported as the major components ca 80 of eps comte et al 2006 the two biomolecules were extracted and used as precursors to further elucidate the i dbps formation proteins presented a higher fp of c idbps than polysaccharides with values of 201 8 and 52 7 µg l 1 respectively fig 7 hong et al 2008 illustrated that proteins were the most important precursors of both thms and haas among three biomolecules i e proteins polysaccharides and lipids in the biofilms it can be interpreted as the influence of electron withdrawing groups on the electrophilic substitution reactivity of organic compounds proteins are primarily made up of the amino acids containing unsaturated conjugated bonds or phenolic structures while polysaccharides are mainly composed of the carbohydrates containing saturated carbon ring structures wingender et al 1999 the unsaturated conjugated bonds or phenolic structures were more capable of withdrawing electrons from α carbon than the saturated carbon ring structures which was beneficial to the electrophilic iodination it was reported that the homogeneous distribution of electron density was not conducive to the occurrence of electrophilic substitution gallard et al 2009 liu et al 2017b compared to polysaccharides proteins also had a higher fp of n idbps with values of 2 5 and 41 8 µg l 1 respectively it was in accordance with a previous study of wang et al 2012 in which p putida eps mainly contains proteins showed a higher fp of hans than p aeruginosa eps mainly contains polysaccharides during chlorination the results can be explained by that proteins provided a higher content of n and more reaction sites for electrophilic iodination than polysaccharides galactose glucosamine glucose mannose glucuronic acid and rhamnose have been reported as the main eps polysaccharide monomers which contain no organic n except glucosamine flemming and wingender 2010 wang et al 2013 as expected the cho cell cytotoxicity of i dbps from proteins was higher than that from polysaccharides with a cell survival rate of 30 8 and 36 9 respectively at a dilution ratio of 1 30 fig s2 3 5 formation of i dbps from amino acids as mentioned above eps proteins were considered as the main precursors for the i dbps formation twenty amino acids contained in proteins were identified and used as precursors with a concentration of 2 0 mg c l 1 each to investigate the impact of chemical structures on the formation of i dbps table 1 for i thms asp trp and his had a considerably high fp of tim with values of 436 0 281 9 and 133 3 μg l 1 respectively hong et al 2009 reported that trp had the highest fp of thms during chlorination the formation mechanism of thms from trp included decarboxylation and substitution to successively generate tryptamine and 3 chloroindole intermediates followed by the cleavage of five membered heterocyclic ring li et al 2019 the formation pathway of i thms was similar to that of thms however it was asp that presented the highest fp of i thms in this study liu et al 2017b reported that asp had a higher fp of i thms than ala gly his phe pro and tyr during the chloramination of i containing waters while the comparison between asp and trp was unavailable chen 2017 proposed that the formation of thms from asp was possibly via the generation of chloroacetaldehyde which was prone to occur the elimination of acetaldehyde unfortunately the mechanism is not supported by the detection of chloroacetaldehyde because of its low formation and unstable structure therefore it remains unknown why asp had a higher fp of i thms than trp which needs further investigation another difference from the previous literature is that his had a relatively higher fp of i thms except asp and trp which may be interpreted as a similar iodination mechanism of trp decarboxylation and substitution to generate 3 iodoimidazole followed by the cleavage of imidazole ring li 2011 for i haas it was observed that only asp asn and trp presented a fp of diaa wang et al 2013 demonstrated the importance of amine group for the high level of haas formation during chlorination by comparing the chemical composition of asp and succinic acid which lacks an amino group on α carbons however in this study it is believed that the two carboxyl groups in asp is another reason for the high fp of i haas the formed nitriles r ch2 cn were deemed as the critical intermediates for the initial reactions of amino acids the h atoms on the α carbons were substituted by i atoms to generate diiodonitriles r ci2 cn the elimination of side chain r occurred to produce diiodoacetonitrile chi2 cn subsequently the addition of hoi to the nitrile group induced the formation of n iodoamides chi2 co nhi which were quickly hydrolyzed to diaa liu et al 2017b the r group in asp is carboxyl with an electron withdrawing effect which facilitated its elimination asp had a much higher fp of diaa than asn and trp the r groups of acyl and indolyl with a weaker electron withdrawing capacity than carboxyl with values of 50 5 10 3 and 6 7 μg l 1 respectively an unobserved formation of i haas from leu ser and phe the r groups of alkyl hydroxyl and phenyl with an electron donating capacity further confirms the promotion effect of the carboxyl groups in asp on the formation of i haas for i hans and i hacams asp asn and tyr had a relatively high fps of both dian and diacam with values of 8 8 and 11 8 8 2 and 9 2 and 7 6 and 9 4 μg l 1 respectively the consistent formation of i hans and i hacams can be explained by the fact that i hacams are mainly hydrolyzed from i hans it was reported that both asp and asn primarily contributed to the formation of hans through the elimination of r groups carboxyl and acyl for asp and asn respectively from dichloronitriles r ccl2 cn wang et al 2013 as for tyr the benzyl cyanide c6h5 ch2 cn was also substituted by the i atoms on the α carbon to form dian after dephenylation except for 4 hydroxyl benzyl cyanide hoc6h5 ch2 cn intermediate chu et al 2012 in a word asp exhibited a high fp of both c and n idbps which can be partly account for its highest chronic cytotoxicity fig s3 considering the proportions of amino acids and the fps of i dbps asp was the primary contributor to the formation of i thms and i haas while all of asp asn and tyr were the important precursors of i hans and i hacams table 1 3 6 control strategy several countermeasures were proposed for i dbps control when biofilm outbreaks in lead containing water pipes 1 increasing water alkalinity and hardness to some extent ph increases with increasing alkalinity decreasing the electrochemical driving force δeh for i dbps formation in addition the increase of alkalinity and hardness facilitates the precipitation of calcium carbonate caco3 which covers the corroded surface and thus reduces the contact area between pbo2 and bulk water 2 disinfection by free chlorine and maintain a high residue the vast majority of i was oxidized to io3 in the presence of excess free chlorine however a large amount of free chlorine is likely to induce the increase of cl dbps which should also be paid attention to 3 hydraulic removal of biofilm hydraulic scour is known as an effective way for biofilm shedding from pipe interface a drawback of hydraulic scour is that pb will be released into the bulk water when biofilm is removed therein hydraulic flow rate is a critical factor and needed to be selected prudently 4 conclusions this study investigated the oxidation of i by pbo2 and formation of i dbps with biofilm eps and its components proteins and polysaccharides as precursors based on the experimental data the following conclusions are drawn at a high rpb i 100 the k obs and kobs of i oxidation decreased as ph increased from 6 0 to 9 0 with an h dependence of 0 79 and the k value was determined to be 1 6 1011 m 2 79 s 1 most of i2 hoi 92 was further converted to toi in the presence of eps compared with ha the i dbps from eps showed a stronger chronic cytotoxicity due to the higher fp of n idbps the formation of i thms i haas and i hans was facilitated at an acidic ph whereas that of i hacams achieved maximum under a neutral condition pbo2 dose and i concentration also had a significant impact on the formation of i dbps proteins showed a higher fp of both c and n idbps than polysaccharides due to the more sites for electrophilic iodination and higher content of n considering the contents in proteins asp was the main contributor to the formation of i thms and i haas while asp asn and tyr were the important precursors of i hans and i hacams declaration of competing interest all authors declare no conflict of interest for the manuscript entitled formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous iodinated

17453,novel control strategies for membrane biofouling with eco friendly photocatalytic technology are critically needed in practical operation of membrane bioreactors mbrs in this study a metal organic frameworks mof based photocatalytic membrane was firstly applied in an anammox mbr for a long term biofouling control where bacteria were inactivated and foulants were degraded simultaneously with environmentally friendly and renewable visible light energy by physicochemical characterization the synthesized photocatalyst of cds mil 101 showed superior visible light photocatalytic ability and the 1 wt cds mil 101 modified membrane c2 showed enhanced hydrophilicity and water permeability compared with the pristine membrane c0 in the long term operation of anammox mbrs under waterproof lights irradiation the filtration cycles of c2 25 26 d were obviously extended compared with c0 10 14 d while their average total nitrogen removal efficiencies were comparable up to 84 indicating an excellent biofouling alleviation effect by using c2 with a satisfactory nitrogen removal performance maintained by analysis of the biofilm on the fouled membranes the organic foulants especially extracellular polymeric substances were degraded and the live bacteria were inactivated effectively by the photocatalytic reactions of cds mil 101 on c2 in the antimicrobial tests against model bacteria c2 exhibited remarkable antimicrobial effect against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria with visible light irradiation by destruction of cell integrity with the inhibition rate of 92 for escherichia coli and 95 for staphylococcus aureus respectively in the model foulants bovine serum albumin sodium alginate and humic acid filtration tests c2 showed higher antifouling capabilities lower flux declining rates and higher foulants rejection rates under visible light irradiation compared with c0 the reactive species of oh e and h generated on c2 were verified to play the predominant role in the anti biofouling processes by simultaneous bacteria inactivation and foulants degradation the findings offer a novel insight into the biofouling controlling in mbrs by simultaneous bacteria inactivation and foulants degradation with an eco friendly method graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox mbr biofouling control visible light photocatalyst membrane modification bacteria inactivation light energy 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs which utilize membranes for water filtration from sludge have been widely used for municipal and industrial sewage treatment in the past several decades due to their advantages of smaller footprint lower excess sludge production better effluent quality and complete biomass retention chen et al 2016 liu et al 2019 tan et al 2019 however membrane fouling which results in additional energy consumption and labor requirements for the operation and maintenance of mbrs is deemed as the major constraint on the development of mbr meng et al 2017 teng et al 2018 for instance membrane aeration which is one of the most common methods to detach foulants from the membrane accounts for approximately half of the total energy consumption in mbrs krzeminski et al 2012 sun et al 2016 among various types of mbr membrane fouling biofouling is considered as a thorny issue because the microorganisms can proliferate on the membrane surface produce microbial products and form communities and biofilms miura et al 2007 zhu et al 2017 so far numerous strategies have been employed to mitigate mbr biofouling xiong and liu 2010 with a particular focus on the anti biofouling modification of the membrane meng et al 2017 perreault et al 2016 common mbr membrane modification strategies are mainly concentrated on hydrophilicity and antimicrobial modification the former enhances the membrane hydrophilicity by blending hydrophilic monomers nanomaterials or compounds while its antifouling efficiency is always weakened when encountering fast microbial reproduction and biofilm formation on the membrane shen et al 2018 tiraferri et al 2012 xiong et al 2019 the latter incorporates biocide agents on the membrane to deactivate bacteria upon contact and reduce the initial biofilm formation rate ben sasson et al 2014 kochkodan and hilal 2015 while the continuous depletion of releasable biocides such as silver ions ag and quaternary ammonium compound qac is the major restrictive problem because of the antimicrobial function loss after complete dissolution of the biocides jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b moreover the leaching of toxic biocides potentially results in secondary pollution and environmental risks levard et al 2013 levard et al 2012 accordingly new control strategies for mbr membrane biofouling which apply environmentally friendly and renewable technology such as photocatalysis to provide membranes with capability of simultaneous bacteria inactivation and foulants degradation are urgently needed in the stable operation of mbr processes semiconductor photocatalysis technology has been regarded as one of the most generally studied solar fuel strategies for solving the environmental pollution by photocatalytic degradation of various toxic and harmful pollutants cheng et al 2018 kudo and miseki 2009 xie et al 2013 under the illumination of light photocatalysts can activate oxygen and water to produce a series of oxidative species such as oh and o2 under ambient conditions chen et al 2010 lee and ko 2013 li et al 2015 and then effectively inactivate microbial pathogens as well as oxidize organic contaminants into carbon dioxide water and simple mineral acids ni et al 2016 tang et al 2017 therefore the photocatalysis technology can theoretically be an environmentally friendly control strategy for mbr membrane biofouling with the capacities of foulants degradation and sterilization on membranes however photocatalysis is very limited in practical application of membrane fouling resistance especially in mbr processes due to high turbidity in the reactor and transmission obstacle of light meng et al 2017 although some photocatalyst modified membranes have been prepared the pollutants degradation experiments were all conducted in optimized conditions such as in a petri dish or a quartz cup with external light sources and synthesized single foulant li et al 2017 rao et al 2016 xu et al 2016 for example a go tio2 photocatalytic polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane was prepared for obtaining improved photodegradation efficiency toward bovine serum albumin bsa under ultraviolet uv light irradiation xu et al 2016 pvdf membrane was also modified with 3d tio2 zno and fe2o3 tio2 go respectively and both the modified membranes obtained photocatalytic degradation activities against humic acid ha li et al 2017 rao et al 2016 however the conventional illumination method used in their tests i e external light irradiation greatly limited the application of the photocatalytic membranes in mbrs to the best of our knowledge new illumination methods such as underwater irradiation with waterproof lights are never tried to alleviate the transmission obstacle of light in practical membrane filtration systems and no study on mbr membrane biofouling control by photocatalysis technology is reported up to now consequently there is a critical requirement to apply a new illumination method i e underwater irradiation for in situ mbr membrane biofouling control with photocatalytic membranes by simultaneous foulants degradation and sterilization among various photocatalytic materials visible light photocatalysts are paid more attention compared with uv photocatalysts because of the economy and safety of visible light li et al 2011 cadmium sulfide cds is considered as one of the most prominent photocatalysts due to its favorable visible light response capability cheng et al 2018 hao and lang 2019 but is still limited by agglomeration rapid recombination of electron hole pairs and severe photocorrosion chen et al 2015 yan et al 2016 calling for the combination with other functional materials to achieve a synergetic effect chen et al 2018 in recent years metal organic frameworks mofs as a class of porous and crystalline materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers have been proved to be a new promising material for hydrogen evolution and pollutants degradation gu et al 2016 laurier et al 2013 mil 101 cr cr3f h2o 2o bdc 3 nh2o bdc terephthalic acid a cr based mof synthesized by ferey et al ferey et al 2005 exhibits prominent characteristics of large surface area high electrical conductivity and well ordered porous structures leading to its wide applications in enhancing the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts huo et al 2019 wang et al 2016b cds nanoparticles have been loaded on the surface of mil 101 to construct cds mil 101 heterostructure photocatalyst he et al 2013 whose photocatalytic hydrogen production capacity was effectively enhanced meng et al 2019 wang et al 2016b therefore cds mil 101 is speculated to be feasible and efficient not only in the field of hydrogen evolution but also in the application of pollutants degradation and bacteria inactivation in this study the pvdf membrane was modified with the visible light photocatalyst of cds mil 101 cr for in situ membrane biofouling control in a practical anaerobic ammonium oxidation mbr anammox mbr by underwater visible light irradiation the anti biofouling performance of the new photocatalytic membrane was investigated and the biofilm on fouled membranes was analyzed during long term operation of anammox process for the first time this study provides a novel application method of photocatalytic membrane in the anti biofouling process of practical anammox mbr through simultaneous bacteria inactivation and foulants degradation by underwater visible light irradiation paves a new pathway for mbr membrane biofouling control with environmentally friendly and cost effective strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals all chemicals and bacteria information in our experiments is available in supporting information si text s1 the visible light source in all photocatalytic anti biofouling tests was commercial waterproof led lights of 15 w with a white light emitting 400 760 nm and a color temperature of 6500 k the lights were immersed in the solution and positioned adjacent to membrane surface to provide a light intensity of 30 w m 2 measured with hd 2302 0 light meter delta ohm 2 2 preparation of cds mil 101 composites and cds mil 101 modified membranes the cds mil 101 nanoparticles were synthesized by a modified hydrothermal procedure and the preparation procedures are shown in si text s2 cds mil 101 modified pvdf membranes were prepared by a phase inversion method via immersion precipitation in brief a predetermined amount of pvdf polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp and cds mil 101 powder was dried for 24 h at 80 c to eliminate moisture a definite amount of cds mil 101 powder was added in a 250 ml conical flask containing 78 g n n dimethylacetamide dmac and dissolved completely under sonication subsequently 19 g pvdf and 3 g pvp were added and stirred at 80 c overnight to form a homogenous casting solution followed by vacuum degassing for 2 h then a casting knife with a clearance of 250 µm was used to spread the casting solution onto a glass pane using an elcometer 4340 motorized film applicator elcometer ltd u k finally the casted film was allowed to evaporate for 30 s before immersed into a coagulation bath deionized water at room temperature to obtain the membranes the resulting modified membranes with 0 0 5 1 and 1 5 wt cds mil 101 addition were denoted as c0 control c1 c2 and c3 respectively 2 3 photocatalysts and membranes

sem is available in si text s3 pure water permeability tests of membranes were conducted in a dead end filtration cell sinap china and the detailed method is presented in si text s4 reactive oxidizing species oh and o2 from membranes were quantitatively detected at low do concentration 0 1 mg l and at ph 7 8 for mimicking the environment of the anammox mbr and the procedure is presented in si text s5 2 4 antibacterial behavior tests against model bacteria a gram positive staphylococcus aureus s aureus and a gram negative escherichia coli e coli were used as model bacteria for antibacterial tests of the membranes viable cell attachment and inactivation experiments with a plate counting method were carried out with or without visible light irradiation liu et al 2017 diffusion inhibition zone diz tests were performed following a modified clsi m07 a9 method chen et al 2003 detailed experiments procedures are documented in si text s6 2 5 antifouling behavior measurements against model foulants bsa ha and sodium alginate sa as model foulants for proteins humic substances and polysaccharides in wastewater respectively were used in the membrane filtration tests and the tests methods are presented in si text s7 the relative flux of membrane foulants was determined as j j0 j and j0 represent the membrane flux at a single moment and the initial flux respectively and the membrane rejection rate r of foulants can be calculated by eq 1 each reported value was expressed by averaging three measurements 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where c p mg l is the foulant concentration in the permeate and c f mg l is the foulant concentration in the feed 2 6 in situ anti biofouling experiments in anammox mbrs the long term anti biofouling behaviors of the cds mil 101 modified membrane c2 and the pristine membrane c0 were compared in two parallel anammox mbrs with the same operational parameters more information of reactors operation can be found in si text s8 and the ingredient of the synthesized influent is shown in table s1 the trans membrane pressure tmp was recorded daily by a pressure gauge when the tmp reached 35 kpa the filtration time was determined as a filtration cycle after which the fouled membrane was withdrawn cleaned with a brush and flushed with pure water to remove the foulants on the membrane for confocal laser scanning microscope clsm olympus fv 3000 japan observation 1 cm2 of membrane sample was cut from the fouled membranes after a specific filtration cycle stained with live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes inc and concavalin a con a molecular probes inc to respectively label viable dead cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps polysaccharide won et al 2012 the deposited foulants on membranes was also determined by quantifying the total solids and volatile solids in accordance with standard methods apha 2006 the total amount of bacteria on the fouled membranes was analyzed by qpcr measurements by evaluating the absolute abundance of 16s rrna genes the primers for amplification of 16s rrna genes were 1369f 5 cggtgaatacgttcycgg 3 and 1492r 5 ggwtaccttgttacgact 3 in addition eps contents and components in biofilm on the fouled membranes were analyzed and the methods are documented in si text s9 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological physicochemical and optical characterization of photocatalysts the morphologies of the prepared photocatalysts were analyzed using tem characterization fig 1 a and b show that the equally distributed mil 101 particles display octahedral nanocrystals with the size of 200 500 nm and their surfaces become rough by cds decoration the hrtem image reveals a lattice spacing of 0 336 nm corresponding to the 002 crystallographic planes of cubic cds fig 1c proving the successful formation of cds mil 101 heterojunction structure by which the charge transport between cds and mil 101 and the photocatalytic capacity of the hybrid cds mil 101 may be promoted the crystallographic structure of the photocatalysts was examined by xrd fig 1d and the pattern of cds mil 101 clearly shows the main characteristic peaks of both cds and mil 101 confirming the successful preparation of cds mil 101 hybrid and the crystallographic integrity of mil 101 after cds deposition the ftir spectra shown in fig 1e were utilized to characterize the functional groups on the photocatalysts for cds mil 101 the large band around 3500 cm 1 confirms the hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite ferey et al 2005 moreover no obvious spectra difference of mil 101 and cds mil 101 is observed and all the bands demonstrate the dominance of the properties of mil 101 in the hybrid cds mil 101 the composition and valence state of cds mil 101 were confirmed by xps as shown in the survey spectra fig 1f cd and s elements from cds and cr o n and c elements from mil 101 can all be observed in the spectrum of cds mil 101 demonstrating that the elemental composition of cds mil 101 is in good agreement with the target composition the binding energy of cd 3d and s 2p in the hybrid is slightly increased compared with that of the pure cds fig s1a and b which may be due to the possible interfacial interaction and electron transfer between cds and mil 101 jiang et al 2018 the peak at 532 3 ev for o 1s spectrum of cds mil 101 is ascribed from surface molecular water fig s1e by which the hydrophilicity of cds mil 101 is further testified ahmed et al 2015 detailed peaks analysis of xrd diffraction ftir and xps of the photocatalysts is shown in si text s10 the optical properties of the photocatalysts were determined by uv vis drs and pl emission spectra as shown in fig 1g the spectrum of cd mil 101 shows a combination of the spectral features of pure cds and mil 101 and exhibits a broad absorption in the visible light region illustrating the enhanced visible light utilization capacity of cd mil 101 by calculation of the band gap eg with the formula in fig 1h butler 1977 dai et al 2014 the eg of cds mil 101 2 19 ev is lower than that of cds and mil 101 2 28 and 2 40 ev respectively indicating that the heterojunction between cds and mil 101 effectively narrowed the band gap of the hybrid which is helpful for the generation of photodegradation carriers and the promotion of visible light photocatalytic reactions the pl spectra can be regarded as a direct approach to understand the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers on the photocatalysts qiu et al 2017 as shown in fig 1i the fluorescence peak intensity of cds mil 101 is remarkably lower than that of pure mil 101 indicating the efficient inhibition of photogenerated electron hole pairs recombination by the formation of cds mil 101 heterojunction more optical analysis about the photocatalysts could be found in si text s11 in a word cds mil 101 was prepared successfully and excellent photocatalytic property of the cds mil 101 in visible light region was obtained in our tests 3 2 properties characterization of the cds mil 101 modified membranes the synthesized membranes were characterized in terms of zeta potential pore size contact angle water permeability sem and reactive species tests fig 2 fig 2a shows that all pvdf membranes display a negative surface charge which increased evidently with the increasing of cds mil 101 addition dosage 0 1 5 wt for c0 c3 because of the blending of higher charged cds 2 01 mv ayodhya and veerabhadram 2017 and positively charged mil 101 liu et al 2015 confirming the successful immobilization and the dominance of cds mil 101 on the modified membranes the average pore sizes of c1 and c2 are not significantly p 0 05 decreased compared with that of c0 fig 2b while it decreased significantly p 0 05 for c3 which might be attributed to the deposition of excessive cds mil 101 nanoparticles 1 5 wt in the casting solution the hydrophilicity plays an important role in determining anti adhesion ability of ultrafiltration membranes mansouri et al 2010 as shown in fig 2c the water contact angle of the membranes reduces continuously with increasing the modification dosage 0 1 5 wt of cds mil 101 for c0 c3 as characterized by ftir fig 1e and xps fig s1 the improved hydrophilicity can be ascribed to the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on cds mil 101 nanoparticles which may form an ultrathin water layer on the membrane surface via intermolecular hydrogen bonding xu et al 2019 in addition the water permeability of c2 is 21 9 higher than that of c0 fig 2d probably because of its significantly enhanced p 0 05 hydrophilicity safarpour et al 2015 the decreased water permeability of c3 may be ascribed to its evidently decreased pore size p 0 05 by excessive cds mil 101 addition compared with c0 xu et al 2016 in summary the modification of cds mil 101 with 1 0 wt dosage endowed the pristine pvdf membrane enhanced hydrophilicity and permeability and c2 was further investigated in the anti biofouling experiments as the optimal modified membrane as shown in fig 2e the morphologies of membranes c2 and c0 were characterized by sem it is observed that abundant of cds mil 101 nanoparticles which can provide favorable hydrophilicity fig 2d and photocatalytic ability fig 1g and i are evenly distributed on c2 reactive oxidizing radicals of o2 and oh generated on c2 were quantitatively analyzed by chemical probe transformation as shown in fig 2f an obviously higher concentration of oh than o2 was produced on c2 under visible light irradiation illustrating that oh was the main oxidizing species in the aquatic environment with low do concentration 0 1 mg l and the generated oh may play important role in foulants oxidation and bacteria inactivation in addition nearly no concentration variations of radical species are observed in dark suggesting that the radical species were only generated under visible light irradiation from cds mil 101 nanoparticles on c2 3 3 antimicrobial activity of the modified membrane against model bacteria to evaluate the antimicrobial property of c2 viable bacteria attachment and inactivation tests for model bacteria were conducted and the results are shown in fig 3 a in dark nearly no e coli and s aureus was inactivated by c2 demonstrating that c2 was biocompatible in dark and no much toxic ions such as cd2 s2 cr3 or cr6 was dissolved under visible light irradiation the inactivation rate of c2 against e coli and s aureus reaches 93 and 89 respectively implying an excellent antimicrobial ability of c2 this was mainly attributed to the photocatalysis sterilization effect of reactive species such as oh from cds mil 101 fig 2f on c2 fig 2e under visible light irradiation in addition no inactivation effect for c0 was observed under light irradiation suggesting that the sterilization of sole visible light was ignorable according to the cells morphologies of the bacteria attached on membranes characterized by sem fig 3b e the cellular morphologies of e coli and s aureus on c0 are intact while that on c2 exhibit losses in cell integrity which could be interpreted that the active species generated on c2 under visible light irradiation fig 2f induced damage to the cells membrane and resulted in the release of cellular contents and ultimate death of the bacteria ding et al 2014 xia et al 2017 as shown in fig 3f i the favorable antibacterial capacity of c2 under visible light irradiation was further demonstrated by the diz tests that c2 shows obvious inhibition zones against e coli fig 3g and s aureus fig 3i compared with c0 in contrast areas around c0 and c2 are completely covered by the bacteria colonies in dark fig 3f and h proving the nontoxicity and biocompatibility of c2 without light irradiation once more in addition no apparent inhibition zone is observed around c0 for both e coli and s aureus in spite of visible light irradiation further illustrating that the bacteria are difficult to be inactivated with sole visible light photolysis 3 4 antifouling activity of the modified membrane against model foulants the normalized water flux variations of c2 and c0 during the filtration of model foulants bsa ha and sa solutions with or without visible light irradiation are shown in fig 4 under visible light irradiation the development of foulants layer on the membrane resulted in a water flux decline of 17 8 68 and 16 1 for c2 by light irradiation compared with that of 39 2 100 and 36 for c0 during 40 min filtration of bsa ha and sa respectively indicating evident antifouling property of c2 with light irradiation the adhered foulants were speculated to be degraded by the reactive species such as oh generated on c2 fig 2f leading to the alleviation of membrane pores blocking and the retard of flux decline when without light irradiation a slightly lower flux decline ratio of c2 than c0 for all foulants can be observed in fig 4 suggesting the intrinsic superior antifouling ability of c2 which was related to its better water permeability and hydrophilicity than c0 fig 2c and d zhu et al 2014 in addition the similar flux decline trends of c0 at both light irradiation and dark conditions for all foulants indicate that the sole photolysis of foulants by visible light was negligible the foulants rejection properties of c0 and c2 in the filtration tests were evaluated table s2 without visible light irradiation the rejection rates of bsa ha and sa for c2 are significantly higher than that for c0 p 0 05 demonstrating an improvement in the ultrafiltration performance of c2 the better rejection rates of c2 can be explained by the combination of its slightly smaller pore size fig 2b and the enhanced hydrophilicity fig 2d based on the principle of interfacial hydration layer as protective barrier xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 specifically the foulants rejection rates for c2 under visible light irradiation are further enhanced compared with that in dark table s2 suggesting that a part of foulants on c2 were degraded by photocatalysis resulting in the alleviation of membrane pores blocking and decreased foulants concentrations in the permeate the degraded parts of foulants were considered as the difference values of the rejection rates of c2 at conditions of light irradiation and dark i e 4 43 3 59 and 6 79 for bsa ha and sa respectively 3 5 in situ anti biofouling performance of the modified membrane in mbr membranes c2 and c0 were respectively operated in two identical mbrs for anammox process according to the schematic plots of the reactors shown in fig 5 a four waterproof led lights were anchored adjacent to membrane to largely avoid the negative effect of the visible light on microorganisms a non transparent plastic cloth was wrapped on the membrane module and covered on the led lights not shown in fig 5a during 51 d operation fig 5b the filtration cycles of c2 25 26 d are evidently longer than that of c0 10 14 d and only one time cleaning was carried out for c2 compared with three times for c0 in accordance with the decreased flux decline of c2 in fig 4 indicating a significantly alleviated membrane fouling on c2 the extended filtration cycles of c2 could effectively reduce the energy consumption for filtration suction and the labor cost for membranes cleaning moreover the tmp profile of c2 exhibits a slow increase in the initial stage about 15 days followed by a rapid rise it can be speculated that the deposited foulants were degraded fig 4 and the attached bacteria were inactivated fig 3 on c2 easily in the initial stage maintaining a high water flux of c2 but the photocatalytic effect was gradually weakened due to the light shielding by the increasing biofoulants leading to the rapid increase of tmp in addition the nitrogen removal performance of the two reactors were comparable fig s2 and the mean total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre reached 0 87 0 06 and 0 84 0 06 for mbr with c0 and mbr with c2 respectively fig 5b suggesting that the anti biofouling process of c2 with visible light brought no negative influences on the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox mbr noteworthily a dramatic tnre drop after each time cleaning and a slow tnre recovery for both two reactors are observed which was probably due to the disturbance of membranes cleaning procedures therefore the reduced membrane cleaning times for c2 were beneficial not only for saving of operational cost but also for the maintaining of high nitrogen removal performance of anammox mbrs after a filtration cycle the foulants on c2 and c0 were analyzed for total solids volatile solids eps components and total bacteria amount as shown in table 1 the total solids on c2 are comparable to that on c0 while the volatile solids percentage of c2 44 3 is significantly lower than that of c0 82 6 p 0 05 besides the total eps content on c2 9 5 10 3 mg cm2 is significantly lower than that on c0 17 7 10 3 mg cm2 p 0 05 the organic foulants including eps on c2 were probably degraded by the active species such as oh generated by c2 with visible light irradiation fig 2f the protein proportion in eps on c2 62 1 is obviously lower than that on c0 79 1 while the polysaccharides 30 5 and humic substances 7 4 proportions in eps on c2 are higher than that 17 5 for polysaccharides and 3 4 for humic substances on c0 this is possibly because protein in eps is more prone to be degraded by visible light photocatalysis than polysaccharides and humic substances due to the lower molecular weight of protein lee and kim 2013 the lower volatile solids percentage of c2 than c0 could be speculated that the big molecular biofoulants were degraded into small molecular intermediate products which were easily dissolved in the feed water or penetrated with the permeate water in addition a significantly lower p 0 05 total bacteria amount on c2 6 63 108 than c0 2 24 109 was revealed by qpcr measurements further confirming the excellent sterilization and anti adhesion properties against bacteria for c2 by photocatalysis taken together c2 exhibited favorable antibacterial and antifouling capabilities in practical anammox mbr in consistent with the results of antibacterial experiments against model bacteria fig 3 and antifouling experiments against model foulants fig 4 respectively biofilm on the fouled membranes was visualized with clsm and the images are shown in fig 6 clearly c0 is mainly covered with live microbial cells green in fig 6a and b while c2 is mainly covered with dead bacteria red in fig 6e and f moreover the eps is observed uniformly distributing on c0 gray in fig 6c and its volume is obviously higher than that on c2 fig 6g illustrating that the photocatalytic capacity of c2 effectively killed the attached bacteria and degraded the deposited organic foulants according to the 3d structure images of c2 fig 6h and c0 fig 6d c2 is covered with a rough dead cells layer red decorated with few live bacteria green in gaps further testifying that the photocatalysis effect of c2 brought about evident inhibition on the biofilm development causing retarded tmp increase rates and extended filtration cycles in the anammox mbr operation process fig 5b 3 6 antimicrobial and antifouling mechanisms of the cds mil 101 modified membrane the excellent anti biofouling effect of c2 was attributed to the enhanced photocatalytic property of cds mil 101 heterojunction mounted on the membrane as illustrated in fig 7 the irradiated visible light is mainly absorbed by cds and partly by the photosensitizer unit of mil 101 meng et al 2019 due to the appropriate band structures cds can be excited to generate electrons e in the conduction band cb and leave holes h in the valence band vb since the cb edge of mil 101 1 91 ev is more negative than that of cds 0 52 ev e can be transferred from the cb of mil 101 to that of cds therefore mil 101 not only serves as a support but also acts as a conducting medium to transfer the photoinduced electrons delay the recombination of electron hole pairs and prevent the photocorrosion of cds moreover the large specific surface area of mil 101 provides more adsorption sites and reaction centers further improving the visible light photocatalytic capacity of cds mil 101 it is widely known that the photocatalytic degradation process takes place via the oxidation or reduction of organic molecules with photogenerated h e and reactive oxidizing species such as o2 and oh which are produced by photocatalytic reduction of do by e and oxidation of water by h bai et al 2013 xu et al 2015 yan et al 2009 however due to the low concentration of do 0 01 mg l in the anammox mbr o2 was difficult to be generated and oh was prone to be generated as the main oxidizing species by the reaction of h and oh because of the slightly alkaline environment ph 7 5 8 5 in the anammox mbr fig 2f it was also reported that the degradation efficiency of organic pollutant ofloxacin for photocatalyst tio2 nanotube was almost the same in presence or absence of do while e replaced o2 as the leading reactive species chen et al 2020 consequently oh e and h were considered as main reactive species and could be responsible for photocatalytic foulants decomposition and bacteria disinfection on c2 in the anammox mbr ding et al 2014 xia et al 2017 the major reaction steps in the photocatalytic anti biofouling process by c2 are summarized as follows 2 c d s m i l 101 h v c d s e c b m i l 101 h v b 3 h h 2 o o h h 4 h o h o h 5 h e oh foulants degradation products in addition the oxidizing or reducing effect of the generated reactive species oh e and h on the intrinsic pvdf membrane and the reactor material in the repetitive usage was not observed which was probably due to the high stability of the polymeric materials 3 7 implications in the field of mbr membrane fouling control currently contact killing and release killing are considered as two main antimicrobial strategies for mbr membrane modification zhang et al 2016b contact killing strategy inhibits the bacteria proliferation by directly contacting the bacteria with the modified membrane while its antibacterial activity is always restricted by the formation of fouling layer on the membrane seon et al 2015 release killing strategy realizes sterilization by releasing bactericides while the continuous release of biocides not only results in limited working period of the antibacterial membrane but also probably raises perceived health and safety concerns bai et al 2015 for example although ag is one of the most extensively studied antimicrobial agents in membrane research remanan et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a a significant loss of ag was found in the antibacterial process of ag modified membranes when permeated with water and their antibacterial activity only maintained for several days huang et al 2016 son et al 2004 moreover the released ag may affect the effluent quality and bring negative influence to the functional bacteria in mbr wang et al 2016a in comparison the anti biofouling strategy based on visible light photocatalysis developed in this study avoids the disadvantages of both contact killing and release killing strategies specifically the generation and release of reactive species from the photocatalytic membrane is not limited to the direct contact between the biofoulants and the membrane the generated radical species are theoretically renewable with continuous visible light irradiation and bring no environmental risk due to their short lifetimes lacombe and pigot 2016 the energy consumption in the application of the photocatalytic membranes was mainly the electric consumption by the led lights which is calculated to be only 18 36 kw h per cycle 25 5 d in the operation of anammox mbr in the current study we not only develop a new anti biofouling membrane for mbr operation but also propose an eco friendly and cost effective way to realize simultaneous bacteria inactivation and foulants degradation with renewable and environmentally friendly energy and prove the feasibility of this way in practical anammox mbr future investigations should focus on exploring the photocatalysts with more effective photocatalytic activity and the photocatalytic membranes with more reasonable modification dosages the in situ light illumination technologies in the mbrs may be further optimized to provide more efficient and energy saving irradiation methods 4 conclusions visible light photocatalyst of cds mil 101 was successfully fabricated and blended into pvdf membrane to prepare a photocatalytic membrane for in situ anti biofouling application in an anammox mbr by physicochemical characterization the synthesized cds mil 101 showed superior visible light photocatalytic ability and the 1 wt cds mil 101 modified membrane c2 showed enhanced hydrophilicity and water permeability compared with the pristine pvdf membrane c0 in the antimicrobial tests against model bacteria the modified membrane c2 exhibited significant antimicrobial capability with visible light irradiation against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria by destruction of cell integrity antifouling tests against model organic foulants bsa sa and ha indicated that the membrane c2 had higher antifouling property lower flux declining rate and higher foulants rejection rates under the irradiation of visible light compared with c0 in situ anti biofouling performance of the modified membrane was investigated by applying c2 membrane in an anammox mbr under in situ irradiation of waterproof lights in comparison with c0 in a parallel mbr the tmp increase was retarded and the membrane fouling was alleviated in long term operation of anammox process with c2 membrane while the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor was not affected moreover the deposited organic foulants including eps were degraded obviously and the attached bacteria were inactivated significantly on c2 which were proved by further characterization of clsm the antifouling and antibacterial mechanism of c2 was speculated to be the generation of reactive species e g oh e and h from the cds mil 101 nanoparticles in the membrane by visible light irradiation the results of this work provide a novel application of visible light photocatalytic technology in mbr biofouling control holding a great potential for realizing in situ mbr membrane biofouling control with eco friendly solar energy

17453,novel control strategies for membrane biofouling with eco friendly photocatalytic technology are critically needed in practical operation of membrane bioreactors mbrs in this study a metal organic frameworks mof based photocatalytic membrane was firstly applied in an anammox mbr for a long term biofouling control where bacteria were inactivated and foulants were degraded simultaneously with environmentally friendly and renewable visible light energy by physicochemical characterization the synthesized photocatalyst of cds mil 101 showed superior visible light photocatalytic ability and the 1 wt cds mil 101 modified membrane c2 showed enhanced hydrophilicity and water permeability compared with the pristine membrane c0 in the long term operation of anammox mbrs under waterproof lights irradiation the filtration cycles of c2 25 26 d were obviously extended compared with c0 10 14 d while their average total nitrogen removal efficiencies were comparable up to 84 indicating an excellent biofouling alleviation effect by using c2 with a satisfactory nitrogen removal performance maintained by analysis of the biofilm on the fouled membranes the organic foulants especially extracellular polymeric substances were degraded and the live bacteria were inactivated effectively by the photocatalytic reactions of cds mil 101 on c2 in the antimicrobial tests against model bacteria c2 exhibited remarkable antimicrobial effect against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria with visible light irradiation by destruction of cell integrity with the inhibition rate of 92 for escherichia coli and 95 for staphylococcus aureus respectively in the model foulants bovine serum albumin sodium alginate and humic acid filtration tests c2 showed higher antifouling capabilities lower flux declining rates and higher foulants rejection rates under visible light irradiation compared with c0 the reactive species of oh e and h generated on c2 were verified to play the predominant role in the anti biofouling processes by simultaneous bacteria inactivation and foulants degradation the findings offer a novel insight into the biofouling controlling in mbrs by simultaneous bacteria inactivation and foulants degradation with an eco friendly method graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox mbr biofouling control visible light photocatalyst membrane modification bacteria inactivation light energy 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs which utilize membranes for water filtration from sludge have been widely used for municipal and industrial sewage treatment in the past several decades due to their advantages of smaller footprint lower excess sludge production better effluent quality and complete biomass retention chen et al 2016 liu et al 2019 tan et al 2019 however membrane fouling which results in additional energy consumption and labor requirements for the operation and maintenance of mbrs is deemed as the major constraint on the development of mbr meng et al 2017 teng et al 2018 for instance membrane aeration which is one of the most common methods to detach foulants from the membrane accounts for approximately half of the total energy consumption in mbrs krzeminski et al 2012 sun et al 2016 among various types of mbr membrane fouling biofouling is considered as a thorny issue because the microorganisms can proliferate on the membrane surface produce microbial products and form communities and biofilms miura et al 2007 zhu et al 2017 so far numerous strategies have been employed to mitigate mbr biofouling xiong and liu 2010 with a particular focus on the anti biofouling modification of the membrane meng et al 2017 perreault et al 2016 common mbr membrane modification strategies are mainly concentrated on hydrophilicity and antimicrobial modification the former enhances the membrane hydrophilicity by blending hydrophilic monomers nanomaterials or compounds while its antifouling efficiency is always weakened when encountering fast microbial reproduction and biofilm formation on the membrane shen et al 2018 tiraferri et al 2012 xiong et al 2019 the latter incorporates biocide agents on the membrane to deactivate bacteria upon contact and reduce the initial biofilm formation rate ben sasson et al 2014 kochkodan and hilal 2015 while the continuous depletion of releasable biocides such as silver ions ag and quaternary ammonium compound qac is the major restrictive problem because of the antimicrobial function loss after complete dissolution of the biocides jiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b moreover the leaching of toxic biocides potentially results in secondary pollution and environmental risks levard et al 2013 levard et al 2012 accordingly new control strategies for mbr membrane biofouling which apply environmentally friendly and renewable technology such as photocatalysis to provide membranes with capability of simultaneous bacteria inactivation and foulants degradation are urgently needed in the stable operation of mbr processes semiconductor photocatalysis technology has been regarded as one of the most generally studied solar fuel strategies for solving the environmental pollution by photocatalytic degradation of various toxic and harmful pollutants cheng et al 2018 kudo and miseki 2009 xie et al 2013 under the illumination of light photocatalysts can activate oxygen and water to produce a series of oxidative species such as oh and o2 under ambient conditions chen et al 2010 lee and ko 2013 li et al 2015 and then effectively inactivate microbial pathogens as well as oxidize organic contaminants into carbon dioxide water and simple mineral acids ni et al 2016 tang et al 2017 therefore the photocatalysis technology can theoretically be an environmentally friendly control strategy for mbr membrane biofouling with the capacities of foulants degradation and sterilization on membranes however photocatalysis is very limited in practical application of membrane fouling resistance especially in mbr processes due to high turbidity in the reactor and transmission obstacle of light meng et al 2017 although some photocatalyst modified membranes have been prepared the pollutants degradation experiments were all conducted in optimized conditions such as in a petri dish or a quartz cup with external light sources and synthesized single foulant li et al 2017 rao et al 2016 xu et al 2016 for example a go tio2 photocatalytic polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane was prepared for obtaining improved photodegradation efficiency toward bovine serum albumin bsa under ultraviolet uv light irradiation xu et al 2016 pvdf membrane was also modified with 3d tio2 zno and fe2o3 tio2 go respectively and both the modified membranes obtained photocatalytic degradation activities against humic acid ha li et al 2017 rao et al 2016 however the conventional illumination method used in their tests i e external light irradiation greatly limited the application of the photocatalytic membranes in mbrs to the best of our knowledge new illumination methods such as underwater irradiation with waterproof lights are never tried to alleviate the transmission obstacle of light in practical membrane filtration systems and no study on mbr membrane biofouling control by photocatalysis technology is reported up to now consequently there is a critical requirement to apply a new illumination method i e underwater irradiation for in situ mbr membrane biofouling control with photocatalytic membranes by simultaneous foulants degradation and sterilization among various photocatalytic materials visible light photocatalysts are paid more attention compared with uv photocatalysts because of the economy and safety of visible light li et al 2011 cadmium sulfide cds is considered as one of the most prominent photocatalysts due to its favorable visible light response capability cheng et al 2018 hao and lang 2019 but is still limited by agglomeration rapid recombination of electron hole pairs and severe photocorrosion chen et al 2015 yan et al 2016 calling for the combination with other functional materials to achieve a synergetic effect chen et al 2018 in recent years metal organic frameworks mofs as a class of porous and crystalline materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers have been proved to be a new promising material for hydrogen evolution and pollutants degradation gu et al 2016 laurier et al 2013 mil 101 cr cr3f h2o 2o bdc 3 nh2o bdc terephthalic acid a cr based mof synthesized by ferey et al ferey et al 2005 exhibits prominent characteristics of large surface area high electrical conductivity and well ordered porous structures leading to its wide applications in enhancing the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts huo et al 2019 wang et al 2016b cds nanoparticles have been loaded on the surface of mil 101 to construct cds mil 101 heterostructure photocatalyst he et al 2013 whose photocatalytic hydrogen production capacity was effectively enhanced meng et al 2019 wang et al 2016b therefore cds mil 101 is speculated to be feasible and efficient not only in the field of hydrogen evolution but also in the application of pollutants degradation and bacteria inactivation in this study the pvdf membrane was modified with the visible light photocatalyst of cds mil 101 cr for in situ membrane biofouling control in a practical anaerobic ammonium oxidation mbr anammox mbr by underwater visible light irradiation the anti biofouling performance of the new photocatalytic membrane was investigated and the biofilm on fouled membranes was analyzed during long term operation of anammox process for the first time this study provides a novel application method of photocatalytic membrane in the anti biofouling process of practical anammox mbr through simultaneous bacteria inactivation and foulants degradation by underwater visible light irradiation paves a new pathway for mbr membrane biofouling control with environmentally friendly and cost effective strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals all chemicals and bacteria information in our experiments is available in supporting information si text s1 the visible light source in all photocatalytic anti biofouling tests was commercial waterproof led lights of 15 w with a white light emitting 400 760 nm and a color temperature of 6500 k the lights were immersed in the solution and positioned adjacent to membrane surface to provide a light intensity of 30 w m 2 measured with hd 2302 0 light meter delta ohm 2 2 preparation of cds mil 101 composites and cds mil 101 modified membranes the cds mil 101 nanoparticles were synthesized by a modified hydrothermal procedure and the preparation procedures are shown in si text s2 cds mil 101 modified pvdf membranes were prepared by a phase inversion method via immersion precipitation in brief a predetermined amount of pvdf polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp and cds mil 101 powder was dried for 24 h at 80 c to eliminate moisture a definite amount of cds mil 101 powder was added in a 250 ml conical flask containing 78 g n n dimethylacetamide dmac and dissolved completely under sonication subsequently 19 g pvdf and 3 g pvp were added and stirred at 80 c overnight to form a homogenous casting solution followed by vacuum degassing for 2 h then a casting knife with a clearance of 250 µm was used to spread the casting solution onto a glass pane using an elcometer 4340 motorized film applicator elcometer ltd u k finally the casted film was allowed to evaporate for 30 s before immersed into a coagulation bath deionized water at room temperature to obtain the membranes the resulting modified membranes with 0 0 5 1 and 1 5 wt cds mil 101 addition were denoted as c0 control c1 c2 and c3 respectively 2 3 photocatalysts and membranes

sem is available in si text s3 pure water permeability tests of membranes were conducted in a dead end filtration cell sinap china and the detailed method is presented in si text s4 reactive oxidizing species oh and o2 from membranes were quantitatively detected at low do concentration 0 1 mg l and at ph 7 8 for mimicking the environment of the anammox mbr and the procedure is presented in si text s5 2 4 antibacterial behavior tests against model bacteria a gram positive staphylococcus aureus s aureus and a gram negative escherichia coli e coli were used as model bacteria for antibacterial tests of the membranes viable cell attachment and inactivation experiments with a plate counting method were carried out with or without visible light irradiation liu et al 2017 diffusion inhibition zone diz tests were performed following a modified clsi m07 a9 method chen et al 2003 detailed experiments procedures are documented in si text s6 2 5 antifouling behavior measurements against model foulants bsa ha and sodium alginate sa as model foulants for proteins humic substances and polysaccharides in wastewater respectively were used in the membrane filtration tests and the tests methods are presented in si text s7 the relative flux of membrane foulants was determined as j j0 j and j0 represent the membrane flux at a single moment and the initial flux respectively and the membrane rejection rate r of foulants can be calculated by eq 1 each reported value was expressed by averaging three measurements 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where c p mg l is the foulant concentration in the permeate and c f mg l is the foulant concentration in the feed 2 6 in situ anti biofouling experiments in anammox mbrs the long term anti biofouling behaviors of the cds mil 101 modified membrane c2 and the pristine membrane c0 were compared in two parallel anammox mbrs with the same operational parameters more information of reactors operation can be found in si text s8 and the ingredient of the synthesized influent is shown in table s1 the trans membrane pressure tmp was recorded daily by a pressure gauge when the tmp reached 35 kpa the filtration time was determined as a filtration cycle after which the fouled membrane was withdrawn cleaned with a brush and flushed with pure water to remove the foulants on the membrane for confocal laser scanning microscope clsm olympus fv 3000 japan observation 1 cm2 of membrane sample was cut from the fouled membranes after a specific filtration cycle stained with live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes inc and concavalin a con a molecular probes inc to respectively label viable dead cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps polysaccharide won et al 2012 the deposited foulants on membranes was also determined by quantifying the total solids and volatile solids in accordance with standard methods apha 2006 the total amount of bacteria on the fouled membranes was analyzed by qpcr measurements by evaluating the absolute abundance of 16s rrna genes the primers for amplification of 16s rrna genes were 1369f 5 cggtgaatacgttcycgg 3 and 1492r 5 ggwtaccttgttacgact 3 in addition eps contents and components in biofilm on the fouled membranes were analyzed and the methods are documented in si text s9 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological physicochemical and optical characterization of photocatalysts the morphologies of the prepared photocatalysts were analyzed using tem characterization fig 1 a and b show that the equally distributed mil 101 particles display octahedral nanocrystals with the size of 200 500 nm and their surfaces become rough by cds decoration the hrtem image reveals a lattice spacing of 0 336 nm corresponding to the 002 crystallographic planes of cubic cds fig 1c proving the successful formation of cds mil 101 heterojunction structure by which the charge transport between cds and mil 101 and the photocatalytic capacity of the hybrid cds mil 101 may be promoted the crystallographic structure of the photocatalysts was examined by xrd fig 1d and the pattern of cds mil 101 clearly shows the main characteristic peaks of both cds and mil 101 confirming the successful preparation of cds mil 101 hybrid and the crystallographic integrity of mil 101 after cds deposition the ftir spectra shown in fig 1e were utilized to characterize the functional groups on the photocatalysts for cds mil 101 the large band around 3500 cm 1 confirms the hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite ferey et al 2005 moreover no obvious spectra difference of mil 101 and cds mil 101 is observed and all the bands demonstrate the dominance of the properties of mil 101 in the hybrid cds mil 101 the composition and valence state of cds mil 101 were confirmed by xps as shown in the survey spectra fig 1f cd and s elements from cds and cr o n and c elements from mil 101 can all be observed in the spectrum of cds mil 101 demonstrating that the elemental composition of cds mil 101 is in good agreement with the target composition the binding energy of cd 3d and s 2p in the hybrid is slightly increased compared with that of the pure cds fig s1a and b which may be due to the possible interfacial interaction and electron transfer between cds and mil 101 jiang et al 2018 the peak at 532 3 ev for o 1s spectrum of cds mil 101 is ascribed from surface molecular water fig s1e by which the hydrophilicity of cds mil 101 is further testified ahmed et al 2015 detailed peaks analysis of xrd diffraction ftir and xps of the photocatalysts is shown in si text s10 the optical properties of the photocatalysts were determined by uv vis drs and pl emission spectra as shown in fig 1g the spectrum of cd mil 101 shows a combination of the spectral features of pure cds and mil 101 and exhibits a broad absorption in the visible light region illustrating the enhanced visible light utilization capacity of cd mil 101 by calculation of the band gap eg with the formula in fig 1h butler 1977 dai et al 2014 the eg of cds mil 101 2 19 ev is lower than that of cds and mil 101 2 28 and 2 40 ev respectively indicating that the heterojunction between cds and mil 101 effectively narrowed the band gap of the hybrid which is helpful for the generation of photodegradation carriers and the promotion of visible light photocatalytic reactions the pl spectra can be regarded as a direct approach to understand the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers on the photocatalysts qiu et al 2017 as shown in fig 1i the fluorescence peak intensity of cds mil 101 is remarkably lower than that of pure mil 101 indicating the efficient inhibition of photogenerated electron hole pairs recombination by the formation of cds mil 101 heterojunction more optical analysis about the photocatalysts could be found in si text s11 in a word cds mil 101 was prepared successfully and excellent photocatalytic property of the cds mil 101 in visible light region was obtained in our tests 3 2 properties characterization of the cds mil 101 modified membranes the synthesized membranes were characterized in terms of zeta potential pore size contact angle water permeability sem and reactive species tests fig 2 fig 2a shows that all pvdf membranes display a negative surface charge which increased evidently with the increasing of cds mil 101 addition dosage 0 1 5 wt for c0 c3 because of the blending of higher charged cds 2 01 mv ayodhya and veerabhadram 2017 and positively charged mil 101 liu et al 2015 confirming the successful immobilization and the dominance of cds mil 101 on the modified membranes the average pore sizes of c1 and c2 are not significantly p 0 05 decreased compared with that of c0 fig 2b while it decreased significantly p 0 05 for c3 which might be attributed to the deposition of excessive cds mil 101 nanoparticles 1 5 wt in the casting solution the hydrophilicity plays an important role in determining anti adhesion ability of ultrafiltration membranes mansouri et al 2010 as shown in fig 2c the water contact angle of the membranes reduces continuously with increasing the modification dosage 0 1 5 wt of cds mil 101 for c0 c3 as characterized by ftir fig 1e and xps fig s1 the improved hydrophilicity can be ascribed to the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on cds mil 101 nanoparticles which may form an ultrathin water layer on the membrane surface via intermolecular hydrogen bonding xu et al 2019 in addition the water permeability of c2 is 21 9 higher than that of c0 fig 2d probably because of its significantly enhanced p 0 05 hydrophilicity safarpour et al 2015 the decreased water permeability of c3 may be ascribed to its evidently decreased pore size p 0 05 by excessive cds mil 101 addition compared with c0 xu et al 2016 in summary the modification of cds mil 101 with 1 0 wt dosage endowed the pristine pvdf membrane enhanced hydrophilicity and permeability and c2 was further investigated in the anti biofouling experiments as the optimal modified membrane as shown in fig 2e the morphologies of membranes c2 and c0 were characterized by sem it is observed that abundant of cds mil 101 nanoparticles which can provide favorable hydrophilicity fig 2d and photocatalytic ability fig 1g and i are evenly distributed on c2 reactive oxidizing radicals of o2 and oh generated on c2 were quantitatively analyzed by chemical probe transformation as shown in fig 2f an obviously higher concentration of oh than o2 was produced on c2 under visible light irradiation illustrating that oh was the main oxidizing species in the aquatic environment with low do concentration 0 1 mg l and the generated oh may play important role in foulants oxidation and bacteria inactivation in addition nearly no concentration variations of radical species are observed in dark suggesting that the radical species were only generated under visible light irradiation from cds mil 101 nanoparticles on c2 3 3 antimicrobial activity of the modified membrane against model bacteria to evaluate the antimicrobial property of c2 viable bacteria attachment and inactivation tests for model bacteria were conducted and the results are shown in fig 3 a in dark nearly no e coli and s aureus was inactivated by c2 demonstrating that c2 was biocompatible in dark and no much toxic ions such as cd2 s2 cr3 or cr6 was dissolved under visible light irradiation the inactivation rate of c2 against e coli and s aureus reaches 93 and 89 respectively implying an excellent antimicrobial ability of c2 this was mainly attributed to the photocatalysis sterilization effect of reactive species such as oh from cds mil 101 fig 2f on c2 fig 2e under visible light irradiation in addition no inactivation effect for c0 was observed under light irradiation suggesting that the sterilization of sole visible light was ignorable according to the cells morphologies of the bacteria attached on membranes characterized by sem fig 3b e the cellular morphologies of e coli and s aureus on c0 are intact while that on c2 exhibit losses in cell integrity which could be interpreted that the active species generated on c2 under visible light irradiation fig 2f induced damage to the cells membrane and resulted in the release of cellular contents and ultimate death of the bacteria ding et al 2014 xia et al 2017 as shown in fig 3f i the favorable antibacterial capacity of c2 under visible light irradiation was further demonstrated by the diz tests that c2 shows obvious inhibition zones against e coli fig 3g and s aureus fig 3i compared with c0 in contrast areas around c0 and c2 are completely covered by the bacteria colonies in dark fig 3f and h proving the nontoxicity and biocompatibility of c2 without light irradiation once more in addition no apparent inhibition zone is observed around c0 for both e coli and s aureus in spite of visible light irradiation further illustrating that the bacteria are difficult to be inactivated with sole visible light photolysis 3 4 antifouling activity of the modified membrane against model foulants the normalized water flux variations of c2 and c0 during the filtration of model foulants bsa ha and sa solutions with or without visible light irradiation are shown in fig 4 under visible light irradiation the development of foulants layer on the membrane resulted in a water flux decline of 17 8 68 and 16 1 for c2 by light irradiation compared with that of 39 2 100 and 36 for c0 during 40 min filtration of bsa ha and sa respectively indicating evident antifouling property of c2 with light irradiation the adhered foulants were speculated to be degraded by the reactive species such as oh generated on c2 fig 2f leading to the alleviation of membrane pores blocking and the retard of flux decline when without light irradiation a slightly lower flux decline ratio of c2 than c0 for all foulants can be observed in fig 4 suggesting the intrinsic superior antifouling ability of c2 which was related to its better water permeability and hydrophilicity than c0 fig 2c and d zhu et al 2014 in addition the similar flux decline trends of c0 at both light irradiation and dark conditions for all foulants indicate that the sole photolysis of foulants by visible light was negligible the foulants rejection properties of c0 and c2 in the filtration tests were evaluated table s2 without visible light irradiation the rejection rates of bsa ha and sa for c2 are significantly higher than that for c0 p 0 05 demonstrating an improvement in the ultrafiltration performance of c2 the better rejection rates of c2 can be explained by the combination of its slightly smaller pore size fig 2b and the enhanced hydrophilicity fig 2d based on the principle of interfacial hydration layer as protective barrier xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 specifically the foulants rejection rates for c2 under visible light irradiation are further enhanced compared with that in dark table s2 suggesting that a part of foulants on c2 were degraded by photocatalysis resulting in the alleviation of membrane pores blocking and decreased foulants concentrations in the permeate the degraded parts of foulants were considered as the difference values of the rejection rates of c2 at conditions of light irradiation and dark i e 4 43 3 59 and 6 79 for bsa ha and sa respectively 3 5 in situ anti biofouling performance of the modified membrane in mbr membranes c2 and c0 were respectively operated in two identical mbrs for anammox process according to the schematic plots of the reactors shown in fig 5 a four waterproof led lights were anchored adjacent to membrane to largely avoid the negative effect of the visible light on microorganisms a non transparent plastic cloth was wrapped on the membrane module and covered on the led lights not shown in fig 5a during 51 d operation fig 5b the filtration cycles of c2 25 26 d are evidently longer than that of c0 10 14 d and only one time cleaning was carried out for c2 compared with three times for c0 in accordance with the decreased flux decline of c2 in fig 4 indicating a significantly alleviated membrane fouling on c2 the extended filtration cycles of c2 could effectively reduce the energy consumption for filtration suction and the labor cost for membranes cleaning moreover the tmp profile of c2 exhibits a slow increase in the initial stage about 15 days followed by a rapid rise it can be speculated that the deposited foulants were degraded fig 4 and the attached bacteria were inactivated fig 3 on c2 easily in the initial stage maintaining a high water flux of c2 but the photocatalytic effect was gradually weakened due to the light shielding by the increasing biofoulants leading to the rapid increase of tmp in addition the nitrogen removal performance of the two reactors were comparable fig s2 and the mean total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre reached 0 87 0 06 and 0 84 0 06 for mbr with c0 and mbr with c2 respectively fig 5b suggesting that the anti biofouling process of c2 with visible light brought no negative influences on the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox mbr noteworthily a dramatic tnre drop after each time cleaning and a slow tnre recovery for both two reactors are observed which was probably due to the disturbance of membranes cleaning procedures therefore the reduced membrane cleaning times for c2 were beneficial not only for saving of operational cost but also for the maintaining of high nitrogen removal performance of anammox mbrs after a filtration cycle the foulants on c2 and c0 were analyzed for total solids volatile solids eps components and total bacteria amount as shown in table 1 the total solids on c2 are comparable to that on c0 while the volatile solids percentage of c2 44 3 is significantly lower than that of c0 82 6 p 0 05 besides the total eps content on c2 9 5 10 3 mg cm2 is significantly lower than that on c0 17 7 10 3 mg cm2 p 0 05 the organic foulants including eps on c2 were probably degraded by the active species such as oh generated by c2 with visible light irradiation fig 2f the protein proportion in eps on c2 62 1 is obviously lower than that on c0 79 1 while the polysaccharides 30 5 and humic substances 7 4 proportions in eps on c2 are higher than that 17 5 for polysaccharides and 3 4 for humic substances on c0 this is possibly because protein in eps is more prone to be degraded by visible light photocatalysis than polysaccharides and humic substances due to the lower molecular weight of protein lee and kim 2013 the lower volatile solids percentage of c2 than c0 could be speculated that the big molecular biofoulants were degraded into small molecular intermediate products which were easily dissolved in the feed water or penetrated with the permeate water in addition a significantly lower p 0 05 total bacteria amount on c2 6 63 108 than c0 2 24 109 was revealed by qpcr measurements further confirming the excellent sterilization and anti adhesion properties against bacteria for c2 by photocatalysis taken together c2 exhibited favorable antibacterial and antifouling capabilities in practical anammox mbr in consistent with the results of antibacterial experiments against model bacteria fig 3 and antifouling experiments against model foulants fig 4 respectively biofilm on the fouled membranes was visualized with clsm and the images are shown in fig 6 clearly c0 is mainly covered with live microbial cells green in fig 6a and b while c2 is mainly covered with dead bacteria red in fig 6e and f moreover the eps is observed uniformly distributing on c0 gray in fig 6c and its volume is obviously higher than that on c2 fig 6g illustrating that the photocatalytic capacity of c2 effectively killed the attached bacteria and degraded the deposited organic foulants according to the 3d structure images of c2 fig 6h and c0 fig 6d c2 is covered with a rough dead cells layer red decorated with few live bacteria green in gaps further testifying that the photocatalysis effect of c2 brought about evident inhibition on the biofilm development causing retarded tmp increase rates and extended filtration cycles in the anammox mbr operation process fig 5b 3 6 antimicrobial and antifouling mechanisms of the cds mil 101 modified membrane the excellent anti biofouling effect of c2 was attributed to the enhanced photocatalytic property of cds mil 101 heterojunction mounted on the membrane as illustrated in fig 7 the irradiated visible light is mainly absorbed by cds and partly by the photosensitizer unit of mil 101 meng et al 2019 due to the appropriate band structures cds can be excited to generate electrons e in the conduction band cb and leave holes h in the valence band vb since the cb edge of mil 101 1 91 ev is more negative than that of cds 0 52 ev e can be transferred from the cb of mil 101 to that of cds therefore mil 101 not only serves as a support but also acts as a conducting medium to transfer the photoinduced electrons delay the recombination of electron hole pairs and prevent the photocorrosion of cds moreover the large specific surface area of mil 101 provides more adsorption sites and reaction centers further improving the visible light photocatalytic capacity of cds mil 101 it is widely known that the photocatalytic degradation process takes place via the oxidation or reduction of organic molecules with photogenerated h e and reactive oxidizing species such as o2 and oh which are produced by photocatalytic reduction of do by e and oxidation of water by h bai et al 2013 xu et al 2015 yan et al 2009 however due to the low concentration of do 0 01 mg l in the anammox mbr o2 was difficult to be generated and oh was prone to be generated as the main oxidizing species by the reaction of h and oh because of the slightly alkaline environment ph 7 5 8 5 in the anammox mbr fig 2f it was also reported that the degradation efficiency of organic pollutant ofloxacin for photocatalyst tio2 nanotube was almost the same in presence or absence of do while e replaced o2 as the leading reactive species chen et al 2020 consequently oh e and h were considered as main reactive species and could be responsible for photocatalytic foulants decomposition and bacteria disinfection on c2 in the anammox mbr ding et al 2014 xia et al 2017 the major reaction steps in the photocatalytic anti biofouling process by c2 are summarized as follows 2 c d s m i l 101 h v c d s e c b m i l 101 h v b 3 h h 2 o o h h 4 h o h o h 5 h e oh foulants degradation products in addition the oxidizing or reducing effect of the generated reactive species oh e and h on the intrinsic pvdf membrane and the reactor material in the repetitive usage was not observed which was probably due to the high stability of the polymeric materials 3 7 implications in the field of mbr membrane fouling control currently contact killing and release killing are considered as two main antimicrobial strategies for mbr membrane modification zhang et al 2016b contact killing strategy inhibits the bacteria proliferation by directly contacting the bacteria with the modified membrane while its antibacterial activity is always restricted by the formation of fouling layer on the membrane seon et al 2015 release killing strategy realizes sterilization by releasing bactericides while the continuous release of biocides not only results in limited working period of the antibacterial membrane but also probably raises perceived health and safety concerns bai et al 2015 for example although ag is one of the most extensively studied antimicrobial agents in membrane research remanan et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a a significant loss of ag was found in the antibacterial process of ag modified membranes when permeated with water and their antibacterial activity only maintained for several days huang et al 2016 son et al 2004 moreover the released ag may affect the effluent quality and bring negative influence to the functional bacteria in mbr wang et al 2016a in comparison the anti biofouling strategy based on visible light photocatalysis developed in this study avoids the disadvantages of both contact killing and release killing strategies specifically the generation and release of reactive species from the photocatalytic membrane is not limited to the direct contact between the biofoulants and the membrane the generated radical species are theoretically renewable with continuous visible light irradiation and bring no environmental risk due to their short lifetimes lacombe and pigot 2016 the energy consumption in the application of the photocatalytic membranes was mainly the electric consumption by the led lights which is calculated to be only 18 36 kw h per cycle 25 5 d in the operation of anammox mbr in the current study we not only develop a new anti biofouling membrane for mbr operation but also propose an eco friendly and cost effective way to realize simultaneous bacteria inactivation and foulants degradation with renewable and environmentally friendly energy and prove the feasibility of this way in practical anammox mbr future investigations should focus on exploring the photocatalysts with more effective photocatalytic activity and the photocatalytic membranes with more reasonable modification dosages the in situ light illumination technologies in the mbrs may be further optimized to provide more efficient and energy saving irradiation methods 4 conclusions visible light photocatalyst of cds mil 101 was successfully fabricated and blended into pvdf membrane to prepare a photocatalytic membrane for in situ anti biofouling application in an anammox mbr by physicochemical characterization the synthesized cds mil 101 showed superior visible light photocatalytic ability and the 1 wt cds mil 101 modified membrane c2 showed enhanced hydrophilicity and water permeability compared with the pristine pvdf membrane c0 in the antimicrobial tests against model bacteria the modified membrane c2 exhibited significant antimicrobial capability with visible light irradiation against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria by destruction of cell integrity antifouling tests against model organic foulants bsa sa and ha indicated that the membrane c2 had higher antifouling property lower flux declining rate and higher foulants rejection rates under the irradiation of visible light compared with c0 in situ anti biofouling performance of the modified membrane was investigated by applying c2 membrane in an anammox mbr under in situ irradiation of waterproof lights in comparison with c0 in a parallel mbr the tmp increase was retarded and the membrane fouling was alleviated in long term operation of anammox process with c2 membrane while the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor was not affected moreover the deposited organic foulants including eps were degraded obviously and the attached bacteria were inactivated significantly on c2 which were proved by further characterization of clsm the antifouling and antibacterial mechanism of c2 was speculated to be the generation of reactive species e g oh e and h from the cds mil 101 nanoparticles in the membrane by visible light irradiation the results of this work provide a novel application of visible light photocatalytic technology in mbr biofouling control holding a great potential for realizing in situ mbr membrane biofouling control with eco friendly solar energy

engineering the ohio state university columbus oh 43210 united states corresponding author aerobic granular sludge ags has been proven to have a low fouling potential in membrane bioreactor mbr nevertheless ags scouring effect on mitigating membrane fouling remains poorly investigated the main objective of this study is to examine ags mbr performance to reveal the ags scouring mechanism and quantify its contribution rate to membrane fouling mitigation from the views of theory and experiment above all ags mbr exhibited a low fouling rate transmembrane pressure tmp kept below 20 kpa without membrane cleaning and a higher removal of organics and nutrients than conventional mbr during 80 days sludge granulation process then flocculent sludge fs with various ags ratios was applied to simulate the sludge granulation phase when ags ratio increased from 0 to 100 the permeate flux gradually elevated from 40 0 l m 2 h 1 to 92 9 l m 2 h 1 and fouling resistance decreased from 9 0 10 12 m 1 to 3 9 10 12 m 1 benefiting from the loose structure and high porosity of ags fouling layer meanwhile the scouring effect produced by ags on the membrane fouling mitigation was investigated based on the momentum conservation a new hydrodynamic model was developed to explain the scouring mechanism of ags the scouring stress proportional to the total amount of ags depositing on the membrane surface effectively reinforced the collision between ags and fs and reduced their deposition on the membrane surface by friction with the membrane thus it was further conducive to membrane fouling mitigation moreover a novel contribution quantification model was proposed for analyzing the contribution rate of ags scouring effect to mitigate membrane fouling ags scouring possessed a significant contribution rate 39 9 for fouling mitigation compared with ags structure 50 3 and hydraulic stress 9 7 in final this study provides an in depth understanding to mitigate the mbr membrane fouling by the unique advantages of sludge granulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aerobic granular sludge ags ags scouring membrane bioreactor mbr membrane fouling mitigation organics and nitrogen wastewater biological treatment 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr consisting of membrane module and bioreactor has been widely applied for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment on account of high pollutant removal efficiency better effluent quality low sludge production rate and small footprint menachem and phillip 2011 meng et al 2009 but as an inevitable problem the severe membrane fouling which restrains filtration efficiency and enhances operational cost undermining its further application zhang and jiang 2019 to mitigate membrane fouling various fouling mitigation strategies including membrane modification module optimization and sludge property modification are put forward subsequently zhang et al 2015a meng et al 2017 membrane modification could effectively control the deposition and binding of foulants onto the membrane by adding functional groups on the membrane surface zhao et al 2013 however most modification methods exhibited shortcomings such as a short effect time easy deactivation and high operational cost bai et al 2015 for module optimization shear stress on the membrane surface can be enhanced by optimizing hydraulic conditions of the membrane module jaffrin 2008 although high shear stress was in favor of membrane fouling mitigation this method resulted in high energy consumption and could not reduce the soluble membrane foulants zamani et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b in mbr the sludge makes a direct interaction with the membrane while its properties significantly affect membrane fouling microparticles and soluble macromolecules in sludge constitute the main membrane foulant ng and kim 2007 meng et al 2017 sludge property modification is a membrane fouling mitigation strategy at the source yeon et al yeon et al 2009 kyung min et al 2009 found that quorum quenching qq could interfere with bacterial quorum sensing system to prevent its gene expression then effectively inhibited the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps ultimately reducing the formation of biofilms and biofouling on the membrane surface but qq mbr was susceptible to a multitude of factors such as bacterial resistance fluid dynamics salinity toxic substances and temperature shocks the addition of powdered activated carbon pac was another approach to modify sludge properties pac could provide media for bacteria attachment and subsequent growth as well as the opportunity to absorb recalcitrant pollutants in mbrs which effectively decreased the permeate flux loss from 27 up to 16 iorhemen et al 2017 however being exposed to poorly biodegradable organics at a certain amount of pac dosage leads to microbial reinforcing cell autolysis and eps production besides pac also elevated operation cost and backwashing difficulty given the large granular size and porous structure of aerobic granular sludge ags sludge granulation turns out to be an alternative mbr fouling mitigation strategy compared with conventional flocculent sludge fs ags is expected to diminish pore blocking surface deposition and cake layer formation on the membrane surface iorhemen et al 2019 in addition during the sludge granulation process a massive eps was immobilized into ags while was degraded by anaerobic bacteria in the granules yu et al 2009 juang et al 2010 tay et al 2007 documented that the permeability decline and transmembrane pressure tmp elevation caused by ags could be ignored while its membrane flux was 2 6 times higher than that of conventional mbr in contrast to other methods for sludge property modification the sludge granulation demonstrates a better fouling mitigation efficacy a more straightforward process and lower operation cost some investigations consider that the granular structure of ags can raise the porosity of the membrane fouling layer and improve permeability vijayalayan et al 2014 iorhemen et al 2017 in theory as a kind of particulate matter for membrane filtration granular sludge is not only conducive to the permeability of membrane fouling layer but also may provide the scouring force on the membrane surface via its stable granular structure adav et al 2008 ni and yu 2010 during the shear filtration process the granular materials can form a positive scouring force by collision and friction with the membrane surface which exerts a significant impact on the membrane fouling mitigation wang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 based on the literature and observation the ags scouring effect granular structure and hydraulic shear are responsible for mitigating membrane fouling in ags mbr however this finding cannot be mechanistically explained and even the role of ags scouring effect is not clear yet to elucidate the mechanism of ags scouring several issues need to be resolved 1 how is the ags mbr performance can ags scouring effectively mitigate membrane fouling 2 is there a mathematical model to explain ags scour mechanism and 3 how to quantify its contribution rate is it an essential factor for membrane fouling mitigation to address these unknowns from the views of theory and experiment the present work is thus to investigate the ags mbr performance to reveal ags scouring mechanism and to evaluate its contribution to membrane fouling mitigation the main study contents comprise of 1 to clarify the filtration performance and fouling mechanism of ags mbr 2 to put forward a hydrodynamic model for revealing the ags scouring mechanism and 3 to propose a new measuring method to quantify the contribution rate of ags scouring effect and evaluate its significance for membrane fouling mitigation this work is expected to provide a possible alternative to face up to the challenges of mbr fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 ags mbr test a plexiglass columnar reactor with an effective working volume of 10 8 l was adopted for ags mbr test air bubble was supplied by an air diffuser as3 pentair at the bottom of the reactor under a constant flux of 8 2 l m2 h the flat sheet membrane module shown in table 1 was set to operate with intervals of 8 min permeation and 2 min relaxation using a peristaltic pump the reactor was operated at room temperature 25 2 when the tmp reached 20 kpa the reactor operation was stopped and the membrane were removed for characterization and analysis of the membrane resistance the synthetic wastewater used in this study mainly comprised of glucose ammonia and phosphate as well as micronutrients and alkalinity the detailed components are shown in table s1 2 2 sludge filtration test the ags with compact spherical structure and stable morphology was generated by ags mbr the sludge filtration tests were conducted by a filtration cell which could adjust the operation conditions hydraulic shear stress transmembrane pressure tmp and membrane type quickly aims to study the filtration performance and fouling mechanism during the sludge granulation process in the filtration cell the membrane was installed at the bottom the agitator generates various hydraulic shear stresses with different agitation speeds tmp maximal value 0 5 mpa was produced by injecting high pressure nitrogen gas the permeate flux was calculated by an electronic scale measuring the weight of permeate solution the properties of membrane utilized in this work are summarized in table 1 the sludge with various ags ratios 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 were used to simulate the sludge granulation process of ags mbr for sludge filtration tests the detailed filtration test process was depicted in the previous study zhang and jiang 2019 chen et al 2019 in this work the dynamic and static filtration tests were performed respectively 2 2 1 dynamic and static filtration tests dynamic and static filtration tests were adopted to inspect the membrane fouling mitigation with various ags ratios in the dynamic and static filtration tests 0 9 pa and mv020 were chosen for tmp and membrane respectively for the dynamic filtration test the hydraulic shear stress was 0 9 pa with a stirring operation while sludge presented a dynamic and suspension state on the membrane surface thus the filtration resistance was determined by hydraulic shear and ags scouring in the static filtration test the hydraulic shear stress was 0 pa without a stirring operation and sludge was at a static and deposition state on the membrane surface thereby the filtration resistance was just controlled by sludge ags fs structure 2 3 analytical items ags with various sizes was classified by the sieving method xuan et al 2010 the 500 ml of ags solution was sampled from ags mbr and screened by a series of standard sieves the sludge larger than 0 2 mm was regarded as ags and the other sludge d 0 2 mm was defined as fs ags ratio was measured by the sieving method xuan et al 2010 size distribution was determined by standard sieve with 0 2 3 mm pore size the ags between the two pore sizes is m1 m2 ms and the total ags weight is m0 m0 m1 m2 ms as well the size distribution in each range is tn mn m0 n 1 2 3 n ags ratio is the ratio of the sum of ags larger than 0 2 mm m2 m3 ms to m0 ags ratio m2 m3 ms m0 lv et al 2013 the sludges with various ags ratios 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 were performed to simulate the sludge granulation process afterwards these agss were applied for sludge filtration tests membrane characterization for the membranes before and after the test the membrane micromorphology was characterized via sem sn 3400 hitachi ltd japan and afm xe 100 park system korea water quality test tests were conducted according to standard methods and the main water quality analysis items included the cod nh3 n tn and tp as an indicator of mbr membrane fouling the tmp was measured using a vacuum gage which was installed on the effluent water permeate line 2 4 calculated parameters according to darcy s law the permeate flux can be calculated by a resistance in series model luo et al 2014 di bella et al 2019 1 j tmp μ r m r c r f where tmp is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the solvent viscosity pa s rm is the intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 rc is the concentration polarization resistance m 1 and rf is the fouling layer resistance m 1 in resistance in series model the intrinsic membrane concentration polarization layer and fouling layer resistances were determined as follows 1 the intrinsic membrane resistance was obtained from the water permeability of the new membrane before the test 2 the sum of intrinsic membrane and fouling layer resistance were calculated from the water permeability of the fouled membrane after the test 3 the sum of intrinsic membrane concentration polarization and fouling layer resistances were acquired from the permeate flux during tests thereby the concentration polarization and fouling layer resistances can be calculated by eq 1 an advanced in series resistance model corsino et al 2016 di bella et al 2018 was applied to calculate the filtration resistances of pore blocking a well as irreversible and reversible cake layer for the continuous ags mbr operation static and dynamic tests the detail equations were displayed in text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of ags mbr the ags mbr was operated more than 80 days for sludge granulation and ags ratio reached a stable maximum 90 after 50 days the average organics and nutrients removal efficiencies of ags mbr at the steady state 50 80 days were higher than those of conventional mbr shown in fig 1 a the cod removal rate for ags mbr exceeded 90 since ags has a stronger adsorption and conversion capacity for organic substrates on account of the high biomass concentration and diverse microbial community for nh3 n tn and tp conversion removal ags mbr also demonstrated better removal efficiencies under aerobic condition the oxygen transfer resistance of ags results in a layered structure aerobic anoxic and anaerobic providing an environment for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification as well as phospherous removal fig 1 b depicts the granulation period step by step with higher and higher ags ratio which stabilized at about 90 during sludge granulation in ags mbr the average ags size enlarged from 0 18 to 0 59 mm notably tmp showed a tendency of gradual increment and then reached 20 kpa after 80 days operation thus both higher ags ratio and larger ags size were conducive to membrane fouling mitigation in mbr compared with the conventional mbrs this fouling rate is highly low demonstrating that ags has a much smaller fouling potential than that of fs nevertheless the underlying mechanism for the antifouling of ags mbr remains unclear due to the long cycle of biological experiments and the limitation of mbr operation it is difficult to explain it via the conventional mbr in the subsequent work the sludge filtration tests were conducted to solve this difficulty 3 2 filtration performance during sludge granulation 3 2 1 flux behavior the permeate fluxes and total fouling resistances of the sludge with various ags ratios at dynamic and static filtrations are illustrated in fig 2 in the sludge filtration test when the ags ratio increased from 0 all sludge is fs to 100 all sludge is ags the permeate flux and fouling resistance gradually elevated and diminished respectively compared with fs the fluxes 36 0 l m 2 h 1 for static filtration and 40 0 l m 2 h 1 for dynamic filtration of ags were twice as higher and the resistances 9 96 10 12 m 1 for static filtration and 8 99 10 12 m 1 for dynamic filtration of ags were half as lower besides the dynamic filtration demonstrated the higher flux and smaller fouling than static filtration due to the dual effect of hydraulic shear and ags scouring during the membrane filtration process the concentration polarization and fouling layer on the membrane surface determine the total fouling resistance whereas the hydraulic shear and sludge structure are able to effectively affect the concentration polarization and fouling layer respectively thus membrane fouling mitigated by ags can be explained by hydraulic shear ags structure and ags scouring 3 2 1 1 hydraulic shear the deposition behavior and the attractive force between sludge and membrane are decided by the hydrodynamic drag shear induced transport force and foulant membrane interaction they acting together on sludge foulants control the gap between sludge ags or fs and membrane and deposition position on the membrane surface luo et al 2013 if shear force is greater than the penetration driving force between foulants and membrane ags or fs moves along on the membrane surface as shown in fig 3 there is a linear correlation between shear flow velocity and sludge particle diameter ags on the millimeter scale whereas the fs is much less than micrometer scale at least one in ten thus shear flow velocity of ags is orders of magnitude larger than shear flow velocity of fs more than tenfold ni and yu 2010 thereby ags has a much greater shear induced transport force relative to fs this high shear induced transport force is capable of outstripping hydrodynamic drag and foulant membrane interaction luo et al 2013 lessening ags deposition on the membrane surface accordingly ags presents much lower membrane fouling than fs furthermore under high hydraulic shear stress in contrast to fs some deposited agss are easier to return to concentration polarization on the other hand agss with greater size and smaller number are more dispersed than fs leading to lower concentration polarization resistance therefore with high hydraulic shear generated by dynamic filtration ags owns a better antifouling capacity than fs 3 2 1 2 ags structure compared with ags fs exhibits a more serious pore blocking because of the smaller size gap between fs and membrane pores zhang and jiang 2019 as for ags its size ags diameter exceeds 0 2 mm is much larger than membrane pore even for mf with large size 0 2 mm and cannot enter membrane pores indeed fs with small size is easy to form a compact fouling layer on the membrane surface especially at high filtration pressure or high filtration velocity the structure of fs fouling layer becomes denser and less permeable on the contrary the fouling layer of ags with large size and stable shape shows a loose structure and great porosity zhang and jiang 2019 indicating a high permeability moreover eps and soluble microbial products smp as main foulants adhere to the compact fs fouling layer meng et al 2017 enhancing the dense degree of the cake layer and pore blocking in contrast during ags formation process partial eps and smp are immobilized into ags and are degraded by anaerobe in the granules yu et al 2009 abating their composition in fouling layer and membrane pores thus its cake layer and pore blocking are smaller in the end during the sludge granulation process ags owns much less number and lower viscosity than fs at the same sludge concentration nancharaiah and reddy 2018 zhou et al 2015 which lessen the thickness of fouling layer and improve filtration efficiency therefore by comparing the flux and fouling resistance of fs and ags under static filtration it can be proved that the ags structure can greatly abate the membrane fouling 3 2 1 3 ags scouring effect there is an inconspicuous phenomenon in fig 2 the increase of permeate flux and reduction of fouling resistance between dynamic and static tests improved with ags ratios in fact in addition to ags structure and hydraulic shear ags also owns a unique strength ags scouring effect which is produced by ags fluid momentum and is analyzed in sections 3 3 mechanism explanation and 3 4 contribution evaluation as discussed above on account of the synergistic effects of ags scouring effect ags structure and hydraulic shear ags exhibits more advantages at antifouling performance than fs 3 2 2 membrane fouling resistances and membrane charterization table 2 depicts total fouling concentration polarization and fouling layer resistances against various ags ratios at dynamic and static filtrations during the granulation process with ags ratio increased both concentration polarization and fouling layer resistances presented the downward trends besides the proportion of concentration polarization kept elevating and that of fouling layer gradually declined thereby the concentration polarization turned out to be the main fouling resistance of ags filtration and the fouling layer is that of fs filtration in comparison with fs ags with large size suffers bigger shear induced stress zhang and jiang 2019 resulting in more depositing agss back to concentration polarization on the other hand on account of lower shear induced stress caused by smaller size the large attractive drag force pushes fs towards membrane easily thus a more compacted fouling layer and serious pore blocking form lack of the immobilization effect of ags yu et al 2009 more eps and smp in fs enter and block membrane pores aggravating the fouling resistance at last the dynamic filtration produces the greater hydraulic shear stress than the static filtration while more sludge in fouling layer returns to concentration polarization thus fouling layer resistance weakens and concentration polarization enhances in order to elucidate and compare the membrane fouling in ags mbr the advanced in series resistance model corsino et al 2016 was adopted to calculate the filtration resistances of the continuous ags mbr operation in static and dynamic tests as shown in table s2 the continuous ags mbr operation exhibited a higher filtration resistance than the other tests compared with dynamic test the static test also displayed the larger filtration resistances which corresponded to the previous analysis moreover the reversible membrane fouling was lower than the irreversible membrane fouling since less ags deposited and caused cake layer on membrane corsino et al 2016 the micromorphology and roughness of the membrane surface were characterized by sem and afm respectively as depicted in fig 4 compared with the pristine membrane more white spots occurred on the fouled membranes while greater peak and valley appeared on the fouled membranes by fs and ags this indicates that both ags and fs bring about obvious membrane fouling furthermore in contrast with fig 4 c and f fig 4 b exhibits more foulants accumulating on membrane and fig 4 e shows more rugged fouling layer respectively thus the fouled membrane of ags possessed less foulants and lower roughness than that of fs besides the clearer cake layer was obvsered on the fouled membrane of fs fig 4 b thereby cake layer is the main fouling types for fs filtration while fs demonstrates more serious membrane fouling than ags as well as these phenomena are consistent with the previous analysis 3 3 ags scouring mechanism ags mechanical scouring model for membrane fouling mitigation is proposed without considering the biodegradation impact because of its little effect upon the membrane fouling mitigation meng et al 2009 for the sake of fouling control a shear force needs to be implemented for opposing the penetration driving force and helping sludge foulant to escape from the penetration driving force according to the estimation of 10 times particle size adav et al 2008 the volume of ags is 1000 times of fs thus the mass of ags is much greater than that of fs similarly as mentioned in section 3 2 the shear velocity of ags was also much greater than that of fs more than tenfold so compared with ags the fs momentum is much smaller in terms of order of magnitudes and can be neglected because of the momentum produced by hydraulic shear wu et al 2017 ags tangentially moved along the membrane surface providing a scouring effect on the membrane surface then collided with fs in its path thus fs obtained an additional shear flow velocity from the faster moving ags for all foulants if shear flow velocity exceeds than escape velocity of penetration driving force they are ejected from membrane surface luo et al 2013 as studied in section 3 2 because fs exhibited a much more serious membrane fouling if fs obtain an additional shear force membrane fouling may be significantly mitigated furthermore the shear flow velocity was parallel to membrane surface jaffrin 2008 but the trajectory of ags or fs may change in case of colliding with other particles or roughness positions on the membrane surface thus these sludge foulants are detached from the membrane surface at the same time more collision contacts also improve the immobilization of eps and smp into ags besides an additional scouring shear stress on the membrane surface generated by ags scouring effect is considered an effective method to reinforce shear flow velocity wang et al 2017 although both hydraulic shear and ags scouring are able to increase the shear stress on the membrane surface ags scouring may play a majore role on the membrane fouling mitigation therefore to evaluate ags scouring effect quantitatively the scouring stress model is proposed theoretically the ags scouring mechanism is in the light of the momentum transferred p from the ags to fs and the scouring stress created by ags scouring can be derived p is linearly proportional to the total number of agss nags on the membrane surface the scouring area of each ags a on the membrane surface and the shear flow velocity of ags us ags on the membrane surface 2 p a n a g s u s a g s the ags scouring on the membrane surface is illustrated in fig 5 and a can be calculated by 3 a w t u s a g s where w is the effective width of ags which hence is proportional to ags diameter dags and t is the filtration duration us ags is proportional to dags fig 3 combining eqs 2 and 3 provides 4 p d a g s 3 n a g s t where dags 3 is proportional to ags volume while dags 3 nags and the total volume of all agss on the membrane surface are linear relations during long term filtration process ags was subjected to the fluid force from hydraulic shear and friction force from the membrane according to newton s law these two forces are in counter balance on the other hand on the membrane surface the relationship between the scouring force from ags and the friction force from membrane is also counter balance therefore the scouring stress ss pa is proportional to the ags particle momentum eq 4 can be rewritten as follow 5 s s p d a g s 3 n a g s t scouring stress is proportional to the total mass of agss on the membrane surface in addition the concentration polarization is also independent of particle diameter and is only a function of the total mass of particles on the membrane surface wu et al 2017 if ags concentration keeps constant the influence of ags on the membrane fouling is independent of ags diameter consequently for ags mbr the moderate ags mass on the membrane is beneficial to generate scouring stress for fouling mitigation the mbr model can be verified by its actual performance at various operation conditions huang et al 2020 ags scouring model was preliminarily verified by the ags filtration tests with various operation conditions as displayed in figs s1 s3 the greater ags ratio produces the larger flux and lower fouling resistance furthermore ags ratio was positively correlated with the total mass of particles on the membrane surface and the permeate flux and fouling resistance were obviously affected by ags scouring stress thus the total mass of particles on the membrane surface was able to exert a strong effect on ags scouring effect this corresponded to the conclusion of ags scouring model eq 5 the ags scouring stress is only a function of the total mass of particles on the membrane surface 3 4 the contribution quantification model for membrane fouling mitigation most mbr studies focus on the revealing and characterization of micro membrane fouling layer but the comprehensive understanding for contribution rate of various influence factors which mitigate membrane fouling is still lacking to comprehend the contribution rates of ags scouring effect ags structure hydraulic shear to mitigate membrane fouling after sludge granulation based on the changes of fouling resistances for ags and fs at dynamic with hydraulic shear and static without hydraulic shear filtrations a contribution quantification model to mitigate membrane fouling is proposed in this section at first some reasonable assumptions are made 1 hydraulic shear occurs both near and on the membrane surface thus it simultaneously affects the concentration polarization and membrane fouling layer 2 membrane fouling layer structure only affects the membrane fouling layer not the concentration polarization 3 ags scouring effect appears on the membrane surface only affecting the membrane fouling layer resistance moreover as depicted in fig 2 the membrane fouling resistances before fs and after ags sludge granulation under both dynamic and static filtrations were summarized the contribution rate of hydraulic shear chs can be expressed by the reduction rate of fs total fouling resistance under dynamic and static filtrations 6 c h s r t f s s r t f s d r t f s s 100 where rt fs d and rt fs s are the fs total fouling resistance under dynamic and static filtrations respectively the contribution rate of ags structure cfl can be determined by the reduction rate of total fouling resistance for ags and fs under static filtration 7 c f l r t f s s r t a g s s r t f s s 100 where rt ags s is the ags total fouling resistance under static filtration the contribution rate of ags scouring effect cse can be calculated by 100 subtracting chs and cfls 8 c s e 100 c f l c h s fig 6 illustrates that the total fouling resistances clearly declined from 8 99 10 12 m 1 dynamic filtration and 9 96 10 12 m 1 static filtration to 3 88 10 12 m 1 dynamic filtration and 4 95 10 12 m 1 static filtration respectively since membrane fouling can be evidently mitigated after sludge granulation fig 7 shows that the contribution rates of ags scouring effect ags structure and hydraulic shear were 39 9 50 3 and 9 7 respectively the greatest contribution rate was ags structure 50 3 the large size and stable shape of ags adav et al 2008 form a fouling layer with high permeability structure and low resistance at the same time due to the larger size than membrane pore less agss could enter membrane pores bringing about low pore blocking therefore the ags structure is obviously in favor of membrane fouling mitigation the second largest contribution rate was the ags scouring effect 39 9 the additional scouring shear stress formed by ags scouring effect on the membrane surface excessively lessened ags deposition on the membrane surface even rendered the depositing ags rise and back to concentration polarization layer as for fs because of the low shear flow velocity zhang and jiang 2019 it was easy to deposit on the membrane or enter membrane pores nevertheless the ags scouring effect diminished this phenomenon by lessening its penetration driving force thereby reducing cake layer and pore blocking of fs under ags scouring effect both ags and fs obtained larger parallel scouring shear stress and shear flow velocity on the membrane surface then enhancing the collision between each other or with the membrane surface roughness afterwards reducing their accumulation on the membrane surface on the other hand this collision also reinforced the ags immobilization behavior to eps and smp in addition ags scouring effect also generated the local turbulence near the membrane surface in comparison with hydraulic shear because of these synergistic effects ags scouring exhibited a greater fouling mitigation effect overall as a unique advantage of ags the scouring effect provided a tremendous help for fouling mitigation the last one was hydraulic shear 9 7 under which the agss depositing on the membrane surface return to concentration polarization layer and subdue the fouling layer resistance compared with fs ags concentration polarization layer possessed a smaller filtration resistance under hydraulic shear the larger particle size and smaller number of ags adav et al 2008 make it more dispersed improving the permeability and lowing the fouling layer moreover the high dispersion enhances the immobilization of ags to eps and smp although hydraulic shear is recognized as the mainstream membrane fouling mitigation strategie in most membrane filtration processes ng and kim 2007 it contributed less than 10 for fouling mitigation in ags mbr which was much lower than those of ags scouring effect and ags structure this suggests that ags scouring attaches a great importance upon fouling mitigation and sludge granulation may be a better implementation approach 4 application perspective membrane fouling mitigation accounts for the main operating cost of mbr compared with other fouling mitigation strategies the sludge granulation appears three advantages 1 excellent antifouling capacity as displayed in fig 8 ags with large size could form a high permeability cake layer reducing the filtration resistance while ags scouring effect can efficiently diminish the concentration polarization thus ags mbr possesses a low fouling behavior 2 low construction and operational cost sludge granulation is an in situ strengthening strategy for process upgrading without the need of additional investment besides the high permeability and anti fouling capacity of ags mbr reduce its aeration demand and operation energy consumption and 3 great removal of organics and nutrients the layered structure aerobic anoxic and anaerobic of ags and its high density and diverse microbial community effectively strengthen the removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorous therefore via selecting a suitable operation condition the sludge granulation can become a promising membrane fouling mitigation strategy for mbr however there are still many limitations of the application of ags mbr 1 the long term stability of ags the stronger ags scouring may lead to more ags disintegration 2 the reactor structure how to facilitate the scouring effect and maintain the size and shape of ags 3 the operation condition how to ensure the possible alternation feast and famine necessary for the maintenance of complete granulation and reducing the re formation rebound of fs 5 conclusions this study investigated the membrane fouling mitigation by sludge granulation in an ags mbr and revealed the ags scouring mechanism as well as evaluated its contribution rate the following notable observations were made during 80 days operation ags mbr exhibited the obvious advantages in term of removal of organics and nutrients and membrane fouling mitigation than those of conventional mbr during sludge granulation process with ags ratios elevated the permeate flux enhanced and fouling resistance diminished on account of ags scouring effect ags structure and hydraulic shear a novel hydrodynamic model was proposed to describe the ags scouring effect according to the momentum transformed from ags to fs the scouring stress was proportional to the total amount of ags on the membrane surface and greatly intensified the collision between ags and fs for the momentum transfer then reduced their deposition on the membrane by friction with membrane a new contribution quantification model was formulated to analyze the contribution rates of ags scouring effect 39 9 ags structure 50 3 and hydraulic shear 9 7 to mitigate membrane fouling thereby ags scouring played an vital role on fouling mitigation in the end the current study indicates the feasibility and significance of using sludge granulation for

nevertheless ags scouring effect on mitigating membrane fouling remains poorly investigated the main objective of this study is to examine ags mbr performance to reveal the ags scouring mechanism and quantify its contribution rate to membrane fouling mitigation from the views of theory and experiment above all ags mbr exhibited a low fouling rate transmembrane pressure tmp kept below 20 kpa without membrane cleaning and a higher removal of organics and nutrients than conventional mbr during 80 days sludge granulation process then flocculent sludge fs with various ags ratios was applied to simulate the sludge granulation phase when ags ratio increased from 0 to 100 the permeate flux gradually elevated from 40 0 l m 2 h 1 to 92 9 l m 2 h 1 and fouling resistance decreased from 9 0 10 12 m 1 to 3 9 10 12 m 1 benefiting from the loose structure and high porosity of ags fouling layer meanwhile the scouring effect produced by ags on the membrane fouling mitigation was investigated based on the momentum conservation a new hydrodynamic model was developed to explain the scouring mechanism of ags the scouring stress proportional to the total amount of ags depositing on the membrane surface effectively reinforced the collision between ags and fs and reduced their deposition on the membrane surface by friction with the membrane thus it was further conducive to membrane fouling mitigation moreover a novel contribution quantification model was proposed for analyzing the contribution rate of ags scouring effect to mitigate membrane fouling ags scouring possessed a significant contribution rate 39 9 for fouling mitigation compared with ags structure 50 3 and hydraulic stress 9 7 in final this study provides an in depth understanding to mitigate the mbr membrane fouling by the unique advantages of sludge granulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aerobic granular sludge ags ags scouring membrane bioreactor mbr membrane fouling mitigation organics and nitrogen wastewater biological treatment 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr consisting of membrane module and bioreactor has been widely applied for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment on account of high pollutant removal efficiency better effluent quality low sludge production rate and small footprint menachem and phillip 2011 meng et al 2009 but as an inevitable problem the severe membrane fouling which restrains filtration efficiency and enhances operational cost undermining its further application zhang and jiang 2019 to mitigate membrane fouling various fouling mitigation strategies including membrane modification module optimization and sludge property modification are put forward subsequently zhang et al 2015a meng et al 2017 membrane modification could effectively control the deposition and binding of foulants onto the membrane by adding functional groups on the membrane surface zhao et al 2013 however most modification methods exhibited shortcomings such as a short effect time easy deactivation and high operational cost bai et al 2015 for module optimization shear stress on the membrane surface can be enhanced by optimizing hydraulic conditions of the membrane module jaffrin 2008 although high shear stress was in favor of membrane fouling mitigation this method resulted in high energy consumption and could not reduce the soluble membrane foulants zamani et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b in mbr the sludge makes a direct interaction with the membrane while its properties significantly affect membrane fouling microparticles and soluble macromolecules in sludge constitute the main membrane foulant ng and kim 2007 meng et al 2017 sludge property modification is a membrane fouling mitigation strategy at the source yeon et al yeon et al 2009 kyung min et al 2009 found that quorum quenching qq could interfere with bacterial quorum sensing system to prevent its gene expression then effectively inhibited the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps ultimately reducing the formation of biofilms and biofouling on the membrane surface but qq mbr was susceptible to a multitude of factors such as bacterial resistance fluid dynamics salinity toxic substances and temperature shocks the addition of powdered activated carbon pac was another approach to modify sludge properties pac could provide media for bacteria attachment and subsequent growth as well as the opportunity to absorb recalcitrant pollutants in mbrs which effectively decreased the permeate flux loss from 27 up to 16 iorhemen et al 2017 however being exposed to poorly biodegradable organics at a certain amount of pac dosage leads to microbial reinforcing cell autolysis and eps production besides pac also elevated operation cost and backwashing difficulty given the large granular size and porous structure of aerobic granular sludge ags sludge granulation turns out to be an alternative mbr fouling mitigation strategy compared with conventional flocculent sludge fs ags is expected to diminish pore blocking surface deposition and cake layer formation on the membrane surface iorhemen et al 2019 in addition during the sludge granulation process a massive eps was immobilized into ags while was degraded by anaerobic bacteria in the granules yu et al 2009 juang et al 2010 tay et al 2007 documented that the permeability decline and transmembrane pressure tmp elevation caused by ags could be ignored while its membrane flux was 2 6 times higher than that of conventional mbr in contrast to other methods for sludge property modification the sludge granulation demonstrates a better fouling mitigation efficacy a more straightforward process and lower operation cost some investigations consider that the granular structure of ags can raise the porosity of the membrane fouling layer and improve permeability vijayalayan et al 2014 iorhemen et al 2017 in theory as a kind of particulate matter for membrane filtration granular sludge is not only conducive to the permeability of membrane fouling layer but also may provide the scouring force on the membrane surface via its stable granular structure adav et al 2008 ni and yu 2010 during the shear filtration process the granular materials can form a positive scouring force by collision and friction with the membrane surface which exerts a significant impact on the membrane fouling mitigation wang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 based on the literature and observation the ags scouring effect granular structure and hydraulic shear are responsible for mitigating membrane fouling in ags mbr however this finding cannot be mechanistically explained and even the role of ags scouring effect is not clear yet to elucidate the mechanism of ags scouring several issues need to be resolved 1 how is the ags mbr performance can ags scouring effectively mitigate membrane fouling 2 is there a mathematical model to explain ags scour mechanism and 3 how to quantify its contribution rate is it an essential factor for membrane fouling mitigation to address these unknowns from the views of theory and experiment the present work is thus to investigate the ags mbr performance to reveal ags scouring mechanism and to evaluate its contribution to membrane fouling mitigation the main study contents comprise of 1 to clarify the filtration performance and fouling mechanism of ags mbr 2 to put forward a hydrodynamic model for revealing the ags scouring mechanism and 3 to propose a new measuring method to quantify the contribution rate of ags scouring effect and evaluate its significance for membrane fouling mitigation this work is expected to provide a possible alternative to face up to the challenges of mbr fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 ags mbr test a plexiglass columnar reactor with an effective working volume of 10 8 l was adopted for ags mbr test air bubble was supplied by an air diffuser as3 pentair at the bottom of the reactor under a constant flux of 8 2 l m2 h the flat sheet membrane module shown in table 1 was set to operate with intervals of 8 min permeation and 2 min relaxation using a peristaltic pump the reactor was operated at room temperature 25 2 when the tmp reached 20 kpa the reactor operation was stopped and the membrane were removed for characterization and analysis of the membrane resistance the synthetic wastewater used in this study mainly comprised of glucose ammonia and phosphate as well as micronutrients and alkalinity the detailed components are shown in table s1 2 2 sludge filtration test the ags with compact spherical structure and stable morphology was generated by ags mbr the sludge filtration tests were conducted by a filtration cell which could adjust the operation conditions hydraulic shear stress transmembrane pressure tmp and membrane type quickly aims to study the filtration performance and fouling mechanism during the sludge granulation process in the filtration cell the membrane was installed at the bottom the agitator generates various hydraulic shear stresses with different agitation speeds tmp maximal value 0 5 mpa was produced by injecting high pressure nitrogen gas the permeate flux was calculated by an electronic scale measuring the weight of permeate solution the properties of membrane utilized in this work are summarized in table 1 the sludge with various ags ratios 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 were used to simulate the sludge granulation process of ags mbr for sludge filtration tests the detailed filtration test process was depicted in the previous study zhang and jiang 2019 chen et al 2019 in this work the dynamic and static filtration tests were performed respectively 2 2 1 dynamic and static filtration tests dynamic and static filtration tests were adopted to inspect the membrane fouling mitigation with various ags ratios in the dynamic and static filtration tests 0 9 pa and mv020 were chosen for tmp and membrane respectively for the dynamic filtration test the hydraulic shear stress was 0 9 pa with a stirring operation while sludge presented a dynamic and suspension state on the membrane surface thus the filtration resistance was determined by hydraulic shear and ags scouring in the static filtration test the hydraulic shear stress was 0 pa without a stirring operation and sludge was at a static and deposition state on the membrane surface thereby the filtration resistance was just controlled by sludge ags fs structure 2 3 analytical items ags with various sizes was classified by the sieving method xuan et al 2010 the 500 ml of ags solution was sampled from ags mbr and screened by a series of standard sieves the sludge larger than 0 2 mm was regarded as ags and the other sludge d 0 2 mm was defined as fs ags ratio was measured by the sieving method xuan et al 2010 size distribution was determined by standard sieve with 0 2 3 mm pore size the ags between the two pore sizes is m1 m2 ms and the total ags weight is m0 m0 m1 m2 ms as well the size distribution in each range is tn mn m0 n 1 2 3 n ags ratio is the ratio of the sum of ags larger than 0 2 mm m2 m3 ms to m0 ags ratio m2 m3 ms m0 lv et al 2013 the sludges with various ags ratios 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 were performed to simulate the sludge granulation process afterwards these agss were applied for sludge filtration tests membrane characterization for the membranes before and after the test the membrane micromorphology was characterized via sem sn 3400 hitachi ltd japan and afm xe 100 park system korea water quality test tests were conducted according to standard methods and the main water quality analysis items included the cod nh3 n tn and tp as an indicator of mbr membrane fouling the tmp was measured using a vacuum gage which was installed on the effluent water permeate line 2 4 calculated parameters according to darcy s law the permeate flux can be calculated by a resistance in series model luo et al 2014 di bella et al 2019 1 j tmp μ r m r c r f where tmp is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the solvent viscosity pa s rm is the intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 rc is the concentration polarization resistance m 1 and rf is the fouling layer resistance m 1 in resistance in series model the intrinsic membrane concentration polarization layer and fouling layer resistances were determined as follows 1 the intrinsic membrane resistance was obtained from the water permeability of the new membrane before the test 2 the sum of intrinsic membrane and fouling layer resistance were calculated from the water permeability of the fouled membrane after the test 3 the sum of intrinsic membrane concentration polarization and fouling layer resistances were acquired from the permeate flux during tests thereby the concentration polarization and fouling layer resistances can be calculated by eq 1 an advanced in series resistance model corsino et al 2016 di bella et al 2018 was applied to calculate the filtration resistances of pore blocking a well as irreversible and reversible cake layer for the continuous ags mbr operation static and dynamic tests the detail equations were displayed in text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of ags mbr the ags mbr was operated more than 80 days for sludge granulation and ags ratio reached a stable maximum 90 after 50 days the average organics and nutrients removal efficiencies of ags mbr at the steady state 50 80 days were higher than those of conventional mbr shown in fig 1 a the cod removal rate for ags mbr exceeded 90 since ags has a stronger adsorption and conversion capacity for organic substrates on account of the high biomass concentration and diverse microbial community for nh3 n tn and tp conversion removal ags mbr also demonstrated better removal efficiencies under aerobic condition the oxygen transfer resistance of ags results in a layered structure aerobic anoxic and anaerobic providing an environment for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification as well as phospherous removal fig 1 b depicts the granulation period step by step with higher and higher ags ratio which stabilized at about 90 during sludge granulation in ags mbr the average ags size enlarged from 0 18 to 0 59 mm notably tmp showed a tendency of gradual increment and then reached 20 kpa after 80 days operation thus both higher ags ratio and larger ags size were conducive to membrane fouling mitigation in mbr compared with the conventional mbrs this fouling rate is highly low demonstrating that ags has a much smaller fouling potential than that of fs nevertheless the underlying mechanism for the antifouling of ags mbr remains unclear due to the long cycle of biological experiments and the limitation of mbr operation it is difficult to explain it via the conventional mbr in the subsequent work the sludge filtration tests were conducted to solve this difficulty 3 2 filtration performance during sludge granulation 3 2 1 flux behavior the permeate fluxes and total fouling resistances of the sludge with various ags ratios at dynamic and static filtrations are illustrated in fig 2 in the sludge filtration test when the ags ratio increased from 0 all sludge is fs to 100 all sludge is ags the permeate flux and fouling resistance gradually elevated and diminished respectively compared with fs the fluxes 36 0 l m 2 h 1 for static filtration and 40 0 l m 2 h 1 for dynamic filtration of ags were twice as higher and the resistances 9 96 10 12 m 1 for static filtration and 8 99 10 12 m 1 for dynamic filtration of ags were half as lower besides the dynamic filtration demonstrated the higher flux and smaller fouling than static filtration due to the dual effect of hydraulic shear and ags scouring during the membrane filtration process the concentration polarization and fouling layer on the membrane surface determine the total fouling resistance whereas the hydraulic shear and sludge structure are able to effectively affect the concentration polarization and fouling layer respectively thus membrane fouling mitigated by ags can be explained by hydraulic shear ags structure and ags scouring 3 2 1 1 hydraulic shear the deposition behavior and the attractive force between sludge and membrane are decided by the hydrodynamic drag shear induced transport force and foulant membrane interaction they acting together on sludge foulants control the gap between sludge ags or fs and membrane and deposition position on the membrane surface luo et al 2013 if shear force is greater than the penetration driving force between foulants and membrane ags or fs moves along on the membrane surface as shown in fig 3 there is a linear correlation between shear flow velocity and sludge particle diameter ags on the millimeter scale whereas the fs is much less than micrometer scale at least one in ten thus shear flow velocity of ags is orders of magnitude larger than shear flow velocity of fs more than tenfold ni and yu 2010 thereby ags has a much greater shear induced transport force relative to fs this high shear induced transport force is capable of outstripping hydrodynamic drag and foulant membrane interaction luo et al 2013 lessening ags deposition on the membrane surface accordingly ags presents much lower membrane fouling than fs furthermore under high hydraulic shear stress in contrast to fs some deposited agss are easier to return to concentration polarization on the other hand agss with greater size and smaller number are more dispersed than fs leading to lower concentration polarization resistance therefore with high hydraulic shear generated by dynamic filtration ags owns a better antifouling capacity than fs 3 2 1 2 ags structure compared with ags fs exhibits a more serious pore blocking because of the smaller size gap between fs and membrane pores zhang and jiang 2019 as for ags its size ags diameter exceeds 0 2 mm is much larger than membrane pore even for mf with large size 0 2 mm and cannot enter membrane pores indeed fs with small size is easy to form a compact fouling layer on the membrane surface especially at high filtration pressure or high filtration velocity the structure of fs fouling layer becomes denser and less permeable on the contrary the fouling layer of ags with large size and stable shape shows a loose structure and great porosity zhang and jiang 2019 indicating a high permeability moreover eps and soluble microbial products smp as main foulants adhere to the compact fs fouling layer meng et al 2017 enhancing the dense degree of the cake layer and pore blocking in contrast during ags formation process partial eps and smp are immobilized into ags and are degraded by anaerobe in the granules yu et al 2009 abating their composition in fouling layer and membrane pores thus its cake layer and pore blocking are smaller in the end during the sludge granulation process ags owns much less number and lower viscosity than fs at the same sludge concentration nancharaiah and reddy 2018 zhou et al 2015 which lessen the thickness of fouling layer and improve filtration efficiency therefore by comparing the flux and fouling resistance of fs and ags under static filtration it can be proved that the ags structure can greatly abate the membrane fouling 3 2 1 3 ags scouring effect there is an inconspicuous phenomenon in fig 2 the increase of permeate flux and reduction of fouling resistance between dynamic and static tests improved with ags ratios in fact in addition to ags structure and hydraulic shear ags also owns a unique strength ags scouring effect which is produced by ags fluid momentum and is analyzed in sections 3 3 mechanism explanation and 3 4 contribution evaluation as discussed above on account of the synergistic effects of ags scouring effect ags structure and hydraulic shear ags exhibits more advantages at antifouling performance than fs 3 2 2 membrane fouling resistances and membrane charterization table 2 depicts total fouling concentration polarization and fouling layer resistances against various ags ratios at dynamic and static filtrations during the granulation process with ags ratio increased both concentration polarization and fouling layer resistances presented the downward trends besides the proportion of concentration polarization kept elevating and that of fouling layer gradually declined thereby the concentration polarization turned out to be the main fouling resistance of ags filtration and the fouling layer is that of fs filtration in comparison with fs ags with large size suffers bigger shear induced stress zhang and jiang 2019 resulting in more depositing agss back to concentration polarization on the other hand on account of lower shear induced stress caused by smaller size the large attractive drag force pushes fs towards membrane easily thus a more compacted fouling layer and serious pore blocking form lack of the immobilization effect of ags yu et al 2009 more eps and smp in fs enter and block membrane pores aggravating the fouling resistance at last the dynamic filtration produces the greater hydraulic shear stress than the static filtration while more sludge in fouling layer returns to concentration polarization thus fouling layer resistance weakens and concentration polarization enhances in order to elucidate and compare the membrane fouling in ags mbr the advanced in series resistance model corsino et al 2016 was adopted to calculate the filtration resistances of the continuous ags mbr operation in static and dynamic tests as shown in table s2 the continuous ags mbr operation exhibited a higher filtration resistance than the other tests compared with dynamic test the static test also displayed the larger filtration resistances which corresponded to the previous analysis moreover the reversible membrane fouling was lower than the irreversible membrane fouling since less ags deposited and caused cake layer on membrane corsino et al 2016 the micromorphology and roughness of the membrane surface were characterized by sem and afm respectively as depicted in fig 4 compared with the pristine membrane more white spots occurred on the fouled membranes while greater peak and valley appeared on the fouled membranes by fs and ags this indicates that both ags and fs bring about obvious membrane fouling furthermore in contrast with fig 4 c and f fig 4 b exhibits more foulants accumulating on membrane and fig 4 e shows more rugged fouling layer respectively thus the fouled membrane of ags possessed less foulants and lower roughness than that of fs besides the clearer cake layer was obvsered on the fouled membrane of fs fig 4 b thereby cake layer is the main fouling types for fs filtration while fs demonstrates more serious membrane fouling than ags as well as these phenomena are consistent with the previous analysis 3 3 ags scouring mechanism ags mechanical scouring model for membrane fouling mitigation is proposed without considering the biodegradation impact because of its little effect upon the membrane fouling mitigation meng et al 2009 for the sake of fouling control a shear force needs to be implemented for opposing the penetration driving force and helping sludge foulant to escape from the penetration driving force according to the estimation of 10 times particle size adav et al 2008 the volume of ags is 1000 times of fs thus the mass of ags is much greater than that of fs similarly as mentioned in section 3 2 the shear velocity of ags was also much greater than that of fs more than tenfold so compared with ags the fs momentum is much smaller in terms of order of magnitudes and can be neglected because of the momentum produced by hydraulic shear wu et al 2017 ags tangentially moved along the membrane surface providing a scouring effect on the membrane surface then collided with fs in its path thus fs obtained an additional shear flow velocity from the faster moving ags for all foulants if shear flow velocity exceeds than escape velocity of penetration driving force they are ejected from membrane surface luo et al 2013 as studied in section 3 2 because fs exhibited a much more serious membrane fouling if fs obtain an additional shear force membrane fouling may be significantly mitigated furthermore the shear flow velocity was parallel to membrane surface jaffrin 2008 but the trajectory of ags or fs may change in case of colliding with other particles or roughness positions on the membrane surface thus these sludge foulants are detached from the membrane surface at the same time more collision contacts also improve the immobilization of eps and smp into ags besides an additional scouring shear stress on the membrane surface generated by ags scouring effect is considered an effective method to reinforce shear flow velocity wang et al 2017 although both hydraulic shear and ags scouring are able to increase the shear stress on the membrane surface ags scouring may play a majore role on the membrane fouling mitigation therefore to evaluate ags scouring effect quantitatively the scouring stress model is proposed theoretically the ags scouring mechanism is in the light of the momentum transferred p from the ags to fs and the scouring stress created by ags scouring can be derived p is linearly proportional to the total number of agss nags on the membrane surface the scouring area of each ags a on the membrane surface and the shear flow velocity of ags us ags on the membrane surface 2 p a n a g s u s a g s the ags scouring on the membrane surface is illustrated in fig 5 and a can be calculated by 3 a w t u s a g s where w is the effective width of ags which hence is proportional to ags diameter dags and t is the filtration duration us ags is proportional to dags fig 3 combining eqs 2 and 3 provides 4 p d a g s 3 n a g s t where dags 3 is proportional to ags volume while dags 3 nags and the total volume of all agss on the membrane surface are linear relations during long term filtration process ags was subjected to the fluid force from hydraulic shear and friction force from the membrane according to newton s law these two forces are in counter balance on the other hand on the membrane surface the relationship between the scouring force from ags and the friction force from membrane is also counter balance therefore the scouring stress ss pa is proportional to the ags particle momentum eq 4 can be rewritten as follow 5 s s p d a g s 3 n a g s t scouring stress is proportional to the total mass of agss on the membrane surface in addition the concentration polarization is also independent of particle diameter and is only a function of the total mass of particles on the membrane surface wu et al 2017 if ags concentration keeps constant the influence of ags on the membrane fouling is independent of ags diameter consequently for ags mbr the moderate ags mass on the membrane is beneficial to generate scouring stress for fouling mitigation the mbr model can be verified by its actual performance at various operation conditions huang et al 2020 ags scouring model was preliminarily verified by the ags filtration tests with various operation conditions as displayed in figs s1 s3 the greater ags ratio produces the larger flux and lower fouling resistance furthermore ags ratio was positively correlated with the total mass of particles on the membrane surface and the permeate flux and fouling resistance were obviously affected by ags scouring stress thus the total mass of particles on the membrane surface was able to exert a strong effect on ags scouring effect this corresponded to the conclusion of ags scouring model eq 5 the ags scouring stress is only a function of the total mass of particles on the membrane surface 3 4 the contribution quantification model for membrane fouling mitigation most mbr studies focus on the revealing and characterization of micro membrane fouling layer but the comprehensive understanding for contribution rate of various influence factors which mitigate membrane fouling is still lacking to comprehend the contribution rates of ags scouring effect ags structure hydraulic shear to mitigate membrane fouling after sludge granulation based on the changes of fouling resistances for ags and fs at dynamic with hydraulic shear and static without hydraulic shear filtrations a contribution quantification model to mitigate membrane fouling is proposed in this section at first some reasonable assumptions are made 1 hydraulic shear occurs both near and on the membrane surface thus it simultaneously affects the concentration polarization and membrane fouling layer 2 membrane fouling layer structure only affects the membrane fouling layer not the concentration polarization 3 ags scouring effect appears on the membrane surface only affecting the membrane fouling layer resistance moreover as depicted in fig 2 the membrane fouling resistances before fs and after ags sludge granulation under both dynamic and static filtrations were summarized the contribution rate of hydraulic shear chs can be expressed by the reduction rate of fs total fouling resistance under dynamic and static filtrations 6 c h s r t f s s r t f s d r t f s s 100 where rt fs d and rt fs s are the fs total fouling resistance under dynamic and static filtrations respectively the contribution rate of ags structure cfl can be determined by the reduction rate of total fouling resistance for ags and fs under static filtration 7 c f l r t f s s r t a g s s r t f s s 100 where rt ags s is the ags total fouling resistance under static filtration the contribution rate of ags scouring effect cse can be calculated by 100 subtracting chs and cfls 8 c s e 100 c f l c h s fig 6 illustrates that the total fouling resistances clearly declined from 8 99 10 12 m 1 dynamic filtration and 9 96 10 12 m 1 static filtration to 3 88 10 12 m 1 dynamic filtration and 4 95 10 12 m 1 static filtration respectively since membrane fouling can be evidently mitigated after sludge granulation fig 7 shows that the contribution rates of ags scouring effect ags structure and hydraulic shear were 39 9 50 3 and 9 7 respectively the greatest contribution rate was ags structure 50 3 the large size and stable shape of ags adav et al 2008 form a fouling layer with high permeability structure and low resistance at the same time due to the larger size than membrane pore less agss could enter membrane pores bringing about low pore blocking therefore the ags structure is obviously in favor of membrane fouling mitigation the second largest contribution rate was the ags scouring effect 39 9 the additional scouring shear stress formed by ags scouring effect on the membrane surface excessively lessened ags deposition on the membrane surface even rendered the depositing ags rise and back to concentration polarization layer as for fs because of the low shear flow velocity zhang and jiang 2019 it was easy to deposit on the membrane or enter membrane pores nevertheless the ags scouring effect diminished this phenomenon by lessening its penetration driving force thereby reducing cake layer and pore blocking of fs under ags scouring effect both ags and fs obtained larger parallel scouring shear stress and shear flow velocity on the membrane surface then enhancing the collision between each other or with the membrane surface roughness afterwards reducing their accumulation on the membrane surface on the other hand this collision also reinforced the ags immobilization behavior to eps and smp in addition ags scouring effect also generated the local turbulence near the membrane surface in comparison with hydraulic shear because of these synergistic effects ags scouring exhibited a greater fouling mitigation effect overall as a unique advantage of ags the scouring effect provided a tremendous help for fouling mitigation the last one was hydraulic shear 9 7 under which the agss depositing on the membrane surface return to concentration polarization layer and subdue the fouling layer resistance compared with fs ags concentration polarization layer possessed a smaller filtration resistance under hydraulic shear the larger particle size and smaller number of ags adav et al 2008 make it more dispersed improving the permeability and lowing the fouling layer moreover the high dispersion enhances the immobilization of ags to eps and smp although hydraulic shear is recognized as the mainstream membrane fouling mitigation strategie in most membrane filtration processes ng and kim 2007 it contributed less than 10 for fouling mitigation in ags mbr which was much lower than those of ags scouring effect and ags structure this suggests that ags scouring attaches a great importance upon fouling mitigation and sludge granulation may be a better implementation approach 4 application perspective membrane fouling mitigation accounts for the main operating cost of mbr compared with other fouling mitigation strategies the sludge granulation appears three advantages 1 excellent antifouling capacity as displayed in fig 8 ags with large size could form a high permeability cake layer reducing the filtration resistance while ags scouring effect can efficiently diminish the concentration polarization thus ags mbr possesses a low fouling behavior 2 low construction and operational cost sludge granulation is an in situ strengthening strategy for process upgrading without the need of additional investment besides the high permeability and anti fouling capacity of ags mbr reduce its aeration demand and operation energy consumption and 3 great removal of organics and nutrients the layered structure aerobic anoxic and anaerobic of ags and its high density and diverse microbial community effectively strengthen the removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorous therefore via selecting a suitable operation condition the sludge granulation can become a promising membrane fouling mitigation strategy for mbr however there are still many limitations of the application of ags mbr 1 the long term stability of ags the stronger ags scouring may lead to more ags disintegration 2 the reactor structure how to facilitate the scouring effect and maintain the size and shape of ags 3 the operation condition how to ensure the possible alternation feast and famine necessary for the maintenance of complete granulation and reducing the re formation rebound of fs 5 conclusions this study investigated the membrane fouling mitigation by sludge granulation in an ags mbr and revealed the ags scouring mechanism as well as evaluated its contribution rate the following notable observations were made during 80 days operation ags mbr exhibited the obvious advantages in term of removal of organics and nutrients and membrane fouling mitigation than those of conventional mbr during sludge granulation process with ags ratios elevated the permeate flux enhanced and fouling resistance diminished on account of ags scouring effect ags structure and hydraulic shear a novel hydrodynamic model was proposed to describe the ags scouring effect according to the momentum transformed from ags to fs the scouring stress was proportional to the total amount of ags on the membrane surface and greatly intensified the collision between ags and fs for the momentum transfer then reduced their deposition on the membrane by friction with membrane a new contribution quantification model was formulated to analyze the contribution rates of ags scouring effect 39 9 ags structure 50 3 and hydraulic shear 9 7 to mitigate membrane fouling thereby ags scouring played an vital role on fouling mitigation in the end the current study indicates the feasibility and significance of using sludge granulation for
