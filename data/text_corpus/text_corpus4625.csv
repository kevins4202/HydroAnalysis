of the unified formula keywords lateral buckling critical force unified formula imperfection shapes 1 introduction submarine pipelines play a significant role in offshore and deep water oil gas transportation systems as offshore oil gas development shifts towards deep water submarine pipelines operating under high temperature and high pressure hthp become more common considerable axial force will be produced in the submarine pipelines because of hthp once the axial force reaches to a certain value global buckling of submarine pipelines occurs this certain value is referred to as critical force because of the expensive costs of burying a pipeline and the difficulties and troubles in detection and maintenance afterwards tianfeng and xianhong 2015 submarine pipelines in deep water are usually laid directly on the seabed or partially embedded in soil in this case lateral buckling is the main buckling type since the lateral soil resistance against the pipeline movement is smaller than the vertical soil resistance lateral buckling jeopardizes the structural integrity and easily leads to final failure modes such as collapse fatigue or fracture dnv rp f110 2007 the critical force of lateral buckling is an important design parameter for submarine pipelines it has attracted a lot of researchers attentions based on the theoretical analysis and experimental tests for the lateral buckling of a pipe palmer and baldry 1974 correctly interpreted the reason why a pipe can buckle laterally and proposed an analytical formula for the critical pressure hobbs 1984 studied the lateral buckling of a perfect straight pipeline based on the related work on railroad track and proposed five buckling modes which may occur in the process of lateral buckling analytical formulas for critical force wavelength and amplitude corresponding to every buckling mode were presented however the initial imperfections of submarine pipelines were not considered in the above studies and this factor was proved to be crucial for the critical force focusing on the influence of initial imperfections on the lateral buckling response taylor and gan 1986 taylor and tran 1993 1996 carried out a series of experimental and analytical studies and proposed three kinds of models for initial imperfections formulas of critical force corresponding to the above three kinds of initial imperfection models were proposed these formulas only contain two independent geometric parameters the maximum amplitude and wavelength of an initial imperfection croll 1997 proposed two design formulas for the critical force of upheaval buckling the two formulas only contain one independent geometric parameter the maximum amplitude of an initial imperfection ju and kyriakides 1988 found that the critical force is sensitive to the initial imperfection shape magnitude and the inelastic characteristics of pipe material the research of richards 1990 also showed that the initial imperfection shape greatly affects the critical force based on theoretical analysis and experimental observations maltby and calladine 1995b found that the initial buckling is localized into a few half waves rather than being a uniform and indefinitely repeating sine wave a simple formula is proposed for the axial load at which the localization of buckling occurs the flexural rigidity of the pipe the amplitude of an initial imperfection and the peak soil resistance are involved in the formula based on an isolated half wavelength model karampour et al 2013 proposed a new interpretation for localization initial imperfection which produces low initial curvature results in a response that is initially dominated by membrane action while higher initial curvature results in a more dominant flexure based on bifurcation analysis zeng and duan 2014 and wang et al 2017a studied the lateral buckling of submarine pipelines in their analysis the initial imperfection is envisaged as the initial disturbance for a perfect submarine pipeline therefore initial imperfection parameters are not included in their formulas based on mode analysis method hong et al 2015a b obtained an analytical formula for the third order lateral buckling of a submarine pipeline with a single arch initial imperfection the analytical formula still only contains two geometric parameters of the initial imperfection the maximum amplitude and wavelength numerical methods were used to study the lateral buckling of submarine pipelines liu et al 2014 compared four numerical simulation methods based on the finite element fe program abaqus different fe methods were proposed for instance two dimensional fe method by zeng et al 2014 three dimensional fe method by valle molina et al 2014 vector form intrinsic fe method by xu and lin 2017 static and dynamic fe method by wang et al 2015b fe methods were also used to study the effects of initial imperfections on the global buckling response by zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2017 and wang et al 2017b wang et al 2017c d and wang and van der heijden 2017 studied the control of lateral buckling by numerical method experimental tests were carried out to investigate the lateral buckling of submarine pipelines taylor and tran 1996 maltby and calladine 1995a miles and calladine 1999 liu et al 2015 wang and liu 2016 however the critical force of lateral buckling still only contains two geometric parameters of the initial imperfection although the initial imperfection shape has a great influence on the critical force of lateral bucking it is not contained in the existing critical force formulas from the above discussion it can be seen that the initial imperfection maximum amplitude wavelength and shape have a great influence on the critical force of lateral buckling although previous researchers have proposed some formulas for it these formulas only contain the first two geometric parameters the exact relationship between the lateral buckling critical force lbcf and the initial imperfection shape is not clear at present moreover the formulas for the lbcf have different forms according to different initial imperfection shapes the formula for the lbcf needs to be unified this paper focuses on the effect of initial imperfection shape on the critical force of lateral buckling in this paper lateral buckling behaviors of submarine pipelines with different initial imperfection shapes are studied the characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection shape is found it is the characteristic parameter that makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape the reason why different initial imperfection shapes correspond to different formulas of the lbcf is also proposed a unified formula for the lbcf is proposed based on a parametric study and dimensional analysis to reveal the exact relationship between the lbcf and the initial imperfection shape 2 initial imperfection shapes to reveal the exact relationship between the lbcf and the initial imperfection shape it is necessary to find out a characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape which makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape since numerical method is planned to study their relationship in this paper the initial imperfection shape equations should be firstly assumed it is assumed that submarine pipelines have the following eight different initial imperfection shapes when they are installed three of them are from karampour et al 2013 and zeng et al 2014 1 f 1 x w 0 8 3 2 x l 0 2 3 2 x l 0 1 1 2 x l 0 3 l 0 2 x 0 w 0 8 3 2 x l 0 2 3 2 x l 0 1 1 2 x l 0 3 0 x l 0 2 2 f 2 x w 0 2 1 cos 2 π x l 0 l 0 2 x l 0 2 3 f 3 x w 0 4 2 x l 0 1 2 x l 0 1 l 0 2 x 0 w 0 4 2 x l 0 1 2 x l 0 1 0 x l 0 2 the following four initial imperfection shapes are from zhang and duan 2015 4 f 4 x w 0 1 5 2 2 x l 0 3 3 2 2 x l 0 5 l 0 2 x 0 w 0 1 5 2 2 x l 0 3 3 2 2 x l 0 5 0 x l 0 2 5 f 5 x w 0 1 4 2 x l 0 3 3 2 x l 0 4 l 0 2 x 0 w 0 1 4 2 x l 0 3 3 2 x l 0 4 0 x l 0 2 6 f 6 x w 0 1 3 2 x l 0 2 2 2 x l 0 3 l 0 2 x 0 w 0 1 3 2 x l 0 2 2 2 x l 0 3 0 x l 0 2 7 f 7 x w 0 1 2 2 x l 0 2 2 x l 0 4 l 0 2 x l 0 2 the last one initial imperfection shape is also from karampour et al 2013 8 f 8 x w 0 0 707 0 2617 π 2 x 2 l 0 0 293 cos 2 86 π x l 0 l 0 2 x l 0 2 where w 0 and l 0 denote the maximum amplitude and wavelength of the initial imperfection respectively as shown in fig 1 the eight initial imperfection shapes equations 1 to 8 are named no 1 to no 8 respectively fig 1 shows the profiles of these eight initial imperfections from this figure it can be seen that these eight different initial imperfections have same maximum amplitude w 0 and wavelength l 0 according to zeng et al 2014 they have same amplitude to wavelength ratio awr 9 δ w 0 l 0 where δ denotes awr the research of zeng et al 2014 showed that critical force formulas corresponding to the above three imperfections no 1 to no 3 have different forms even when those initial imperfections have same awr so different initial imperfection shapes correspond to different formulas of the lbcf to unify the formula of the lbcf the characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection shape should be included again it is critical to find a characteristic parameter of an initial imperfection shape from fig 1 it can be seen that these eight initial imperfection shapes all have different amplitudes within the region of the initial imperfection except point a b and c besides they have different curvature values some researchers ju and kyriakides 1988 maltby and calladine 1995b karampour et al 2013 pointed out that the temperature rise required for initial uplift is related to the curvature of the imperfection at x 0 here a dimensionless parameter is defined to describe their differences 10 φ x 1 k x l 0 ρ x l 0 where k x and ρ x denote curvature and curvature radius at the horizontal position x respectively here they are allowed to get negative values and are given by 11 k x f 1 f 2 3 2 12 ρ x 1 k x 1 f 2 3 2 f if ρ x has a negative value it denotes that the curvature center of that position is under the profile of the initial imperfection we will see later in this paper that it is the maximum of this parameter φ m or ρ max l 0 making the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape thereby the parameter can be a characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection and the parameter should be included in the unified formula of the lbcf finally a parametric study will be conducted using the fe method to determine the relationship between the lbcf and the characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection shape 3 finite element modeling palmer et al 1990 pointed out that the fe method is an effective method for analyzing buckling problems of submarine pipelines and the results are convenient to obtain some empirical formulas in this paper the model of heavy beam on rigid foundation is used to simulate the lateral buckling response 3 1 pipeline a pipeline segment with length of 1200 m is selected because of the multi modal feature of lateral buckling the external diameter and thickness of the pipeline take 0 457 m and 0 0143 m respectively the wavelengths of those eight different initial imperfections take 100 m api x 65 steel is used for the pipeline with yield stress 448mpa young s modulus 207gpa and poisson s ratio 0 3 it is modeled by hooke s law of elasticity theory and j2 flow theory of plasticity associated with mises yielding criteria and isotropic hardening law an et al 2012 the thermal expansion coefficient of pipeline material is 1 17e 5 c linear timoshenko beam element pipe31 is used to model the pipeline segment the pipeline segment is divided into 1200 elements by 1201 nodes the ends are fixed in both x y and z direction the downward force per unit length applied on the pipeline segment q is modeled by identical and evenly distributed linear loads zeng et al 2014 the temperature rise takes 100 c which is used to model the axial loads caused by both temperature rise and pressure difference between the inside and outside of the pipeline 3 2 seabed for simplicity it is assumed that the sea bed is rigid discrete rigid element r3d4 is used to model the rigid foundation the length and the wide of the foundation take 1200 m and 40 m respectively a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the effect of mesh topology on the lateral buckling response it is found that the element with a size of 20 m 20 m is enough to obtain a convergent and relatively accurate results therefore the whole foundation is divided into 120 elements coulomb friction model is used to model the interaction between the pipeline and surrounding soil the lateral resistance is expressed as the production of effective submerged weight of the pipeline the pipe soil tests from lambrakos 1985 show that the friction coefficient between the pipeline and the soil of seabed lies in the range of 0 2 0 8 and the friction coefficients of the lateral resistance are 0 45 and 0 75 for clay and sand respectively in this paper the friction coefficient takes a constant of 0 6 3 3 solution method lateral buckling of submarine pipelines is an unstable nonlinear and localized problem thereby the pure newton raphson method often causes computational convergence problems three methods can be used to solve this problem they are dynamic damping method wang et al 2015a static damping method zeng et al 2014 and modified riks method in this study the static damping method is adopted to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equations two general static analysis steps have been set in the problem accounting for geometric nonlinearity in the first step the distributed load is applied on the pipeline segment and in the second step the temperature increases by modifying the predefined field the axial force p 0 caused by the temperature rise and by the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the pipeline is calculated by taylor and tran 1996 13 p 0 e a α t 1 2 υ a p d 2 t e a α t t where the parameters a d and t denote pipeline cross section area external diameter and thickness respectively e υ and α denote young s modulus poisson s ratio and thermal expansion coefficient of the pipeline respectively t and p denote temperature rise and pressure difference respectively t denotes the effective temperature rise of pressure difference 3 4 verification of the solution method the same pipeline parameters used by karampour et al 2013 in their analytical studies is simulated in this section to test the accuracy of the proposed fe model table 1 lists the pipeline properties the imperfection no 1 is adopted as the initial imperfection shape function of the pipeline the maximum amplitude w 0 and wavelength of the initial imperfection take 0 2 m and 100 m respectively fig 2 shows the responses of the pipeline from this study and from karampour et al 2013 the horizontal axis represents the lateral displacement of the middle point of the pipeline while the vertical axis represents the axial force from fig 2 it can be seen easily that the critical force from this paper is 1 013 mn which shows good agreement with the result from karampour et al 2013 i e 0 992mn the fe prediction is 97 9 of the analytical result for the critical force 4 parametric study on the lateral buckling using the above fe modeling lateral buckling of imperfect submarine pipelines is successfully simulated the lbcf is affected by the maximum amplitude wavelength shape of an initial imperfection and etc to obtain the exact relationship between the lbcf and the above parameters a parametric study is carried out herein initial imperfection shapes are variable from no 1 to no 8 awrs are variable from 1 200 to 1 1000 in total 72 sets of results are obtained the critical temperatures of lateral buckling for pipeline segments with different awrs and different initial imperfection shapes are listed in table 3 according to equation 13 a series of critical axial forces are obtained as shown in table 4 4 1 the lateral buckling mode prior to reviewing results of the parametric study on the lbcf for submarine pipelines it is worth to discuss the buckling modes observed in the fe simulations the fe results show that two types of lateral buckling were observed in the lateral buckling responses of submarine pipelines fig 3 shows a typical lateral buckling response the deformation scale factor is set to 5 for the sake of clarity the midpoint of the pipeline is marked with from fig 3 it can be seen that with the increasing of temperature or axial force the pipeline deforms from the just before lateral buckling fig 3 a to just after lateral buckling fig 3 b in this process a large displacement happens laterally in the pipeline in a very short time and then the lateral buckling propagates from middle of the pipeline to two sides until the pipeline reaches to final state when the temperature rise is 100 c as shown in fig 3 c it can be seen clearly that the pipeline has a maximum stress value and a maximum lateral displacement at the midpoint of the pipeline segment both before and after buckling the buckling mode is mode 3 presented by hobbs 1984 which represents the lowest energy configuration the buckling type shown in fig 3 is referred to as type a herein the pipelines with initial imperfection shapes from no 1 to no 3 and no 6 to no 8 with awrs from 1 1000 to 1 200 all have such results fig 4 shows the lateral buckling response of the submarine pipeline with initial imperfection no 4 it is different from other six groups and has never been reported before in lateral buckling study of submarine pipelines for the sake of clarity the deformation scale factor is set to 5 the midpoint of the pipeline number of the node 601 is marked with the stress and deformation contour plot just before lateral buckling is shown in fig 4 a in fig 4 b lateral buckling happens firstly it is referred to as coupled modes buckling since it has the predominant mode at two positions rather than the midpoint of the pipeline then the maximum stress of the pipeline begins to decrease and local energy transfers from two sides to the center as shown in fig 4 c and then the lateral buckling happens suddenly again at the midpoint of the pipeline segment which is shown in fig 4 d fig 4 e shows the stress and deformation contour plot of the pipeline segment in final state when the temperature rise reaches to 100 c the buckling type shown in fig 4 is referred to as type b herein the pipelines with initial imperfection shapes from no 4 and no 5 with awrs from 1 1000 to 1 200 all have such results from the above analysis it can be seen clearly that the coupled modes lateral buckling happened firstly then with the increasing of axial force the coupled modes lateral buckling jumped into single mode lateral buckling in this evolutionary process a local transfer of strain energy occurred from two sides to the midpoint of the pipeline segment this coupled modes buckling phenomenon was firstly mentioned by zhang and duan 2015 in the study of upheaval buckling it manifests that this phenomenon can also happen in the process of lateral buckling to clearly show the positon of coupled modes buckling the lateral displacement versus the horizontal positon of the pipeline at critical buckling state corresponding to fig 4 b is plotted as shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be seen that the positions of the predominant mode are around at x 579 m corresponding to the number of the node 580 and x 621 m corresponding to the number of the node 622 in order to find out the reason why the lateral buckling of the pipeline with initial imperfection no 4 or no 5 has the predominant mode at the above positions the curvatures graphs of initial imperfection shapes no 1 to no 8 on different horizontal positions of the pipeline segment is plotted in fig 6 they are divided into two groups to clearly show their features although they are plotted when the initial imperfection maximum amplitude w 0 and wavelength l 0 take 0 1 m and 100 m respectively their shapes and features will not change with the initial imperfection maximum amplitude and wavelength from fig 6 a it can be seen that initial imperfection shape no 1 no 2 and no 3 all have the minimum curvatures values at the position x 0 which corresponds to the midpoint of the pipeline segment as shown by points a1 a2 and a3 respectively while the initial imperfection shape no 4 has the minimum curvature value at the position of x 21 and the positon of x 21 as shown by points a4 yet the two positions are consistent with those two positions node 580 and 622 where the lateral buckling of the pipeline has the predominant mode the same thing happens in fig 6 b i e the initial imperfection shapes no 6 no 7 and no 8 all have the minimum curvatures values at the position of x 0 as shown by points a6 a7 and a8 respectively while the initial imperfection shape no 5 has the minimum curvature value at the position of x 18 and the position of x 18 approximately as shown by points a5 they are also consistent with those two positions node 583 and 619 where the lateral buckling of the pipeline has the predominant mode therefore one conclusion can be obtained that the occurrence of lateral buckling is related to the minimum curvatures value of initial imperfection shape function and the lbcf might be affected by the minimum curvature of an initial imperfection shape the initial imperfection shapes discussed above are all symmetrical about the midpoint of pipeline segment now an asymmetrical case is taken into account in this paper to verify the above conclusion as shown in fig 7 the left half of imperfection shape takes no 5 and the right half of imperfection shape takes no 7 fig 8 shows the curvature of the asymmetrical initial imperfection which corresponds to the configuration of fig 7 from fig 8 it can be seen that the asymmetrical initial imperfection has the minimum curvature 0 00159856 at x 18 if the above conclusion is still correct the lateral bucking of the pipeline with the asymmetrical initial imperfection will have the predominant mode at the positon that x approximately equals to 582 m the midpoint of the pipeline is at x 600 m the lateral buckling response of the pipeline segment with the above asymmetrical imperfection shape is shown in fig 9 for the sake of clarity the deformation scale factor is set to 5 and the midpoint of the pipeline segment is marked with fig 9 a and b show the stress and deformation contour plots just before and just after lateral buckling respectively fig 9 c shows the propagation of the lateral buckling from left to right side fig 9 d shows the stress and deformation contour plot in final state when the temperature rise reaches to 100 c to clearly show the position of the predominant mode in fig 9 b the lateral displacement versus horizontal position of the pipeline with asymmetrical initial imperfection at critical buckling state is plotted in fig 10 it can be seen that as predicted lateral buckling of the pipeline with the asymmetrical initial imperfection does have the predominant mode at the position that x approximately equals to 582 m therefore it is confirmed that the occurrence of lateral buckling must be related to the minimum curvature values of the initial imperfection shape function 4 2 the effect of initial imperfection shape to investigate the effect of initial imperfection shape on the lbcf the axial force versus lateral displacement curves of key point on each pipeline segment with different initial imperfection shapes are plotted in fig 11 the key point for initial imperfection shapes no 1 to 3 and no 6 to 8 is the midpoint of the pipeline segment while the key point for initial imperfection no 4 or no 5 is the node 580 and 583 respectively from fig 11 a it can be seen that the lbcfs of the pipelines with different initial imperfection shapes have great difference although they have same awr 1 1000 the same thing happens when awr equals to 1 800 1 500 or 1 200 see fig 11 b d comparing fig 11 a to fig 11 b c and d it is found that the lbcfs corresponding to different initial imperfection shapes always have the following order p l3 p l8 p l1 p l6 p l2 p l4 p l7 p l5 where p li represents the lbcf corresponding to initial imperfection shape no i i 1 8 in section 2 a dimensionless parameter φ x is defined to describe the differences of the eight initial imperfection shapes according to the conclusion in section 4 1 the occurrence of lateral buckling is related to the minimum curvatures values of initial imperfection shape a minimum curvature corresponds to a maximum curvature radius table 2 lists the maximum values of the dimensionless parameter φ m with the scope of negative for each initial imperfection shape from table 2 it is found that the values of φ m for each initial imperfection shape follow the following relationship φ m 5 φ m 7 φ m 4 φ m 2 φ m 6 φ m 1 φ m 8 φ m 3 where φ m i represents the maximum value of the dimensionless parameter for initial imperfection no i i 1 8 it can be seen that this order is just opposite with the order of critical force it manifests that the lbcf is related to the dimensionless parameter φ m or ρ max l 0 the reason why different initial imperfection shape corresponds to different formula for the lbcf is that they have different values of ρ max l 0 therefore the parameter ρ max l 0 can be a characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection shape which makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape 4 3 the effect of awr to understand the effect of awr on the lbcf the initial imperfection shape is kept constant and the awr is variable from 1 1000 to 1 200 take the pipeline with initial imperfection shape no 1 and no 2 for example fig 12 a and b show the axial force versus the lateral displacement curves of the key point of the pipeline for initial imperfection shape no 1 and no 2 respectively from fig 12 a it can be seen that the lbcf is variable with the awr for same initial imperfection shape no 1 a smaller awr corresponds to a larger lbcf the same thing happens in fig 12 b which illustrates the relationship between the lbcf and lateral displacement for initial imperfection shape no 2 comparing fig 12 a and b it shows when the awr becomes large for example 1 200 the snap through phenomenon of lateral buckling is not evident in this situation it is difficult to precisely determine the critical point of lateral buckling therefore in order to improve the accuracy of unified formula the awrs above 1 200 are not taken into consideration in this paper 5 the unified formula of critical buckling force and application 5 1 the unified formula previous researchers hobbs 1984 taylor and gan 1986 croll 1997 karampour et al 2013 etc showed that the lbcf of a submarine pipeline is related to the flexural stiffness of the pipeline ei lateral friction μq initial imperfection maximum amplitude w 0 wavelength l 0 and initial imperfection shape according to the conclusion in section 4 2 the ratio of ρ max l 0 can be a characteristic parameter of an initial imperfection shape which makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape therefore the parameter ρ max l 0 should be included in the formula for the lbcf according to zeng et al 2014 the awr w 0 l 0 should be included in the formula for critical force of buckling as a whole these parameters form a complete set of independent quantities therefore the lbcf can be written as follows 14 p l p e i w 0 l 0 μ q ρ max l 0 using the international system of units i e mass m unit kg length l unit meter and time t unit second the dimensions of those quantities in equation 14 are as following independent terms e i m l 3 t 2 μ q m t 2 w 0 l 0 1 ρ max l 0 1 dependent term p l m l t 2 m l 3 t 2 1 3 m t 2 2 3 e i μ q 1 3 e i μ q 2 1 3 using dimensional analysis method the following function can be obtained 15 g w 0 l 0 ρ max l 0 p l e i μ q 2 1 3 where g is a coefficient function which describes the effect of initial imperfection parameters on the lbcf therefore the lbcf can be written as follows 16 g w 0 l 0 ρ max l 0 p l e i μ q 2 1 3 from equation 16 a series of dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 are obtained as shown in table 5 to determine the coefficient function g the relationship between the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 and the awr for same ρ max l 0 needs to be determined firstly plots of the values for dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 against the values for the inverse of awr are shown in fig 13 from fig 13 it can be seen that the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 or coefficient function g has a very good linear relationship with the inverse of awr by linear correlation analysis the results show that the fitting curves of the linear correlation coefficient are all greater than 99 26 therefore linear relationship is used in this paper to express the relationship between the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 and the inverse of awr then the relationship between the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 and the characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape ρ max l 0 with same awr needs to be determined table 6 lists the values for the characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shapes ρ max l 0 the values for the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 or the coefficient function g versus the values for the characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape ρ max l 0 is shown in fig 14 by correlation analysis the results show that the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 or coefficient function g has an approximate cubic relationship with the characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape the fitting curves of the correlation coefficient are all greater than 96 34 the fitting curves are also plotted in fig 14 therefore cubic function is used in this paper to express the relationship between the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 and the characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape ρ max l 0 thereby one form of the coefficient formula g is obtained as follows 17 g a b 1 ρ max l 0 c 1 l 0 w 0 b 2 ρ max l 0 2 c 2 ρ max l 0 l 0 w 0 b 3 ρ max l 0 3 c 3 ρ max l 0 2 l 0 w 0 multiply regression method is adopted to determine the above coefficients a b 1 b 2 b 3 c 1 c 2 c 3 by multiply regression analysis the results show that the fitting curve surface of the correlation coefficient is 98 29 the fitting plot residuals plot and contour plot are shown in fig 15 it shows that the fitting results are reliable the values for these coefficients are obtained a 15 53 b 1 0 615 b 2 0 0106 b 3 0 0001714 c 1 0 0250 c 2 0 000366 c 3 0 finally a unified formula for lbcf is obtained 18 p l 15 53 0 0250 l 0 w 0 0 615 ρ max l 0 0 0106 ρ max l 0 2 0 000366 ρ max w 0 0 0001714 ρ max l 0 3 μ q 2 e i 1 3 the formula manifests that if a pipeline segment has an initial imperfection the effect of initial imperfection on the lbcf can be expressed by three parameters the initial imperfection maximum amplitude w 0 wavelength l 0 and the maximum value of curvature radius ρ max within the scope of negative the essence of initial imperfection shape affecting the lbcf is that different initial imperfection shape has different value of ρ max l 0 it is the parameter that makes the lbcf affected by the initial imperfection shape 5 2 the application of the unified formula the submarine pipeline with the following initial imperfection shape karampour et al 2013 is selected to verify the reliability of equation 18 it is 19 f 9 x w 0 q x 4 24 e i q l 0 x 3 18 e i q l 0 2 x 2 48 e i l 0 2 x 0 w 0 q x 4 24 e i q l 0 x 3 18 e i q l 0 2 x 2 48 e i 0 x l 0 2 where l 0 2 72 e i w 0 q 1 4 it is supposed that the initial imperfection maximum amplitude is 0 3 m and the vertical load q equals to 1500n m then the initial imperfection wavelength is 69 4477 m suppose other parameters of the pipeline are same with those used in above fe simulating the results calculated by equation 18 and fe model are 1081634n and 1054862n respectively the relative error between the unified formula and the fe model is 2 54 it shows the accuracy of the unified formula the significance of the unified formula is that the formula reveals the relationship between the lbcf and the initial imperfection shape 6 conclusions in this paper the lateral buckling behaviors of submarine pipelines with different initial imperfection shapes are studied using 3d fe analysis the fe results were verified by an analytical solution of a previous researcher using the verified fe model a parametric study was carried out and a special type of lateral buckling was observed which has never been reported in the study of lateral buckling the characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection shape is found it is the characteristic parameter that makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape a unified formula is proposed based on the parametric study and dimensional analysis to reveal the exact relationship between the lbcf and the initial imperfection shape some conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the occurrence of lateral buckling is related to the minimum curvature value of the initial imperfection shape 2 the parameter ρ max l 0 can be a characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape it is the characteristic parameter that makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape 3 the parameter ρ max l 0 should be included in the formula of lateral buckling critical force 4 an application of the unified formula of the lateral buckling critical force was carried out and the results show that the unified formula

of the unified formula keywords lateral buckling critical force unified formula imperfection shapes 1 introduction submarine pipelines play a significant role in offshore and deep water oil gas transportation systems as offshore oil gas development shifts towards deep water submarine pipelines operating under high temperature and high pressure hthp become more common considerable axial force will be produced in the submarine pipelines because of hthp once the axial force reaches to a certain value global buckling of submarine pipelines occurs this certain value is referred to as critical force because of the expensive costs of burying a pipeline and the difficulties and troubles in detection and maintenance afterwards tianfeng and xianhong 2015 submarine pipelines in deep water are usually laid directly on the seabed or partially embedded in soil in this case lateral buckling is the main buckling type since the lateral soil resistance against the pipeline movement is smaller than the vertical soil resistance lateral buckling jeopardizes the structural integrity and easily leads to final failure modes such as collapse fatigue or fracture dnv rp f110 2007 the critical force of lateral buckling is an important design parameter for submarine pipelines it has attracted a lot of researchers attentions based on the theoretical analysis and experimental tests for the lateral buckling of a pipe palmer and baldry 1974 correctly interpreted the reason why a pipe can buckle laterally and proposed an analytical formula for the critical pressure hobbs 1984 studied the lateral buckling of a perfect straight pipeline based on the related work on railroad track and proposed five buckling modes which may occur in the process of lateral buckling analytical formulas for critical force wavelength and amplitude corresponding to every buckling mode were presented however the initial imperfections of submarine pipelines were not considered in the above studies and this factor was proved to be crucial for the critical force focusing on the influence of initial imperfections on the lateral buckling response taylor and gan 1986 taylor and tran 1993 1996 carried out a series of experimental and analytical studies and proposed three kinds of models for initial imperfections formulas of critical force corresponding to the above three kinds of initial imperfection models were proposed these formulas only contain two independent geometric parameters the maximum amplitude and wavelength of an initial imperfection croll 1997 proposed two design formulas for the critical force of upheaval buckling the two formulas only contain one independent geometric parameter the maximum amplitude of an initial imperfection ju and kyriakides 1988 found that the critical force is sensitive to the initial imperfection shape magnitude and the inelastic characteristics of pipe material the research of richards 1990 also showed that the initial imperfection shape greatly affects the critical force based on theoretical analysis and experimental observations maltby and calladine 1995b found that the initial buckling is localized into a few half waves rather than being a uniform and indefinitely repeating sine wave a simple formula is proposed for the axial load at which the localization of buckling occurs the flexural rigidity of the pipe the amplitude of an initial imperfection and the peak soil resistance are involved in the formula based on an isolated half wavelength model karampour et al 2013 proposed a new interpretation for localization initial imperfection which produces low initial curvature results in a response that is initially dominated by membrane action while higher initial curvature results in a more dominant flexure based on bifurcation analysis zeng and duan 2014 and wang et al 2017a studied the lateral buckling of submarine pipelines in their analysis the initial imperfection is envisaged as the initial disturbance for a perfect submarine pipeline therefore initial imperfection parameters are not included in their formulas based on mode analysis method hong et al 2015a b obtained an analytical formula for the third order lateral buckling of a submarine pipeline with a single arch initial imperfection the analytical formula still only contains two geometric parameters of the initial imperfection the maximum amplitude and wavelength numerical methods were used to study the lateral buckling of submarine pipelines liu et al 2014 compared four numerical simulation methods based on the finite element fe program abaqus different fe methods were proposed for instance two dimensional fe method by zeng et al 2014 three dimensional fe method by valle molina et al 2014 vector form intrinsic fe method by xu and lin 2017 static and dynamic fe method by wang et al 2015b fe methods were also used to study the effects of initial imperfections on the global buckling response by zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2017 and wang et al 2017b wang et al 2017c d and wang and van der heijden 2017 studied the control of lateral buckling by numerical method experimental tests were carried out to investigate the lateral buckling of submarine pipelines taylor and tran 1996 maltby and calladine 1995a miles and calladine 1999 liu et al 2015 wang and liu 2016 however the critical force of lateral buckling still only contains two geometric parameters of the initial imperfection although the initial imperfection shape has a great influence on the critical force of lateral bucking it is not contained in the existing critical force formulas from the above discussion it can be seen that the initial imperfection maximum amplitude wavelength and shape have a great influence on the critical force of lateral buckling although previous researchers have proposed some formulas for it these formulas only contain the first two geometric parameters the exact relationship between the lateral buckling critical force lbcf and the initial imperfection shape is not clear at present moreover the formulas for the lbcf have different forms according to different initial imperfection shapes the formula for the lbcf needs to be unified this paper focuses on the effect of initial imperfection shape on the critical force of lateral buckling in this paper lateral buckling behaviors of submarine pipelines with different initial imperfection shapes are studied the characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection shape is found it is the characteristic parameter that makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape the reason why different initial imperfection shapes correspond to different formulas of the lbcf is also proposed a unified formula for the lbcf is proposed based on a parametric study and dimensional analysis to reveal the exact relationship between the lbcf and the initial imperfection shape 2 initial imperfection shapes to reveal the exact relationship between the lbcf and the initial imperfection shape it is necessary to find out a characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape which makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape since numerical method is planned to study their relationship in this paper the initial imperfection shape equations should be firstly assumed it is assumed that submarine pipelines have the following eight different initial imperfection shapes when they are installed three of them are from karampour et al 2013 and zeng et al 2014 1 f 1 x w 0 8 3 2 x l 0 2 3 2 x l 0 1 1 2 x l 0 3 l 0 2 x 0 w 0 8 3 2 x l 0 2 3 2 x l 0 1 1 2 x l 0 3 0 x l 0 2 2 f 2 x w 0 2 1 cos 2 π x l 0 l 0 2 x l 0 2 3 f 3 x w 0 4 2 x l 0 1 2 x l 0 1 l 0 2 x 0 w 0 4 2 x l 0 1 2 x l 0 1 0 x l 0 2 the following four initial imperfection shapes are from zhang and duan 2015 4 f 4 x w 0 1 5 2 2 x l 0 3 3 2 2 x l 0 5 l 0 2 x 0 w 0 1 5 2 2 x l 0 3 3 2 2 x l 0 5 0 x l 0 2 5 f 5 x w 0 1 4 2 x l 0 3 3 2 x l 0 4 l 0 2 x 0 w 0 1 4 2 x l 0 3 3 2 x l 0 4 0 x l 0 2 6 f 6 x w 0 1 3 2 x l 0 2 2 2 x l 0 3 l 0 2 x 0 w 0 1 3 2 x l 0 2 2 2 x l 0 3 0 x l 0 2 7 f 7 x w 0 1 2 2 x l 0 2 2 x l 0 4 l 0 2 x l 0 2 the last one initial imperfection shape is also from karampour et al 2013 8 f 8 x w 0 0 707 0 2617 π 2 x 2 l 0 0 293 cos 2 86 π x l 0 l 0 2 x l 0 2 where w 0 and l 0 denote the maximum amplitude and wavelength of the initial imperfection respectively as shown in fig 1 the eight initial imperfection shapes equations 1 to 8 are named no 1 to no 8 respectively fig 1 shows the profiles of these eight initial imperfections from this figure it can be seen that these eight different initial imperfections have same maximum amplitude w 0 and wavelength l 0 according to zeng et al 2014 they have same amplitude to wavelength ratio awr 9 δ w 0 l 0 where δ denotes awr the research of zeng et al 2014 showed that critical force formulas corresponding to the above three imperfections no 1 to no 3 have different forms even when those initial imperfections have same awr so different initial imperfection shapes correspond to different formulas of the lbcf to unify the formula of the lbcf the characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection shape should be included again it is critical to find a characteristic parameter of an initial imperfection shape from fig 1 it can be seen that these eight initial imperfection shapes all have different amplitudes within the region of the initial imperfection except point a b and c besides they have different curvature values some researchers ju and kyriakides 1988 maltby and calladine 1995b karampour et al 2013 pointed out that the temperature rise required for initial uplift is related to the curvature of the imperfection at x 0 here a dimensionless parameter is defined to describe their differences 10 φ x 1 k x l 0 ρ x l 0 where k x and ρ x denote curvature and curvature radius at the horizontal position x respectively here they are allowed to get negative values and are given by 11 k x f 1 f 2 3 2 12 ρ x 1 k x 1 f 2 3 2 f if ρ x has a negative value it denotes that the curvature center of that position is under the profile of the initial imperfection we will see later in this paper that it is the maximum of this parameter φ m or ρ max l 0 making the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape thereby the parameter can be a characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection and the parameter should be included in the unified formula of the lbcf finally a parametric study will be conducted using the fe method to determine the relationship between the lbcf and the characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection shape 3 finite element modeling palmer et al 1990 pointed out that the fe method is an effective method for analyzing buckling problems of submarine pipelines and the results are convenient to obtain some empirical formulas in this paper the model of heavy beam on rigid foundation is used to simulate the lateral buckling response 3 1 pipeline a pipeline segment with length of 1200 m is selected because of the multi modal feature of lateral buckling the external diameter and thickness of the pipeline take 0 457 m and 0 0143 m respectively the wavelengths of those eight different initial imperfections take 100 m api x 65 steel is used for the pipeline with yield stress 448mpa young s modulus 207gpa and poisson s ratio 0 3 it is modeled by hooke s law of elasticity theory and j2 flow theory of plasticity associated with mises yielding criteria and isotropic hardening law an et al 2012 the thermal expansion coefficient of pipeline material is 1 17e 5 c linear timoshenko beam element pipe31 is used to model the pipeline segment the pipeline segment is divided into 1200 elements by 1201 nodes the ends are fixed in both x y and z direction the downward force per unit length applied on the pipeline segment q is modeled by identical and evenly distributed linear loads zeng et al 2014 the temperature rise takes 100 c which is used to model the axial loads caused by both temperature rise and pressure difference between the inside and outside of the pipeline 3 2 seabed for simplicity it is assumed that the sea bed is rigid discrete rigid element r3d4 is used to model the rigid foundation the length and the wide of the foundation take 1200 m and 40 m respectively a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the effect of mesh topology on the lateral buckling response it is found that the element with a size of 20 m 20 m is enough to obtain a convergent and relatively accurate results therefore the whole foundation is divided into 120 elements coulomb friction model is used to model the interaction between the pipeline and surrounding soil the lateral resistance is expressed as the production of effective submerged weight of the pipeline the pipe soil tests from lambrakos 1985 show that the friction coefficient between the pipeline and the soil of seabed lies in the range of 0 2 0 8 and the friction coefficients of the lateral resistance are 0 45 and 0 75 for clay and sand respectively in this paper the friction coefficient takes a constant of 0 6 3 3 solution method lateral buckling of submarine pipelines is an unstable nonlinear and localized problem thereby the pure newton raphson method often causes computational convergence problems three methods can be used to solve this problem they are dynamic damping method wang et al 2015a static damping method zeng et al 2014 and modified riks method in this study the static damping method is adopted to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equations two general static analysis steps have been set in the problem accounting for geometric nonlinearity in the first step the distributed load is applied on the pipeline segment and in the second step the temperature increases by modifying the predefined field the axial force p 0 caused by the temperature rise and by the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the pipeline is calculated by taylor and tran 1996 13 p 0 e a α t 1 2 υ a p d 2 t e a α t t where the parameters a d and t denote pipeline cross section area external diameter and thickness respectively e υ and α denote young s modulus poisson s ratio and thermal expansion coefficient of the pipeline respectively t and p denote temperature rise and pressure difference respectively t denotes the effective temperature rise of pressure difference 3 4 verification of the solution method the same pipeline parameters used by karampour et al 2013 in their analytical studies is simulated in this section to test the accuracy of the proposed fe model table 1 lists the pipeline properties the imperfection no 1 is adopted as the initial imperfection shape function of the pipeline the maximum amplitude w 0 and wavelength of the initial imperfection take 0 2 m and 100 m respectively fig 2 shows the responses of the pipeline from this study and from karampour et al 2013 the horizontal axis represents the lateral displacement of the middle point of the pipeline while the vertical axis represents the axial force from fig 2 it can be seen easily that the critical force from this paper is 1 013 mn which shows good agreement with the result from karampour et al 2013 i e 0 992mn the fe prediction is 97 9 of the analytical result for the critical force 4 parametric study on the lateral buckling using the above fe modeling lateral buckling of imperfect submarine pipelines is successfully simulated the lbcf is affected by the maximum amplitude wavelength shape of an initial imperfection and etc to obtain the exact relationship between the lbcf and the above parameters a parametric study is carried out herein initial imperfection shapes are variable from no 1 to no 8 awrs are variable from 1 200 to 1 1000 in total 72 sets of results are obtained the critical temperatures of lateral buckling for pipeline segments with different awrs and different initial imperfection shapes are listed in table 3 according to equation 13 a series of critical axial forces are obtained as shown in table 4 4 1 the lateral buckling mode prior to reviewing results of the parametric study on the lbcf for submarine pipelines it is worth to discuss the buckling modes observed in the fe simulations the fe results show that two types of lateral buckling were observed in the lateral buckling responses of submarine pipelines fig 3 shows a typical lateral buckling response the deformation scale factor is set to 5 for the sake of clarity the midpoint of the pipeline is marked with from fig 3 it can be seen that with the increasing of temperature or axial force the pipeline deforms from the just before lateral buckling fig 3 a to just after lateral buckling fig 3 b in this process a large displacement happens laterally in the pipeline in a very short time and then the lateral buckling propagates from middle of the pipeline to two sides until the pipeline reaches to final state when the temperature rise is 100 c as shown in fig 3 c it can be seen clearly that the pipeline has a maximum stress value and a maximum lateral displacement at the midpoint of the pipeline segment both before and after buckling the buckling mode is mode 3 presented by hobbs 1984 which represents the lowest energy configuration the buckling type shown in fig 3 is referred to as type a herein the pipelines with initial imperfection shapes from no 1 to no 3 and no 6 to no 8 with awrs from 1 1000 to 1 200 all have such results fig 4 shows the lateral buckling response of the submarine pipeline with initial imperfection no 4 it is different from other six groups and has never been reported before in lateral buckling study of submarine pipelines for the sake of clarity the deformation scale factor is set to 5 the midpoint of the pipeline number of the node 601 is marked with the stress and deformation contour plot just before lateral buckling is shown in fig 4 a in fig 4 b lateral buckling happens firstly it is referred to as coupled modes buckling since it has the predominant mode at two positions rather than the midpoint of the pipeline then the maximum stress of the pipeline begins to decrease and local energy transfers from two sides to the center as shown in fig 4 c and then the lateral buckling happens suddenly again at the midpoint of the pipeline segment which is shown in fig 4 d fig 4 e shows the stress and deformation contour plot of the pipeline segment in final state when the temperature rise reaches to 100 c the buckling type shown in fig 4 is referred to as type b herein the pipelines with initial imperfection shapes from no 4 and no 5 with awrs from 1 1000 to 1 200 all have such results from the above analysis it can be seen clearly that the coupled modes lateral buckling happened firstly then with the increasing of axial force the coupled modes lateral buckling jumped into single mode lateral buckling in this evolutionary process a local transfer of strain energy occurred from two sides to the midpoint of the pipeline segment this coupled modes buckling phenomenon was firstly mentioned by zhang and duan 2015 in the study of upheaval buckling it manifests that this phenomenon can also happen in the process of lateral buckling to clearly show the positon of coupled modes buckling the lateral displacement versus the horizontal positon of the pipeline at critical buckling state corresponding to fig 4 b is plotted as shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be seen that the positions of the predominant mode are around at x 579 m corresponding to the number of the node 580 and x 621 m corresponding to the number of the node 622 in order to find out the reason why the lateral buckling of the pipeline with initial imperfection no 4 or no 5 has the predominant mode at the above positions the curvatures graphs of initial imperfection shapes no 1 to no 8 on different horizontal positions of the pipeline segment is plotted in fig 6 they are divided into two groups to clearly show their features although they are plotted when the initial imperfection maximum amplitude w 0 and wavelength l 0 take 0 1 m and 100 m respectively their shapes and features will not change with the initial imperfection maximum amplitude and wavelength from fig 6 a it can be seen that initial imperfection shape no 1 no 2 and no 3 all have the minimum curvatures values at the position x 0 which corresponds to the midpoint of the pipeline segment as shown by points a1 a2 and a3 respectively while the initial imperfection shape no 4 has the minimum curvature value at the position of x 21 and the positon of x 21 as shown by points a4 yet the two positions are consistent with those two positions node 580 and 622 where the lateral buckling of the pipeline has the predominant mode the same thing happens in fig 6 b i e the initial imperfection shapes no 6 no 7 and no 8 all have the minimum curvatures values at the position of x 0 as shown by points a6 a7 and a8 respectively while the initial imperfection shape no 5 has the minimum curvature value at the position of x 18 and the position of x 18 approximately as shown by points a5 they are also consistent with those two positions node 583 and 619 where the lateral buckling of the pipeline has the predominant mode therefore one conclusion can be obtained that the occurrence of lateral buckling is related to the minimum curvatures value of initial imperfection shape function and the lbcf might be affected by the minimum curvature of an initial imperfection shape the initial imperfection shapes discussed above are all symmetrical about the midpoint of pipeline segment now an asymmetrical case is taken into account in this paper to verify the above conclusion as shown in fig 7 the left half of imperfection shape takes no 5 and the right half of imperfection shape takes no 7 fig 8 shows the curvature of the asymmetrical initial imperfection which corresponds to the configuration of fig 7 from fig 8 it can be seen that the asymmetrical initial imperfection has the minimum curvature 0 00159856 at x 18 if the above conclusion is still correct the lateral bucking of the pipeline with the asymmetrical initial imperfection will have the predominant mode at the positon that x approximately equals to 582 m the midpoint of the pipeline is at x 600 m the lateral buckling response of the pipeline segment with the above asymmetrical imperfection shape is shown in fig 9 for the sake of clarity the deformation scale factor is set to 5 and the midpoint of the pipeline segment is marked with fig 9 a and b show the stress and deformation contour plots just before and just after lateral buckling respectively fig 9 c shows the propagation of the lateral buckling from left to right side fig 9 d shows the stress and deformation contour plot in final state when the temperature rise reaches to 100 c to clearly show the position of the predominant mode in fig 9 b the lateral displacement versus horizontal position of the pipeline with asymmetrical initial imperfection at critical buckling state is plotted in fig 10 it can be seen that as predicted lateral buckling of the pipeline with the asymmetrical initial imperfection does have the predominant mode at the position that x approximately equals to 582 m therefore it is confirmed that the occurrence of lateral buckling must be related to the minimum curvature values of the initial imperfection shape function 4 2 the effect of initial imperfection shape to investigate the effect of initial imperfection shape on the lbcf the axial force versus lateral displacement curves of key point on each pipeline segment with different initial imperfection shapes are plotted in fig 11 the key point for initial imperfection shapes no 1 to 3 and no 6 to 8 is the midpoint of the pipeline segment while the key point for initial imperfection no 4 or no 5 is the node 580 and 583 respectively from fig 11 a it can be seen that the lbcfs of the pipelines with different initial imperfection shapes have great difference although they have same awr 1 1000 the same thing happens when awr equals to 1 800 1 500 or 1 200 see fig 11 b d comparing fig 11 a to fig 11 b c and d it is found that the lbcfs corresponding to different initial imperfection shapes always have the following order p l3 p l8 p l1 p l6 p l2 p l4 p l7 p l5 where p li represents the lbcf corresponding to initial imperfection shape no i i 1 8 in section 2 a dimensionless parameter φ x is defined to describe the differences of the eight initial imperfection shapes according to the conclusion in section 4 1 the occurrence of lateral buckling is related to the minimum curvatures values of initial imperfection shape a minimum curvature corresponds to a maximum curvature radius table 2 lists the maximum values of the dimensionless parameter φ m with the scope of negative for each initial imperfection shape from table 2 it is found that the values of φ m for each initial imperfection shape follow the following relationship φ m 5 φ m 7 φ m 4 φ m 2 φ m 6 φ m 1 φ m 8 φ m 3 where φ m i represents the maximum value of the dimensionless parameter for initial imperfection no i i 1 8 it can be seen that this order is just opposite with the order of critical force it manifests that the lbcf is related to the dimensionless parameter φ m or ρ max l 0 the reason why different initial imperfection shape corresponds to different formula for the lbcf is that they have different values of ρ max l 0 therefore the parameter ρ max l 0 can be a characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection shape which makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape 4 3 the effect of awr to understand the effect of awr on the lbcf the initial imperfection shape is kept constant and the awr is variable from 1 1000 to 1 200 take the pipeline with initial imperfection shape no 1 and no 2 for example fig 12 a and b show the axial force versus the lateral displacement curves of the key point of the pipeline for initial imperfection shape no 1 and no 2 respectively from fig 12 a it can be seen that the lbcf is variable with the awr for same initial imperfection shape no 1 a smaller awr corresponds to a larger lbcf the same thing happens in fig 12 b which illustrates the relationship between the lbcf and lateral displacement for initial imperfection shape no 2 comparing fig 12 a and b it shows when the awr becomes large for example 1 200 the snap through phenomenon of lateral buckling is not evident in this situation it is difficult to precisely determine the critical point of lateral buckling therefore in order to improve the accuracy of unified formula the awrs above 1 200 are not taken into consideration in this paper 5 the unified formula of critical buckling force and application 5 1 the unified formula previous researchers hobbs 1984 taylor and gan 1986 croll 1997 karampour et al 2013 etc showed that the lbcf of a submarine pipeline is related to the flexural stiffness of the pipeline ei lateral friction μq initial imperfection maximum amplitude w 0 wavelength l 0 and initial imperfection shape according to the conclusion in section 4 2 the ratio of ρ max l 0 can be a characteristic parameter of an initial imperfection shape which makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape therefore the parameter ρ max l 0 should be included in the formula for the lbcf according to zeng et al 2014 the awr w 0 l 0 should be included in the formula for critical force of buckling as a whole these parameters form a complete set of independent quantities therefore the lbcf can be written as follows 14 p l p e i w 0 l 0 μ q ρ max l 0 using the international system of units i e mass m unit kg length l unit meter and time t unit second the dimensions of those quantities in equation 14 are as following independent terms e i m l 3 t 2 μ q m t 2 w 0 l 0 1 ρ max l 0 1 dependent term p l m l t 2 m l 3 t 2 1 3 m t 2 2 3 e i μ q 1 3 e i μ q 2 1 3 using dimensional analysis method the following function can be obtained 15 g w 0 l 0 ρ max l 0 p l e i μ q 2 1 3 where g is a coefficient function which describes the effect of initial imperfection parameters on the lbcf therefore the lbcf can be written as follows 16 g w 0 l 0 ρ max l 0 p l e i μ q 2 1 3 from equation 16 a series of dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 are obtained as shown in table 5 to determine the coefficient function g the relationship between the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 and the awr for same ρ max l 0 needs to be determined firstly plots of the values for dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 against the values for the inverse of awr are shown in fig 13 from fig 13 it can be seen that the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 or coefficient function g has a very good linear relationship with the inverse of awr by linear correlation analysis the results show that the fitting curves of the linear correlation coefficient are all greater than 99 26 therefore linear relationship is used in this paper to express the relationship between the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 and the inverse of awr then the relationship between the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 and the characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape ρ max l 0 with same awr needs to be determined table 6 lists the values for the characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shapes ρ max l 0 the values for the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 or the coefficient function g versus the values for the characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape ρ max l 0 is shown in fig 14 by correlation analysis the results show that the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 or coefficient function g has an approximate cubic relationship with the characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape the fitting curves of the correlation coefficient are all greater than 96 34 the fitting curves are also plotted in fig 14 therefore cubic function is used in this paper to express the relationship between the dimensionless quantity p l μ q 2 e i 1 3 and the characteristic parameter of initial imperfection shape ρ max l 0 thereby one form of the coefficient formula g is obtained as follows 17 g a b 1 ρ max l 0 c 1 l 0 w 0 b 2 ρ max l 0 2 c 2 ρ max l 0 l 0 w 0 b 3 ρ max l 0 3 c 3 ρ max l 0 2 l 0 w 0 multiply regression method is adopted to determine the above coefficients a b 1 b 2 b 3 c 1 c 2 c 3 by multiply regression analysis the results show that the fitting curve surface of the correlation coefficient is 98 29 the fitting plot residuals plot and contour plot are shown in fig 15 it shows that the fitting results are reliable the values for these coefficients are obtained a 15 53 b 1 0 615 b 2 0 0106 b 3 0 0001714 c 1 0 0250 c 2 0 000366 c 3 0 finally a unified formula for lbcf is obtained 18 p l 15 53 0 0250 l 0 w 0 0 615 ρ max l 0 0 0106 ρ max l 0 2 0 000366 ρ max w 0 0 0001714 ρ max l 0 3 μ q 2 e i 1 3 the formula manifests that if a pipeline segment has an initial imperfection the effect of initial imperfection on the lbcf can be expressed by three parameters the initial imperfection maximum amplitude w 0 wavelength l 0 and the maximum value of curvature radius ρ max within the scope of negative the essence of initial imperfection shape affecting the lbcf is that different initial imperfection shape has different value of ρ max l 0 it is the parameter that makes the lbcf affected by the initial imperfection shape 5 2 the application of the unified formula the submarine pipeline with the following initial imperfection shape karampour et al 2013 is selected to verify the reliability of equation 18 it is 19 f 9 x w 0 q x 4 24 e i q l 0 x 3 18 e i q l 0 2 x 2 48 e i l 0 2 x 0 w 0 q x 4 24 e i q l 0 x 3 18 e i q l 0 2 x 2 48 e i 0 x l 0 2 where l 0 2 72 e i w 0 q 1 4 it is supposed that the initial imperfection maximum amplitude is 0 3 m and the vertical load q equals to 1500n m then the initial imperfection wavelength is 69 4477 m suppose other parameters of the pipeline are same with those used in above fe simulating the results calculated by equation 18 and fe model are 1081634n and 1054862n respectively the relative error between the unified formula and the fe model is 2 54 it shows the accuracy of the unified formula the significance of the unified formula is that the formula reveals the relationship between the lbcf and the initial imperfection shape 6 conclusions in this paper the lateral buckling behaviors of submarine pipelines with different initial imperfection shapes are studied using 3d fe analysis the fe results were verified by an analytical solution of a previous researcher using the verified fe model a parametric study was carried out and a special type of lateral buckling was observed which has never been reported in the study of lateral buckling the characteristic parameter of the initial imperfection shape is found it is the characteristic parameter that makes the lbcf greatly affected by the initial imperfection shape a unified formula is proposed based on the parametric study and dimensional analysis to reveal the exact relationship between the lbcf and the initial imperfection shape some conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the occurrence of lateral buckling is related to the minimum curvature value of the initial imperfection shape 2 the parameter ρ max l 0 can be a

23126,bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping bslam technique could provide long term underwater navigation results for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and produce a self consistent bathymetric map simultaneously however the inter frame motion inside bslam is still difficult to estimate and bslam might fail catastrophically with invalid loop closures caused by the measurement errors of vehicle states and bathymetric data to deal with these problems an auv robust bslam algorithm is proposed based on graph slam in this algorithm weak data association is constructed via sparse pseudo input gaussian process spgp regression to predict inter frame motion and a multi window consistency method mcm is introduced to identify invalid loop closures various simulation experiments are conducted under different environments comparisons are made between more standard approaches and our proposed algorithm is shown to be viable accurate and could robustly handle invalid loop closures keywords navigation bslam robust spgp consistency method 1 introduction with the increasing demand of marine exploration and the development of seabed topographic mapping methods such as the bathymetry system a significant amount of work has been done to produce high resolution maps of the seabed doble et al 2009 however because the map resolution for ship borne bathymetry system is proportional to the water depths they could not meet the requirements of high resolution mapping in deep waters due to their ability to operate closely to the seafloor regardless of depth autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have become important mapping platforms for topography missions and geological surveys such as searching for manganese nodules hydrothermal vents and remains of vessels the accuracy of bathymetric map depends on the accuracy of navigation on the auv the global positioning system gps dead reckoning dr ultrashort baseline usbl and long baseline lbl acoustic positioning systems all provides options for improving navigational accuracy with various levels of attainable precision paull et al 2014 tan et al 2011 gps observations could provide accurate locations but this requires the auv to surface the dr navigation error is related to the total distance traveled which means it is unsuitable to a long term underwater navigation scenario without other precise auxiliary means of positioning although usbl and lbl could provide bounded navigation error support vessels or acoustic array are necessary and this would limit the operating range as a more recently developed approach to provide accurate navigation solution for auvs without any aids simultaneous localization and mapping slam technique is introduced slam technique makes it possible for a vehicle to incrementally build a map with consistency of an unknown environment while simultaneously determining its location within this map durrant whyte and bailey 2006 at present many breakthroughs of slam technique have been made in unmanned ground vehicles ugvs ila et al 2017 nieto et al 2007 dellaert and kaess 2006 and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs kownacki 2016 underwater slam algorithms for auvs have also been developed and most of them are applied using a camera kim and eustice 2013 and forward looking sonar mallios et al 2014 ribas et al 2008 ozog et al 2016 proposed the long term underwater visual slam algorithm this algorithm applies generic linear constraints to reduce nodes in the factor graph for building a lifelong map for cases when the navigation system is not reliable and the sensor cannot perform continuous observations elibol et al 2016 presented a seabed topographic mapping approach for trajectories with gaps this approach produced solutions for low cost underwater optical mapping missions using the extended kalman filter ekf slam meanwhile many researches about forward looking sonar slam have been carried out some of them are based on an abandoned marina dataset and their viability and accuracy have also been verified burguera et al 2010 mallios et al 2014 however the use of camera is limited to applications in which the vehicle navigates in clear water and very near to the seafloor ribas et al 2008 and the slam technique with forward looking sonar cannot be applied in unstructured environments compared with the techniques listed above bathymetric slam bslam is more flexible and has little restrictions on water clarity and environment however some difficulties have still limited the application of bslam see figs 1 and 2 as shown in fig 3 obvious overlap of the bathymetric data couldn t be obtained at adjacent time periods and this make it difficult to measure the inter frame motion loop closures detected by terrain matching techniques have a great impact on navigation results navigation results for vehicles are inaccurate if the invalid loop closures cannot be identified to overcome these difficulties the robust bslam algorithm which consists of graph construction and optimization is proposed based on graph method in graph construction to estimate the inter frame motion this paper constructs weak data association by comparing the prior and measurement depths where the prior depths are estimated by sparse pseudo input gaussian process spgp regression as for the graph optimization using global and local trajectory optimizations as graph updating approaches the multi window consistency method mcm is proposed to identify the invalid loop closures by an iterative approach with on board collected data the playback experiments were conducted to show both spgp and mcm are more efficient and accurate than the state of art approaches and the viability accuracy and robust performance of the robust bslam algorithm are also verified the rest of paper is organized as follows a description of the related works is put forward in section 2 the graph construction algorithm and graph optimization algorithm are proposed in sections 3 and 4 respectively and the playback experiments and their results are discussed in section 5 finally the conclusions of this study are drawn in section 6 2 related works bslam have lately received great attention barkby et al 2012 proposed a bathymetric particle filter slam bpslam to help locate the vehicle position in real time without the loop closure detection this algorithm applied gaussian process and rao blackwellized particle filter to solve slam solutions and an ancestry tree was used to reduced computation but regrettably the computational efficiency of the bpslam still limits its real time performance palomer et al 2013 proposed the submap division approach in the bslam to deal with the time consuming problem of loop closure detection this approach applied an octree structure to optimize the point cloud data obtained from the bathymetry system and represented the amount of information contained in the map by calculating the different of normals don stuckey 2012 represented the dynamic model of auvs via hydrodynamic coefficients he applied this method in the ekf slam framework and verified its validity in a simulation experiment as for the robust slam algorithm sunderhauf and protzel 2012 introduced the switch variable and penalty function into objective function to optimize the reliability of data association this algorithm works well but is time consuming on the basic of this algorithm dynamic covariance scaling dcs approach was proposed by agarwal et al 2013 in dcs switch variable is calculated directly and removed from the entire optimization process to reduce computation and agarwal et al 2014 also presented an optimization method with a poor initial value based on dcs this method is mainly focused on a solution for local consistency and the global consistency couldn t be guaranteed all the above algorithms run the optimization algorithm and association identification simultaneously to identify the data association the different kind of methods is the global consistency method and this method finds out the largest subset of data association that construct a consistent map through an iterative approach latif et al 2012 proposed a novel consistency based approach which is called realizing reversing recovering rrr this approach divides loop closures into clusters based on topological similarity and then tries to find the valid closures by consistency test carlone et al 2014 proposed to select all coherent measurements instead of distinguishing outliers in the optimization process and this method represents the constraints of each non odometer data association by the big m trick graham et al 2015 put forward the consistency checking iscc approach applied in incremental slam algorithm iscc applies a greedy algorithm to solve the data association sequence and could ensure the consistency of the global map 3 graph construction in the pose graph shown in fig 4 denotes the vehicle position and represent the loop closure weak data association and odometer constraint respectively odometer constraint is provided by reference navigation system such as dr and loop closure detection and weak data association construction are described in the following 3 1 loop closure detection when the length r and echo angle β of a beam is provided by bathymetry system combined with the navigation information x x y z ϕ θ ψ where x y z are the position in east north and vertical axes in geodetic coordinate system and ϕ θ ψ denote the corresponding rotation the corresponding measured point location x m y m z m in geodetic coordinate system could be calculated as 1 x m y m z m 1 r 0 r sin β r cos β 1 where r cos θ cos ψ sin ϕ sin θ sin ψ cos ϕ sin ψ sin θ cos ψ sin ϕ cos θ sin ψ x cos θ sin ψ sin ϕ sin θ cos ψ cos ϕ cos ψ sin θ sin ψ sin ϕ cos θ cos ψ y sin θ cos ψ sin ϕ cos θ cos ψ z 0 0 0 1 due to the measurement error of bathymetry system the noise would affect the bathymetric data and some outliers would be produced for example the outermost beams of multi beam sonar always produce more errors than the others to deal with this problem the automatic processing algorithm proposed by chen 2016 is applied to detect the outliers of bathymetric data in the process of bathymetric data acquisition this algorithm uses the alpha shapes model to detect the outliers in 2d swaths efficiently and its viability and accuracy have been proved with both flat and complex topography using the locations of measured points the bathymetric map is constructed considering the time consuming problem palomer 2016 proposed to divide bathymetric map into various submaps according to the submap length in this paper submaps are constructed in one global frame instead of various local frames because locations of all measured points have been transformed to the geodetic coordinate system when a new submap have been constructed loop closures between the new submap and all historical ones are detected using the template matching approach in this approach mean squared deviation msd operator is applied as a numeric measure of the submap similarity considering the influence of tide the msd operator with two submaps of size m n could be expressed as 2 m s d 1 m n i 1 m j 1 n h i j 1 h 1 h i j 2 h 2 2 where h i j 1 and h i j 2 denote depths at point i j of submaps 1 and 2 and h 1 and h 2 represent the average depths of corresponding submaps respectively if the minimum msd value is smaller than threshold this two submaps are considered overlapping and the corresponding loop closure would be detected now the measurement function of loop closures would be discussed as shown in fig 5 submap 1 overlaps with submap 5 in the green area and the center of overlapping area is z i j with the zero mean uncorrelated gaussian measurement error w predicted z i j and measured z i j locations of z i j could be represented as 3 z i j x j l j 4 z i j x i l i w where x i or x j is the closest vehicle states to z i j or z i j and l i or l j denotes the vector between them apply δ to denote the relative pose between x i and x j the measurement function at x j is 5 x i x j l j l i δ w if dr offsets δ x i and δ x j are applied to replace x i and x j equation 5 could be represented as 6 δ x i δ x j δ w in addition only east and north location errors would be taken into consideration in terrain matching process owing to a although systematic errors of attitude and heading would also influence bathymetric data these impacts are always negligible in terrain aided navigation tan because fiber optic gyrocompass fog is much more accurate the measurement error of fog used in this paper is less than 0 1 than odometer zhao et al 2015 hagen and ånonsen 2014 b both pressure senor and altimeter could provide accurate measurements to estimate vehicle depth with error less than 0 01 operation depth 3 2 weak data association to estimate inter frame motions the weak data association is built within the bslam the weak data association is the likelihood that the measurement matches the priori estimation and this could be calculated by the comparison of the measurement depths and a priori estimation barkby et al 2009 applied the gauss process gp regression to estimate the priori depths according to the historical bathymetric data and both the mean values and beliefs of the target depths could be gained however gp regression is quite time consuming and this limits its calculation efficiency this paper introduces spgp regression to deal with this problem spgp regression was originally proposed by snelson and ghahramani 2006 and this algorithm takes m where m is much smaller than n pseudo inputs instead of n real inputs as the training samples to reduce the computation suppose there are n measurement points in historical bathymetric data d f d d 1 d 2 d n d i x i y i f f 1 f 2 f n where x i y i and f i denote the point locations in east north and vertical axes in geodetic coordinate system the target depth at x y could be represented as f and the standard gaussian covariance κ is 7 κ x i y i x j y j a e 1 2 b x i x j 2 c y i y j 2 σ n 2 δ x i y i x j y j θ a b c σ n θ denotes the hyperparameter where a controls the typical amplitude b and c decide the typical lengthscale of variation σ n 2 is the covariance of measurement noise for the bathymetric data and δ d i d j represents the kronecker delta 8 δ d i d j 0 i j 1 i j different from gp regression spgp regression takes m pseudo inputs d ˆ d ˆ 1 d ˆ 2 d ˆ m and corresponding targets f ˆ instead of all n points to parameterize spgp model and both pseudo inputs pseudo targets and hyperparameter θ would be obtained by maximize the marginal likelihood 9 p f d d ˆ θ ν f 0 k n m k m 1 k m n λ σ n 2 i n in which λ d i a g λ λ i k i i k i t k m 1 k i i n is a unit matrix of size n n kernel matrix k i i k d i d i k m i j k d ˆ i d ˆ j k n m i j k d i d ˆ j and kernel vector k i j k d ˆ j d i where i 1 n and j 1 m the maximization of marginal likelihood is an optimization task and it could be solved by conjugate gradient cg techniques or gauss newton methods to calculation the distribution of the target depth by derive a sparse model with pseudo inputs snelson and ghahramani 2006 calculated the posterior distribution over pseudo targets using bayes rule and applied it to integrate the likelihood 10 p f x y d ˆ f ˆ ν f k n m k m 1 f ˆ λ σ n 2 i n the distribution of the target depth at point x y could be obtained 11 p f x y x y θ ν f z i σ 2 12 z i k t q m 1 k m n λ σ n 2 i n 1 f 13 σ 2 k k t k m 1 q m 1 k σ n 2 where 14 q m 1 k m k m n λ σ n 2 i n 1 k n m then the weak data association between time i 1 and i could be expressed as 15 l i k e l i h o o d p z i z i j 1 n 1 2 π σ e 2 σ j 2 exp 1 2 σ e 2 σ j 2 z i j z i j 2 where z i and z i denote the measurement and estimation of depths at time i σ e 2 is the covariance matrix of measurement noise z i j and z i j represent the measured and predicted depth of j th measurement point at time i and σ j 2 describes the covariance matrix of z i j to compare the estimation results of gp and spgp regressions simulation experiments were conducted using matlab with a simulation computer configuration of 8 gb memory and an i5 6300hq 2 3 hz processor for each experiment samples were obtained from the bathymetric data in sea trials experiment with 20 pings and swath width of 70 m the distance between adjacent points in one ping was 0 5 m we trained gp and spgp with 20 pseudo inputs model based on samples and estimated terrain depths of 140 measuring points as shown in figs 6 and 7 100 terrain depth estimation experiments were conducted the average time consumed in gp regression is 2 616s and the mean estimation error is 0 0709 m as for spgp regression the corresponding values are 4 68 10 4 s and 0 0690 m respectively both gp and spgp regressions could estimate terrain depths accurately but spgp is more efficient the ability of spgp regression to estimate terrain depth have been verified and its performance in local trajectory optimization would be discussed in section 5 4 graph optimization 4 1 global trajectory optimization vehicle states with loop closures are defined as key states in our previous study ma et al 2017 the state transfer function for key states was represented as 16 δ x i k e y a i δ x i 1 k e y 1 a i δ x i 1 k e y v where δ x i k e y is the dr offset of key state x i k e y at time i and v denotes the zero mean uncorrelated gaussian motion disturbances with covariance λ combined with weak data association p x i 1 x i a i could be obtained as 17 a i 1 p x k x k 1 x k x i 1 k e y x i k e y 1 p x k x k 1 x k x i 1 k e y x i 1 k e y in which 1 p x k x k 1 x k x i 1 k e y x i 1 k e y is the sum of 1 p x k x k 1 for vehicle states between key states x i 1 k e y and x i 1 k e y by minimizing measurement error w and motion disturbances v global trajectory optimization corrects the dr offsets of all key states combined the measurement and state transfer functions which are shown in equations 6 and 16 the global trajectory optimization is to solve 18 δ x k e y arg min i 1 m a i δ x i 1 k e y 1 a i δ x i 1 k e y δ x i k e y λ i 2 j 1 n δ x j 1 k e y δ x j 2 k e y δ j γ j 2 where δ x k e y is the modified dr offset of key state δ x i k e y denotes the dr offset of key state at time i δ x j 1 k e y and δ x j 2 k e y are two key states associated with the relative pose δ j and δ j is obtained by terrain matching techniques λ and γ are covariance matrix of motion disturbances and measurement error then collecting coefficient of δ x k e y into a large but sparse measurement matrix a r 2 m n 2 n and collecting the vectors δ into the bottom of b r n according to kaess et al 2008 equation 18 could be transformed into 19 δ x k e y arg min a δ x k e y b by eliminate the covariance matrix λ and γ hence the following normal equation is used to solve equation 19 20 δ x k e y a t a 1 a t b however the covariance γ of measurement error is still difficult to calculated because it is influenced by many factors such as bathymetry system marine environment and underwater terrain but it is possible to estimate the lower bound of γ by calculating its cramer rao lower bound crlb at time i the observation of bathymetry system is 21 h i h x i r i where h i and h x i denote the measurement and predicted depths with vehicle state x i at time i r i is the observation error with distribution of ν 0 c e and c e σ e 2 i nygren 2005 with n matching points the likelihood function is 22 p h i x i 1 2 π σ e 2 n 2 exp 1 2 σ e 2 j 1 n h i j h j x i 2 and the fisher information j could be calculated as 23 j e 2 ln p h i x i 2 x i 1 σ e 2 j 1 n h j x i x i 2 thus 24 j 1 σ e 2 j 1 n h j x i x i 2 j 1 n h j x i x i h j x i y i j 1 n h j x i x i h j x i y i j 1 n h j x i y i 2 in which h i j and h j x i represent the measurement and predicted depths of measurement point j of time i according to the fisher information the crbl of γ could be obtained as 25 c r b l 1 j 4 2 local trajectory optimization after obtaining the global optimization results all vehicle states between each two adjacent key states are represented as a local trajectory in our previous paper a terrain correlation correcting method tccm was proposed to solve this problem li et al 2017 if key states x i 1 k e y and x i k e y could be denoted as x k and x k m the modified dr offset δ x k j could be calculated as follows 26 δ x k j δ x k i k k j a i i k k m a i δ x k m δ x k 4 3 robust method in bslam the invalid loop closures would be provided by terrain matching technique because bathymetric data would be influenced by vehicle poses reverberation and other environmental characteristics in the marine environment if the invalid loop closures couldn t be identified for a long time the effectiveness of bslam algorithm will be significantly affected in addition in template terrain matching approach the msd threshold usually needs to be set as small as possible in order to ensure the accuracy of loop closures however small msd threshold means fewer closures could be detected and this would reduce the graph optimization effect if all invalid loop closures could be identified in time bigger msd threshold value could be chosen this would increase the number of loop closures and the effectiveness of optimization would also be improved so it s necessary to apply the robust method for invalid closure identification as for the odometer constraints because the odometer error in a short time interval is small odometer constraints are assumed to be valid in most of researches latif et al 2012 graham et al 2015 lee et al 2013 and weak data association has little impact on global trajectory optimization so only invalid closures would be considered in this section the straight forward way to test the existence of invalid loop closures is applying the consistency χ 2 test to the weighted sum of the measurement residuals suppose the pose graph includes m vehicle states and n loop closures owing to the low belief of weak data association the consistency function could be represented as 27 χ 2 χ o 2 χ l 2 where consistency functions χ o 2 and χ l 2 for odometer constraint and loop closure are 28 χ o 2 i 1 m δ x i 1 δ x i λ i 2 29 χ l 2 j 1 n δ x j 1 k e y δ x j 2 k e y δ j γ j 2 in which δ x i 1 denotes the modified dr offset of vehicle state at time i 1 δ x j 1 k e y and δ x j 2 k e y is the modified value of two key states associated with the relative pos δ j according to the consistency test the multi window consistency method mcm is presented to find out the largest subset of loop closures that construct a consistent bathymetric map through an iterative approach in mcm the pose graph is optimized using global and local optimizations and the multi window and check algorithms are proposed to deal with the local inconsistency and false recognition of closures in mcm respectively they would be discussed in the following but their advantages would be explained in section 5 according to experiment results 4 3 1 multi window in each iteration the traditional global consistency methods such as rrr or iscc move the loop closure that contributes most to whole map inconsistency to reject a set stores all closures that are defined as invalid in other words without this removed loop closure the global inconsistency would be minimal however as shown in fig 8 a this kind of approach couldn t deal with local inconsistent areas for a long time if the local consistency contributes less to the global consistency that is to say if the invalid closure has a little impact on the global consistency these methods wouldn t move it though it causes the local inconsistency in this case the multi window method is proposed to identify and solve local inconsistency in mcm some windows which represent local inconsistent areas would be identified and the sample of one window is shown in fig 8 b this algorithm would determine if local inconsistency should be corrected priority and this result would decide whether our goal in this iteration is to minimize global inconsistency or the local inconsistency in these windows the corresponding algorithm is shown in the following image image 4 3 2 retrieve influence by some invalid loop closures that cannot be identified in a timely manner some of valid closures would be wrongly moved into reject as more and more valid closures are wrongly identified the value of χ 2 would become larger rather than smaller when the increase of χ 2 is detected retrieve algorithm would add loop closures from reject to current pose graph one by one and run consistency test to the graph only closures pass this test would be moved into pose graph this algorithm terminates when χ 2 becomes larger after one iteration image 4 3 3 multi window consistency method the mcm is an iterative approach and the closure with largest global or local with multi window algorithm inconsistency would be moved to reject in each iterative once the increase of inconsistency is detected the retrieve algorithm would recall some closures from reject when the variance ξ 2 of χ 2 is lower than the threshold mcm would output the final pose graph in addition pose graph would be constantly optimized in mcm using global and local trajectory optimizations the global optimization process is time consuming and this make it difficult to ensure the efficiency of computation however in bslam the analytical solution of all key states could be obtained as 30 δ x k e y a t a 1 a t b in the pose graph if all key states are retained and only loop closures are removed make a t a and b t b t d i a g 1 1 1 1 1 t i i 0 the analytical solution is 31 δ x k e y a t t t t a 1 a t t t t b a t t a 1 a t t b mcm algorithm is shown in the following image 5 playback experiments to test the algorithm using bathymetry system and navigation data a simulation framework was created in matlab to read time stamped historical bathymetric and navigation data log files and this framework generates sequences of input data messages for the auv robust bslam algorithm as shown in fig 9 to obtain bathymetric and navigation data the sea trial experiment was conducted around zhongsha jiao in qingdao china in this experiment a gs wide swath bathymetry system was installed beneath the ship this bathymetry system provided bathymetric data with swath length of 70 m and 140 measurement points and it was aided by a sonar altimeter provided depth gauge data and the mini svs provided acoustic velocity data from valeport company the observations of heading pitch and roll were received from a fog that delivered 0 1 degree accuracy and the vehicle position in x and y axis was supplied by the gps with a positioning accuracy rtk of 20 cm cep the on board collected data includes 8 km planned track recorded at the speed of 4 knots with length of 3613s after processing experimental data was used to update the vehicle states and measurements with a frequency of 1 hz the dr data x d r is simulated using gps data x g p s along with white noise and dr error was about 7 of trajectory length firstly to compare the performances of gp and spgp regressions in the local trajectory optimization process various local trajectories between two key states start and end points were extracted in dr trajectory to conduct the simulation experiments in each experiment the modified dr offsets of two key states were calculated using dr and gps data instead of global trajectory optimization for simplicity and the local trajectory optimization results and average registration errors were calculated according to equation 26 it should be noted the average registration error describes the accuracy of navigation results and registration error for each measured point could be calculated as 32 e i x s l a m i x g p s i 2 y s l a m i y g p s i 2 where x g p s i and y g p s i are the truth locations for measured point i x s l a m i and y s l a m i define the point positions corrected using bslam result the experiment results are shown in table 1 according to table 1 compared with gp regression spgp could provide local trajectory optimization results with similar or even smaller average registration errors in less time spgp model is modelled by pseudo inputs instead of all bathymetric data so the outliers in bathymetric data might have less or no influence over the estimation results and this causes spgp behave better than gp regression according to the experiment results spgp proves more suitable for local trajectory optimization in bslam using the whole dr trajectory recorded in the sea trail experiment mcm and rrr were applied as robust method in bslam respectively to conduct the experiments 1 to 5 for comparing the effects of these two methods in simulation experiments the msd threshold is set to 0 03 0 04 0 05 0 06 and 0 08 m in the terrain matching approach respectively the experiment results are shown in table 2 as the increment of msd threshold 0 04 0 08 from experiments 1 to 5 more invalid closures are detected and they account for 52 55 of all loop closures in experiment 5 when msd threshold is no more than 0 08 similar iterations and registration errors could be obtained using mcm or rrr with msd threshold of 0 08 mcm could provide better results with less iterations and reduce the registration error by 17 45 compared to rrr here we made an assumption that mcm behaves better than rrr with a great number of invalid loop closures and to prove this assumption the corresponding simulation experiments were conducted in experiments 6 to 11 the dr error was set to 16 of trajectory length to obtain much more invalid closures and the msd threshold varied from 0 03 to 0 08 the experiment results shown in table 3 verify our assumption mcm provides much better results than rrr in most cases and it could reduce the registration error by 11 87 21 33 and 17 59 compared with rrr when invalid closures account for 71 01 71 63 and 73 33 of total closures respectively to explore why mcm behaves better than rrr precision and recall values are introduced latif et al 2014 precision and recall values are widely applied in robust back end methods and they represent the fraction of valid loop closures included in final graph and the fraction of total valid closures that is included in the final graph respectively the precision and recall results of experiments 1 to 11 are shown in fig 10 the precision values of mcm and rrr are both 100 but their recall values are different in some cases more especially when more invalid closures were detected for example in experiments 9 10 and 11 the recall values of rrr are obviously smaller than mcm and this leads a greater registration error of rrr the reasons would be discussed in the following on the one hand as shown in tables 2 and 3 compared with other slam methods such as visual slam much fewer loop closures could be detected in bslam and invalid closures still account for a large proportion this causes only invalid closures would be detected in some areas even more unfortunately these invalid closures might only cause local inconsistency and have small effect on global consistency so it is hard to identify these invalid closures on the other hand influence by these invalid loop closures which couldn t be identified in time some valid closures would be wrongly moved into reject in both rrr and mcm therefore the main way to increase recall value is to identify the above invalid closures and retrieve the removed valid one for the first problem multi window method is applied in the mcm to identify the invalid closures which causes local inconsistency for the second one although rrr could also retrieve the removed loop closures by the second optimization process the invalid closures which couldn t be identified in time in the first process would even cause a greater impact on the second optimization results because all valid closures identified in the first process would be removed and the invalid closures would account for a larger proportion in mcm the removed closures are retrieved of by retrieve process retrieve would find the closures that are consistence with the current pose graph from reject by adding the removed closures to current graph one by one so this process wouldn t be influenced by other removed closures on the basic of the above two reasons mcm could provide bigger recall values rrr is a state of art robust method but in bslam mcm would work better especially when a great number of invalid loop closures is presented to illustrate the effect of the bslam algorithm with mcm the bathymetric map and registration errors of experiments 3 and 7 are shown in fig 11 the average registration errors in experiment 3 produced by bslam and dr are 5 750 and 31 734 m and the final location errors vehicle location error after finishing whole bathymetric map construction are 6 389 and 67 044 m respectively the corresponding values in experiment 7 are 9 202 72 620 2 269 and 137 570 m in experiments 3 and 7 compared with dr results the bslam algorithm with mcm reduces the average registration errors by 81 88 and 87 33 and it reduces final location errors by 90 470 and 98 350 the experiment results show the bslam algorithm with mcm could provide valid mapping and navigation results with various levels of dr navigation precisions finally to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm in different environments simulation experiments 12 and 13 were conducted the terrain maps shown in fig 12 are obtained from the website www ibcao org combined with the navigation data in experiment 1 bathymetric data is simulated by intersection line in vega software li et al 2017 and the msd threshold is set to 0 07 in these experiments the experiment results are shown in table 4 and fig 13 in experiment 12 after 99 iterations mcm could identify 87 93 of total valid loop closures when valid closures account for 46 79 of total closures as for the experiment 13 after 78 iterations the corresponding values are 88 24 and 53 68 in experiments 12 and 13 there is no invalid closures in the final pose graphs and the bslam average registration errors are 7 345 and 7 596 m respectively which are 77 36 and 76 58 less than dr registration errors according to the experiment results the viability accuracy and robust performance of the robust bslam algorithm are verified in several different environments 6 conclusions in this paper an auv robust bslam method is proposed and the simulation experiments have been conducted with on board collected data including 8 km planned track recorded at the speed of 4 knots in qingdao china the following conclusions could be obtained 1 spgp regression could provide estimation terrain depths more efficiently than gp regression with similar precision and spgp is more suitable for local trajectory optimization according to

23126,bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping bslam technique could provide long term underwater navigation results for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and produce a self consistent bathymetric map simultaneously however the inter frame motion inside bslam is still difficult to estimate and bslam might fail catastrophically with invalid loop closures caused by the measurement errors of vehicle states and bathymetric data to deal with these problems an auv robust bslam algorithm is proposed based on graph slam in this algorithm weak data association is constructed via sparse pseudo input gaussian process spgp regression to predict inter frame motion and a multi window consistency method mcm is introduced to identify invalid loop closures various simulation experiments are conducted under different environments comparisons are made between more standard approaches and our proposed algorithm is shown to be viable accurate and could robustly handle invalid loop closures keywords navigation bslam robust spgp consistency method 1 introduction with the increasing demand of marine exploration and the development of seabed topographic mapping methods such as the bathymetry system a significant amount of work has been done to produce high resolution maps of the seabed doble et al 2009 however because the map resolution for ship borne bathymetry system is proportional to the water depths they could not meet the requirements of high resolution mapping in deep waters due to their ability to operate closely to the seafloor regardless of depth autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have become important mapping platforms for topography missions and geological surveys such as searching for manganese nodules hydrothermal vents and remains of vessels the accuracy of bathymetric map depends on the accuracy of navigation on the auv the global positioning system gps dead reckoning dr ultrashort baseline usbl and long baseline lbl acoustic positioning systems all provides options for improving navigational accuracy with various levels of attainable precision paull et al 2014 tan et al 2011 gps observations could provide accurate locations but this requires the auv to surface the dr navigation error is related to the total distance traveled which means it is unsuitable to a long term underwater navigation scenario without other precise auxiliary means of positioning although usbl and lbl could provide bounded navigation error support vessels or acoustic array are necessary and this would limit the operating range as a more recently developed approach to provide accurate navigation solution for auvs without any aids simultaneous localization and mapping slam technique is introduced slam technique makes it possible for a vehicle to incrementally build a map with consistency of an unknown environment while simultaneously determining its location within this map durrant whyte and bailey 2006 at present many breakthroughs of slam technique have been made in unmanned ground vehicles ugvs ila et al 2017 nieto et al 2007 dellaert and kaess 2006 and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs kownacki 2016 underwater slam algorithms for auvs have also been developed and most of them are applied using a camera kim and eustice 2013 and forward looking sonar mallios et al 2014 ribas et al 2008 ozog et al 2016 proposed the long term underwater visual slam algorithm this algorithm applies generic linear constraints to reduce nodes in the factor graph for building a lifelong map for cases when the navigation system is not reliable and the sensor cannot perform continuous observations elibol et al 2016 presented a seabed topographic mapping approach for trajectories with gaps this approach produced solutions for low cost underwater optical mapping missions using the extended kalman filter ekf slam meanwhile many researches about forward looking sonar slam have been carried out some of them are based on an abandoned marina dataset and their viability and accuracy have also been verified burguera et al 2010 mallios et al 2014 however the use of camera is limited to applications in which the vehicle navigates in clear water and very near to the seafloor ribas et al 2008 and the slam technique with forward looking sonar cannot be applied in unstructured environments compared with the techniques listed above bathymetric slam bslam is more flexible and has little restrictions on water clarity and environment however some difficulties have still limited the application of bslam see figs 1 and 2 as shown in fig 3 obvious overlap of the bathymetric data couldn t be obtained at adjacent time periods and this make it difficult to measure the inter frame motion loop closures detected by terrain matching techniques have a great impact on navigation results navigation results for vehicles are inaccurate if the invalid loop closures cannot be identified to overcome these difficulties the robust bslam algorithm which consists of graph construction and optimization is proposed based on graph method in graph construction to estimate the inter frame motion this paper constructs weak data association by comparing the prior and measurement depths where the prior depths are estimated by sparse pseudo input gaussian process spgp regression as for the graph optimization using global and local trajectory optimizations as graph updating approaches the multi window consistency method mcm is proposed to identify the invalid loop closures by an iterative approach with on board collected data the playback experiments were conducted to show both spgp and mcm are more efficient and accurate than the state of art approaches and the viability accuracy and robust performance of the robust bslam algorithm are also verified the rest of paper is organized as follows a description of the related works is put forward in section 2 the graph construction algorithm and graph optimization algorithm are proposed in sections 3 and 4 respectively and the playback experiments and their results are discussed in section 5 finally the conclusions of this study are drawn in section 6 2 related works bslam have lately received great attention barkby et al 2012 proposed a bathymetric particle filter slam bpslam to help locate the vehicle position in real time without the loop closure detection this algorithm applied gaussian process and rao blackwellized particle filter to solve slam solutions and an ancestry tree was used to reduced computation but regrettably the computational efficiency of the bpslam still limits its real time performance palomer et al 2013 proposed the submap division approach in the bslam to deal with the time consuming problem of loop closure detection this approach applied an octree structure to optimize the point cloud data obtained from the bathymetry system and represented the amount of information contained in the map by calculating the different of normals don stuckey 2012 represented the dynamic model of auvs via hydrodynamic coefficients he applied this method in the ekf slam framework and verified its validity in a simulation experiment as for the robust slam algorithm sunderhauf and protzel 2012 introduced the switch variable and penalty function into objective function to optimize the reliability of data association this algorithm works well but is time consuming on the basic of this algorithm dynamic covariance scaling dcs approach was proposed by agarwal et al 2013 in dcs switch variable is calculated directly and removed from the entire optimization process to reduce computation and agarwal et al 2014 also presented an optimization method with a poor initial value based on dcs this method is mainly focused on a solution for local consistency and the global consistency couldn t be guaranteed all the above algorithms run the optimization algorithm and association identification simultaneously to identify the data association the different kind of methods is the global consistency method and this method finds out the largest subset of data association that construct a consistent map through an iterative approach latif et al 2012 proposed a novel consistency based approach which is called realizing reversing recovering rrr this approach divides loop closures into clusters based on topological similarity and then tries to find the valid closures by consistency test carlone et al 2014 proposed to select all coherent measurements instead of distinguishing outliers in the optimization process and this method represents the constraints of each non odometer data association by the big m trick graham et al 2015 put forward the consistency checking iscc approach applied in incremental slam algorithm iscc applies a greedy algorithm to solve the data association sequence and could ensure the consistency of the global map 3 graph construction in the pose graph shown in fig 4 denotes the vehicle position and represent the loop closure weak data association and odometer constraint respectively odometer constraint is provided by reference navigation system such as dr and loop closure detection and weak data association construction are described in the following 3 1 loop closure detection when the length r and echo angle β of a beam is provided by bathymetry system combined with the navigation information x x y z ϕ θ ψ where x y z are the position in east north and vertical axes in geodetic coordinate system and ϕ θ ψ denote the corresponding rotation the corresponding measured point location x m y m z m in geodetic coordinate system could be calculated as 1 x m y m z m 1 r 0 r sin β r cos β 1 where r cos θ cos ψ sin ϕ sin θ sin ψ cos ϕ sin ψ sin θ cos ψ sin ϕ cos θ sin ψ x cos θ sin ψ sin ϕ sin θ cos ψ cos ϕ cos ψ sin θ sin ψ sin ϕ cos θ cos ψ y sin θ cos ψ sin ϕ cos θ cos ψ z 0 0 0 1 due to the measurement error of bathymetry system the noise would affect the bathymetric data and some outliers would be produced for example the outermost beams of multi beam sonar always produce more errors than the others to deal with this problem the automatic processing algorithm proposed by chen 2016 is applied to detect the outliers of bathymetric data in the process of bathymetric data acquisition this algorithm uses the alpha shapes model to detect the outliers in 2d swaths efficiently and its viability and accuracy have been proved with both flat and complex topography using the locations of measured points the bathymetric map is constructed considering the time consuming problem palomer 2016 proposed to divide bathymetric map into various submaps according to the submap length in this paper submaps are constructed in one global frame instead of various local frames because locations of all measured points have been transformed to the geodetic coordinate system when a new submap have been constructed loop closures between the new submap and all historical ones are detected using the template matching approach in this approach mean squared deviation msd operator is applied as a numeric measure of the submap similarity considering the influence of tide the msd operator with two submaps of size m n could be expressed as 2 m s d 1 m n i 1 m j 1 n h i j 1 h 1 h i j 2 h 2 2 where h i j 1 and h i j 2 denote depths at point i j of submaps 1 and 2 and h 1 and h 2 represent the average depths of corresponding submaps respectively if the minimum msd value is smaller than threshold this two submaps are considered overlapping and the corresponding loop closure would be detected now the measurement function of loop closures would be discussed as shown in fig 5 submap 1 overlaps with submap 5 in the green area and the center of overlapping area is z i j with the zero mean uncorrelated gaussian measurement error w predicted z i j and measured z i j locations of z i j could be represented as 3 z i j x j l j 4 z i j x i l i w where x i or x j is the closest vehicle states to z i j or z i j and l i or l j denotes the vector between them apply δ to denote the relative pose between x i and x j the measurement function at x j is 5 x i x j l j l i δ w if dr offsets δ x i and δ x j are applied to replace x i and x j equation 5 could be represented as 6 δ x i δ x j δ w in addition only east and north location errors would be taken into consideration in terrain matching process owing to a although systematic errors of attitude and heading would also influence bathymetric data these impacts are always negligible in terrain aided navigation tan because fiber optic gyrocompass fog is much more accurate the measurement error of fog used in this paper is less than 0 1 than odometer zhao et al 2015 hagen and ånonsen 2014 b both pressure senor and altimeter could provide accurate measurements to estimate vehicle depth with error less than 0 01 operation depth 3 2 weak data association to estimate inter frame motions the weak data association is built within the bslam the weak data association is the likelihood that the measurement matches the priori estimation and this could be calculated by the comparison of the measurement depths and a priori estimation barkby et al 2009 applied the gauss process gp regression to estimate the priori depths according to the historical bathymetric data and both the mean values and beliefs of the target depths could be gained however gp regression is quite time consuming and this limits its calculation efficiency this paper introduces spgp regression to deal with this problem spgp regression was originally proposed by snelson and ghahramani 2006 and this algorithm takes m where m is much smaller than n pseudo inputs instead of n real inputs as the training samples to reduce the computation suppose there are n measurement points in historical bathymetric data d f d d 1 d 2 d n d i x i y i f f 1 f 2 f n where x i y i and f i denote the point locations in east north and vertical axes in geodetic coordinate system the target depth at x y could be represented as f and the standard gaussian covariance κ is 7 κ x i y i x j y j a e 1 2 b x i x j 2 c y i y j 2 σ n 2 δ x i y i x j y j θ a b c σ n θ denotes the hyperparameter where a controls the typical amplitude b and c decide the typical lengthscale of variation σ n 2 is the covariance of measurement noise for the bathymetric data and δ d i d j represents the kronecker delta 8 δ d i d j 0 i j 1 i j different from gp regression spgp regression takes m pseudo inputs d ˆ d ˆ 1 d ˆ 2 d ˆ m and corresponding targets f ˆ instead of all n points to parameterize spgp model and both pseudo inputs pseudo targets and hyperparameter θ would be obtained by maximize the marginal likelihood 9 p f d d ˆ θ ν f 0 k n m k m 1 k m n λ σ n 2 i n in which λ d i a g λ λ i k i i k i t k m 1 k i i n is a unit matrix of size n n kernel matrix k i i k d i d i k m i j k d ˆ i d ˆ j k n m i j k d i d ˆ j and kernel vector k i j k d ˆ j d i where i 1 n and j 1 m the maximization of marginal likelihood is an optimization task and it could be solved by conjugate gradient cg techniques or gauss newton methods to calculation the distribution of the target depth by derive a sparse model with pseudo inputs snelson and ghahramani 2006 calculated the posterior distribution over pseudo targets using bayes rule and applied it to integrate the likelihood 10 p f x y d ˆ f ˆ ν f k n m k m 1 f ˆ λ σ n 2 i n the distribution of the target depth at point x y could be obtained 11 p f x y x y θ ν f z i σ 2 12 z i k t q m 1 k m n λ σ n 2 i n 1 f 13 σ 2 k k t k m 1 q m 1 k σ n 2 where 14 q m 1 k m k m n λ σ n 2 i n 1 k n m then the weak data association between time i 1 and i could be expressed as 15 l i k e l i h o o d p z i z i j 1 n 1 2 π σ e 2 σ j 2 exp 1 2 σ e 2 σ j 2 z i j z i j 2 where z i and z i denote the measurement and estimation of depths at time i σ e 2 is the covariance matrix of measurement noise z i j and z i j represent the measured and predicted depth of j th measurement point at time i and σ j 2 describes the covariance matrix of z i j to compare the estimation results of gp and spgp regressions simulation experiments were conducted using matlab with a simulation computer configuration of 8 gb memory and an i5 6300hq 2 3 hz processor for each experiment samples were obtained from the bathymetric data in sea trials experiment with 20 pings and swath width of 70 m the distance between adjacent points in one ping was 0 5 m we trained gp and spgp with 20 pseudo inputs model based on samples and estimated terrain depths of 140 measuring points as shown in figs 6 and 7 100 terrain depth estimation experiments were conducted the average time consumed in gp regression is 2 616s and the mean estimation error is 0 0709 m as for spgp regression the corresponding values are 4 68 10 4 s and 0 0690 m respectively both gp and spgp regressions could estimate terrain depths accurately but spgp is more efficient the ability of spgp regression to estimate terrain depth have been verified and its performance in local trajectory optimization would be discussed in section 5 4 graph optimization 4 1 global trajectory optimization vehicle states with loop closures are defined as key states in our previous study ma et al 2017 the state transfer function for key states was represented as 16 δ x i k e y a i δ x i 1 k e y 1 a i δ x i 1 k e y v where δ x i k e y is the dr offset of key state x i k e y at time i and v denotes the zero mean uncorrelated gaussian motion disturbances with covariance λ combined with weak data association p x i 1 x i a i could be obtained as 17 a i 1 p x k x k 1 x k x i 1 k e y x i k e y 1 p x k x k 1 x k x i 1 k e y x i 1 k e y in which 1 p x k x k 1 x k x i 1 k e y x i 1 k e y is the sum of 1 p x k x k 1 for vehicle states between key states x i 1 k e y and x i 1 k e y by minimizing measurement error w and motion disturbances v global trajectory optimization corrects the dr offsets of all key states combined the measurement and state transfer functions which are shown in equations 6 and 16 the global trajectory optimization is to solve 18 δ x k e y arg min i 1 m a i δ x i 1 k e y 1 a i δ x i 1 k e y δ x i k e y λ i 2 j 1 n δ x j 1 k e y δ x j 2 k e y δ j γ j 2 where δ x k e y is the modified dr offset of key state δ x i k e y denotes the dr offset of key state at time i δ x j 1 k e y and δ x j 2 k e y are two key states associated with the relative pose δ j and δ j is obtained by terrain matching techniques λ and γ are covariance matrix of motion disturbances and measurement error then collecting coefficient of δ x k e y into a large but sparse measurement matrix a r 2 m n 2 n and collecting the vectors δ into the bottom of b r n according to kaess et al 2008 equation 18 could be transformed into 19 δ x k e y arg min a δ x k e y b by eliminate the covariance matrix λ and γ hence the following normal equation is used to solve equation 19 20 δ x k e y a t a 1 a t b however the covariance γ of measurement error is still difficult to calculated because it is influenced by many factors such as bathymetry system marine environment and underwater terrain but it is possible to estimate the lower bound of γ by calculating its cramer rao lower bound crlb at time i the observation of bathymetry system is 21 h i h x i r i where h i and h x i denote the measurement and predicted depths with vehicle state x i at time i r i is the observation error with distribution of ν 0 c e and c e σ e 2 i nygren 2005 with n matching points the likelihood function is 22 p h i x i 1 2 π σ e 2 n 2 exp 1 2 σ e 2 j 1 n h i j h j x i 2 and the fisher information j could be calculated as 23 j e 2 ln p h i x i 2 x i 1 σ e 2 j 1 n h j x i x i 2 thus 24 j 1 σ e 2 j 1 n h j x i x i 2 j 1 n h j x i x i h j x i y i j 1 n h j x i x i h j x i y i j 1 n h j x i y i 2 in which h i j and h j x i represent the measurement and predicted depths of measurement point j of time i according to the fisher information the crbl of γ could be obtained as 25 c r b l 1 j 4 2 local trajectory optimization after obtaining the global optimization results all vehicle states between each two adjacent key states are represented as a local trajectory in our previous paper a terrain correlation correcting method tccm was proposed to solve this problem li et al 2017 if key states x i 1 k e y and x i k e y could be denoted as x k and x k m the modified dr offset δ x k j could be calculated as follows 26 δ x k j δ x k i k k j a i i k k m a i δ x k m δ x k 4 3 robust method in bslam the invalid loop closures would be provided by terrain matching technique because bathymetric data would be influenced by vehicle poses reverberation and other environmental characteristics in the marine environment if the invalid loop closures couldn t be identified for a long time the effectiveness of bslam algorithm will be significantly affected in addition in template terrain matching approach the msd threshold usually needs to be set as small as possible in order to ensure the accuracy of loop closures however small msd threshold means fewer closures could be detected and this would reduce the graph optimization effect if all invalid loop closures could be identified in time bigger msd threshold value could be chosen this would increase the number of loop closures and the effectiveness of optimization would also be improved so it s necessary to apply the robust method for invalid closure identification as for the odometer constraints because the odometer error in a short time interval is small odometer constraints are assumed to be valid in most of researches latif et al 2012 graham et al 2015 lee et al 2013 and weak data association has little impact on global trajectory optimization so only invalid closures would be considered in this section the straight forward way to test the existence of invalid loop closures is applying the consistency χ 2 test to the weighted sum of the measurement residuals suppose the pose graph includes m vehicle states and n loop closures owing to the low belief of weak data association the consistency function could be represented as 27 χ 2 χ o 2 χ l 2 where consistency functions χ o 2 and χ l 2 for odometer constraint and loop closure are 28 χ o 2 i 1 m δ x i 1 δ x i λ i 2 29 χ l 2 j 1 n δ x j 1 k e y δ x j 2 k e y δ j γ j 2 in which δ x i 1 denotes the modified dr offset of vehicle state at time i 1 δ x j 1 k e y and δ x j 2 k e y is the modified value of two key states associated with the relative pos δ j according to the consistency test the multi window consistency method mcm is presented to find out the largest subset of loop closures that construct a consistent bathymetric map through an iterative approach in mcm the pose graph is optimized using global and local optimizations and the multi window and check algorithms are proposed to deal with the local inconsistency and false recognition of closures in mcm respectively they would be discussed in the following but their advantages would be explained in section 5 according to experiment results 4 3 1 multi window in each iteration the traditional global consistency methods such as rrr or iscc move the loop closure that contributes most to whole map inconsistency to reject a set stores all closures that are defined as invalid in other words without this removed loop closure the global inconsistency would be minimal however as shown in fig 8 a this kind of approach couldn t deal with local inconsistent areas for a long time if the local consistency contributes less to the global consistency that is to say if the invalid closure has a little impact on the global consistency these methods wouldn t move it though it causes the local inconsistency in this case the multi window method is proposed to identify and solve local inconsistency in mcm some windows which represent local inconsistent areas would be identified and the sample of one window is shown in fig 8 b this algorithm would determine if local inconsistency should be corrected priority and this result would decide whether our goal in this iteration is to minimize global inconsistency or the local inconsistency in these windows the corresponding algorithm is shown in the following image image 4 3 2 retrieve influence by some invalid loop closures that cannot be identified in a timely manner some of valid closures would be wrongly moved into reject as more and more valid closures are wrongly identified the value of χ 2 would become larger rather than smaller when the increase of χ 2 is detected retrieve algorithm would add loop closures from reject to current pose graph one by one and run consistency test to the graph only closures pass this test would be moved into pose graph this algorithm terminates when χ 2 becomes larger after one iteration image 4 3 3 multi window consistency method the mcm is an iterative approach and the closure with largest global or local with multi window algorithm inconsistency would be moved to reject in each iterative once the increase of inconsistency is detected the retrieve algorithm would recall some closures from reject when the variance ξ 2 of χ 2 is lower than the threshold mcm would output the final pose graph in addition pose graph would be constantly optimized in mcm using global and local trajectory optimizations the global optimization process is time consuming and this make it difficult to ensure the efficiency of computation however in bslam the analytical solution of all key states could be obtained as 30 δ x k e y a t a 1 a t b in the pose graph if all key states are retained and only loop closures are removed make a t a and b t b t d i a g 1 1 1 1 1 t i i 0 the analytical solution is 31 δ x k e y a t t t t a 1 a t t t t b a t t a 1 a t t b mcm algorithm is shown in the following image 5 playback experiments to test the algorithm using bathymetry system and navigation data a simulation framework was created in matlab to read time stamped historical bathymetric and navigation data log files and this framework generates sequences of input data messages for the auv robust bslam algorithm as shown in fig 9 to obtain bathymetric and navigation data the sea trial experiment was conducted around zhongsha jiao in qingdao china in this experiment a gs wide swath bathymetry system was installed beneath the ship this bathymetry system provided bathymetric data with swath length of 70 m and 140 measurement points and it was aided by a sonar altimeter provided depth gauge data and the mini svs provided acoustic velocity data from valeport company the observations of heading pitch and roll were received from a fog that delivered 0 1 degree accuracy and the vehicle position in x and y axis was supplied by the gps with a positioning accuracy rtk of 20 cm cep the on board collected data includes 8 km planned track recorded at the speed of 4 knots with length of 3613s after processing experimental data was used to update the vehicle states and measurements with a frequency of 1 hz the dr data x d r is simulated using gps data x g p s along with white noise and dr error was about 7 of trajectory length firstly to compare the performances of gp and spgp regressions in the local trajectory optimization process various local trajectories between two key states start and end points were extracted in dr trajectory to conduct the simulation experiments in each experiment the modified dr offsets of two key states were calculated using dr and gps data instead of global trajectory optimization for simplicity and the local trajectory optimization results and average registration errors were calculated according to equation 26 it should be noted the average registration error describes the accuracy of navigation results and registration error for each measured point could be calculated as 32 e i x s l a m i x g p s i 2 y s l a m i y g p s i 2 where x g p s i and y g p s i are the truth locations for measured point i x s l a m i and y s l a m i define the point positions corrected using bslam result the experiment results are shown in table 1 according to table 1 compared with gp regression spgp could provide local trajectory optimization results with similar or even smaller average registration errors in less time spgp model is modelled by pseudo inputs instead of all bathymetric data so the outliers in bathymetric data might have less or no influence over the estimation results and this causes spgp behave better than gp regression according to the experiment results spgp proves more suitable for local trajectory optimization in bslam using the whole dr trajectory recorded in the sea trail experiment mcm and rrr were applied as robust method in bslam respectively to conduct the experiments 1 to 5 for comparing the effects of these two methods in simulation experiments the msd threshold is set to 0 03 0 04 0 05 0 06 and 0 08 m in the terrain matching approach respectively the experiment results are shown in table 2 as the increment of msd threshold 0 04 0 08 from experiments 1 to 5 more invalid closures are detected and they account for 52 55 of all loop closures in experiment 5 when msd threshold is no more than 0 08 similar iterations and registration errors could be obtained using mcm or rrr with msd threshold of 0 08 mcm could provide better results with less iterations and reduce the registration error by 17 45 compared to rrr here we made an assumption that mcm behaves better than rrr with a great number of invalid loop closures and to prove this assumption the corresponding simulation experiments were conducted in experiments 6 to 11 the dr error was set to 16 of trajectory length to obtain much more invalid closures and the msd threshold varied from 0 03 to 0 08 the experiment results shown in table 3 verify our assumption mcm provides much better results than rrr in most cases and it could reduce the registration error by 11 87 21 33 and 17 59 compared with rrr when invalid closures account for 71 01 71 63 and 73 33 of total closures respectively to explore why mcm behaves better than rrr precision and recall values are introduced latif et al 2014 precision and recall values are widely applied in robust back end methods and they represent the fraction of valid loop closures included in final graph and the fraction of total valid closures that is included in the final graph respectively the precision and recall results of experiments 1 to 11 are shown in fig 10 the precision values of mcm and rrr are both 100 but their recall values are different in some cases more especially when more invalid closures were detected for example in experiments 9 10 and 11 the recall values of rrr are obviously smaller than mcm and this leads a greater registration error of rrr the reasons would be discussed in the following on the one hand as shown in tables 2 and 3 compared with other slam methods such as visual slam much fewer loop closures could be detected in bslam and invalid closures still account for a large proportion this causes only invalid closures would be detected in some areas even more unfortunately these invalid closures might only cause local inconsistency and have small effect on global consistency so it is hard to identify these invalid closures on the other hand influence by these invalid loop closures which couldn t be identified in time some valid closures would be wrongly moved into reject in both rrr and mcm therefore the main way to increase recall value is to identify the above invalid closures and retrieve the removed valid one for the first problem multi window method is applied in the mcm to identify the invalid closures which causes local inconsistency for the second one although rrr could also retrieve the removed loop closures by the second optimization process the invalid closures which couldn t be identified in time in the first process would even cause a greater impact on the second optimization results because all valid closures identified in the first process would be removed and the invalid closures would account for a larger proportion in mcm the removed closures are retrieved of by retrieve process retrieve would find the closures that are consistence with the current pose graph from reject by adding the removed closures to current graph one by one so this process wouldn t be influenced by other removed closures on the basic of the above two reasons mcm could provide bigger recall values rrr is a state of art robust method but in bslam mcm would work better especially when a great number of invalid loop closures is presented to illustrate the effect of the bslam algorithm with mcm the bathymetric map and registration errors of experiments 3 and 7 are shown in fig 11 the average registration errors in experiment 3 produced by bslam and dr are 5 750 and 31 734 m and the final location errors vehicle location error after finishing whole bathymetric map construction are 6 389 and 67 044 m respectively the corresponding values in experiment 7 are 9 202 72 620 2 269 and 137 570 m in experiments 3 and 7 compared with dr results the bslam algorithm with mcm reduces the average registration errors by 81 88 and 87 33 and it reduces final location errors by 90 470 and 98 350 the experiment results show the bslam algorithm with mcm could provide valid mapping and navigation results with various levels of dr navigation precisions finally to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm in different environments simulation experiments 12 and 13 were conducted the terrain maps shown in fig 12 are obtained from the website www ibcao org combined with the navigation data in experiment 1 bathymetric data is simulated by intersection line in vega software li et al 2017 and the msd threshold is set to 0 07 in these experiments the experiment results are shown in table 4 and fig 13 in experiment 12 after 99 iterations mcm could identify 87 93 of total valid loop closures when valid closures account for 46 79 of total closures as for the experiment 13 after 78 iterations the corresponding values are 88 24 and 53 68 in experiments 12 and 13 there is no invalid closures in the final pose graphs and the bslam average registration errors are 7 345 and 7 596 m respectively which are 77 36 and 76 58 less than dr registration errors according to the experiment results the viability accuracy and robust performance of the robust bslam algorithm are verified in several different environments 6 conclusions in this paper an auv robust bslam method is proposed and the simulation experiments have been conducted with on board collected data including 8 km planned track recorded at the speed of 4 knots in qingdao china the following conclusions could be obtained 1 spgp regression could provide estimation terrain depths more efficiently than gp regression with similar precision and spgp is more suitable for local trajectory optimization according to

23127,the energy efficiency design index eedi introduced by the international maritime organization imo in 2011 had an admirable intent to improve energy efficiency for ships through a set of technical performance standards nowadays after several revisions regarding the eedi calculation it is still not clear whether this intent is or will be fulfilled segments of shipping particularly sensitive to these issues are passenger and ro ro passenger ships since many of them are promoted by their shipowners as eco friendly with the aim of attracting more tourists this is particularly true for ships with integrated power system ips however the fact is that it is not possible to discuss energy efficiency improvements without a valid methodology to evaluate it current methodology to calculate eedi is not applicable to ships with ips since it observes only one operating point and only a part of the ship power system this paper introduces a new methodology to evaluate energy efficiency of ro ro passenger ships with ips based on a holistic approach evaluates it for the current fleet of ro ro passenger ships and proposes options to further improve it for new ships keywords

efficiency management plan sfc specific fuel consumption wros world register of ships 1 introduction energy efficiency of any technical system can be considered in principle as a ratio of power input to the system and a useful work that is a direct consequence of this input application of this principle in marine power systems requires first the definition in which part of ship life cycle will the energy efficiency be analysed the second step includes the quantification of ship power system input and the useful work derived from it two basic levels for the analysis are design and operational level for the analysis on the design level the energy efficiency design index eedi is proposed after several studies mepc 2009a 2010 2011a wang 2010 aiming to determine the measures to reduce ghg emissions marine environment protection committee mepc adopted resolution 203 62 mepc 2011b which added a new chapter 4 to marpol annex vi named regulation for energy efficiency of ships this chapter requires that every ship of gt 400 and above engaged in international shipping has to have the international energy efficiency certificate iee certificate in order to obtain it the ship has to comply with the eedi requirements and to have ship energy efficiency management plan seemp onboard eedi is mandatory for ships engaged in international shipping since mepc 2009a concluded that the main source of co2 emission is the operation of these ships however eedi can be implemented also for domestic and or short sea shipping since pollution originated from these ships occurs mostly in and near ports and highly populated areas and is especially pernicious for public health runko luttenberger et al 2013 application of eedi to inland shipping is a separate issue which deserves appropriate attention karim and hasan 2017 simic 2014 eedi is a design measure to increase energy efficiency of ships and as such is applicable only to new ships for new ships the attained eedi has to be calculated according to mepc 2014 and not higher than the required eedi which is calculated from the eedi reference line value and the appropriate reduction factor the purpose of the eedi is to provide a fair basis for comparison to stimulate the development of more efficient ships in general and to establish the minimum efficiency of new ships depending on ship type and size as stated by mepc 2013 the eedi even though it is named as the energy efficiency index was actually developed by the mepc from the co 2 index which was defined as co2 emission from ship per ton and nautical mile of cargo transported only later was it renamed into the eedi but remained to be the measure of the relative co2 emission the energy efficiency and the co2 emissions are usually related but in some cases especially for power systems which do not use fossil fuels these two terms are completely different from literature overview presented below it can be concluded that the eedi in its present form does not present a valid measure of the ship s energy efficiency because it evaluates only a part of the ship power system and only in one operating point which might never be met in real ship operating conditions ancic et al 2018 in its current form eedi is highly sensitive to ship speed lindstad et al 2011 its current formulation is not appropriate for ro ro ro ro passenger and passenger ships deltamarine 2011 neither to small ships centre for maritime technology and innovation 2010 walsh and bows 2012 and ultra large container ships ulcs vladimir et al 2017 as well as to ships with integrated power systems ips or hybrid power systems hps mepc 2014 ancic et al 2013 proposed a new approach that could be applicable to ips but it requires further elaboration and verification furthermore to achieve practical energy efficiency improvements in the industry technical solutions and technical measures like eedi alone are insufficient armstrong and banks 2015 it has to be pointed out that policies aiming to improve energy efficiency of ships need to be carefully considered in order to avoid unnecessary burden on the shipping industry while ensuring satisfactory levels of energy efficiency improvements rehmatulla and smith 2015 the aim of this paper is to introduce a methodology to analyse the energy efficiency of ships with ips and hps that could be applicable both to ro ro passenger and small ships in the next section an overview of the currently used methodology is presented and the reasons why it is not applicable to ships having ips are highlighted based on it a new methodology to evaluate energy efficiency for ro ro passenger ships with ips is introduced after that the results of the energy efficiency analysis of the current ro ro passenger ships fleet using the current and proposed methodology are compared finally a thorough discussion emphasizes the differences in these methodologies and indicates ship power system configurations with higher energy efficiency 2 methodology in order to fulfil the aim of the paper current fleet of ro ro passenger ships was analysed in the first place based on their technical characteristics important for energy efficiency evaluation world register of ships wros database was used to obtain technical characteristics for ships this database is the most extensive and is recognized by the mepc as reference one ihs fairplay 2013 secondly current approach in the evaluation of ships energy efficiency is analysed revealing reasons why current approach is not applicable to ips and hps in addition studies and proposals available in literature are analysed including the impact of different correction factors currently used in the eedi formula based on these analyses a new methodology to evaluate ship energy efficiency is proposed an outline of main characteristics of integrated and hybrid power systems is presented 2 1 integrated power systems the main characteristic of conventional power system in ships is a clear division between the main and the auxiliary power system the main power system produces the power for the ship propulsion system while the auxiliary power system produces the electric power which is required for the main power system operation and for every other use onboard the main power system is typically comprised of the main diesel engine shafting system and the propeller while the auxiliary system consists of auxiliary diesel engines directly coupled to the electric generator on the contrary the main characteristic of ips is centralized electric power generation and the application of electric propulsion ipss are undoubtedly more complex but enable the integration of all ship power consumers and producers into one system the main benefits of ipss are increased energy efficiency increased power available for every system or a component and increased reliability miller et al 2013 energy efficiency is inversely proportional to fuel consumption so increased energy efficiency can be easily confirmed through reduced specific fuel oil consumption sfc of the engine also for ships with ips designers of ship machinery have a higher degree of freedom since diesel engines no longer need to be installed in the ship aft section as in case of conventional systems a possibility to place ship machinery in different parts of a ship allows the optimization of masses in the ship which can lead to better exploitation of ship capacity and better hydrodynamic seakeeping performances it should be noted that there are certain differences between the ips and the hybrid power systems hps according to chau and wong 2002 and the application in the automotive industry hps is any system which has more than one power source they further divide them into series parallel and series parallel hps however in marine engineering this definition is not applicable since even conventional power systems regularly have more than one power source and would be considered as hps by this definition even though these configurations are not new to the marine industry the difference between ips and hps is still not widely accepted so in this paper the following definitions are used ips is a power system in which each power producer and consumer are integrated into one power system while hps is a system having more than one type of power source from these definitions it is clear that the ship can have ips which is not hps for example if it uses only diesel engines as a power source or which can at the same time be hps for example if besides diesel engines it also uses fuel cells or batteries one of typical configurations of ips is the diesel electric power system de fig 1 here prime movers usually medium speed diesel engines are coupled directly to electric generators producing electric power for the entire power system including the electric propulsion system this configuration allows better optimization of diesel engine operating points regardless of load as a consequence fuel oil consumption and emissions to air are generally lower also in this case ship machinery does not need to be located at the ship stern the energy efficiency can be further improved using batteries which allow diesel engines to be turned off at very small loads in port or at anchor a downside to this configuration are losses due to energy conversion from mechanical to electrical and then back to mechanical power because of this conventional power systems should generally have higher efficiency if observing only one operating point especially around 75 of mcr but when observing the entire ship operating profile ips will generally be more energy efficient so this configuration is more appropriate for ships which have significant variations in engine load and stay more often in ports like passenger or ro ro passenger ships passenger and ro ro passenger ships are specific since their design criteria vary significantly due to a great variation in their operation demands such ships usually have to compete with other transportation modes or only make part of a greater transport chain this means they are often limited by tight schedules and the number of passengers and or cars the ship has to transport all defined by transport needs and usually not optimal regarding ship energy efficiency furthermore ips configurations allow these ships to have propulsion systems configured to provide maximum manoeuvring abilities and in addition have some reserve power in order to compensate for possible delays and rough weather another typical configuration is power take off power take in pto pti power system fig 2 in this configuration an electric device is used mounted on a shaft or connected through a gearbox it can act either as the electric generator producing electric power or as the electric motor assisting diesel engine for the propulsion and allows the operation of diesel engines at loads where its sfc is lower the configuration with shaft generator motor is typical for larger vessels since it allows the production of the electrical power onboard by the main engine having a lower sfc compared to auxiliary engines another application is for small vessels having medium or high speed diesel engines and a gearbox the gearbox allows then several options only the diesel engine is coupled to the propeller both the diesel engine and the electric machine are coupled to the propeller only the electric machine is coupled to the propeller or the propeller is uncoupled and the diesel engine is used solely to drive the electric generator to produce electrical power if batteries are used then the possibilities grow even wider usually a controllable pitch propeller is used for this configuration allowing the change of the ship speed while keeping the engine speed and the frequency of the electric power constant possibilities provided by ips and hps are numerous and introduce a new paradigm in design of the ship power system replacing conventional power systems as unequaled solution having a higher energy efficiency and lower environmental impact 2 2 ro ro passenger fleet analysis from wros database ro ro passenger ships with following codes are taken into account a36a2pr passenger roro ship vehicles a36a2pt passenger roro ship vehicles rail a36b2pl passenger landing craft for these ships the following characteristics are obtained 1 gt in order to determine if the eedi requirements apply to it 2 engine power and speed as well as engine type in order to determine sfc 3 ship speed propulsion type and ship length in order to determine froude number froude number is used to determine hull type according to 1 f r v g l where v denotes ship speed g is gravity constant and l denotes ship length based on this value it can be determined whether a ship has full displacement semi displacement or planning hull if the value of froude number is below 0 4 the ship has full displacement hull if it is between 0 4 and 1 it has semi displacement hull while for values above 1 it has planing hull 2 3 current eedi calculation approach the attained eedi is calculated according to the following equation 2 eedi j 1 m f j i 1 n m e p m e i c f m e i s f c m e i p a e c f a e s f c a e f i f c f l c a p a c i t y f w v r e f j 1 m f j i 1 n p t i p p t i i i 1 n e f f f e f f i p a e e f f i c f a e s f c a e i 1 n e f f f e f f i p e f f i c f m e s f c m e f i f c f l c a p a c i t y f w v r e f the symbols in this formula are described in detail in mepc 2014 so here only parameters that have significant impact on ro ro passenger ships are described the numerator in the eedi formula generally represents co2 mass flow produced based on the ship systems power needs and the denominator represents benefit for the society transport work in general the symbols in eq 1 have the following meaning p denotes power c represents co2 conversion factor sfc is specific fuel oil consumption me denotes main engine and ae denotes auxiliary engine p me is hence the power of the main engine s defined as 75 of the maximum continuous rating mcr after the deduction of shaft generator power if applicable there are a number of correction factors in eq 1 but two correction factors f jroro and f cropax are introduced especially for ro ro passenger ships thus f jroro is a correction factor to account for ship specific design elements 3 f j r o r o 1 f n l α l p p b s β b s d s γ l p p 1 3 δ where fn l is froude number l pp is length between perpendiculars b s is breadth d s is summer load line draught and is volumetric displacement while exponents for ro ro passenger ships are defined as α 2 50 γ 0 75 β 0 75 δ 1 00 for ro ro passenger ships having a dwt gt ratio of less than 0 25 the following cubic capacity correction factor f cropax should also apply 4 f c r o p a x d w t g t 0 25 0 8 these factors are introduced with the intent to correct eedi values for ships so that a better correlation between values for different ships can be obtained as can be seen they are defined using statistical methods without solid physical background f jroro is introduced in order to reduce eedi value for ships with higher froude number i e higher speed while f cropax partially replaces dwt as a measure of ship capacity with gt as mentioned earlier the attained eedi value for a ship is compared against the required eedi which is calculated using the eedi reference line value and the appropriate reduction factor the eedi reference line value is obtained from the eedi reference curve as a function of ship type and capacity this curve should represent average energy efficiency of the world fleet for a specific ship type the process of determining the eedi reference curve is described in details in mepc 2013 for every ro ro passenger ship of gt 400 and above delivered from 1 january 1998 to 1 january 2010 estimated eedi is calculated according to 5 estimated eedi 3 1144 f j r o r o 190 i 1 n m e p m e i 215 p a e f c r o p a x c a p a c i t y v r e f according to the mepc 2013 in order to calculate the eedi reference line for ro ro passenger ships 75 of the total installed main power should be used as well as corresponding ship speed v ref based on these values using regression analysis an eedi reference curve is plotted after that in filtering process every estimated eedi values deviating by more than two standard deviations are discarded and a new curve is then plotted to calculate estimated eedi required data are main engine s total mcr ship speed and dwt plus ship gt to calculate f cropax and ship length breadth draught and displacement to calculate f jroro there are numerous problems concerning the application of eedi for ro ro passenger ships with ips generally the power balance on a ship and consequently co2 emissions as well as other emissions from a ship can be determined using two basic methods first is by observing the characteristics of ship prime movers which produce power and these emissions the second is by analysing ship power system requirements and the efficiency of the power chain in order to determine the required output from prime mover s and consequently their emissions the second method is more complicated and based on several assumptions especially in the design phase when the ship power system is not fully defined but should produce the same result if implemented correctly even though it seems more prudent simpler quicker more reliable to use the former method in the design phase to estimate the co2 emissions from a ship eq 1 uses the latter method and that is partly the reason why eedi has so many correction factors implications of this approach are not fully clear i e it is questionable if the eedi in its present form provides an accurate measure of the ship co2 emission this can be noticed in the p me and p eff definition according to mepc 2014 p me is 75 of engine maximum continuous rating mcr after the deduction of shaft generators in case they are installed the value of mcr specified on the engine international air pollution prevention eiapp certificate should be used for calculation if main engines are not required to have eiapp certificate the mcr value on the nameplate should be used p eff on the other hand is the output of innovative mechanical energy efficient technologies and has negative sign in eq 1 however it is not clear based on which parameters is an engine selected in the design phase if innovative mechanical energy efficient technologies are present if there are technologies which can reduce the power demand on the engine this will be reflected on the engine selection as a consequence a derated engine may be selected but this would lead in fact to double deduction of the eedi in eq 1 first through lower mcr of the selected engine and second through negative value of p eff of innovative technologies that led to engine mcr deduction this was first identified in mepc 2009b hence the guidance on treatment of innovative energy efficient technologies was adopted with the aim of ensuring uniform application of these technologies in the eedi calculation the guidance prescribes that the reference speed v ref for the eedi calculation is the one that can be achieved without new technologies the effect of these technologies is then determined for that reference speed however this approach has a flaw because the reference speed determined in this way can significantly defer from the design speed especially if the power output of new technologies is significant another issue is the definition of p ae first current guidelines observe only mechanical and electrical power but completely neglect the heating power furthermore only the power required for propulsion machinery systems and accommodation is taken into account in this way every other auxiliary system is excluded from the eedi formula even though its power requirements can be similar or in some cases even higher than for the propulsion system this particularly refers to passenger and lng ships for which a separate calculation is provided as well as for tankers and ro ro passenger ships for which there is no separate calculation of the p ae with the exclusion of a part of the ship power system the eedi formula essentially becomes invalid for integrated and or hybrid power systems and this is the main reason why it cannot be applied for those systems associated with the definition of p ae is the definition of sfc ae it is defined at 50 of the auxiliary engine mcr according to the eiapp certificate which has to be issued for every engine of 130 kw and above since the p ae is defined as a percentage of the main engine mcr and not at 50 of mcr of auxiliary engines it is also doubtful if this value is valid since these two powers can be significantly different furthermore during the engine testing for the eiapp certificate along with the nox emission also the co2 emission is measured mepc 2008 and recorded in the nox technical file while the value of sfc is calculated since it cannot be directly measured hence it seems more precise and simpler to use the co2 emission data directly from the nox technical file for the eedi calculation this would also eliminate the uncertainty regarding the co2 conversion factor c f the value of c f is defined only as a function of the percentage of carbon in fuel and assumes complete combustion which is only theoretical for diesel engines of course if the nox technical file is not available co2 emission could be calculated using the current method of multiplying power specific fuel consumption and co2 conversion factor as stated above the eedi in its current form observes only one operating point 75 mcr for some cargo ships this can even be sufficient but not for ro ro passenger ships their power system is usually optimized for a range of operating points since their speed and load vary significantly so the energy efficiency should also be analysed over that range also specific for ro ro passenger ships is that they transport a combination of passengers and cars varying in size and weight energy efficiency of ships should be expressed per income earning unit be it cargo dwt gt or passenger number usually the number of passengers and vehicles they can transport is not limited by weight the ship can sustain but by the available space thus gt seems to be more appropriate measure of their capacity than deadweight from environmental perspective the ships should not be considered solely as power consumers but they are also power producers therefore their efficiency and responsibility for emissions should be interpreted in a more integrated manner comparable to land based industrial installations that are subject to integrated pollution prevention and control regulations whereby energy efficiency is solely a part of environmental performance of the plant in authors opinion the concept of best available technology for ship machinery should be developed with regard to emission limits and technical performance of ships whereby ips as well as research and development thereof would certainly be of central interest hence a new approach to define the attained eedi is required this approach should 1 observe prime movers co2 emission including main and auxiliary engines as well as other sources of co2 like boilers incinerators etc in a range of operating points 2 define co2 emission based on engine characteristics determined within nox technical code 3 if nox technical code is not available sfc value should not be considered constant but dependent on engine type load and speed 4 use gt as a measure of capacity rather than dwt 5 define eedi reference value as a function of ship capacity and speed 6 define eedi reference surface based on estimated eedi values for ships delivered in the last 15 years with full displacement hulls only 2 4 suggested eedi calculation approach it is suggested to calculate 4 values of eedi for 4 reference loads i e for 25 50 75 and 100 of total engine s mcr formulas then yield 6 a t t a i n e d e e d i 100

achievable speed in knots at specific load and gt is ship capacity non dimensional co2 represents the co2 emissions of ship prime movers g co2 h for diesel engines it is as reported in the nox technical code alternatively if that data is not available the co2 emission can be calculated based on the engine power p kw specific fuel consumption sfc g fuel kwh and the conversion factor c f g co2 g fuel as in current approach in this sense every ship will have 4 values of the eedi which can then be evaluated it has to be pointed out that when the power system is at 50 load this does not necessarily mean every engine is at 50 load of course for conventional power systems with only one main engine this will be the true but for ips with several engines different options can be achieved leading to optimum engine efficiency methods to define which engines will be operational and at which load depend on the power system configuration therefore for each of these loads explanation is required in the eedi technical document determining which engines are operating and at which load based on this information total co2 emission can be calculated depending on engine load frequency of occurrences and the values of the attained eedi in each operating condition it is possible to calculate average attained eedi this was done for bulk carriers by ancic et al 2018 using weighting factors determined by experimental data from banks et al 2013 similar calculation can be performed for ro ro passenger ships providing data on engine load frequency of occurrences is available when analysing eq 4 it can be concluded that the current approach assumes that every ship uses hfo sfc for every main engine equals 190 g kwh and for every auxiliary engine equals 215 and every correction factor apart from f jroro and f cropax is neglected justification for such assumptions is limitation to data available in the wros database even though the database does not contain data on sfc for every ship certain improvements are possible since it contains data on engine rpm according to iacs 2016 diesel engines are divided into slow speed with less than 300 rpm medium speed with 300 rpm and above but less than 1400 rpm and high speed with 1400 rpm and above depending on their type they have different sfc for various combinations of load and speed reference sfc values used in this paper are presented in table 1 also the database contains data on engine and propulsion type based on the engine type it can be concluded if a ship has conventional or ips and based on the propulsion type it can be concluded if engine operates according to propeller curve or in generator mode with constant rpm estimated eedi in this paper are defined in 3 different ways 1 for ships having conventional motor diesel power system configuration and fpp estimated eedi values are defined for 4 main engine loads 7 e s t i m a t e d e e d i 100 3 1144 p m e 100 s f c 100 100 p a e s f c a e 50 v 100 g t e

propulsion type cpp azimuth voith schneider and other estimated eedi values are defined similarly except that sfc values for 4 main engine loads are determined for a fixed engine rpm i e main engine

dimensional analysis ancic et al 2018 the following relation is valid 11 e e d i a g t b v c where parameters a b and c are determined using the least square method as in the current approach the expected values of parameters b and c are 1 3 and 2 respectively i e slower and bigger ships will have lower estimated eedi value but unlike in the current approach the reference eedi value for slower ships will also be lower since the suggested approach expands the eedi reference curve in the speed axis it effectively becomes the eedi reference surface 3 results in this section the results of the eedi calculation using the current and the suggested approach are presented two sets of data are used first according to the reference period prescribed by mepc 2013 and second for ships delivered in the last 15 years the reference period declared by mepc 2013 for ro ro passenger ships is from 1 january 1998 to 1 january 2010 in that period 629 ro ro passenger ships were delivered since the data required for the eedi reference line calculation by mepc 2013 are quite detailed these data are available for only 111 ships the database is constantly updated so when observing the last period available to authors from 15 august 2000 to 15 august 2015 in total 764 ro ro passenger ships with gt 400 or above were delivered after discarding ships for which there is no data about engine power engine rpm ship speed type of propulsion and ship length in total 442 ships remain from these ships 304 of them have medium speed diesel engines 133 ships have high speed diesel engines while for 5 ships it was not possible to determine engine type so they are discarded from further analysis according to the value of froude number 384 of these vessels have full displacement hulls 43 have semi displacement hulls while none of them have planing hulls when observing their propulsion systems the majority has controllable pitch propellers cpp in total 218 fixed pitch propeller fpp is used on 55 ships 72 ships have azimuth and 23 have azipod thrusters while 14 ships have voith schneider thruster water jets are used on 53 ships out of which 51 have semi displacement hulls table 2 fig 3 presents the adopted eedi reference line using eq 4 and the methodology prescribed by mepc 2013 for ro ro passenger ships in the same figure the required eedi line for phase 3 is plotted i e the line with 30 lower eedi compared to the reference eedi as well as the line derived by authors using the same methodology and the same data as prescribed by mepc 2013 values of parameters a and c for the reference line adopted by mepc yield 752 16 and 0 381 respectively while for the reference line derived from the repeated calculation is 1830 and 0 539 respectively value of the coefficient of determination for the reference line adopted by mepc is unknown while for the derived reference line is 0 5811 fig 4 presents the derived eedi reference surface using the new set of data but eq 5 in order to provide a better comparison only ships with full displacement hull forms were analysed the values of parameters a b and c are 431 0 602 and 0 9217 respectively while the coefficient of determination r 2 equals 0 8569 in fig 5 values of the eedi for vessels with ips are plotted on the derived eedi reference surface from 384 ro ro passenger ships in the observed time period 48 had ips 28 of those ships 58 have their eedi below the reference surface 4 discussion when observing values of estimated eedi for ro ro passenger ships and comparing them to eedi reference lines fig 3 it can be concluded that the current approach to define eedi reference line is satisfactory the value of the coefficient of determination for the adopted function is unknown but for the derived function in this paper it equals 0 58 which also supports that claim when this data is analysed deeper certain flaws come to light first the adopted eedi reference line was obtained from data about the ro ro passenger ships fleet delivered from 1 january 1998 and 1 january 2010 from 629 ships delivered in that time period only 111 had enough data to be used for the eedi reference line calculation and after the filtering process 8 ships were discarded it is doubtful whether these 103 ships 16 of the fleet are representative for the calculation also several distinctive groups of ships can be noticed in fig 3 particularly the one marked grey and the other marked red ships in the group marked grey have capacity under 2000 t of corrected dwt and estimated eedi well below the required eedi line even for phase 3 that would suggest that these ships are highly energy efficient however deeper observation for each ship reveals that this group consists of ferries with very low design speed conventional power system and without any innovative energy efficient technologies on the other hand group marked red includes all ships from 7000 to 9000 t of corrected dwt and every one of these ships has estimated eedi above the required eedi line for phase 3 this would suggest that none of these ships have satisfactory energy efficiency performance but deeper analysis again reveals these ships have none of the characteristics that would significantly either improve or deteriorate their energy efficiency the only difference from the grey group is that these ships have somewhat higher design speed this leads to the conclusion that the current approach does not evaluate energy efficiency of ships but rather their design speed so it is hard to expect that new ships from 7000 to 9000 t of corrected dwt will be able to satisfy the phase 3 requirement without significant speed reductions also it is even harder to expect that new ferries will improve their energy efficiency performance since the current approach already proclaimed them highly energy efficient fig 4 represents the eedi reference surface for ro ro passenger ships the value of the coefficient of determination r 2 0 81 reveals a high correlation between the surface and data used values of parameters b and c also indicate important findings as expected parameter b is negative 0 602 indicating that ships with bigger capacity will have lower eedi parameter c equals 0 9217 which is positive and indicates that faster ships will have higher eedi but the value of parameter c should be a bit higher and equal around 2 this is partly explained since the numerator in eq 5 is not determined solely by the main engine power but also by the auxiliary engine power which for ro ro passenger ships can be significant even more important is the conclusion that faster ships do not have the resistance as high as expected in another words faster ships require significantly higher power to sail so during the design phase many improvements are usually implemented in order to reduce that power this is not the case for slower ships especially ferries since the amount of power reduction achievable is not as high so the same measures are not economically feasible unlike the current approach which suggests that only faster ships require improvements in energy efficiency the suggested approach reveals that in fact slower ships have much higher potential to improve their energy efficiency it has to be pointed out that semi displacement hull vessels were discarded from this analysis this is because they have significantly higher design speeds and almost exclusively have water jet thrusters which would unfairly penalize them when comparing energy efficiency with full displacement hull form ships finally in the suggested approach there are no ships significantly above or below the surface which leads to the conclusion this approach is referent for the fleet of ro ro passenger ships energy efficiency performance of ro ro passenger ships with ips is presented on fig 5 since the current approach is not applicable to ships with ips only a comparison using the suggested approach is possible the results confirm that most of ships with ips are more energy efficient compared to the fleet average another issue that has to be mentioned is the definition of the required environmental goal which the eedi has the aim to accomplish this environmental goal can be defined in several ways for example like total global yearly co2 emission from ships the required eedi should set a requirement that would ensure the fulfilment of this goal through definitions of eedi reference values and appropriate reduction factors reduction factors for the majority of ship types are currently defined as a 10 reduction every 5 years with a vague link to europe 2020 strategy and an aim of achieving 30 co2 reduction for new ships by 2025 however it is essential to realize that this does not directly implicate a global reduction of co2 emission from ships global co2 emissions depend also on emissions from older ships for which eedi does not apply and even more on the size and operation profiles of the world fleet which is primarily determined by the economy growth and market demands it is extremely hard to scientifically link the co2 emission from ships and some environmental goal markandya et al 2014 suggest that the goal of achieving the greenhouse gas concentration levels necessary to maintain global temperature increases below 2 c above preindustrial levels i e 550 ppm could be technically feasible and economically viable meinhausen et al 2006 specify different co2 emission reduction rates in order to achieve different levels of the co2 in the atmosphere to achieve the concentration of the co2 in the atmosphere of 550 ppm the co2 emission growth rate should be between 1 01 and 0 62 per year ancic and sestan 2015 estimated the co2 emission increase of about 20 per year for bulk carriers if no regulation is implemented this indicates a clear need to regulate the energy efficiency of ships when assessing the impact of the current regulations on future co2 emissions from ships ancic and sestan 2015 estimated that it will result in an average co2 emission increase of about 6 3 per year this is substantially below the no regulation scenario but still high above the levels prescribed by meinhausen et al 2006 and indicates the need to correct the eedi requirements but without a clear environmental goal it is not possible to determine the appropriate reduction rates ancic et al 2018 proposed to categorize ships in different energy efficiency levels instead of currently used pass fail criterion in the eedi the similar approach is used for household appliances and provided certain level of energy efficiency increase without posing a threat to market balance apart from the reasons stated in the introduction the need for permanent improvement and development of environmental standards of ship machinery is inevitable for at least two additional reasons the first one involves the evolving sustainable public procurement standards where goods and services will inevitably concern contract award criteria regarding emissions and life cycle costing luttenberger and runko luttenberger 2016 from sustainability perspective that integrates economy environment and society the best energy is the one that needs not to be produced the second reason concerns sustainability reporting obligations of undertakings gri 2016 which for the time being apply to large companies but clearly indicate future requirements on entities as well eu 2014 the data to be reported extends to suppliers as well therefore potential obligations for both the shipowner and or the shipyard or second hand seller energy efficiency measures implemented by shipping companies should thus be reflected in improved indicators of economic performance environmental performance occupational health and safety societal performance with respect to local communities and product responsibility throughout the life cycle thereof 5 conclusion in this paper a methodology to analyse energy efficiency of ships with ips and hps is proposed this methodology was used to analyse energy efficiency of ro ro passenger ships ship delivered in the last 15 years were analysed based on their technical and hydrodynamic properties for the energy efficiency analysis in total 384 ships were used out of which 48 had ips or hps for every of those ships the estimated eedis were calculated and based on them eedi reference surface was proposed determining the referent eedi value for ro ro passenger ships depending on the ship capacity and speed after evaluating the energy efficiency performance of the entire fleet it was found that the majority of ships with ips or hps have their eedi values below the reference surface this leads to the conclusion that ships with ips or hps not only can be more energy efficient but in fact are more energy efficient compared to the fleet average acknowledgments this research was supported in part by croatian science foundation under the

23127,the energy efficiency design index eedi introduced by the international maritime organization imo in 2011 had an admirable intent to improve energy efficiency for ships through a set of technical performance standards nowadays after several revisions regarding the eedi calculation it is still not clear whether this intent is or will be fulfilled segments of shipping particularly sensitive to these issues are passenger and ro ro passenger ships since many of them are promoted by their shipowners as eco friendly with the aim of attracting more tourists this is particularly true for ships with integrated power system ips however the fact is that it is not possible to discuss energy efficiency improvements without a valid methodology to evaluate it current methodology to calculate eedi is not applicable to ships with ips since it observes only one operating point and only a part of the ship power system this paper introduces a new methodology to evaluate energy efficiency of ro ro passenger ships with ips based on a holistic approach evaluates it for the current fleet of ro ro passenger ships and proposes options to further improve it for new ships keywords

efficiency management plan sfc specific fuel consumption wros world register of ships 1 introduction energy efficiency of any technical system can be considered in principle as a ratio of power input to the system and a useful work that is a direct consequence of this input application of this principle in marine power systems requires first the definition in which part of ship life cycle will the energy efficiency be analysed the second step includes the quantification of ship power system input and the useful work derived from it two basic levels for the analysis are design and operational level for the analysis on the design level the energy efficiency design index eedi is proposed after several studies mepc 2009a 2010 2011a wang 2010 aiming to determine the measures to reduce ghg emissions marine environment protection committee mepc adopted resolution 203 62 mepc 2011b which added a new chapter 4 to marpol annex vi named regulation for energy efficiency of ships this chapter requires that every ship of gt 400 and above engaged in international shipping has to have the international energy efficiency certificate iee certificate in order to obtain it the ship has to comply with the eedi requirements and to have ship energy efficiency management plan seemp onboard eedi is mandatory for ships engaged in international shipping since mepc 2009a concluded that the main source of co2 emission is the operation of these ships however eedi can be implemented also for domestic and or short sea shipping since pollution originated from these ships occurs mostly in and near ports and highly populated areas and is especially pernicious for public health runko luttenberger et al 2013 application of eedi to inland shipping is a separate issue which deserves appropriate attention karim and hasan 2017 simic 2014 eedi is a design measure to increase energy efficiency of ships and as such is applicable only to new ships for new ships the attained eedi has to be calculated according to mepc 2014 and not higher than the required eedi which is calculated from the eedi reference line value and the appropriate reduction factor the purpose of the eedi is to provide a fair basis for comparison to stimulate the development of more efficient ships in general and to establish the minimum efficiency of new ships depending on ship type and size as stated by mepc 2013 the eedi even though it is named as the energy efficiency index was actually developed by the mepc from the co 2 index which was defined as co2 emission from ship per ton and nautical mile of cargo transported only later was it renamed into the eedi but remained to be the measure of the relative co2 emission the energy efficiency and the co2 emissions are usually related but in some cases especially for power systems which do not use fossil fuels these two terms are completely different from literature overview presented below it can be concluded that the eedi in its present form does not present a valid measure of the ship s energy efficiency because it evaluates only a part of the ship power system and only in one operating point which might never be met in real ship operating conditions ancic et al 2018 in its current form eedi is highly sensitive to ship speed lindstad et al 2011 its current formulation is not appropriate for ro ro ro ro passenger and passenger ships deltamarine 2011 neither to small ships centre for maritime technology and innovation 2010 walsh and bows 2012 and ultra large container ships ulcs vladimir et al 2017 as well as to ships with integrated power systems ips or hybrid power systems hps mepc 2014 ancic et al 2013 proposed a new approach that could be applicable to ips but it requires further elaboration and verification furthermore to achieve practical energy efficiency improvements in the industry technical solutions and technical measures like eedi alone are insufficient armstrong and banks 2015 it has to be pointed out that policies aiming to improve energy efficiency of ships need to be carefully considered in order to avoid unnecessary burden on the shipping industry while ensuring satisfactory levels of energy efficiency improvements rehmatulla and smith 2015 the aim of this paper is to introduce a methodology to analyse the energy efficiency of ships with ips and hps that could be applicable both to ro ro passenger and small ships in the next section an overview of the currently used methodology is presented and the reasons why it is not applicable to ships having ips are highlighted based on it a new methodology to evaluate energy efficiency for ro ro passenger ships with ips is introduced after that the results of the energy efficiency analysis of the current ro ro passenger ships fleet using the current and proposed methodology are compared finally a thorough discussion emphasizes the differences in these methodologies and indicates ship power system configurations with higher energy efficiency 2 methodology in order to fulfil the aim of the paper current fleet of ro ro passenger ships was analysed in the first place based on their technical characteristics important for energy efficiency evaluation world register of ships wros database was used to obtain technical characteristics for ships this database is the most extensive and is recognized by the mepc as reference one ihs fairplay 2013 secondly current approach in the evaluation of ships energy efficiency is analysed revealing reasons why current approach is not applicable to ips and hps in addition studies and proposals available in literature are analysed including the impact of different correction factors currently used in the eedi formula based on these analyses a new methodology to evaluate ship energy efficiency is proposed an outline of main characteristics of integrated and hybrid power systems is presented 2 1 integrated power systems the main characteristic of conventional power system in ships is a clear division between the main and the auxiliary power system the main power system produces the power for the ship propulsion system while the auxiliary power system produces the electric power which is required for the main power system operation and for every other use onboard the main power system is typically comprised of the main diesel engine shafting system and the propeller while the auxiliary system consists of auxiliary diesel engines directly coupled to the electric generator on the contrary the main characteristic of ips is centralized electric power generation and the application of electric propulsion ipss are undoubtedly more complex but enable the integration of all ship power consumers and producers into one system the main benefits of ipss are increased energy efficiency increased power available for every system or a component and increased reliability miller et al 2013 energy efficiency is inversely proportional to fuel consumption so increased energy efficiency can be easily confirmed through reduced specific fuel oil consumption sfc of the engine also for ships with ips designers of ship machinery have a higher degree of freedom since diesel engines no longer need to be installed in the ship aft section as in case of conventional systems a possibility to place ship machinery in different parts of a ship allows the optimization of masses in the ship which can lead to better exploitation of ship capacity and better hydrodynamic seakeeping performances it should be noted that there are certain differences between the ips and the hybrid power systems hps according to chau and wong 2002 and the application in the automotive industry hps is any system which has more than one power source they further divide them into series parallel and series parallel hps however in marine engineering this definition is not applicable since even conventional power systems regularly have more than one power source and would be considered as hps by this definition even though these configurations are not new to the marine industry the difference between ips and hps is still not widely accepted so in this paper the following definitions are used ips is a power system in which each power producer and consumer are integrated into one power system while hps is a system having more than one type of power source from these definitions it is clear that the ship can have ips which is not hps for example if it uses only diesel engines as a power source or which can at the same time be hps for example if besides diesel engines it also uses fuel cells or batteries one of typical configurations of ips is the diesel electric power system de fig 1 here prime movers usually medium speed diesel engines are coupled directly to electric generators producing electric power for the entire power system including the electric propulsion system this configuration allows better optimization of diesel engine operating points regardless of load as a consequence fuel oil consumption and emissions to air are generally lower also in this case ship machinery does not need to be located at the ship stern the energy efficiency can be further improved using batteries which allow diesel engines to be turned off at very small loads in port or at anchor a downside to this configuration are losses due to energy conversion from mechanical to electrical and then back to mechanical power because of this conventional power systems should generally have higher efficiency if observing only one operating point especially around 75 of mcr but when observing the entire ship operating profile ips will generally be more energy efficient so this configuration is more appropriate for ships which have significant variations in engine load and stay more often in ports like passenger or ro ro passenger ships passenger and ro ro passenger ships are specific since their design criteria vary significantly due to a great variation in their operation demands such ships usually have to compete with other transportation modes or only make part of a greater transport chain this means they are often limited by tight schedules and the number of passengers and or cars the ship has to transport all defined by transport needs and usually not optimal regarding ship energy efficiency furthermore ips configurations allow these ships to have propulsion systems configured to provide maximum manoeuvring abilities and in addition have some reserve power in order to compensate for possible delays and rough weather another typical configuration is power take off power take in pto pti power system fig 2 in this configuration an electric device is used mounted on a shaft or connected through a gearbox it can act either as the electric generator producing electric power or as the electric motor assisting diesel engine for the propulsion and allows the operation of diesel engines at loads where its sfc is lower the configuration with shaft generator motor is typical for larger vessels since it allows the production of the electrical power onboard by the main engine having a lower sfc compared to auxiliary engines another application is for small vessels having medium or high speed diesel engines and a gearbox the gearbox allows then several options only the diesel engine is coupled to the propeller both the diesel engine and the electric machine are coupled to the propeller only the electric machine is coupled to the propeller or the propeller is uncoupled and the diesel engine is used solely to drive the electric generator to produce electrical power if batteries are used then the possibilities grow even wider usually a controllable pitch propeller is used for this configuration allowing the change of the ship speed while keeping the engine speed and the frequency of the electric power constant possibilities provided by ips and hps are numerous and introduce a new paradigm in design of the ship power system replacing conventional power systems as unequaled solution having a higher energy efficiency and lower environmental impact 2 2 ro ro passenger fleet analysis from wros database ro ro passenger ships with following codes are taken into account a36a2pr passenger roro ship vehicles a36a2pt passenger roro ship vehicles rail a36b2pl passenger landing craft for these ships the following characteristics are obtained 1 gt in order to determine if the eedi requirements apply to it 2 engine power and speed as well as engine type in order to determine sfc 3 ship speed propulsion type and ship length in order to determine froude number froude number is used to determine hull type according to 1 f r v g l where v denotes ship speed g is gravity constant and l denotes ship length based on this value it can be determined whether a ship has full displacement semi displacement or planning hull if the value of froude number is below 0 4 the ship has full displacement hull if it is between 0 4 and 1 it has semi displacement hull while for values above 1 it has planing hull 2 3 current eedi calculation approach the attained eedi is calculated according to the following equation 2 eedi j 1 m f j i 1 n m e p m e i c f m e i s f c m e i p a e c f a e s f c a e f i f c f l c a p a c i t y f w v r e f j 1 m f j i 1 n p t i p p t i i i 1 n e f f f e f f i p a e e f f i c f a e s f c a e i 1 n e f f f e f f i p e f f i c f m e s f c m e f i f c f l c a p a c i t y f w v r e f the symbols in this formula are described in detail in mepc 2014 so here only parameters that have significant impact on ro ro passenger ships are described the numerator in the eedi formula generally represents co2 mass flow produced based on the ship systems power needs and the denominator represents benefit for the society transport work in general the symbols in eq 1 have the following meaning p denotes power c represents co2 conversion factor sfc is specific fuel oil consumption me denotes main engine and ae denotes auxiliary engine p me is hence the power of the main engine s defined as 75 of the maximum continuous rating mcr after the deduction of shaft generator power if applicable there are a number of correction factors in eq 1 but two correction factors f jroro and f cropax are introduced especially for ro ro passenger ships thus f jroro is a correction factor to account for ship specific design elements 3 f j r o r o 1 f n l α l p p b s β b s d s γ l p p 1 3 δ where fn l is froude number l pp is length between perpendiculars b s is breadth d s is summer load line draught and is volumetric displacement while exponents for ro ro passenger ships are defined as α 2 50 γ 0 75 β 0 75 δ 1 00 for ro ro passenger ships having a dwt gt ratio of less than 0 25 the following cubic capacity correction factor f cropax should also apply 4 f c r o p a x d w t g t 0 25 0 8 these factors are introduced with the intent to correct eedi values for ships so that a better correlation between values for different ships can be obtained as can be seen they are defined using statistical methods without solid physical background f jroro is introduced in order to reduce eedi value for ships with higher froude number i e higher speed while f cropax partially replaces dwt as a measure of ship capacity with gt as mentioned earlier the attained eedi value for a ship is compared against the required eedi which is calculated using the eedi reference line value and the appropriate reduction factor the eedi reference line value is obtained from the eedi reference curve as a function of ship type and capacity this curve should represent average energy efficiency of the world fleet for a specific ship type the process of determining the eedi reference curve is described in details in mepc 2013 for every ro ro passenger ship of gt 400 and above delivered from 1 january 1998 to 1 january 2010 estimated eedi is calculated according to 5 estimated eedi 3 1144 f j r o r o 190 i 1 n m e p m e i 215 p a e f c r o p a x c a p a c i t y v r e f according to the mepc 2013 in order to calculate the eedi reference line for ro ro passenger ships 75 of the total installed main power should be used as well as corresponding ship speed v ref based on these values using regression analysis an eedi reference curve is plotted after that in filtering process every estimated eedi values deviating by more than two standard deviations are discarded and a new curve is then plotted to calculate estimated eedi required data are main engine s total mcr ship speed and dwt plus ship gt to calculate f cropax and ship length breadth draught and displacement to calculate f jroro there are numerous problems concerning the application of eedi for ro ro passenger ships with ips generally the power balance on a ship and consequently co2 emissions as well as other emissions from a ship can be determined using two basic methods first is by observing the characteristics of ship prime movers which produce power and these emissions the second is by analysing ship power system requirements and the efficiency of the power chain in order to determine the required output from prime mover s and consequently their emissions the second method is more complicated and based on several assumptions especially in the design phase when the ship power system is not fully defined but should produce the same result if implemented correctly even though it seems more prudent simpler quicker more reliable to use the former method in the design phase to estimate the co2 emissions from a ship eq 1 uses the latter method and that is partly the reason why eedi has so many correction factors implications of this approach are not fully clear i e it is questionable if the eedi in its present form provides an accurate measure of the ship co2 emission this can be noticed in the p me and p eff definition according to mepc 2014 p me is 75 of engine maximum continuous rating mcr after the deduction of shaft generators in case they are installed the value of mcr specified on the engine international air pollution prevention eiapp certificate should be used for calculation if main engines are not required to have eiapp certificate the mcr value on the nameplate should be used p eff on the other hand is the output of innovative mechanical energy efficient technologies and has negative sign in eq 1 however it is not clear based on which parameters is an engine selected in the design phase if innovative mechanical energy efficient technologies are present if there are technologies which can reduce the power demand on the engine this will be reflected on the engine selection as a consequence a derated engine may be selected but this would lead in fact to double deduction of the eedi in eq 1 first through lower mcr of the selected engine and second through negative value of p eff of innovative technologies that led to engine mcr deduction this was first identified in mepc 2009b hence the guidance on treatment of innovative energy efficient technologies was adopted with the aim of ensuring uniform application of these technologies in the eedi calculation the guidance prescribes that the reference speed v ref for the eedi calculation is the one that can be achieved without new technologies the effect of these technologies is then determined for that reference speed however this approach has a flaw because the reference speed determined in this way can significantly defer from the design speed especially if the power output of new technologies is significant another issue is the definition of p ae first current guidelines observe only mechanical and electrical power but completely neglect the heating power furthermore only the power required for propulsion machinery systems and accommodation is taken into account in this way every other auxiliary system is excluded from the eedi formula even though its power requirements can be similar or in some cases even higher than for the propulsion system this particularly refers to passenger and lng ships for which a separate calculation is provided as well as for tankers and ro ro passenger ships for which there is no separate calculation of the p ae with the exclusion of a part of the ship power system the eedi formula essentially becomes invalid for integrated and or hybrid power systems and this is the main reason why it cannot be applied for those systems associated with the definition of p ae is the definition of sfc ae it is defined at 50 of the auxiliary engine mcr according to the eiapp certificate which has to be issued for every engine of 130 kw and above since the p ae is defined as a percentage of the main engine mcr and not at 50 of mcr of auxiliary engines it is also doubtful if this value is valid since these two powers can be significantly different furthermore during the engine testing for the eiapp certificate along with the nox emission also the co2 emission is measured mepc 2008 and recorded in the nox technical file while the value of sfc is calculated since it cannot be directly measured hence it seems more precise and simpler to use the co2 emission data directly from the nox technical file for the eedi calculation this would also eliminate the uncertainty regarding the co2 conversion factor c f the value of c f is defined only as a function of the percentage of carbon in fuel and assumes complete combustion which is only theoretical for diesel engines of course if the nox technical file is not available co2 emission could be calculated using the current method of multiplying power specific fuel consumption and co2 conversion factor as stated above the eedi in its current form observes only one operating point 75 mcr for some cargo ships this can even be sufficient but not for ro ro passenger ships their power system is usually optimized for a range of operating points since their speed and load vary significantly so the energy efficiency should also be analysed over that range also specific for ro ro passenger ships is that they transport a combination of passengers and cars varying in size and weight energy efficiency of ships should be expressed per income earning unit be it cargo dwt gt or passenger number usually the number of passengers and vehicles they can transport is not limited by weight the ship can sustain but by the available space thus gt seems to be more appropriate measure of their capacity than deadweight from environmental perspective the ships should not be considered solely as power consumers but they are also power producers therefore their efficiency and responsibility for emissions should be interpreted in a more integrated manner comparable to land based industrial installations that are subject to integrated pollution prevention and control regulations whereby energy efficiency is solely a part of environmental performance of the plant in authors opinion the concept of best available technology for ship machinery should be developed with regard to emission limits and technical performance of ships whereby ips as well as research and development thereof would certainly be of central interest hence a new approach to define the attained eedi is required this approach should 1 observe prime movers co2 emission including main and auxiliary engines as well as other sources of co2 like boilers incinerators etc in a range of operating points 2 define co2 emission based on engine characteristics determined within nox technical code 3 if nox technical code is not available sfc value should not be considered constant but dependent on engine type load and speed 4 use gt as a measure of capacity rather than dwt 5 define eedi reference value as a function of ship capacity and speed 6 define eedi reference surface based on estimated eedi values for ships delivered in the last 15 years with full displacement hulls only 2 4 suggested eedi calculation approach it is suggested to calculate 4 values of eedi for 4 reference loads i e for 25 50 75 and 100 of total engine s mcr formulas then yield 6 a t t a i n e d e e d i 100

achievable speed in knots at specific load and gt is ship capacity non dimensional co2 represents the co2 emissions of ship prime movers g co2 h for diesel engines it is as reported in the nox technical code alternatively if that data is not available the co2 emission can be calculated based on the engine power p kw specific fuel consumption sfc g fuel kwh and the conversion factor c f g co2 g fuel as in current approach in this sense every ship will have 4 values of the eedi which can then be evaluated it has to be pointed out that when the power system is at 50 load this does not necessarily mean every engine is at 50 load of course for conventional power systems with only one main engine this will be the true but for ips with several engines different options can be achieved leading to optimum engine efficiency methods to define which engines will be operational and at which load depend on the power system configuration therefore for each of these loads explanation is required in the eedi technical document determining which engines are operating and at which load based on this information total co2 emission can be calculated depending on engine load frequency of occurrences and the values of the attained eedi in each operating condition it is possible to calculate average attained eedi this was done for bulk carriers by ancic et al 2018 using weighting factors determined by experimental data from banks et al 2013 similar calculation can be performed for ro ro passenger ships providing data on engine load frequency of occurrences is available when analysing eq 4 it can be concluded that the current approach assumes that every ship uses hfo sfc for every main engine equals 190 g kwh and for every auxiliary engine equals 215 and every correction factor apart from f jroro and f cropax is neglected justification for such assumptions is limitation to data available in the wros database even though the database does not contain data on sfc for every ship certain improvements are possible since it contains data on engine rpm according to iacs 2016 diesel engines are divided into slow speed with less than 300 rpm medium speed with 300 rpm and above but less than 1400 rpm and high speed with 1400 rpm and above depending on their type they have different sfc for various combinations of load and speed reference sfc values used in this paper are presented in table 1 also the database contains data on engine and propulsion type based on the engine type it can be concluded if a ship has conventional or ips and based on the propulsion type it can be concluded if engine operates according to propeller curve or in generator mode with constant rpm estimated eedi in this paper are defined in 3 different ways 1 for ships having conventional

expected values of parameters b and c are 1 3 and 2 respectively i e slower and bigger ships will have lower estimated eedi value but unlike in the current approach the reference eedi value for slower ships will also be lower since the suggested approach expands the eedi reference curve in the speed axis it effectively becomes the eedi reference surface 3 results in this section the results of the eedi calculation using the current and the suggested approach are presented two sets of data are used first according to the reference period prescribed by mepc 2013 and second for ships delivered in the last 15 years the reference period declared by mepc 2013 for ro ro passenger ships is from 1 january 1998 to 1 january 2010 in that period 629 ro ro passenger ships were delivered since the data required for the eedi reference line calculation by mepc 2013 are quite detailed these data are available for only 111 ships the database is constantly updated so when observing the last period available to authors from 15 august 2000 to 15 august 2015 in total 764 ro ro passenger ships with gt 400 or above were delivered after discarding ships for which there is no data about engine power engine rpm ship speed type of propulsion and ship length in total 442 ships remain from these ships 304 of them have medium speed diesel engines 133 ships have high speed diesel engines while for 5 ships it was not possible to determine engine type so they are discarded from further analysis according to the value of froude number 384 of these vessels have full displacement hulls 43 have semi displacement hulls while none of them have planing hulls when observing their propulsion systems the majority has controllable pitch propellers cpp in total 218 fixed pitch propeller fpp is used on 55 ships 72 ships have azimuth and 23 have azipod thrusters while 14 ships have voith schneider thruster water jets are used on 53 ships out of which 51 have semi displacement hulls table 2 fig 3 presents the adopted eedi reference line using eq 4 and the methodology prescribed by mepc 2013 for ro ro passenger ships in the same figure the required eedi line for phase 3 is plotted i e the line with 30 lower eedi compared to the reference eedi as well as the line derived by authors using the same methodology and the same data as prescribed by mepc 2013 values of parameters a and c for the reference line adopted by mepc yield 752 16 and 0 381 respectively while for the reference line derived from the repeated calculation is 1830 and 0 539 respectively value of the coefficient of determination for the reference line adopted by mepc is unknown while for the derived reference line is 0 5811 fig 4 presents the derived eedi reference surface using the new set of data but eq 5 in order to provide a better comparison only ships with full displacement hull forms were analysed the values of parameters a b and c are 431 0 602 and 0 9217 respectively while the coefficient of determination r 2 equals 0 8569 in fig 5 values of the eedi for vessels with ips are plotted on the derived eedi reference surface from 384 ro ro passenger ships in the observed time period 48 had ips 28 of those ships 58 have their eedi below the reference surface 4 discussion when observing values of estimated eedi for ro ro passenger ships and comparing them to eedi reference lines fig 3 it can be concluded that the current approach to define eedi reference line is satisfactory the value of the coefficient of determination for the adopted function is unknown but for the derived function in this paper it equals 0 58 which also supports that claim when this data is analysed deeper certain flaws come to light first the adopted eedi reference line was obtained from data about the ro ro passenger ships fleet delivered from 1 january 1998 and 1 january 2010 from 629 ships delivered in that time period only 111 had enough data to be used for the eedi reference line calculation and after the filtering process 8 ships were discarded it is doubtful whether these 103 ships 16 of the fleet are representative for the calculation also several distinctive groups of ships can be noticed in fig 3 particularly the one marked grey and the other marked red ships in the group marked grey have capacity under 2000 t of corrected dwt and estimated eedi well below the required eedi line even for phase 3 that would suggest that these ships are highly energy efficient however deeper observation for each ship reveals that this group consists of ferries with very low design speed conventional power system and without any innovative energy efficient technologies on the other hand group marked red includes all ships from 7000 to 9000 t of corrected dwt and every one of these ships has estimated eedi above the required eedi line for phase 3 this would suggest that none of these ships have satisfactory energy efficiency performance but deeper analysis again reveals these ships have none of the characteristics that would significantly either improve or deteriorate their energy efficiency the only difference from the grey group is that these ships have somewhat higher design speed this leads to the conclusion that the current approach does not evaluate energy efficiency of ships but rather their design speed so it is hard to expect that new ships from 7000 to 9000 t of corrected dwt will be able to satisfy the phase 3 requirement without significant speed reductions also it is even harder to expect that new ferries will improve their energy efficiency performance since the current approach already proclaimed them highly energy efficient fig 4 represents the eedi reference surface for ro ro passenger ships the value of the coefficient of determination r 2 0 81 reveals a high correlation between the surface and data used values of parameters b and c also indicate important findings as expected parameter b is negative 0 602 indicating that ships with bigger capacity will have lower eedi parameter c equals 0 9217 which is positive and indicates that faster ships will have higher eedi but the value of parameter c should be a bit higher and equal around 2 this is partly explained since the numerator in eq 5 is not determined solely by the main engine power but also by the auxiliary engine power which for ro ro passenger ships can be significant even more important is the conclusion that faster ships do not have the resistance as high as expected in another words faster ships require significantly higher power to sail so during the design phase many improvements are usually implemented in order to reduce that power this is not the case for slower ships especially ferries since the amount of power reduction achievable is not as high so the same measures are not economically feasible unlike the current approach which suggests that only faster ships require improvements in energy efficiency the suggested approach reveals that in fact slower ships have much higher potential to improve their energy efficiency it has to be pointed out that semi displacement hull vessels were discarded from this analysis this is because they have significantly higher design speeds and almost exclusively have water jet thrusters which would unfairly penalize them when comparing energy efficiency with full displacement hull form ships finally in the suggested approach there are no ships significantly above or below the surface which leads to the conclusion this approach is referent for the fleet of ro ro passenger ships energy efficiency performance of ro ro passenger ships with ips is presented on fig 5 since the current approach is not applicable to ships with ips only a comparison using the suggested approach is possible the results confirm that most of ships with ips are more energy efficient compared to the fleet average another issue that has to be mentioned is the definition of the required environmental goal which the eedi has the aim to accomplish this environmental goal can be defined in several ways for example like total global yearly co2 emission from ships the required eedi should set a requirement that would ensure the fulfilment of this goal through definitions of eedi reference values and appropriate reduction factors reduction factors for the majority of ship types are currently defined as a 10 reduction every 5 years with a vague link to europe 2020 strategy and an aim of achieving 30 co2 reduction for new ships by 2025 however it is essential to realize that this does not directly implicate a global reduction of co2 emission from ships global co2 emissions depend also on emissions from older ships for which eedi does not apply and even more on the size and operation profiles of the world fleet which is primarily determined by the economy growth and market demands it is extremely hard to scientifically link the co2 emission from ships and some environmental goal markandya et al 2014 suggest that the goal of achieving the greenhouse gas concentration levels necessary to maintain global temperature increases below 2 c above preindustrial levels i e 550 ppm could be technically feasible and economically viable meinhausen et al 2006 specify different co2 emission reduction rates in order to achieve different levels of the co2 in the atmosphere to achieve the concentration of the co2 in the atmosphere of 550 ppm the co2 emission growth rate should be between 1 01 and 0 62 per year ancic and sestan 2015 estimated the co2 emission increase of about 20 per year for bulk carriers if no regulation is implemented this indicates a clear need to regulate the energy efficiency of ships when assessing the impact of the current regulations on future co2 emissions from ships ancic and sestan 2015 estimated that it will result in an average co2 emission increase of about 6 3 per year this is substantially below the no regulation scenario but still high above the levels prescribed by meinhausen et al 2006 and indicates the need to correct the eedi requirements but without a clear environmental goal it is not possible to determine the appropriate reduction rates ancic et al 2018 proposed to categorize ships in different energy efficiency levels instead of currently used pass fail criterion in the eedi the similar approach is used for household appliances and provided certain level of energy efficiency increase without posing a threat to market balance apart from the reasons stated in the introduction the need for permanent improvement and development of environmental standards of ship machinery is inevitable for at least two additional reasons the first one involves the evolving sustainable public procurement standards where goods and services will inevitably concern contract award criteria regarding emissions and life cycle costing luttenberger and runko luttenberger 2016 from sustainability perspective that integrates economy environment and society the best energy is the one that needs not to be produced the second reason concerns sustainability reporting obligations of undertakings gri 2016 which for the time being apply to large companies but clearly indicate future requirements on entities as well eu 2014 the data to be reported extends to suppliers as well therefore potential obligations for both the shipowner and or the shipyard or second hand seller energy efficiency measures implemented by shipping companies should thus be reflected in improved indicators of economic performance environmental performance occupational health and safety societal performance with respect to local communities and product responsibility throughout the life cycle thereof 5 conclusion in this paper a methodology to analyse energy efficiency of ships with ips and hps is proposed this methodology was used to analyse energy efficiency of ro ro passenger ships ship delivered in the last 15 years were analysed based on their technical and hydrodynamic properties for the energy efficiency analysis in total 384 ships were used out of which 48 had ips or hps for every of those ships the estimated eedis were calculated and based on them eedi reference surface was proposed determining the referent eedi value for ro ro passenger ships depending on the ship capacity and speed after evaluating the energy efficiency performance of the entire fleet it was found that the majority of ships with ips or hps have their eedi values below the reference surface this leads to the conclusion that ships with ips or hps not only can be more energy efficient but in fact are more energy efficient compared to the fleet average acknowledgments this research was supported in part by croatian science foundation under the

23128,the bulge formed joint an innovative joint with a bulge plate employed for the connection between the braces and the chord was firstly put forward by authors however the degrees of bending dobs of the joint which are important to the accurate prediction of the fatigue life using the fracture mechanics method are unclear so far in this paper the finite element fe method verified by experimental data was utilized to investigate the dobs of the bulge formed k joints under balanced axial loads then the geometrical effects on the dobs at key locations the crown position and φ 105 position which is nearby the saddle position were investigated by 2117 fe models the geometrical parameters of the bulge formed k joint investigated in this study include τ s η 1 η 2 θ β γ τ of which the first three parameters are typical for the bulge formed joint and the other four are same as those in the unstiffened joint by large amounts of nonlinear regression analyses a set of parametric formulas were derived for the dobs keywords bulge formed k joint fracture mechanics degrees of bending dobs balanced axial loads 1 introduction tubular truss structures are widely used in offshore structures and port engineering structures due to the low drag coefficient and high strength weight ratio jia 2008 as shown in fig 1 a however the complex geometry and welds in the joints connections of members as shown in fig 1 b usually lead to high stress concentration so the fatigue damage is prone to occur in the joint under cycle loading ahmadi and lotfollahi yaghin 2016 usually the fatigue life of a tubular joint can be evaluated by the hot spot stress hss approach and the stress life s n curve the hss is the structural stress at the weld toe that includes the stress concentration caused by structural discontinuities except the weld itself maddox 2003 it is usually determined by extrapolation of the stresses out of the region affected by the weld as fricke and kahl 2005 said the hss can be calculated either by surface stress extrapolation or by stress linearization along the wall thickness both the methods exclude the local non linear stress peak caused by the notch effect in the weld toe whose effect is considered in the s n curve traditionally the hss is calculated by linear extrapolation method or quadratic extrapolation method based on the strains measured at two or three reference points near the weld toe radaj et al 2006 the above extrapolation methods are useful in both the experimental test and the finite element analysis the recommendations on the extrapolation approaches for tubular joints are presented in iiw xv e 2000 cidect zhao et al 2000 and api rp2a wsd 2014 etc for many tubular joints the hsss can be directly calculated by the norminal stresses and the corresponding parametric equations for the stress concentration factors scfs given in many design rules such as cidect iiw xv e and api rp2a wsd based on the hsss and the stress s n curve the fatigue life can be roughly estimated however large amounts of fatigue test data showed that either the different joints or the same joints under different load conditions which shared the similar hsss still exhibited significantly different fatigue life connolly and mary 1986 it is due to the factor that although the hsss are similar the stress distribution along the thickness may be different which therefore results in the changes in crack growth rate chang and dover 1999 the stress distribution along the thickness as well as other details such as the joint geometry weld angle and chord wall thickness were considered in the fatigue life prediction using fracture mechanics in the report by lee and bowness 2002b the results showed that the trends in the predicted fatigue lives obtained by fracture mechanics were superior to those obtained by s n approach in fig 2 a typical stress distribution along the chord wall thickness of a tubular joint is presented the stress along the chord thickness mainly includes the membrane stress component and the bending stress component chang and dover 1999 actually the stress in the chord surface at the weld region includes two parts one is the structural stress caused by the different responses of the chord and the brace the other is the notch stress caused by the notch effect at the weld toe as chang and dover 1999 said the notch stress which depends on the weld toe profile is cruical to the fatigue crack initiation however it has little effect for a deep crack also the fatigue crack initiation life is ignored in the fracture mechanics approach which may be acceptable in the fatigue life estimation for tubular joints since the initial defects such as micro cracks undercut or slag exist along the weld toe shen and choo 2012 regardless of the notch stress the degree of bending dob which is expressed as the ratio of bending stress to the sum of bending stress and membrane stress at the outer surface is used to describe the stress distribution along the wall thickness in the fracture mechanics the sif is a key parameter which can be expressed as 1 k y σ π a where y is the shape correction factor that depends on the geometry of the crack and specimen σ is the stress at the crack a is the crack depth and k is the stress intensity factor under the applied stress range the sif range can be calculated with the hss range δ σ 2 δ k k max k min y a δ σ π a bowness and lee 2002 used t butt joint solutions to calculate the sif approximately for tubular joints because of the similarity geometry between the t butt joint geometry and the unwrapped tubular intersection the t butt solutions can significantly reduce the effort required for the analyses and obtain reliable results lee and bowness 2002b according to the t butt solutions the sif for the crack in a tubular joint can be calculated by the scf and dob at the crack location as 3 k tubular joint y m scf 1 dob y b scf dob σ n π a where σ n is the nominal stress in the brace y m and y b are respectively the shape factors for the crack in the t butt joint under membrane and bending loading that can be calculated from 4 y t butt y plain plate m k where m k is the weld toe magnification factor that reflects the effect of the weld attachment on the crack finally eq 3 can be expressed as 5 k tubular joint m k m m m scf 1 dob m k b m b scf dob σ n π a where m m and m b are the shape factors for the crack in the plain plate under membrane and bending loading respectively based on the sif calculated by scf dob and the paris law paris and erdogan 1963 as eq 6 6 d a d n c δ k m therefore the remaining life can be calculated by the integration of d n from the initial crack a i to the final crack a f 7 n a i a f 1 c δ k m d a where c and m are material constants and the sif range δ k is expressed as eq 8 8 δ k m k m m m scf 1 dob m k b m b scf dob δ σ n π a where δ σ n is range of the nominal stress scf is the stress concentration factor m k m and m k b are the weld toe magnification factors for membrane stress and bending stress respectively from eqs 1 8 it can be seen that based on fracture mechanics the fatigue life of a tubular joint can be estimated by scfs dobs and σ n combined with the other constants such as m k m m m m k b and m b the calculation of sif scf and dob in tubular joints had been investigated in a lot of open literature as discussed in section 2 in the present paper an innovative stiffened tubular joint named the bulge formed joint was put forward with a chinese patent number 201610008519 3 sun et al 2016 this new type of joint had been used in a practical engineering fig 1 b due to its advantages one is the higher strength and stiffness compared with the unstiffened joint the other is that it can effectively avoid the overlap of braces which may lead to complex weld profiles sun et al 2016 the scfs of the bulge formed k joint had been investigated by the authors in another report nie et al 2017 however the dobs of the bulge formed k joint which are crucial to the fatigue life estimation by fracture mechanics have never been investigated before in the present study the geometrical effects on the dobs are investigated for the bulge formed k joint the geometrical parameters are defined as follows t s thickness of the bulge plate r s radius of the bulge plate in the xy plane h height of the bulge plate l s length of the bulge plate d chord diameter t chord thickness d brace diameter t brace thickness θ brace chord inclination angle l s 1 length of the un bulge part in the bulge plate l s length of bulge plate l s is not an independent parameter as it could be expressed as the function of h r s and l s 1 ls1 0 38 d in this study as shown in fig 3 so totally seven geometrical geometric parameters are investigated for the bulge formed k joint τ s η 1 η 2 β τ θ γ among which the first three parameters are typical for the bulge formed k joint τ s t s t η 1 2 r s d η 2 2 h d the other four β d d τ t t θ γ d 2 t are same as those in the unstiffened joint in this study the chord slenderness ratio α 2 l d and the brace slenderness ratio α b 2 l d were kept constant due to the limited effects on the dobs when they exceeded the critical values as discussed in section 3 4 based on the finite element fe method verified by the experimental data the geometrical effects on the dobs at the crown position and the φ 105 position the maximum scf location along the brace bulge plate intersection nearby the saddle position were investigated for the bulge formed k joints under the balanced axial loads then a set of dob equations were derived by large amounts of nonlinear analyses which were proved accurate enough for the prediction of the dobs 2 literature review 2 1 stress intensity factors sifs in tubular joints to calculate the sifs in tubular t joints bowness and lee 1995 proposed a modeling technique to accurately represent the semielliptical crack at the weld toe and the displacement extrapolation method was successfully used to evaluate the stress intensity factor solutions then chiew et al 2001 used the displacement extrapolation method proposed by bowness and lee 1995 to evaluate the sifs of a general cracked tubular y joint with the fe method which was then validated by a typical t joint with three different surface cracks lee and bowness 2002a investigated the stress intensity factors in the cracked tubular joints using the t butt solutions bowness and lee 2000a 2000b combined with the scfs and dobs in the uncracked tubular joints and excellent results were obtained for the shape factors for the shallow and narrow cracks for deeper cracks the predicted fatigue lives by fracture mechanic were superior to those predicted from the stress endurance method shen and choo 2012 investigated the sifs scfs and dobs of a grouted joint the results showed that the infilled grout reduced the scfs and dobs compared with the as welded tubular joint based on the sifs and the fatigue test results the effect of dob was proved essential in the fatigue life assessment for the grouted tubular joints shao and tjhen 2005 investigated the sifs for a tubular k joint by the j integral method which was validated by the experimental sifs obtained using the paris equation based on da dn and a t finally the parametric equations for sifs were derived based on 5120 numerical models under the balanced axial loading then the method was extended to the cracked tubular t y and k joints under combined loads by lee et al 2005 2 2 stress concentration factors scfs and degrees of bending dobs in tubular joints for the scfs of the tubular joints the reader is referred to cidect zhao et al 2000 api rp2a wsd 2014 and hse health and safety executive 1997 these rules cover many kinds of tubular joints such as t y x k xx kk and kt joints the study on the scfs of various kinds of tubular joints is helpful for engineers however the research about the dob was relatively less compared with the scf morgan and lee 1998 investigated the degree of bending dob distribution in offshore tubular k joints under the brace axial loading and the corresponding parametric equations for the dobs were derived with design guide factors employed to get conservative results ahmadi et al 2015 investigated the dobs and proposed the corresponding parametric equations for tubular k joints under in plane bending ipb loadings based on 81 fe models and the corresponding study under out of plane bending opb loadings was reported by ahmadi and asoodeh 2016 chang and dover 1999 investigated the dobs in tubular x and dt joints under different load conditions including single axial loading single ipb loading single opb loading balanced axial loading balanced ipb loading and balanced opb loading finally the corresponding parametric equations were derived based on the work of chang and dover a probability distribution analysis was conducted by ahmadi and ghaffari 2015 for the dobs of the tubular x joints under four bending loads i e single ipb single opb double ipb and double opb loadings 3 fe analysis for dobs 3 1 derivation of dob as mentioned in section 1 the degree of bending dob can be expressed as the ratio of the bending stress to the sum of the bending stress σ b and membrane stress σ m the bending stress σ b and membrane stress σ m can be calculated by the hsss at the outer surface σ o and the stress at the corresponding location at the inner surface σ i as shown in eqs 9 and 10 9 σ b σ o σ i 2 10 σ m σ o σ i 2 therefore the dob can be expressed as eq 11 11 dob 1 2 1 σ i σ o if the nominal stress in the brace is normalized to 1 σ o will equals scf 3 2 weld consideration as is known the weld profile has a great effect on the scfs in this study the weld details were considered in the fe models to get accurate scfs according to american welding society aws 2015 the dihedral angle along the brace chord intersection is a crucial parameter for the determination of the weld thickness similarly the weld thickness at the brace bulge plate intersection is determined by the dihedral angle between the brace and the bulge plate both the weld thickness and the dihedral angle along the intersection are shown in fig 4 and table 1 it is well known that the weld profile along the brace bulge plate intersection is too complicated to be modeled exactly so the simplification method proposed by lee 1999 approximately modeling the weld volume using concentric cylinders is adopted to ensure the smooth and accurate weld profiles it can be seen from section 4 that the created weld profiles predicted the scfs accurately 3 3 dihedral angle as illustrated in fig 5 p is a point at the brace chord intersection in a tubular joint s1 and s2 are respectively the tangential planes of the chord and the brace at point p n 1 and n 2 are the normal vectors of s1 and s2 respectively so the dihedral angle at the point p can be calculated by the supplement angle between the vectors n 1 and n 2 as expressed as eq 12 for the bulge formed joint the dihedral angle can also be determined in a similar way both the dihedral angle of the unstiffened tubular joint and the bulge formed joint are shown in fig 6 12 ψ π arc cos n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 3 4 boundary conditions and mesh details as morgan and lee 1998 pointed out the restraint condition of the chord fixed chord ends or pinned chord ends had influence on the scfs only for the cases with α 8 and large values of β and γ when the brace ends were unrestrained the scf only descended 2 6 when the length of the brace l increased from 3 d to 19 d in this paper α 14 93 and α b 7 55 were used for all models with the chord ends fixed the balanced axial loads and restraint condition are shown in fig 7 as discussed by herion et al 1996 3d quadratic solid elements can get more accurate stress results for the tubular joints which are also suggested by iiw xv e 2000 these elements are suitable for modeling the curved boundaries due to the compatible displacement shapes so in this study they were used for modeling the welds braces chords and the bulge plates mesh details for the bulge formed k joint are shown in fig 8 convergence check was conducted for the fe models before the investigation of the dobs four layers of elements through the bulge plate thickness and two layers of elements through the brace thickness were adopted respectively totally 36 divisions were used for half the circle of the brace bulge plate intersection to check the convergence of the calculation results three different mesh densities respectively coarse mesh original mesh and refined mesh were used for comparison as shown in fig 8 the element numbers and the dob results are listed in table 2 it was observed that the relative error between the coarse mesh and the original mesh wass about 3 3 however the error between the original mesh and the refined mesh was only 0 6 it indicated that the original mesh and refined mesh already tended to converge finally the original mesh was adopted in this study 3 5 extraction of scf to calculate the scf the hss is extrapolated by the points in the extrapolation region the linear extrapolation method is recommended for the hss calculation for circular hollow section chs joints in cidect zhao et al 2000 and iiw xv e 2000 the extrapolation region given by cidect zhao et al 2000 and iiw xv e 2000 for the crown and saddle positions are listed in table 3 which were originally obtained based on the experimental data empirically another extrapolation method was recommended by romeijn 1994 i e the linear extrapolation for the hss based on two extrapolation points respectively 0 4t0 1 4t0 away from the weld toe in his paper the extrapolation method was proved more simplified and less sensitive after the discussion about the limits of the extrapolation region with reference to the scale effect this extrapolation region was also used by karamanos et al 2000 ahmadi and lotfollahi yaghin 2012 ahmadi et al 2011 and ahmadi et al 2012 in the present study the extrapolation region from 0 4t0 to 1 4t0 as shown in fig 9 was used to calculate the scfs of the bulge formed joint in fig 9 t is the wall thickness σ is the hss in the perpendicular direction at the weld toe σ 0 4 t and σ 0 4 t are respectively the stresses in the perpendicular direction of the weld toe at point 1 and point 2 the hss at the weld toe is linearly extrapolated as shown in eq 13 it should be noted that to calculate of the scfs along the brace bulge plate intersection in the bulge formed joint t in eq 13 and table 3 will replaced by the thickness of the bulge plate t s by the comparison between the dob results obtained from the two extrapolation methods one using the extrapolation region 0 4t and 1 4t the other using the extrapolation region recommended by cidect or iiw xv e it was found that the differences were negligible i e the relative errors between the results were less than 0 15 so in the following study the extrapolation 0 4t and 1 4t was adopted which was then verified by the experimental data 13 σ h s 1 4 σ 0 4 t 0 4 σ 1 4 t as to the direction of the hss the direction perpendicular to weld toe is recommended by api rp2a wsd 2014 cidect zhao et al 2000 and mashiri et al 2004 while in iiw xv e 2000 the principal stress approximately in line with i e within a deviation of 60 the direction perpendicular to the weld toe is recommended for the case that the deviation between principal stress and perpendicular direction is greater than 60 the stress in the parallel direction of the weld toe is recommended in this paper the direction perpendicular to the weld toe was adopted for the hss the stress perpendicular to the weld toe can be calculated as 14 σ σ x l 1 2 σ y m 1 2 σ z n 1 2 2 τ x y l 1 m 1 τ y z m 1 n 1 τ z x n 1 l 1 where the σ x σ y σ z τ x y τ y z τ z x are stress components and l 1 m 1 n 1 are the direction cosines of x y and z axis σ is the stress component perpendicular to the weld toe then the scf is calculated as 15 scf σ h s σ n where the nominal stress σ n under the balanced axial loads is calculate by eq 16 16 σ n 4 f π d 2 d 2 t 2 where d and t are the diameter and thickness of the brace respectively 3 6 sensitivity analysis of sif with respect to dob as discussed in section 3 4 the mesh density used in the fe analysis may cause an error of 0 6 in the calculation of the dobs so it is necessary to conduct a sensitivity analysis of sif with respect to dob based on the sensitivity theory presented in christensen and klarbring 2008 the sensitivity ε is used to represent the change of sif caused by that of dob as shown in eq 17 17 ε δsif sif δdob dob in this equation the δsif means the sif range caused by the dob range i e δdob based on eq 5 ε is finally expressed as eq 18 18 ε m k m m m m k b m b m k m m m 1 dob 1 m k b m b according to eq 18 the sensitivity ε can be calculated by the parameters m k m m m m k b m b obtained from the t butt solution bowness and lee 2002 and the dob of the bulge formed k joint m k m and m k b were obtained from the t butt solution in bowness and lee 2002 m m and m b were obtained from the newman and raju s empirical intensity factor equation for the cracked plain plate newman and raju 1981 they are determined by the crack depth a t crack aspect ratio a c weld attachment footprint l t weld angle θ weld toe radius ρ t and width ratio of the crack to the cracked plain plate c b in the present study the weld toe radius ρ t was selected to be 0 1 to represent the ground weld toe θ 45 was used to represent the average weld angle and the width ratio of the crack to the cracked plain plate c b was equal to 0 the weld attachment footprint l t was equal to 1 25 which was about the average value of the 2117 fe models in this study the ranges of the crack depth a t and the crack aspect ratio a c are listed in table 4 the average value of the dobs obtained from the 2117 fe models is 0 76 finally the sensitivity results ε for different crack depths a t and crack aspect ratios a c are listed in table 4 it can be concluded from table 4 that most of the sensitivity values are in the range of 0 01 to 3 94 however for the case with a c 1 and a t 0 9 the sensitivity value is 9 9 it means that 1 change of the dob i e δdob dob 1 may lead to 0 01 to 3 94 change of the sif i e δsif sif 0 01 3 94 for most cases and 9 9 change of the sif for the case with a c 1 and a t 0 9 4 validation 4 1 experimental details the experiment was conducted according to the recommendations given in cidect zhao et al 2000 a bulge formed k joint was fabricated to verify the fe method which included the geometrical modeling chord braces bulge plate and weld profile the mesh details element type and size and the dob extraction method the details of the test specimen are shown in fig 10 and table 3 the test rig as shown in fig 11 consisted of the counterforce frame the specimen and two hydraulic actuating cylinders the specimen was connected to the counterforce frame by flanges the hydraulic actuating cylinders which were employed to apply the brace axial loads on the specimen were connected to the counterforce frame and the specimen by pins the material of the counterforce frame and the specimen was q345 whose yield stress and ultimate stress were 345 mpa and 510 mpa respectively due to the limitations of the experiment condition it was difficult to apply the balanced axial loads i e one brace is under axial compressive load and the other brace under axial tensile load and the axial compressive load is equal to the axial tensile load in value so the unbalanced axial compressive loads were applied to the braces in this test under the unbalanced axial compressive loads both the braces are subjected to 50 kn in axial compression because the dob is obtained in the linear elastic state of the material the fe model validated under the test load are also believed feasible for the balanced axial loads the strain gauges were arranged along the brace bulge plate intersection at an interval of 30 to capture the strains due to the symmetry only half the intersection was measured with the strain gauges as shown in fig 12 the scfs in the outer surface of the bulge plate were measured however no strain gauges were bonded to the inner surface of the bulge plate because it was impossible for the bulge formed joint at each measured point two strain gauges were used one was in the perpendicular direction the other in the parallel direction the dh3820 a strain data acquisition system consisted of the hardware system including data acquisition card signal amplifier and data processing module and the software system was utilized to measure the strains the strain components at the weld toe were linearly extrapolated by those at the measured points then the hhs at the weld toe could be derived by the parallel and perpendicular strain according to the relationship between of scf and sncf the strain concentration factor calculated by ε ε n given by shao 2007 and niemi et al 2006 19 scf 1 ν ε ε 1 ν 2 sncf i e 20 σ σ n σ e ε n 1 ν ε ε 1 ν 2 ε ε n finally 21 σ 1 ν ε ε 1 ν 2 e ε c e ε where c 1 ν ε ε 1 ν 2 the average value of c measured in the test was 1 19 which was close to the value 1 20 for the unstiffened tubular joints recommended by cidect zhao et al 2000 zhao et al 2000 in the present study the poisson s ratio ν and elastic modulus e for the steel material were 0 3 and 206 gpa respectively 4 2 experimental results both the test data and fe results of the scfs under the test load are shown in fig 13 the tested scfs coincided well with the scfs calculated by the fe method which validated the fe models in the stress analysis because the study of the scfs and dobs was under linear elastic state of the material the fe model validated under the test load was also feasible for the study of dobs under the balanced axial loads the similar validation method was also utilized by ahmadi et al 2016 along the brace bulge plate intersection the polar angle φ measured from the crown position was used to mark the position 5 parametric study 5 1 details of the parametric study as validated by the experimental data the fe models were utilized to investigate geometrical effects on the dobs under the balanced axial loads in another report the authors had found that the maximum scf at the brace bulge plate intersection of the bulge formed k joint under the balanced axial loads is located at the φ 105 position while the minimum scf is located at the heel position nie et al 2017 so in the following passages only the dobs at the crown and φ 105 positions were investigated the dob at the heel position was not considered because the scf at this position was minimum compared with the crown and φ 105 positions to investigate the geometrical effects on the dobs different values were assigned for the geometrical parameters as listed in table 6 α 14 93 and α b 7 55 were used for all the models as discussed in section 3 4 totally 2117 fe models were analyzed to investigate the effects of the geometrical parameters on the dobs a large amount of comparisons were conducted and only a few typical comparisons were presented for brevity it should be noted that all the possible combinations of parameters listed in table 5 is 3645 calculated by 3 6 5 however in this paper we mainly focus on the cases that the brace is totally connected to the bulge part marked with in fig 3 r s the combinations of the parameters which may lead to the connection of the brace and the un bulge part marked with l s 1 in fig 3 are not included in this study because this kind of connection may lead to a different dob distribution along the brace bulge plate intersection due to their complex weld paths in the following research only 2117 cases that the braces were completely connected to the bulge part were investigated 5 2 effects of β and γ on the dobs the parameter β a crucial parameter for the tubular joint is the ratio of brace diameter to chord diameter when the chord diameter is kept unchanged the brace diameter increases with the increase of β the effect of β on the dobs is shown in fig 14 it exhibits a positive relation between β and the dobs i e with the increase of β the dobs at the crown and φ 105 positions increase the parameter γ is the ratio of radius to thickness of the chord so the increase of γ results in the decrease of thickness when the chord diameter remains unchanged as shown in fig 14 with the increase of γ the dobs at the crown and φ 105 positions increase 5 3 effect of τ on the dobs the parameter τ is the ratio of brace thickness to chord thickness the brace thickness increases with the increase of τ for a constant chord thickness the effect of τ was investigated combined with β as shown in fig 15 with the increase of τ the dobs increase for the case β 0 3 but decrease for the cases β 0 45 and 0 6 at the crown and φ 105 positions 5 4 effect of θ on the dobs the parameter θ the inclination angle between the brace and the chord is an important parameter that affects the arrangement of braces and chords in a tubular truss structure as shown in fig 16 with the increase of θ the dobs increase at the crown and φ 105 positions 5 5 effects of τ s and η 1 on the dobs the parameter τ s is the ratio of the thickness of bulge plate to the chord thickness as shown in fig 17 with the increase of τ s the dobs decrease at the crown and φ 105 positions the parameter η 1 is the ratio of the radius of the bulge plate in the xy plane as shown in fig 3 to the chord radius with the increase of η 1 the dob decreases at the crown position but increases at the φ 105 position 5 6 effect of η 2 on the dobs the parameter η 2 denotes the ratio of the height of the bulge plate to the chord radius as shown in fig 18 the effects of η 2 on the dob at the crown position should be discussed for different τ s for the cases τ s 1 and 1 5 the dob decreases with the increase of η 2 for the case τ s 2 the dob increases as η 2 increases from 0 5 to 0 7 and then decreases as η 2 increases from 0 7 to 0 9 for the φ 105 position the effect of η 2 on the dob is negligible for the cases τ s 1 and 1 5 but for the case τ s 2 the dob increases as η 2 increases from 0 5 to 0 7 and then remains almost unchanged as η 2 increases from 0 7 to 0 9 6 parametric equations for dobs 6 1 parametric equations in order to predict the dobs at the key locations of the bulge formed k joints under the balanced axial loads a set of parametric equations were derived by large amounts of nonlinear regression analyses based on the 2117 fe models in these equations the geometrical parameters include β γ τ θ τ s η 1 and η 2 in the nonlinear regression analyses the trail function was similar to that used by chang and dover 1996 and the first terms and cross terms of the geometrical parameters were added in the trail function to get accurate fitting results by large amounts of nonlinear regression analyses the dob equations were derived with high determination coefficients r2 the dob equations for the crown and φ 105 positions are given by eqs 22 and 23 respectively crown position 22

6 2 assessment of the parametric equations to evaluate the proposed dob equations an error analysis was conducted using the method given by shao et al 2009 the relative errors were calculated according to eq 24 to compare the predicted dobs calculated from the parametric equations with the fe results for the 2117 models 24 e 1 dob p dob r dob r 100 in the equation dob p and dob r are the calculated dobs according to the proposed equations and the fe results respectively the comparisons between dob p and dob r at the crown and φ 105 positions of the 2117 models are plotted in fig 19 a and b respectively as shown in fig 19 and table 7 it can be seen that the errors in the crown position are less than 9 for φ 105 position the errors are less than 3 5 for 99 6 cases and the errors for the other 4 cases are less than 6 it shows a good agreement between the predicted dobs dob p and the recorded dobs dob r in the fatigue life estimation the safety of the dob equations should be further considered the underestimation of dobs means a conservative prediction of the fatigue life while an overestimation of dobs may be too optimistic for the estimation of the fatigue life as is known for the case under the same nominal stress and dob a higher scf means a higher hss and a shorter fatigue life furthermore for the case under the same nominal stress and scf a lower dob means a relatively higher membrane stress at the hot spot which means a shorter fatigue life due to the contribution of the membrane stress on the fatigue crack development so the acceptance criteria p r 1 25 was proposed by morgan and lee 1998 for the dob equations to ensure the conservative estimation of the fatigue life p stands for the predicted dob from the proposed equation r strands for the recorded dob from the fe analysis or test p r stands for the ratio between them also to revise the dob equation which doesn t meet the condition a design factor is recommended for the dob equation as a product term then the revised dob equation which meets the acceptance is considered safe for the fatigue life estimation the design factor is expressed as eq 25 ahmadi et al 2012 ahmadi and zavvar 2015 25 design factor dob design dob eq by multiple comparative analyses the design factors 0 96 and 0 97 were recommended for eqs 22 and 23 respectively the revised equations are given as eqs 26 and 27 26 dob design crown 0 96 dob crown 27 dob design φ 105 0 97 dob φ 105 the design factors are used to increase the reliability of the equations and avoid the remarkable over prediction for dobs which may lead to an un conservative prediction of the fatigue life the assessment of the unrevised and revised equations are listed in table 8 7 conclusions in this paper the dobs were investigated for an innovative stiffened k joint called the bulge formed k joint under the balanced axial loads based on 2117 fe models validated by the experiment data the effects of the geometrical parameters β τ γ θ τ s η 1 and η 2 on the dobs at the key locations the crown and φ 105 positions were concluded as follows with the increase of β γ and θ the dobs increase at the crown and φ 105 positions with the increase of τ the dobs increase for the case β 0 3 but decrease for the cases β 0 45 and 0 6 at the crown and φ 105 positions with the increase of τ s the dobs decrease at the crown and φ 105 positions with the increase of η 1 the dob decreases at the crown position but increases at the φ 105 position the effect of η 2 on the dobs should be discussed for different locations separately for the crown position with the increase of η 2 the dob decreases for the cases τ s 1 and 1 5 but for the case τ s 2 the dob increases as η 2 increases from 0 5 to 0 7 and then decreases as η 2 increases from 0 7 to 0 9 for the φ 105 position the effect of η 2 on the dobs is negligible for the cases τ s 1 and 1 5 but for the case τ s 2 the dob increases as η 2 increases from 0 5 to 0 7 and then remains almost unchanged as η 2 increases from 0 7 to 0 9 finally the dob equations were derived by a large amount of nonlinear regression analyses based on the fe database the good agreement between the predicted dobs and the recorded dobs indicates that the proposed equations are accurate enough to predict the dobs for the bulge formed k joints then the design factors were derived for the equations to ensure the conservative estimation of dobs for the fatigue life prediction acknowledgements this work was supported by the science and technology commission of shanghai municipality china

23128,the bulge formed joint an innovative joint with a bulge plate employed for the connection between the braces and the chord was firstly put forward by authors however the degrees of bending dobs of the joint which are important to the accurate prediction of the fatigue life using the fracture mechanics method are unclear so far in this paper the finite element fe method verified by experimental data was utilized to investigate the dobs of the bulge formed k joints under balanced axial loads then the geometrical effects on the dobs at key locations the crown position and φ 105 position which is nearby the saddle position were investigated by 2117 fe models the geometrical parameters of the bulge formed k joint investigated in this study include τ s η 1 η 2 θ β γ τ of which the first three parameters are typical for the bulge formed joint and the other four are same as those in the unstiffened joint by large amounts of nonlinear regression analyses a set of parametric formulas were derived for the dobs keywords bulge formed k joint fracture mechanics degrees of bending dobs balanced axial loads 1 introduction tubular truss structures are widely used in offshore structures and port engineering structures due to the low drag coefficient and high strength weight ratio jia 2008 as shown in fig 1 a however the complex geometry and welds in the joints connections of members as shown in fig 1 b usually lead to high stress concentration so the fatigue damage is prone to occur in the joint under cycle loading ahmadi and lotfollahi yaghin 2016 usually the fatigue life of a tubular joint can be evaluated by the hot spot stress hss approach and the stress life s n curve the hss is the structural stress at the weld toe that includes the stress concentration caused by structural discontinuities except the weld itself maddox 2003 it is usually determined by extrapolation of the stresses out of the region affected by the weld as fricke and kahl 2005 said the hss can be calculated either by surface stress extrapolation or by stress linearization along the wall thickness both the methods exclude the local non linear stress peak caused by the notch effect in the weld toe whose effect is considered in the s n curve traditionally the hss is calculated by linear extrapolation method or quadratic extrapolation method based on the strains measured at two or three reference points near the weld toe radaj et al 2006 the above extrapolation methods are useful in both the experimental test and the finite element analysis the recommendations on the extrapolation approaches for tubular joints are presented in iiw xv e 2000 cidect zhao et al 2000 and api rp2a wsd 2014 etc for many tubular joints the hsss can be directly calculated by the norminal stresses and the corresponding parametric equations for the stress concentration factors scfs given in many design rules such as cidect iiw xv e and api rp2a wsd based on the hsss and the stress s n curve the fatigue life can be roughly estimated however large amounts of fatigue test data showed that either the different joints or the same joints under different load conditions which shared the similar hsss still exhibited significantly different fatigue life connolly and mary 1986 it is due to the factor that although the hsss are similar the stress distribution along the thickness may be different which therefore results in the changes in crack growth rate chang and dover 1999 the stress distribution along the thickness as well as other details such as the joint geometry weld angle and chord wall thickness were considered in the fatigue life prediction using fracture mechanics in the report by lee and bowness 2002b the results showed that the trends in the predicted fatigue lives obtained by fracture mechanics were superior to those obtained by s n approach in fig 2 a typical stress distribution along the chord wall thickness of a tubular joint is presented the stress along the chord thickness mainly includes the membrane stress component and the bending stress component chang and dover 1999 actually the stress in the chord surface at the weld region includes two parts one is the structural stress caused by the different responses of the chord and the brace the other is the notch stress caused by the notch effect at the weld toe as chang and dover 1999 said the notch stress which depends on the weld toe profile is cruical to the fatigue crack initiation however it has little effect for a deep crack also the fatigue crack initiation life is ignored in the fracture mechanics approach which may be acceptable in the fatigue life estimation for tubular joints since the initial defects such as micro cracks undercut or slag exist along the weld toe shen and choo 2012 regardless of the notch stress the degree of bending dob which is expressed as the ratio of bending stress to the sum of bending stress and membrane stress at the outer surface is used to describe the stress distribution along the wall thickness in the fracture mechanics the sif is a key parameter which can be expressed as 1 k y σ π a where y is the shape correction factor that depends on the geometry of the crack and specimen σ is the stress at the crack a is the crack depth and k is the stress intensity factor under the applied stress range the sif range can be calculated with the hss range δ σ 2 δ k k max k min y a δ σ π a bowness and lee 2002 used t butt joint solutions to calculate the sif approximately for tubular joints because of the similarity geometry between the t butt joint geometry and the unwrapped tubular intersection the t butt solutions can significantly reduce the effort required for the analyses and obtain reliable results lee and bowness 2002b according to the t butt solutions the sif for the crack in a tubular joint can be calculated by the scf and dob at the crack location as 3 k tubular joint y m scf 1 dob y b scf dob σ n π a where σ n is the nominal stress in the brace y m and y b are respectively the shape factors for the crack in the t butt joint under membrane and bending loading that can be calculated from 4 y t butt y plain plate m k where m k is the weld toe magnification factor that reflects the effect of the weld attachment on the crack finally eq 3 can be expressed as 5 k tubular joint m k m m m scf 1 dob m k b m b scf dob σ n π a where m m and m b are the shape factors for the crack in the plain plate under membrane and bending loading respectively based on the sif calculated by scf dob and the paris law paris and erdogan 1963 as eq 6 6 d a d n c δ k m therefore the remaining life can be calculated by the integration of d n from the initial crack a i to the final crack a f 7 n a i a f 1 c δ k m d a where c and m are material constants and the sif range δ k is expressed as eq 8 8 δ k m k m m m scf 1 dob m k b m b scf dob δ σ n π a where δ σ n is range of the nominal stress scf is the stress concentration factor m k m and m k b are the weld toe magnification factors for membrane stress and bending stress respectively from eqs 1 8 it can be seen that based on fracture mechanics the fatigue life of a tubular joint can be estimated by scfs dobs and σ n combined with the other constants such as m k m m m m k b and m b the calculation of sif scf and dob in tubular joints had been investigated in a lot of open literature as discussed in section 2 in the present paper an innovative stiffened tubular joint named the bulge formed joint was put forward with a chinese patent number 201610008519 3 sun et al 2016 this new type of joint had been used in a practical engineering fig 1 b due to its advantages one is the higher strength and stiffness compared with the unstiffened joint the other is that it can effectively avoid the overlap of braces which may lead to complex weld profiles sun et al 2016 the scfs of the bulge formed k joint had been investigated by the authors in another report nie et al 2017 however the dobs of the bulge formed k joint which are crucial to the fatigue life estimation by fracture mechanics have never been investigated before in the present study the geometrical effects on the dobs are investigated for the bulge formed k joint the geometrical parameters are defined as follows t s thickness of the bulge plate r s radius of the bulge plate in the xy plane h height of the bulge plate l s length of the bulge plate d chord diameter t chord thickness d brace diameter t brace thickness θ brace chord inclination angle l s 1 length of the un bulge part in the bulge plate l s length of bulge plate l s is not an independent parameter as it could be expressed as the function of h r s and l s 1 ls1 0 38 d in this study as shown in fig 3 so totally seven geometrical geometric parameters are investigated for the bulge formed k joint τ s η 1 η 2 β τ θ γ among which the first three parameters are typical for the bulge formed k joint τ s t s t η 1 2 r s d η 2 2 h d the other four β d d τ t t θ γ d 2 t are same as those in the unstiffened joint in this study the chord slenderness ratio α 2 l d and the brace slenderness ratio α b 2 l d were kept constant due to the limited effects on the dobs when they exceeded the critical values as discussed in section 3 4 based on the finite element fe method verified by the experimental data the geometrical effects on the dobs at the crown position and the φ 105 position the maximum scf location along the brace bulge plate intersection nearby the saddle position were investigated for the bulge formed k joints under the balanced axial loads then a set of dob equations were derived by large amounts of nonlinear analyses which were proved accurate enough for the prediction of the dobs 2 literature review 2 1 stress intensity factors sifs in tubular joints to calculate the sifs in tubular t joints bowness and lee 1995 proposed a modeling technique to accurately represent the semielliptical crack at the weld toe and the displacement extrapolation method was successfully used to evaluate the stress intensity factor solutions then chiew et al 2001 used the displacement extrapolation method proposed by bowness and lee 1995 to evaluate the sifs of a general cracked tubular y joint with the fe method which was then validated by a typical t joint with three different surface cracks lee and bowness 2002a investigated the stress intensity factors in the cracked tubular joints using the t butt solutions bowness and lee 2000a 2000b combined with the scfs and dobs in the uncracked tubular joints and excellent results were obtained for the shape factors for the shallow and narrow cracks for deeper cracks the predicted fatigue lives by fracture mechanic were superior to those predicted from the stress endurance method shen and choo 2012 investigated the sifs scfs and dobs of a grouted joint the results showed that the infilled grout reduced the scfs and dobs compared with the as welded tubular joint based on the sifs and the fatigue test results the effect of dob was proved essential in the fatigue life assessment for the grouted tubular joints shao and tjhen 2005 investigated the sifs for a tubular k joint by the j integral method which was validated by the experimental sifs obtained using the paris equation based on da dn and a t finally the parametric equations for sifs were derived based on 5120 numerical models under the balanced axial loading then the method was extended to the cracked tubular t y and k joints under combined loads by lee et al 2005 2 2 stress concentration factors scfs and degrees of bending dobs in tubular joints for the scfs of the tubular joints the reader is referred to cidect zhao et al 2000 api rp2a wsd 2014 and hse health and safety executive 1997 these rules cover many kinds of tubular joints such as t y x k xx kk and kt joints the study on the scfs of various kinds of tubular joints is helpful for engineers however the research about the dob was relatively less compared with the scf morgan and lee 1998 investigated the degree of bending dob distribution in offshore tubular k joints under the brace axial loading and the corresponding parametric equations for the dobs were derived with design guide factors employed to get conservative results ahmadi et al 2015 investigated the dobs and proposed the corresponding parametric equations for tubular k joints under in plane bending ipb loadings based on 81 fe models and the corresponding study under out of plane bending opb loadings was reported by ahmadi and asoodeh 2016 chang and dover 1999 investigated the dobs in tubular x and dt joints under different load conditions including single axial loading single ipb loading single opb loading balanced axial loading balanced ipb loading and balanced opb loading finally the corresponding parametric equations were derived based on the work of chang and dover a probability distribution analysis was conducted by ahmadi and ghaffari 2015 for the dobs of the tubular x joints under four bending loads i e single ipb single opb double ipb and double opb loadings 3 fe analysis for dobs 3 1 derivation of dob as mentioned in section 1 the degree of bending dob can be expressed as the ratio of the bending stress to the sum of the bending stress σ b and membrane stress σ m the bending stress σ b and membrane stress σ m can be calculated by the hsss at the outer surface σ o and the stress at the corresponding location at the inner surface σ i as shown in eqs 9 and 10 9 σ b σ o σ i 2 10 σ m σ o σ i 2 therefore the dob can be expressed as eq 11 11 dob 1 2 1 σ i σ o if the nominal stress in the brace is normalized to 1 σ o will equals scf 3 2 weld consideration as is known the weld profile has a great effect on the scfs in this study the weld details were considered in the fe models to get accurate scfs according to american welding society aws 2015 the dihedral angle along the brace chord intersection is a crucial parameter for the determination of the weld thickness similarly the weld thickness at the brace bulge plate intersection is determined by the dihedral angle between the brace and the bulge plate both the weld thickness and the dihedral angle along the intersection are shown in fig 4 and table 1 it is well known that the weld profile along the brace bulge plate intersection is too complicated to be modeled exactly so the simplification method proposed by lee 1999 approximately modeling the weld volume using concentric cylinders is adopted to ensure the smooth and accurate weld profiles it can be seen from section 4 that the created weld profiles predicted the scfs accurately 3 3 dihedral angle as illustrated in fig 5 p is a point at the brace chord intersection in a tubular joint s1 and s2 are respectively the tangential planes of the chord and the brace at point p n 1 and n 2 are the normal vectors of s1 and s2 respectively so the dihedral angle at the point p can be calculated by the supplement angle between the vectors n 1 and n 2 as expressed as eq 12 for the bulge formed joint the dihedral angle can also be determined in a similar way both the dihedral angle of the unstiffened tubular joint and the bulge formed joint are shown in fig 6 12 ψ π arc cos n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 3 4 boundary conditions and mesh details as morgan and lee 1998 pointed out the restraint condition of the chord fixed chord ends or pinned chord ends had influence on the scfs only for the cases with α 8 and large values of β and γ when the brace ends were unrestrained the scf only descended 2 6 when the length of the brace l increased from 3 d to 19 d in this paper α 14 93 and α b 7 55 were used for all models with the chord ends fixed the balanced axial loads and restraint condition are shown in fig 7 as discussed by herion et al 1996 3d quadratic solid elements can get more accurate stress results for the tubular joints which are also suggested by iiw xv e 2000 these elements are suitable for modeling the curved boundaries due to the compatible displacement shapes so in this study they were used for modeling the welds braces chords and the bulge plates mesh details for the bulge formed k joint are shown in fig 8 convergence check was conducted for the fe models before the investigation of the dobs four layers of elements through the bulge plate thickness and two layers of elements through the brace thickness were adopted respectively totally 36 divisions were used for half the circle of the brace bulge plate intersection to check the convergence of the calculation results three different mesh densities respectively coarse mesh original mesh and refined mesh were used for comparison as shown in fig 8 the element numbers and the dob results are listed in table 2 it was observed that the relative error between the coarse mesh and the original mesh wass about 3 3 however the error between the original mesh and the refined mesh was only 0 6 it indicated that the original mesh and refined mesh already tended to converge finally the original mesh was adopted in this study 3 5 extraction of scf to calculate the scf the hss is extrapolated by the points in the extrapolation region the linear extrapolation method is recommended for the hss calculation for circular hollow section chs joints in cidect zhao et al 2000 and iiw xv e 2000 the extrapolation region given by cidect zhao et al 2000 and iiw xv e 2000 for the crown and saddle positions are listed in table 3 which were originally obtained based on the experimental data empirically another extrapolation method was recommended by romeijn 1994 i e the linear extrapolation for the hss based on two extrapolation points respectively 0 4t0 1 4t0 away from the weld toe in his paper the extrapolation method was proved more simplified and less sensitive after the discussion about the limits of the extrapolation region with reference to the scale effect this extrapolation region was also used by karamanos et al 2000 ahmadi and lotfollahi yaghin 2012 ahmadi et al 2011 and ahmadi et al 2012 in the present study the extrapolation region from 0 4t0 to 1 4t0 as shown in fig 9 was used to calculate the scfs of the bulge formed joint in fig 9 t is the wall thickness σ is the hss in the perpendicular direction at the weld toe σ 0 4 t and σ 0 4 t are respectively the stresses in the perpendicular direction of the weld toe at point 1 and point 2 the hss at the weld toe is linearly extrapolated as shown in eq 13 it should be noted that to calculate of the scfs along the brace bulge plate intersection in the bulge formed joint t in eq 13 and table 3 will replaced by the thickness of the bulge plate t s by the comparison between the dob results obtained from the two extrapolation methods one using the extrapolation region 0 4t and 1 4t the other using the extrapolation region recommended by cidect or iiw xv e it was found that the differences were negligible i e the relative errors between the results were less than 0 15 so in the following study the extrapolation 0 4t and 1 4t was adopted which was then verified by the experimental data 13 σ h s 1 4 σ 0 4 t 0 4 σ 1 4 t as to the direction of the hss the direction perpendicular to weld toe is recommended by api rp2a wsd 2014 cidect zhao et al 2000 and mashiri et al 2004 while in iiw xv e 2000 the principal stress approximately in line with i e within a deviation of 60 the direction perpendicular to the weld toe is recommended for the case that the deviation between principal stress and perpendicular direction is greater than 60 the stress in the parallel direction of the weld toe is recommended in this paper the direction perpendicular to the weld toe was adopted for the hss the stress perpendicular to the weld toe can be calculated as 14 σ σ x l 1 2 σ y m 1 2 σ z n 1 2 2 τ x y l 1 m 1 τ y z m 1 n 1 τ z x n 1 l 1 where the σ x σ y σ z τ x y τ y z τ z x are stress components and l 1 m 1 n 1 are the direction cosines of x y and z axis σ is the stress component perpendicular to the weld toe then the scf is calculated as 15 scf σ h s σ n where the nominal stress σ n under the balanced axial loads is calculate by eq 16 16 σ n 4 f π d 2 d 2 t 2 where d and t are the diameter and thickness of the brace respectively 3 6 sensitivity analysis of sif with respect to dob as discussed in section 3 4 the mesh density used in the fe analysis may cause an error of 0 6 in the calculation of the dobs so it is necessary to conduct a sensitivity analysis of sif with respect to dob based on the sensitivity theory presented in christensen and klarbring 2008 the sensitivity ε is used to represent the change of sif caused by that of dob as shown in eq 17 17 ε δsif sif δdob dob in this equation the δsif means the sif range caused by the dob range i e δdob based on eq 5 ε is finally expressed as eq 18 18 ε m k m m m m k b m b m k m m m 1 dob 1 m k b m b according to eq 18 the sensitivity ε can be calculated by the parameters m k m m m m k b m b obtained from the t butt solution bowness and lee 2002 and the dob of the bulge formed k joint m k m and m k b were obtained from the t butt solution in bowness and lee 2002 m m and m b were obtained from the newman and raju s empirical intensity factor equation for the cracked plain plate newman and raju 1981 they are determined by the crack depth a t crack aspect ratio a c weld attachment footprint l t weld angle θ weld toe radius ρ t and width ratio of the crack to the cracked plain plate c b in the present study the weld toe radius ρ t was selected to be 0 1 to represent the ground weld toe θ 45 was used to represent the average weld angle and the width ratio of the crack to the cracked plain plate c b was equal to 0 the weld attachment footprint l t was equal to 1 25 which was about the average value of the 2117 fe models in this study the ranges of the crack depth a t and the crack aspect ratio a c are listed in table 4 the average value of the dobs obtained from the 2117 fe models is 0 76 finally the sensitivity results ε for different crack depths a t and crack aspect ratios a c are listed in table 4 it can be concluded from table 4 that most of the sensitivity values are in the range of 0 01 to 3 94 however for the case with a c 1 and a t 0 9 the sensitivity value is 9 9 it means that 1 change of the dob i e δdob dob 1 may lead to 0 01 to 3 94 change of the sif i e δsif sif 0 01 3 94 for most cases and 9 9 change of the sif for the case with a c 1 and a t 0 9 4 validation 4 1 experimental details the experiment was conducted according to the recommendations given in cidect zhao et al 2000 a bulge formed k joint was fabricated to verify the fe method which included the geometrical modeling chord braces bulge plate and weld profile the mesh details element type and size and the dob extraction method the details of the test specimen are shown in fig 10 and table 3 the test rig as shown in fig 11 consisted of the counterforce frame the specimen and two hydraulic actuating cylinders the specimen was connected to the counterforce frame by flanges the hydraulic actuating cylinders which were employed to apply the brace axial loads on the specimen were connected to the counterforce frame and the specimen by pins the material of the counterforce frame and the specimen was q345 whose yield stress and ultimate stress were 345 mpa and 510 mpa respectively due to the limitations of the experiment condition it was difficult to apply the balanced axial loads i e one brace is under axial compressive load and the other brace under axial tensile load and the axial compressive load is equal to the axial tensile load in value so the unbalanced axial compressive loads were applied to the braces in this test under the unbalanced axial compressive loads both the braces are subjected to 50 kn in axial compression because the dob is obtained in the linear elastic state of the material the fe model validated under the test load are also believed feasible for the balanced axial loads the strain gauges were arranged along the brace bulge plate intersection at an interval of 30 to capture the strains due to the symmetry only half the intersection was measured with the strain gauges as shown in fig 12 the scfs in the outer surface of the bulge plate were measured however no strain gauges were bonded to the inner surface of the bulge plate because it was impossible for the bulge formed joint at each measured point two strain gauges were used one was in the perpendicular direction the other in the parallel direction the dh3820 a strain data acquisition system consisted of the hardware system including data acquisition card signal amplifier and data processing module and the software system was utilized to measure the strains the strain components at the weld toe were linearly extrapolated by those at the measured points then the hhs at the weld toe could be derived by the parallel and perpendicular strain according to the relationship between of scf and sncf the strain concentration factor calculated by ε ε n given by shao 2007 and niemi et al 2006 19 scf 1 ν ε ε 1 ν 2 sncf i e 20 σ σ n σ e ε n 1 ν ε ε 1 ν 2 ε ε n finally 21 σ 1 ν ε ε 1 ν 2 e ε c e ε where c 1 ν ε ε 1 ν 2 the average value of c measured in the test was 1 19 which was close to the value 1 20 for the unstiffened tubular joints recommended by cidect zhao et al 2000 zhao et al 2000 in the present study the poisson s ratio ν and elastic modulus e for the steel material were 0 3 and 206 gpa respectively 4 2 experimental results both the test data and fe results of the scfs under the test load are shown in fig 13 the tested scfs coincided well with the scfs calculated by the fe method which validated the fe models in the stress analysis because the study of the scfs and dobs was under linear elastic state of the material the fe model validated under the test load was also feasible for the study of dobs under the balanced axial loads the similar validation method was also utilized by ahmadi et al 2016 along the brace bulge plate intersection the polar angle φ measured from the crown position was used to mark the position 5 parametric study 5 1 details of the parametric study as validated by the experimental data the fe models were utilized to investigate geometrical effects on the dobs under the balanced axial loads in another report the authors had found that the maximum scf at the brace bulge plate intersection of the bulge formed k joint under the balanced axial loads is located at the φ 105 position while the minimum scf is located at the heel position nie et al 2017 so in the following passages only the dobs at the crown and φ 105 positions were investigated the dob at the heel position was not considered because the scf at this position was minimum compared with the crown and φ 105 positions to investigate the geometrical effects on the dobs different values were assigned for the geometrical parameters as listed in table 6 α 14 93 and α b 7 55 were used for all the models as discussed in section 3 4 totally 2117 fe models were analyzed to investigate the effects of the geometrical parameters on the dobs a large amount of comparisons were conducted and only a few typical comparisons were presented for brevity it should be noted that all the possible combinations of parameters listed in table 5 is 3645 calculated by 3 6 5 however in this paper we mainly focus on the cases that the brace is totally connected to the bulge part marked with in fig 3 r s the combinations of the parameters which may lead to the connection of the brace and the un bulge part marked with l s 1 in fig 3 are not included in this study because this kind of connection may lead to a different dob distribution along the brace bulge plate intersection due to their complex weld paths in the following research only 2117 cases that the braces were completely connected to the bulge part were investigated 5 2 effects of β and γ on the dobs the parameter β a crucial parameter for the tubular joint is the ratio of brace diameter to chord diameter when the chord diameter is kept unchanged the brace diameter increases with the increase of β the effect of β on the dobs is shown in fig 14 it exhibits a positive relation between β and the dobs i e with the increase of β the dobs at the crown and φ 105 positions increase the parameter γ is the ratio of radius to thickness of the chord so the increase of γ results in the decrease of thickness when the chord diameter remains unchanged as shown in fig 14 with the increase of γ the dobs at the crown and φ 105 positions increase 5 3 effect of τ on the dobs the parameter τ is the ratio of brace thickness to chord thickness the brace thickness increases with the increase of τ for a constant chord thickness the effect of τ was investigated combined with β as shown in fig 15 with the increase of τ the dobs increase for the case β 0 3 but decrease for the cases β 0 45 and 0 6 at the crown and φ 105 positions 5 4 effect of θ on the dobs the parameter θ the inclination angle between the brace and the chord is an important parameter that affects the arrangement of braces and chords in a tubular truss structure as shown in fig 16 with the increase of θ the dobs increase at the crown and φ 105 positions 5 5 effects of τ s and η 1 on the dobs the parameter τ s is the ratio of the thickness of bulge plate to the chord thickness as shown in fig 17 with the increase of τ s the dobs decrease at the crown and φ 105 positions the parameter η 1 is the ratio of the radius of the bulge plate in the xy plane as shown in fig 3 to the chord radius with the increase of η 1 the dob decreases at the crown position but increases at the φ 105 position 5 6 effect of η 2 on the dobs the parameter η 2 denotes the ratio of the height of the bulge plate to the chord radius as shown in fig 18 the effects of η 2 on the dob at the crown position should be discussed for different τ s for the cases τ s 1 and 1 5 the dob decreases with the increase of η 2 for the case τ s 2 the dob increases as η 2 increases from 0 5 to 0 7 and then decreases as η 2 increases from 0 7 to 0 9 for the φ 105 position the effect of η 2 on the dob is negligible for the cases τ s 1 and 1 5 but for the case τ s 2 the dob increases as η 2 increases from 0 5 to 0 7 and then remains almost unchanged as η 2 increases from 0 7 to 0 9 6 parametric equations for dobs 6 1 parametric equations in order to predict the dobs at the key locations of the bulge formed k joints under the balanced axial loads a set of parametric equations were derived by large amounts of nonlinear regression analyses based on the 2117 fe models in these equations the geometrical parameters include β γ τ θ τ s η 1 and η 2 in the nonlinear regression analyses the trail function was similar to that used by chang and dover 1996 and the first terms and cross terms of the geometrical parameters were added in the trail function to get accurate fitting results by large amounts of nonlinear regression analyses the dob equations were derived with high determination coefficients r2 the dob equations for the crown and φ 105 positions are given by eqs 22 and 23 respectively crown position 22

6 2 assessment of the parametric equations to evaluate the proposed dob equations an error analysis was conducted using the method given by shao et al 2009 the relative errors were calculated according to eq 24 to compare the predicted dobs calculated from the parametric equations with the fe results for the 2117 models 24 e 1 dob p dob r dob r 100 in the equation dob p and dob r are the calculated dobs according to the proposed equations and the fe results respectively the comparisons between dob p and dob r at the crown and φ 105 positions of the 2117 models are plotted in fig 19 a and b respectively as shown in fig 19 and table 7 it can be seen that the errors in the crown position are less than 9 for φ 105 position the errors are less than 3 5 for 99 6 cases and the errors for the other 4 cases are less than 6 it shows a good agreement between the predicted dobs dob p and the recorded dobs dob r in the fatigue life estimation the safety of the dob equations should be further considered the underestimation of dobs means a conservative prediction of the fatigue life while an overestimation of dobs may be too optimistic for the estimation of the fatigue life as is known for the case under the same nominal stress and dob a higher scf means a higher hss and a shorter fatigue life furthermore for the case under the same nominal stress and scf a lower dob means a relatively higher membrane stress at the hot spot which means a shorter fatigue life due to the contribution of the membrane stress on the fatigue crack development so the acceptance criteria p r 1 25 was proposed by morgan and lee 1998 for the dob equations to ensure the conservative estimation of the fatigue life p stands for the predicted dob from the proposed equation r strands for the recorded dob from the fe analysis or test p r stands for the ratio between them also to revise the dob equation which doesn t meet the condition a design factor is recommended for the dob equation as a product term then the revised dob equation which meets the acceptance is considered safe for the fatigue life estimation the design factor is expressed as eq 25 ahmadi et al 2012 ahmadi and zavvar 2015 25 design factor dob design dob eq by multiple comparative analyses the design factors 0 96 and 0 97 were recommended for eqs 22 and 23 respectively the revised equations are given as eqs 26 and 27 26 dob design crown 0 96 dob crown 27 dob design φ 105 0 97 dob φ 105 the design factors are used to increase the reliability of the equations and avoid the remarkable over prediction for dobs which may lead to an un conservative prediction of the fatigue life the assessment of the unrevised and revised equations are listed in table 8 7 conclusions in this paper the dobs were investigated for an innovative stiffened k joint called the bulge formed k joint under the balanced axial loads based on 2117 fe models validated by the experiment data the effects of the geometrical parameters β τ γ θ τ s η 1 and η 2 on the dobs at the key locations the crown and φ 105 positions were concluded as follows with the increase of β γ and θ the dobs increase at the crown and φ 105 positions with the increase of τ the dobs increase for the case β 0 3 but decrease for the cases β 0 45 and 0 6 at the crown and φ 105 positions with the increase of τ s the dobs decrease at the crown and φ 105 positions with the increase of η 1 the dob decreases at the crown position but increases at the φ 105 position the effect of η 2 on the dobs should be discussed for different locations separately for the crown position with the increase of η 2 the dob decreases for the cases τ s 1 and 1 5 but for the case τ s 2 the dob increases as η 2 increases from 0 5 to 0 7 and then decreases as η 2 increases from 0 7 to 0 9 for the φ 105 position the effect of η 2 on the dobs is negligible for the cases τ s 1 and 1 5 but for the case τ s 2 the dob increases as η 2 increases from 0 5 to 0 7 and then remains almost unchanged as η 2 increases from 0 7 to 0 9 finally the dob equations were derived by a large amount of nonlinear regression analyses based on the fe database the good agreement between the predicted dobs and the recorded dobs indicates that the proposed equations are accurate enough to predict the dobs for the bulge formed k joints then the design factors were derived for the equations to ensure the conservative estimation of dobs for the fatigue life prediction acknowledgements this work was supported by the science and technology commission of shanghai municipality china

23129,statistical uncertainty is undoubtedly introduced in the estimation of parameters usually involved in the physical or probabilistic models employed for reliability analysis provided that such models parameters are uncertain the probability of failure and the reliability index become uncertain variables as well in this work a general formulation is introduced to account for parameter uncertainties in the reliability analysis of jacket platforms under storm conditions a point estimates method based on the rosenblatt transformation is used to compute the statistics of the failure probability and the reliability index it has the advantage that the estimating points and weights are readily defined the effect of considering parameter uncertainties in the probability distribution of maximum wave height and the environmental load model was assessed the relative influence of the different sources of parameter uncertainty and the implications of neglecting it were examined credible bounds of failure probability and coefficients of variation of the reliability index were evaluated as means of charactering uncertainty in their estimation a decision problem regarding optimal probabilities of failure for structural design using a risk model is also analyzed showing that depending on the coefficient of variation of the failure probability greater safety margins may be required keywords jacket reliability parameter uncertainty predictive failure probability point estimates rosenblatt transformation offshore platforms 1 introduction the reliability assessment of jacket platforms under storm conditions involves probabilistic and physical models of environmental loading and structural resistance some of the parameters in these models are estimated by means of statistical inference using possibly recorded numerical and experimental or field test data on metocean conditions loading and structural capacity the uncertainty in the parameter estimates that results from such statistical process is regarded as parameter uncertainty when accounting for parameter uncertainty the probability of failure and the reliability index are functions of the uncertain models parameters and hence become random variables as well it is therefore of interest to characterize the statistics of the failure probability and the reliability index the so called predictive failure probability defined as the mean value of the probability of failure is considered to be a measure that takes into account parameter uncertainty der kiureghian 2008 credible intervals may also be a tool to characterize the uncertainty in the estimation of the failure probability quantifying the uncertainty involved in the estimation of reliability improves risk informed decision making for instance regarding optimal and acceptable reliabilities for design and reassessment code calibration as well as optimal inspection planning and maintenance prioritization it would be possible to assess to which extent such uncertainty could be reduced as a consequence of gathering additional information provided that increasing statistical data and observations should reduce parameter uncertainty furthermore the impact of reducing parameter uncertainty on safety measures could be compared within the framework of a cost benefit analysis against the investment to gather more information for instance the economic benefits resulting from designing for lower safety margins extending inspection intervals and reducing the number of critical components to be inspected as a consequence of reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of the failure probability should at least be balanced by the cost of getting more information to characterize the parameters of the models for environmental loading demands and structural performance proper treatment of parameter uncertainty is also relevant for system reliability analysis parameter uncertainty in the load and capacity distributions of system components can introduce statistical dependence and have significant influence on the estimates of the system probability of failure der kiureghian and ditlevsen 2009 have shown that as the sample size of observations decreases and parameter uncertainty becomes larger the estimates of predictive failure probability can increase quite significantly such an effect depends on the redundancy of the system and can reach several orders of magnitude for highly redundant systems structural reliability formulations and applications for design criteria and risk based inspection planning of jacket platforms have been developed in previous works see e g ayala 2001 bai et al 2015 ersdal 2005 faber et al 2000 frieze et al 1997 heredia zavoni et al 2008 heredia zavoni et al 2004 madsen et al 1989 manuel et al 1998 mathisen et al 2004 montes iturrizaga et al 2009 onoufriou and forbes 2001 sigurdsson et al 1994 these studies have advanced procedures to deal with 1 the probabilistic modeling of environmental loads 2 the probabilistic characterization of structural capacity 3 the stochastic modeling of damage and deterioration 4 approaches for system analysis and 5 time dependency and directional effects among other topics a comparative study conducted by zhang et al 2010 analyzed the features of some statistical models for the uncertainty in the parameters of a steel corrosion model and applied it to the reliability analysis of a fixed jacket platform efforts to assess the effect of parameter uncertainty have been made mainly for reliability analysis of offshore applications other than jacket platforms formulations considering uncertainties in the probability distributions of mooring loads and suction caisson capacity for the reliability analysis of floating production systems have been developed recently rendón conde and heredia zavoni 2014 2016 these studies have shown that significant differences may be found between the predictive and the mean reliability indices and that the predictive failure probability is more sensitive to statistical uncertainties in the loading distribution the effect of parameter uncertainties on the reliability of mooring lines for floating structures under extreme sea states has been analyzed by rendón conde and heredia zavoni 2015 their case study for catenary and taut leg mooring lines of fpso systems indicated that the predictive failure probability was much more sensitive to the statistical uncertainty in the probability distribution of loading than to that in the distribution of line resistance significant differences were also found between the predictive and the mean reliability index in this work we study the effect of parameter uncertainty on the predictive failure probability and the statistics of the reliability index of jacket platforms environmental loading due to storm conditions is considered since the ultimate limit state which addresses the structural capacity to withstand extreme environmental loads is understandably a most relevant limit state for the design of reliable facilities in areas exposed to tropical cyclones a general reliability formulation is presented first to account for uncertain parameters in the probabilistic and physical models of environmental loading and structural resistance of jackets the probability of failure and the reliability index are expressed as random functions of the uncertain modeling parameters the point estimates method used for the computation of the statistics of the reliability index and the failure probability is described next an application example is then given considering parameter uncertainty in the wave height probability distribution and the load model results are thoroughly examined and discussed a decision problem to select target probabilities of failure for design using a risk model is also analyzed main findings and concluding remarks are summarized at the end 2 reliability formulation consider a fixed jacket structure subjected to loads from extreme sea states due to hurricane or storm conditions as schematically depicted in fig 1 the limit state function for the ultimate capacity of the jacket structure can be written in terms of the base shear resistance at collapse r and the base shear from environmental loads during extreme sea states s x as follows 1 g r s r s x where x is a vector of environmental variables such as wave height current velocity and wind speed etc let f ˆ x θ f denote the selected model for the probability density function of x and θ f the set of distribution parameters to be estimated from statistical data let s ˆ x θ s e be an idealized model for x in which s ˆ x θ s is a deterministic model with θ s denoting its parameters and e is the model error or residual the model parameters and the residual are estimated by statistical inference using for instance data from numerical response analyses from the limit state function the probability of failure for a given value of x is p x f r s ˆ x θ s θ r where f r r θ r is the probability distribution of the resistance r and θ r the distribution parameters considering the parameterized models f ˆ x θ f s ˆ x θ s f r r θ r and the statistical model for the residual e f ˆ ε ε θ e with parameters θ e independent from θ s θ f and θ r the failure probability is then given by 2 p θ ε x f r s ˆ x θ s θ r f ˆ x x θ f f ˆ ε ε θ e d x d ε eq 2 indicates that the failure probability is a function of the set of uncertain model parameters θ θ s θ r θ f θ e and thus p p θ is also a random variable representing the uncertain failure probability the uncertain reliability index β θ is equal to 3 β θ φ 1 1 p θ where φ is the standard normal distribution function a measure of reliability that accounts for parameter uncertainty is the so called predictive failure probability p which is defined as the expected value of p θ over the outcome of uncertain model parameters θ der kiureghian 2008 using eq 2 this can be written as 4 p θ p θ f θ θ d θ where f θ θ is the joint density function of θ the corresponding predictive reliability index can be obtained from 5 β φ 1 1 p the predictive failure probability in eq 4 can be computed using an auxiliary limit state function wen and chen 1987 6 g θ u u β θ where u is a sample value of an independent standard normal variable u and β θ is the reliability index for θ θ in eq 6 let μ β and σ β 2 be the mean and variance of β θ since in eq 6 μ g μ β and σ g 1 σ β 2 an approximate estimate for the predictive reliability index is der kiureghian 2008 7 β μ b 1 σ b 2 eq 7 becomes an exact expression when the reliability index β θ is normally distributed 3 point estimates method we are interested in estimating such statistics as the mean and variance of the uncertain reliability index β θ approximate methods to estimate the first statistical moments of functions of random variables are available some of these methods are first order approximations based on the taylor series expansion a disadvantage of this approach is that it imposes restrictions on the existence and continuity of the first few derivatives of the function in addition to the possible difficulties involved in the computation of such derivatives an alternative approach are the point estimates methods in which the statistical moments of functions of random variables are given as weighted sums of powers of the function computed at a finite set of estimating points rosenblueth 1975 the problem to be solved for their application is selecting the estimating points and the corresponding weights zhao and ono 2000 have developed a method where the estimating points and weights are obtained by mapping the random variables into a space of standard normal variables using the rosenblatt transformation in the transformed space the estimating points and weights are readily defined by hermite integration this method offers some significant advantages 1 the number of estimating points can be increased easily since they are independent of the random variables 2 the use of higher order moments of the random variables is not required 3 the estimating points do not fall outside the domain of the random variables and 4 the first two statistical moments of the function can be usually estimated accurately using few point estimates e g five or seven let g x be a function of random vector x x 1 x 2 x n and u t x the rosenblatt transformation u being a vector of independent standard normal variables in terms of the inverse transformation the mean μ g and the k th order moments of g x are 8 μ g g t 1 u φ u d u 9 m k g g t 1 u μ g k φ u d u k 2 where φ is the standard normal density function consider the case of a function of a single random variable if u φ 1 f x where f is the distribution function of x the moments of the standard normal variable u can be expressed as 10 u k e x p 1 2 u 2 d u 2 π j 1 m w j u j k the left hand is a hermite integration with weight function φ u exp u 2 2 and therefore the estimating points u j and weights w j are known for given m table 1 gives the estimating points and weights for m 5 and 7 since

1 x 2 x n in this case the multivariate probability density is concentrated at m n points in the hyperspace defined by the n random variables however if n is a very large number computations may become quite intensive zhao and ono 2000 proposed to use the following approximation for g x 13 g x i 1 n g i g μ g μ where g μ is the function evaluated at the mean values of the variables g i g t 1 u i and u i is a vector where only the i th component u i is treated as a random variable while all the other variables are given their mean values transformed into standard normal space thus g i is a function of just one random variable u i since u t x are mutually independent g i i 1 2 n are also statistically independent and hence 14 μ g i 1 n μ g i g μ g μ 15 σ g 2 i 1 n σ g i 2 where μ g i and σ g i 2 are obtained using the point estimates approach for functions of single variables 4 application example for the idealized model of base shear due to environmental loading in eq 1 we considered the widely used model 16 s ˆ h k α k h α where h is the maximum wave height model parameter k depends on the number of legs of the platform and parameter α which typically takes values between 2 0 and 3 0 is considered for practical purposes to be independent of the number of legs heredia zavoni et al 2008 kurian et al 2014 manuel et al 1998 zhang et al 2010 parameters k and α are estimated by statistical fitting of the model in 16 to base shear demands computed from numerical analyses for a range of values of environmental variables the model assumes that maximum wave height is a dominant contributor to base shear compared to other contributing environmental variables such as wind speed and current velocity here we adopt the well known model in eq 16 so that the effect of considering parameter uncertainty can be ascertained in comparison to traditional approaches where it is not taken into account a weibull distribution was considered for the maximum wave height the base shear resistance was taken as the ultimate base shear resistance obtained from nonlinear pushover analysis an approximate estimate of the mean base shear resistance could be obtained by performing such analysis using the mean values of geometric and material properties for instance the mean value of steel yield stress heredia zavoni et al 2008 a more rigorous procedure would involve simulating a number of uncertain geometric and material properties performing the pushover analyses and then estimating the mean base shear resistance using a monte carlo approach for the application example here we are performing the sensitivity analysis assuming a number of possible mean values for the ultimate base shear resistance varying from 2000 to 4000 t using different configurations for structural models of four and eight legged jackets sigurdsson et al 1994 evaluated the coefficient of variation of base shear obtained from pushover analyses to characterize structural capacity their results showed that uncertainty in geometric imperfections could be neglected compared to the uncertainty in steel yield stress considering for their sensitivity study coefficients of variation of steel yield stress from 6 to 15 they found by means of monte carlo simulations that the coefficient of variation of structural capacity was less than 8 in fact the coefficient of variation of structural capacity characterized in terms of the ultimate base shear is about 50 the coefficient of variation of the steel yield stress for the sensitivity study conducted here the base shear resistance has been modeled as a lognormal variable considering a coefficient of variation of 8 three parameters were selected for the assessment of parameter uncertainty in this study the load parameter α in s ˆ h k α thus θ s α and the shape ξ and scale σ parameters in the probability distribution of the maximum wave height hence θ f ξ σ a lognormal distribution was selected for the load parameter α based on the typical values reported for α between 2 0 and 3 0 heredia zavoni et al 2008 kurian et al 2014 manuel et al 1998 zhang et al 2010 we have considered for the sensitivity analysis mean values μ α 2 5 2 7 and 2 9 and coefficients of variation c v α 5 and 10 to assess its influence a joint lognormal distribution was assumed for the scale and shape parameters based on statistical analysis of metocean data from hindcast of tropical and extratropical cyclones for a site in the gulf of mexico mean values of the scale and shape parameter μ σ 1 93 μ ξ 1 03 coefficient of variation c v σ c v ξ 10 and linear correlation coefficient ρ σ ε 0 25 were used silva gonzález et al 2012 the zhao and ono procedure for functions of a single variable was extended here to deal with the three uncertain parameters in θ α ξ σ following from eqs 8 and 9 and considering α to be statistically independent from ξ and σ the mean and variance of the reliability index are estimated as follows 17 a μ β j 1 m w j k 1 m w k i 1 m w i β α j ξ k σ i 17 b σ β 2 j 1 m w j k 1 m w k i 1 m w i β α j ξ k σ i μ β 2 where according to the rosenblatt transformation 18 a α j f α 1 φ u j 18 b ξ k f ξ 1 φ u k 18 c σ i f σ ξ 1 φ u i ξ k for j 1 m the mean and the variance of the reliability index were computed using the point estimates method according to eqs 17 and 18 with m 5 and also the approximate formulation in eqs 14 and 15 we considered m 5 as a reasonable intermediate option between very few point estimates e g m 3 and a greater number e g m 7 the accuracy of these approaches was assessed comparing the results with those of monte carlo simulation ensembles of 5000 realizations of load parameter α and of the shape and scale parameters were simulated and the corresponding reliability index was computed using the ensemble of reliability indices the sample mean and sample variance were then calculated for comparison with the statistics obtained from point estimates figs 2 and 3 show plots of μ β and σ β 2 in terms of the mean base shear resistance the 5 point estimation yielded estimates of the mean reliability index that match extremely well those of monte carlo simulation differences between estimates are less than 0 5 the 5 point estimation also yields a very good estimation of the variance of the reliability index in this case differences between estimates are less than 3 the approximate formulation yields very good estimates of the mean reliability index as well compared with monte carlo results the error is at most of the order of 0 3 however the approximate formulation is less accurate for estimating the variance of the reliability index in this case differences between estimates can be of the order of 10 the results in fig 2 also show logical trends μ β increases with the mean base shear resistance and decreases with μ α notice that the effect of μ α is significant for instance if μ α varies from 2 5 to 2 9 then μ β decreases from values in the range of 3 3 4 1 to 2 3 2 9 when c v α 5 and from 3 4 to 4 2 to 2 3 3 when c v α 10 if the mean reliability index μ β was adopted as a measure of the jacket reliability the corresponding estimates of failure probability would increase by one to two orders of magnitude with such increase in μ α the ratio of the variance of σ β 2 for c v α 10 and 5 is given in table 2 uncertainty in the reliability index is higher as parameter uncertainty becomes greater results in table 2 show that when c v α 10 the variance σ β 2 is at least 2 5 times that when c v α 5 the coefficient of variation of the reliability index c v β is listed in table 3 as seen c v β can be of the order of 20 and 30 when c v α 5 and 10 respectively the relative influence of the sources of parameter uncertainty can be assessed as well table 4 shows values of the variance σ β 2 when only load parameter α is considered uncertain and when the uncertainty in the statistical parameters of maximum wave height is included as well when c v α 5 the uncertainty in the load parameter amounts for 40 50 of σ β 2 so both the uncertainty in the α parameter of the load model and the uncertainty in the distribution parameters of maximum wave height contribute about the same to the variance of the reliability index when c v α 10 the uncertainty in the load parameter α amounts for 70 80 of the variance σ β 2 and becomes dominant compared to that of the statistical parameters of maximum wave height estimates of the predictive failure probability p are shown in fig 4 as function of the mean base shear resistance using 5 point estimates fig 4 also shows results from monte carlo using 5000 realizations of the load parameter α and of the shape and scale parameters as seen the 5 point estimation yields very accurate estimates of the predictive failure probability compared to monte carlo results errors are less than 3 the failure probability computed without considering parameter uncertainty is also shown in fig 4 where 1 the load parameter α and the shape and scale parameters in the wave height distribution are considered deterministic 2 their estimates are equal to their mean values and 3 the failure probability is estimated evaluating eq 2 at the mean vector e θ μ α μ ξ μ σ as observed the predictive failure probability is in all cases greater than the failure probability computed without accounting for parameter uncertainty neglecting the influence of parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of failure probability of the jacket structure that are less than the predictive failure probability the underestimation of failure probability can be significant in some cases for instance for mean base shear resistance equal to 4000 t the predictive failure probability is about 30 times the standard failure probability when μ α 2 5 and c v α 10 if c v α 5 and parameter uncertainty decreases then the predictive failure probability is about 10 times the standard one in other cases estimates of failure probability were about 10 50 of the predictive failure probability plots of the predictive failure probability p versus the residual influence factor rif are shown in fig 5 the rif characterizes the base shear capacity under a given state of structural damage and deterioration and is used for risk based inspection planning and decision maintenance it is expressed as the reserve strength ratio rsr of the structure in a given damage state divided by the rsr in the undamaged condition the rsr is defined as the mean ultimate base shear resistance of the platform divided by a reference load usually the base shear associated to a maximum wave height for 100 year return period the rif can be taken as the mean base shear capacity of the platform in a given damage condition expressed as a percentage of the original capacity in the intact condition results in fig 5 show the influence of parameter uncertainty on the variation of p versus rif because of the structural redundancy of jacket platforms rif values are generally in the range of 0 8 1 0 heredia zavoni et al 2008 in such range of rif values predictive failure probabilities for c v α 10 are about one order of magnitude greater than the standard failure probability which does not consider parameter uncertainty fig 5 also shows the effect of greater parameter uncertainty on the variation of p in the limit case where the mean base shear resistance tends to zero failure probability approaches one and thus all curves in fig 5 approach one as rif 0 thus as observed in fig 5 for lower mean base shear resistances the effect of parameter uncertainty becomes less noticeable the ratio of the predictive over the mean reliability index β μ β is shown in fig 6 the approximate expression in eq 7 provides some clues on the expected trends for ratio β μ β since μ b is a positive number then β μ b furthermore as the variance σ b 2 gets larger β is expected to decrease indeed the results in fig 6 first show that β μ b 1 they also show that as c v α increases from 5 to 10 and the variance of the reliability index σ b 2 becomes greater the ratio β μ b decreases the effect of accounting for parameter uncertainty in the reliability analysis can be assessed ratio β μ b lies in the interval 0 84 0 93 when c v α 5 and 0 75 0 85 when c v α 10 take for instance e r 3500 t when c v α 5 β is about 0 85 0 89 and 0 91 of μ b depending upon the μ α in the case where c v α 10 β is about 0 76 0 79 and 0 82 of μ b therefore noticeable differences can be expected between the predictive failure probability p and the failure probability estimated based on the mean reliability index μ b a comparison of the predictive reliability index and the approximate estimate given in eq 7 in terms of the mean μ β and the variance σ β 2 is shown in fig 7 the approximation underestimates the value of the predictive reliability index for lower degrees of parameter uncertainty say c v α 5 the approximate expression estimates the predictive reliability index with better accuracy and errors vary from 1 to 5 for higher uncertainty say c v α 10 the approximation becomes less accurate and errors span from 3 to 15 credible bounds define an interval that contains the failure probability with certain probability this interval expresses a measure of the uncertainty in the failure probability given the mean μ β and the variance σ β 2 of the reliability index credible bounds can be estimated for the failure probability der kiureghian 2008 the 70 credible bounds are approximately defined by φ μ β 1 c v β φ μ β 1 c v β where c v β σ β μ β figs 8 and 9 show 70 credible bounds for the failure probability the results indicate that the uncertainty in failure probability can be very significant in some cases credible interval limits may span over a few orders of magnitude depending on c v α the mean resistance and the mean load parameter for instance take a mean resistance equal to 3000 t credible bounds span over three orders of magnitude from about 1e 03 to 1e 06 when μ α 2 5 and c v α 10 it is also seen that the uncertainty in failure probability is very sensitive to parameter uncertainty for instance for e r 3000 t μ α 2 7 the credible interval is about 1e 04 0 5e 02 when c v α 5 however if c v α 10 the interval becomes 1e 05 1e 02 the plots also show the predictive failure probability p it can be seen that p is closer to the upper credible bound than to the lower one considering that by definition p is equal to the mean value of the failure probability these results are indicative of the highly skewed nature of the distribution of failure probability the influence of parameter uncertainty is further examined in a decision problem related to target probabilities of failure for design an economic criterion for decision making is to choose as target the failure probability that minimizes the total expected costs for practical applications the total expected cost is expressed in a simple model that adds the initial cost plus the expected present value of the future cost of structural failure e c t c i e c f in this model the initial cost includes planning design fabrication transportation and installation costs and is expressed as a linear function of the failure probability p in logarithmic scale c i c o c i ln p c o and c i being constants the expected future cost is expressed as e c f c f p v where c f is the total cost of structural failure including production interruption material losses environmental damage and human life loss among others and v r l 1 e x p r l r is the present value function that depends on the net discount rate r and the intended service lifetime of the structure l consider now that the failure probability is a function of an uncertain parameter θ for instance the load parameter α thus p p θ and the total expected cost conditional on θ is 19 e c t θ c o c i ln p θ c f p θ v the total expected cost is now given by 20 e c t c o c i e ln p θ c f e p θ v notice that in eq 20 p e p θ is the predictive failure probability using a second order taylor expansion it can be shown that e ln p θ ln p 1 2 σ p 2 p 2 where σ p 2 is the variance of the failure probability the total expected cost can thus be expressed as 21 e c t c o c i ln p c i σ p 2 2 p 2 c f p v let p o denote the optimal failure probability which minimizes the total expected cost when parameter uncertainty is not considered and p o denote the optimal predictive failure probability which minimizes the total expected cost in eq 21 it is shown in appendix a that 22 p o p o 1 c v p 2 where c v p is the coefficient of variation of the failure probability when the failure probability is not a random function c v p 0 and p o p o eq 22 shows that in addition to the initial and failure cost parameters the target probability for design depends on the uncertainty in failure probability p as well as measured by its coefficient of variation c v p such uncertainty can be reduced to some extent by gathering additional data the benefits of reducing the uncertainty in failure probability in terms of the target reliability for design can be assessed against the cost of having to collect additional information using the results obtained above table 5 lists the ratio p o p o for the case where the load parameter α is uncertain for μ α 2 5 2 7 and 2 9 ratio p o p o is on average equal to 0 25 0 40 and 0 55 when c v α 5 and to 0 10 0 20 0 30 when c v α 10 let now the predictive failure probability be expressed as p γ p where p is the failure probability without considering parameter uncertainty if the safety margin is defined as m p o p then it can be shown that 23 m m o 1 c v p 2 γ where m o p o p is the safety margin without consideration of parameter uncertainty when m m o 1 accounting for parameter uncertainty demands a safety margin greater than that required under a conventional analysis where it is not considered fig 10 shows values of ratio m m o using the results presented above it can be seen that there are combinations of variable values for which ratio m m o is indeed greater than one 5 conclusions this paper has focused on the structural reliability analysis of jacket platforms under storm conditions considering parameter uncertainty this is the uncertainty associated with the statistical estimation of parameters in the probability distributions and physical models of environmental loading and structural resistance a general formulation was introduced to account for parameter uncertainty in the reliability analysis the probability of failure and the reliability index were expressed as random functions of the uncertain models parameters a point estimates method based on the rosenblatt transformation was used to compute the first two statistical moments of the failure probability and reliability index it has the advantage that the estimating points and weights are known if needed the number of estimating points can be increased easily the point estimates method gave very accurate estimates of the predictive failure probability and the mean and variance of the reliability index three parameters were selected for the assessment of the influence of parameter uncertainty in this study the power of maximum wave height in the base shear load model and the shape and scale parameters of the probability distribution of maximum wave height results for the mean and variance of the reliability index using point estimates were compared to those obtained using monte carlo simulations to assess its accuracy very accurate estimates of the mean and variance of the reliability index were obtained using 5 point estimates with errors less than 0 5 and 3 respectively that was also the case in the computation of the predictive failure probability 5 point estimates were within 3 of the ones using monte carlo simulation the point estimates approach is a relatively simple method and produced accurate estimates with less computational effort assessing the statistics of the reliability index considering three uncertain parameters involved computing the reliability index 125 times at pre defined parameter values for the monte carlo simulations the reliability index was evaluated 5000 times at ensembles of simulated values of the three parameters such difference between the number of reliability assessments using both approaches will become even greater if higher coefficients of variation are considered for the uncertain parameters an approximate method for point estimates was employed as well it was found to estimate properly the mean reliability index but introduced greater errors in the computation of the variance the accuracy of an approximate and simple analytical expression for the predictive reliability index in terms of the mean and variance of the reliability index which follows from using an alternative limit state function was also assessed only in the case of relatively low degrees of parameter uncertainty such approximate expression was found to give good estimates of the predictive reliability index for higher degrees of parameter uncertainty it was less accurate yielding errors of the order of up to 15 some findings from the study considering coefficients of variation of the load model parameter c v α 5 and 10 and of the shape and scale parameters in the probability distribution of maximum wave height c v σ c v ξ 10 are 1 the coefficient of variation of the uncertain reliability index can be of the order of 20 30 when c v α 5 and 10 respectively 2 when c v α 5 both the uncertainty in the load model parameter and the uncertainty in the distribution parameters of maximum wave height contribute about the same to the variance of the reliability index however when c v α 10 the uncertainty in the load model parameter amounts for 70 80 of the reliability index variance the uncertainty in the load model parameter is a predominant contributor to the uncertainty in the reliability index compared to the statistical parameters of maximum wave height 3 neglecting parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of the failure probability of the jacket structure that are less than the predictive failure probability in some cases the predictive failure probability was found to be about 10 30 times the failure probability computed without accounting for parameter uncertainty 4 credible bounds showed that the uncertainty in failure probability is very sensitive to parameter uncertainty and can be very significant in certain cases spanning over a few orders of magnitude depending on c v α the comparison between the predictive failure probability and the credible bounds was indicative of the highly skewed nature of the distribution of failure probability 5 the solution to a decision problem regarding optimal failure probabilities for structural design showed that depending on the coefficient of variation of the failure probability greater safety margins may be required appendix a the total expected cost is expressed as a 1 e c t c o c i ln p c i σ p 2 2 p 2 c f p v the first derivative with respect to p is

23129,statistical uncertainty is undoubtedly introduced in the estimation of parameters usually involved in the physical or probabilistic models employed for reliability analysis provided that such models parameters are uncertain the probability of failure and the reliability index become uncertain variables as well in this work a general formulation is introduced to account for parameter uncertainties in the reliability analysis of jacket platforms under storm conditions a point estimates method based on the rosenblatt transformation is used to compute the statistics of the failure probability and the reliability index it has the advantage that the estimating points and weights are readily defined the effect of considering parameter uncertainties in the probability distribution of maximum wave height and the environmental load model was assessed the relative influence of the different sources of parameter uncertainty and the implications of neglecting it were examined credible bounds of failure probability and coefficients of variation of the reliability index were evaluated as means of charactering uncertainty in their estimation a decision problem regarding optimal probabilities of failure for structural design using a risk model is also analyzed showing that depending on the coefficient of variation of the failure probability greater safety margins may be required keywords jacket reliability parameter uncertainty predictive failure probability point estimates rosenblatt transformation offshore platforms 1 introduction the reliability assessment of jacket platforms under storm conditions involves probabilistic and physical models of environmental loading and structural resistance some of the parameters in these models are estimated by means of statistical inference using possibly recorded numerical and experimental or field test data on metocean conditions loading and structural capacity the uncertainty in the parameter estimates that results from such statistical process is regarded as parameter uncertainty when accounting for parameter uncertainty the probability of failure and the reliability index are functions of the uncertain models parameters and hence become random variables as well it is therefore of interest to characterize the statistics of the failure probability and the reliability index the so called predictive failure probability defined as the mean value of the probability of failure is considered to be a measure that takes into account parameter uncertainty der kiureghian 2008 credible intervals may also be a tool to characterize the uncertainty in the estimation of the failure probability quantifying the uncertainty involved in the estimation of reliability improves risk informed decision making for instance regarding optimal and acceptable reliabilities for design and reassessment code calibration as well as optimal inspection planning and maintenance prioritization it would be possible to assess to which extent such uncertainty could be reduced as a consequence of gathering additional information provided that increasing statistical data and observations should reduce parameter uncertainty furthermore the impact of reducing parameter uncertainty on safety measures could be compared within the framework of a cost benefit analysis against the investment to gather more information for instance the economic benefits resulting from designing for lower safety margins extending inspection intervals and reducing the number of critical components to be inspected as a consequence of reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of the failure probability should at least be balanced by the cost of getting more information to characterize the parameters of the models for environmental loading demands and structural performance proper treatment of parameter uncertainty is also relevant for system reliability analysis parameter uncertainty in the load and capacity distributions of system components can introduce statistical dependence and have significant influence on the estimates of the system probability of failure der kiureghian and ditlevsen 2009 have shown that as the sample size of observations decreases and parameter uncertainty becomes larger the estimates of predictive failure probability can increase quite significantly such an effect depends on the redundancy of the system and can reach several orders of magnitude for highly redundant systems structural reliability formulations and applications for design criteria and risk based inspection planning of jacket platforms have been developed in previous works see e g ayala 2001 bai et al 2015 ersdal 2005 faber et al 2000 frieze et al 1997 heredia zavoni et al 2008 heredia zavoni et al 2004 madsen et al 1989 manuel et al 1998 mathisen et al 2004 montes iturrizaga et al 2009 onoufriou and forbes 2001 sigurdsson et al 1994 these studies have advanced procedures to deal with 1 the probabilistic modeling of environmental loads 2 the probabilistic characterization of structural capacity 3 the stochastic modeling of damage and deterioration 4 approaches for system analysis and 5 time dependency and directional effects among other topics a comparative study conducted by zhang et al 2010 analyzed the features of some statistical models for the uncertainty in the parameters of a steel corrosion model and applied it to the reliability analysis of a fixed jacket platform efforts to assess the effect of parameter uncertainty have been made mainly for reliability analysis of offshore applications other than jacket platforms formulations considering uncertainties in the probability distributions of mooring loads and suction caisson capacity for the reliability analysis of floating production systems have been developed recently rendón conde and heredia zavoni 2014 2016 these studies have shown that significant differences may be found between the predictive and the mean reliability indices and that the predictive failure probability is more sensitive to statistical uncertainties in the loading distribution the effect of parameter uncertainties on the reliability of mooring lines for floating structures under extreme sea states has been analyzed by rendón conde and heredia zavoni 2015 their case study for catenary and taut leg mooring lines of fpso systems indicated that the predictive failure probability was much more sensitive to the statistical uncertainty in the probability distribution of loading than to that in the distribution of line resistance significant differences were also found between the predictive and the mean reliability index in this work we study the effect of parameter uncertainty on the predictive failure probability and the statistics of the reliability index of jacket platforms environmental loading due to storm conditions is considered since the ultimate limit state which addresses the structural capacity to withstand extreme environmental loads is understandably a most relevant limit state for the design of reliable facilities in areas exposed to tropical cyclones a general reliability formulation is presented first to account for uncertain parameters in the probabilistic and physical models of environmental loading and structural resistance of jackets the probability of failure and the reliability index are expressed as random functions of the uncertain modeling parameters the point estimates method used for the computation of the statistics of the reliability index and the failure probability is described next an application example is then given considering parameter uncertainty in the wave height probability distribution and the load model results are thoroughly examined and discussed a decision problem to select target probabilities of failure for design using a risk model is also analyzed main findings and concluding remarks are summarized at the end 2 reliability formulation consider a fixed jacket structure subjected to loads from extreme sea states due to hurricane or storm conditions as schematically depicted in fig 1 the limit state function for the ultimate capacity of the jacket structure can be written in terms of the base shear resistance at collapse r and the base shear from environmental loads during extreme sea states s x as follows 1 g r s r s x where x is a vector of environmental variables such as wave height current velocity and wind speed etc let f ˆ x θ f denote the selected model for the probability density function of x and θ f the set of distribution parameters to be estimated from statistical data let s ˆ x θ s e be an idealized model for x in which s ˆ x θ s is a deterministic model with θ s denoting its parameters and e is the model error or residual the model parameters and the residual are estimated by statistical inference using for instance data from numerical response analyses from the limit state function the probability of failure for a given value of x is p x f r s ˆ x θ s θ r where f r r θ r is the probability distribution of the resistance r and θ r the distribution parameters considering the parameterized models f ˆ x θ f s ˆ x θ s f r r θ r and the statistical model for the residual e f ˆ ε ε θ e with parameters θ e independent from θ s θ f and θ r the failure probability is then given by 2 p θ ε x f r s ˆ x θ s θ r f ˆ x x θ f f ˆ ε ε θ e d x d ε eq 2 indicates that the failure probability is a function of the set of uncertain model parameters θ θ s θ r θ f θ e and thus p p θ is also a random variable representing the uncertain failure probability the uncertain reliability index β θ is equal to 3 β θ φ 1 1 p θ where φ is the standard normal distribution function a measure of reliability that accounts for parameter uncertainty is the so called predictive failure probability p which is defined as the expected value of p θ over the outcome of uncertain model parameters θ der kiureghian 2008 using eq 2 this can be written as 4 p θ p θ f θ θ d θ where f θ θ is the joint density function of θ the corresponding predictive reliability index can be obtained from 5 β φ 1 1 p the predictive failure probability in eq 4 can be computed using an auxiliary limit state function wen and chen 1987 6 g θ u u β θ where u is a sample value of an independent standard normal variable u

der kiureghian 2008 7 β μ b 1 σ b 2 eq 7 becomes an exact expression when the reliability index β θ is normally distributed 3 point estimates method we are interested in estimating such statistics as the mean and variance of the uncertain reliability index β θ approximate methods to estimate the first statistical moments of functions of random variables are available some of these methods are first order approximations based on the taylor series expansion a disadvantage of this approach is that it imposes restrictions on the existence and continuity of the first few derivatives of the function in addition to the possible difficulties involved in the computation of such derivatives an alternative approach are the point estimates methods in which the statistical moments of functions of random variables are given as weighted sums of powers of the function computed at a finite set of estimating points rosenblueth 1975 the problem to be solved for their application is selecting the estimating points and the corresponding weights zhao and ono 2000 have developed a method where the estimating points and weights are obtained by mapping the random variables into a space of standard normal variables using the rosenblatt transformation in the transformed space the estimating points and weights are readily defined by hermite integration this method offers some significant advantages 1 the number of estimating points can be increased easily since they are independent of the random variables 2 the use of higher order moments of the random variables is not required 3 the estimating points do not fall outside the domain of the random variables and 4 the first two statistical moments of the function can be usually estimated accurately using few point estimates e g five or seven let g x be a function of random vector x x 1 x 2 x n and u t x the rosenblatt transformation u being a vector of independent standard normal variables in terms of the inverse transformation the mean μ g and the k th order moments of g x are 8 μ g g t 1 u φ u d u 9 m k g g t 1 u μ g k φ u d u k 2 where φ is the standard normal density function consider the case of a function of a single random variable if u φ 1 f x where f is the distribution function of x the moments of the standard normal variable u can be expressed as 10 u k e x p 1 2 u 2 d u 2 π j 1 m w j u j k the left hand is a hermite integration with weight function φ u exp u 2 2 and therefore the estimating points u j and weights w j are known for given m table 1 gives the estimating points and weights for m 5 and 7 since

1 x 2 x n in this case the multivariate probability density is concentrated at m n points in the hyperspace defined by the n random variables however if n is a very large number computations may become quite intensive zhao and ono 2000 proposed to use the following approximation for g x 13 g x i 1 n g i g μ g μ where g μ is the function evaluated at the mean values of the variables g i g t 1 u i and u i is a vector where only the i th component u i is treated as a random variable while all the other variables are given their mean values transformed into standard normal space thus g i is a function of just one random variable u i since u t x are mutually independent g i i 1 2 n are also statistically independent and hence 14 μ g i 1 n μ g i g μ g μ 15 σ g 2 i 1 n σ g i 2 where μ g i and σ g i 2 are obtained using the point estimates approach for functions of single variables 4 application example for the idealized model of base shear due to environmental loading in eq 1 we considered the widely used model 16 s ˆ h k α k h α where h is the maximum wave height model parameter k depends on the number of legs of the platform and parameter α which typically takes values between 2 0 and 3 0 is considered for practical purposes to be independent of the number of legs heredia zavoni et al 2008 kurian et al 2014 manuel et al 1998 zhang et al 2010 parameters k and α are estimated by statistical fitting of the model in 16 to base shear demands computed from numerical analyses for a range of values of environmental variables the model assumes that maximum wave height is a dominant contributor to base shear compared to other contributing environmental variables such as wind speed and current velocity here we adopt the well known model in eq 16 so that the effect of considering parameter uncertainty can be ascertained in comparison to traditional approaches where it is not taken into account a weibull distribution was considered for the maximum wave height the base shear resistance was taken as the ultimate base shear resistance obtained from nonlinear pushover analysis an approximate estimate of the mean base shear resistance could be obtained by performing such analysis using the mean values of geometric and material properties for instance the mean value of steel yield stress heredia zavoni et al 2008 a more rigorous procedure would involve simulating a number of uncertain geometric and material properties performing the pushover analyses and then estimating the mean base shear resistance using a monte carlo approach for the application example here we are performing the sensitivity analysis assuming a number of possible mean values for the ultimate base shear resistance varying from 2000 to 4000 t using different configurations for structural models of four and eight legged jackets sigurdsson et al 1994 evaluated the coefficient of variation of base shear obtained from pushover analyses to characterize structural capacity their results showed that uncertainty in geometric imperfections could be neglected compared to the uncertainty in steel yield stress considering for their sensitivity study coefficients of variation of steel yield stress from 6 to 15 they found by means of monte carlo simulations that the coefficient of variation of structural capacity was less than 8 in fact the coefficient of variation of structural capacity characterized in terms of the ultimate base shear is about 50 the coefficient of variation of the steel yield stress for the sensitivity study conducted here the base shear resistance has been modeled as a lognormal variable considering a coefficient of variation of 8 three parameters were selected for the assessment of parameter uncertainty in this study the load parameter α in s ˆ h k α thus θ s α and the shape ξ and scale σ parameters in the probability distribution of the maximum wave height hence θ f ξ σ a lognormal distribution was selected for the load parameter α based on the typical values reported for α between 2 0 and 3 0 heredia zavoni et al 2008 kurian et al 2014 manuel et al 1998 zhang et al 2010 we have considered for the sensitivity analysis mean values μ α 2 5 2 7 and 2 9 and coefficients of variation c v α 5 and 10 to assess its influence a joint lognormal distribution was assumed for the scale and shape parameters based on statistical analysis of metocean data from hindcast of tropical and extratropical cyclones for a site in the gulf of mexico mean values of the scale and shape parameter μ σ 1 93 μ ξ 1 03 coefficient of variation c v σ c v ξ 10 and linear correlation coefficient ρ σ ε 0 25 were used silva gonzález et al 2012 the zhao and ono procedure for functions of a single variable was extended here to deal with the three uncertain parameters in θ α ξ σ following from eqs 8 and 9 and considering α to be statistically independent from ξ and σ the mean and variance of the reliability index are estimated as follows 17 a μ β j 1 m w j k 1 m w k i 1 m w i β α j ξ k σ i 17 b σ β 2 j 1 m w j k 1 m w k i 1 m w i β α j ξ k σ i μ β 2 where according to the rosenblatt transformation 18 a α j f α 1 φ u j 18 b ξ k f ξ 1 φ u k 18 c σ i f σ ξ 1 φ u i ξ k for j 1 m the mean and the variance of the reliability index were computed using the point estimates method according to eqs 17 and 18 with m 5 and also the approximate formulation in eqs 14 and 15 we considered m 5 as a reasonable intermediate option between very few point estimates e g m 3 and a greater number e g m 7 the accuracy of these approaches was assessed comparing the results with those of monte carlo simulation ensembles of 5000 realizations of load parameter α and of the shape and scale parameters were simulated and the corresponding reliability index was computed using the ensemble of reliability indices the sample mean and sample variance were then calculated for comparison with the statistics obtained from point estimates figs 2 and 3 show plots of μ β and σ β 2 in terms of the mean base shear resistance the 5 point estimation yielded estimates of the mean reliability index that match extremely well those of monte carlo simulation differences between estimates are less than 0 5 the 5 point estimation also yields a very good estimation of the variance of the reliability index in this case differences between estimates are less than 3 the approximate formulation yields very good estimates of the mean reliability index as well compared with monte carlo results the error is at most of the order of 0 3 however the approximate formulation is less accurate for estimating the variance of the reliability index in this case differences between estimates can be of the order of 10 the results in fig 2 also show logical trends μ β increases with the mean base shear resistance and decreases with μ α notice that the effect of μ α is significant for instance if μ α varies from 2 5 to 2 9 then μ β decreases from values in the range of 3 3 4 1 to 2 3 2 9 when c v α 5 and from 3 4 to 4 2 to 2 3 3 when c v α 10 if the mean reliability index μ β was adopted as a measure of the jacket reliability the corresponding estimates of failure probability would increase by one to two orders of magnitude with such increase in μ α the ratio of the variance of σ β 2 for c v α 10 and 5 is given in table 2 uncertainty in the reliability index is higher as parameter uncertainty becomes greater results in table 2 show that when c v α 10 the variance σ β 2 is at least 2 5 times that when c v α 5 the coefficient of variation of the reliability index c v β is listed in table 3 as seen c v β can be of the order of 20 and 30 when c v α 5 and 10 respectively the relative influence of the sources of parameter uncertainty can be assessed as well table 4 shows values of the variance σ β 2 when only load parameter α is considered uncertain and when the uncertainty in the statistical parameters of maximum wave height is included as well when c v α 5 the uncertainty in the load parameter amounts for 40 50 of σ β 2 so both the uncertainty in the α parameter of the load model and the uncertainty in the distribution parameters of maximum wave height contribute about the same to the variance of the reliability index when c v α 10 the uncertainty in the load parameter α amounts for 70 80 of the variance σ β 2 and becomes dominant compared to that of the statistical parameters of maximum wave height estimates of the predictive failure probability p are shown in fig 4 as function of the mean base shear resistance using 5 point estimates fig 4 also shows results from monte carlo using 5000 realizations of the load parameter α and of the shape and scale parameters as seen the 5 point estimation yields very accurate estimates of the predictive failure probability compared to monte carlo results errors are less than 3 the failure probability computed without considering parameter uncertainty is also shown in fig 4 where 1 the load parameter α and the shape and scale parameters in the wave height distribution are considered deterministic 2 their estimates are equal to their mean values and 3 the failure probability is estimated evaluating eq 2 at the mean vector e θ μ α μ ξ μ σ as observed the predictive failure probability is in all cases greater than the failure probability computed without accounting for parameter uncertainty neglecting the influence of parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of failure probability of the jacket structure that are less than the predictive failure probability the underestimation of failure probability can be significant in some cases for instance for mean base shear resistance equal to 4000 t the predictive failure probability is about 30 times the standard failure probability when μ α 2 5 and c v α 10 if c v α 5 and parameter uncertainty decreases then the predictive failure probability is about 10 times the standard one in other cases estimates of failure probability were about 10 50 of the predictive failure probability plots of the predictive failure probability p versus the residual influence factor rif are shown in fig 5 the rif characterizes the base shear capacity under a given state of structural damage and deterioration and is used for risk based inspection planning and decision maintenance it is expressed as the reserve strength ratio rsr of the structure in a given damage state divided by the rsr in the undamaged condition the rsr is defined as the mean ultimate base shear resistance of the platform divided by a reference load usually the base shear associated to a maximum wave height for 100 year return period the rif can be taken as the mean base shear capacity of the platform in a given damage condition expressed as a percentage of the original capacity in the intact condition results in fig 5 show the influence of parameter uncertainty on the variation of p versus rif because of the structural redundancy of jacket platforms rif values are generally in the range of 0 8 1 0 heredia zavoni et al 2008 in such range of rif values predictive failure probabilities for c v α 10 are about one order of magnitude greater than the standard failure probability which does not consider parameter uncertainty fig 5 also shows the effect of greater parameter uncertainty on the variation of p in the limit case where the mean base shear resistance tends to zero failure probability approaches one and thus all curves in fig 5 approach one as rif 0 thus as observed in fig 5 for lower mean base shear resistances the effect of parameter uncertainty becomes less noticeable the ratio of the predictive over the mean reliability index β μ β is shown in fig 6 the approximate expression in eq 7 provides some clues on the expected trends for ratio β μ β since μ b is a positive number then β μ b furthermore as the variance σ b 2 gets larger β is expected to decrease indeed the results in fig 6 first show that β μ b 1 they also show that as c v α increases from 5 to 10 and the variance of the reliability index σ b 2 becomes greater the ratio β μ b decreases the effect of accounting for parameter uncertainty in the reliability analysis can be assessed ratio β μ b lies in the interval 0 84 0 93 when c v α 5 and 0 75 0 85 when c v α 10 take for instance e r 3500 t when c v α 5 β is about 0 85 0 89 and 0 91 of μ b depending upon the μ α in the case where c v α 10 β is about 0 76 0 79 and 0 82 of μ b therefore noticeable differences can be expected between the predictive failure probability p and the failure probability estimated based on the mean reliability index μ b a comparison of the predictive reliability index and the approximate estimate given in eq 7 in terms of the mean μ β and the variance σ β 2 is shown in fig 7 the approximation underestimates the value of the predictive reliability index for lower degrees of parameter uncertainty say c v α 5 the approximate expression estimates the predictive reliability index with better accuracy and errors vary from 1 to 5 for higher uncertainty say c v α 10 the approximation becomes less accurate and errors span from 3 to 15 credible bounds define an interval that contains the failure probability with certain probability this interval expresses a measure of the uncertainty in the failure probability given the mean μ β and the variance σ β 2 of the reliability index credible bounds can be estimated for the failure probability der kiureghian 2008 the 70 credible bounds are approximately defined by φ μ β 1 c v β φ μ β 1 c v β where c v β σ β μ β figs 8 and 9 show 70 credible bounds for the failure probability the results indicate that the uncertainty in failure probability can be very significant in some cases credible interval limits may span over a few orders of magnitude depending on c v α the mean resistance and the mean load parameter for instance take a mean resistance equal to 3000 t credible bounds span over three orders of magnitude from about 1e 03 to 1e 06 when μ α 2 5 and c v α 10 it is also seen that the uncertainty in failure probability is very sensitive to parameter uncertainty for instance for e r 3000 t μ α 2 7 the credible interval is about 1e 04 0 5e 02 when c v α 5 however if c v α 10 the interval becomes 1e 05 1e 02 the plots also show the predictive failure probability p it can be seen that p is closer to the upper credible bound than to the lower one considering that by definition p is equal to the mean value of the failure probability these results are indicative of the highly skewed nature of the distribution of failure probability the influence of parameter uncertainty is further examined in a decision problem related to target probabilities of failure for design an economic criterion for decision making is to choose as target the failure probability that minimizes the total expected costs for practical applications the total expected cost is expressed in a simple model that adds the initial cost plus the expected present value of the future cost of structural failure e c t c i e c f in this model the initial cost includes planning design fabrication transportation and installation costs and is expressed as a linear function of the failure probability p in logarithmic scale c i c o c i ln p c o and c i being constants the expected future cost is expressed as e c f c f p v where c f is the total cost of structural failure including production interruption material losses environmental damage and human life loss among others and v r l 1 e x p r l r is the present value function that depends on the net discount rate r and the intended service lifetime of the structure l consider now that the failure probability is a function of an uncertain parameter θ for instance the load parameter α thus p p θ and the total expected cost conditional on θ is 19 e c t θ c o c i ln p θ c f p θ v the total expected cost is now given by 20 e c t c o c i e ln p θ c f e p θ v notice that in eq 20 p e p θ is the predictive failure probability using a second order taylor expansion it can be shown that e ln p θ ln p 1 2 σ p 2 p 2 where σ p 2 is the variance of the failure probability the total expected cost can thus be expressed as 21 e c t c o c i ln p c i σ p 2 2 p 2 c f p v let p o denote the optimal failure probability which minimizes the total expected cost when parameter uncertainty is not considered and p o denote the optimal predictive failure probability which minimizes the total expected cost in eq 21 it is shown in appendix a that 22 p o p o 1 c v p 2 where c v p is the coefficient of variation of the failure probability when the failure probability is not a random function c v p 0 and p o p o eq 22 shows that in addition to the initial and failure cost parameters the target probability for design depends on the uncertainty in failure probability p as well as measured by its coefficient of variation c v p such uncertainty can be reduced to some extent by gathering additional data the benefits of reducing the uncertainty in failure probability in terms of the target reliability for design can be assessed against the cost of having to collect additional information using the results obtained above table 5 lists the ratio p o p o for the case where the load parameter α is uncertain for μ α 2 5 2 7 and 2 9 ratio p o p o is on average equal to 0 25 0 40 and 0 55 when c v α 5 and to 0 10 0 20 0 30 when c v α 10 let now the predictive failure probability be expressed as p γ p where p is the failure probability without considering parameter uncertainty if the safety margin is defined as m p o p then it can be shown that 23 m m o 1 c v p 2 γ where m o p o p is the safety margin without consideration of parameter uncertainty when m m o 1 accounting for parameter uncertainty demands a safety margin greater than that required under a conventional analysis where it is not considered fig 10 shows values of ratio m m o using the results presented above it can be seen that there are combinations of variable values for which ratio m m o is indeed greater than one 5 conclusions this paper has focused on the structural reliability analysis of jacket platforms under storm conditions considering parameter uncertainty this is the uncertainty associated with the statistical estimation of parameters in the probability distributions and physical models of environmental loading and structural resistance a general formulation was introduced to account for parameter uncertainty in the reliability analysis the probability of failure and the reliability index were expressed as random functions of the uncertain models parameters a point estimates method based on the rosenblatt transformation was used to compute the first two statistical moments of the failure probability and reliability index it has the advantage that the estimating points and weights are known if needed the number of estimating points can be increased easily the point estimates method gave very accurate estimates of the predictive failure probability and the mean and variance of the reliability index three parameters were selected for the assessment of the influence of parameter uncertainty in this study the power of maximum wave height in the base shear load model and the shape and scale parameters of the probability distribution of maximum wave height results for the mean and variance of the reliability index using point estimates were compared to those obtained using monte carlo simulations to assess its accuracy very accurate estimates of the mean and variance of the reliability index were obtained using 5 point estimates with errors less than 0 5 and 3 respectively that was also the case in the computation of the predictive failure probability 5 point estimates were within 3 of the ones using monte carlo simulation the point estimates approach is a relatively simple method and produced accurate estimates with less computational effort assessing the statistics of the reliability index considering three uncertain parameters involved computing the reliability index 125 times at pre defined parameter values for the monte carlo simulations the reliability index was evaluated 5000 times at ensembles of simulated values of the three parameters such difference between the number of reliability assessments using both approaches will become even greater if higher coefficients of variation are considered for the uncertain parameters an approximate method for point estimates was employed as well it was found to estimate properly the mean reliability index but introduced greater errors in the computation of the variance the accuracy of an approximate and simple analytical expression for the predictive reliability index in terms of the mean and variance of the reliability index which follows from using an alternative limit state function was also assessed only in the case of relatively low degrees of parameter uncertainty such approximate expression was found to give good estimates of the predictive reliability index for higher degrees of parameter uncertainty it was less accurate yielding errors of the order of up to 15 some findings from the study considering coefficients of variation of the load model parameter c v α 5 and 10 and of the shape and scale parameters in the probability distribution of maximum wave height c v σ c v ξ 10 are 1 the coefficient of variation of the uncertain reliability index can be of the order of 20 30 when c v α 5 and 10 respectively 2 when c v α 5 both the uncertainty in the load model parameter and the uncertainty in the distribution parameters of maximum wave height contribute about the same to the variance of the reliability index however when c v α 10 the uncertainty in the load model parameter amounts for 70 80 of the reliability index variance the uncertainty in the load model parameter is a predominant contributor to the uncertainty in the reliability index compared to the statistical parameters of maximum wave height 3 neglecting parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of the failure probability of the jacket structure that are less than the predictive failure probability in some cases the predictive failure probability was found to be about 10 30 times the failure probability computed without accounting for parameter uncertainty 4 credible bounds showed that the uncertainty in failure probability is very sensitive to parameter uncertainty and can be very significant in certain cases spanning over a few orders of magnitude depending on c v α the comparison between the predictive failure probability and the credible bounds was indicative of the highly skewed nature of the distribution of failure probability 5 the solution to a decision problem regarding optimal failure probabilities for structural design showed that depending on the coefficient of variation of the failure probability greater safety margins may be required appendix a the total expected cost is expressed as a 1 e c t c o c i ln p c i σ p 2 2 p 2 c f p v the first derivative with respect to p is then a 2 d e c t d p c i p c i 2 2 σ p 2 p 3 c f v which can be re written as a 3 d e c t d p c i 1 p c v p 2 p c f v where c v p σ p 2 p 2 is the coefficient of variation of the failure probability setting the first derivative equal to zero one obtains the optimal predictive failure probability that minimizes the total expected cost p o a 4 p o c i c f v 1 c v p 2 when parameter uncertainty is not considered the failure probability that minimizes the total expected cost is p o c i c f v thus a 5 p o p o 1 c v p 2
