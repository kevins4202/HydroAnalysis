16440,hydroxylamine is a nitrogen intermediate of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob that can transiently accumulate during nitrification the impact of hydroxylamine on aerobic ammonium oxidations is still obscure in the present study the short and long term impact of hydroxylamine on partial nitritation granular sludge was investigated dissolved oxygen was the governing factor determining the hydroxylamine impact in short term studies with continuous hydroxylamine feeding continuous short term hydroxylamine feeding together with low dissolved oxygen resulted in higher hydroxylamine accumulation higher n2o production and decreased or maintained ammonium consumption instead high dissolved oxygen reduced hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o production and increased ammonium consumption long term continuous hydroxylamine feeding reduced ammonium consumption rate while the constant nitrite production rate indicated that dosed hydroxylamine was mainly transformed to nitrite this indicates that hydroxylamine was preferred over ammonium as substrate nitrosomonas sp was shown to be predominant during continuous hydroxylamine feeding while the side community shifted graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonium nitrite hydroxylamine ammonium oxidizing bacteria 1 introduction aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob have been studied for over a century these autotrophic organisms are able to transform ammonium to nitrite aerobically hydroxylamine was postulated as intermediate in ammonium oxidation by lees and coworkers lees 1952 thus according to the current aob central nitrogen metabolism ammonium is transformed to hydroxylamine by the enzyme ammonium monooxygenase amo see eq 1 the transformation of ammonium by amo requires oxygen and two electrons then produced hydroxylamine is subsequently transformed to nitrite see eq 2 by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao it has also been proposed that hao only catalyses the transformation of hydroxylamine to no see eq 3 while no is further transformed to no2 chemically or by a yet unidentified enzyme eq 4 caranto and lancaster 2017 hooper and terry 1979 independently of the intermediate steps the conversion of hydroxylamine to nitrite results in 4 electron being produced it is generally accepted that two of these electrons are funneled back to amo while two are dedicated to energy generation within the terminal electron acceptor arp and stein 2003 simon and klotz 2013 stein 2011 where oxygen generally acts as terminal electron acceptor eq 5 1 n h 3 o 2 2 h 2

sufficient terminal electron acceptor anoxic conditions nitrite can act as terminal electron acceptor while generating n2o the use of nitrite as electron acceptor is the so called nitrifier denitrification pathway stein 2011 the anoxic conversion of hydroxylamine to n2o has been recently proposed to be mediated by the cytp460 of hao caranto et al 2016 contrarily the hydroxylamine oxidation pathway producing n2o is generally associated with high oxygen concentrations leading to hydroxylamine partial oxidation to no or n2o stein 2011 yu et al 2010 hydroxylamine is seldom measured or experimentally evaluated in wastewater treatment related research only few studies have reported transient hydroxylamine accumulation events with concentrations ranging from 0 003 up to 4 3 mg n l hu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 soler jofra et al 2016 stüven et al 1992 su et al 2019b yu et al 2010 2018 generally reported data are associated with sbr operations hu et al 2017 su et al 2019b batch tests liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 or switching conditions from aerobic anoxic environments yu and chandran 2010 yu et al 2018 the mechanisms leading to such transient hydroxylamine accumulations are not fully understood different studies have investigated the impact of hydroxylamine on aob communities with contradictory results for instance some studies proposed the use of hydroxylamine to avoid complete nitrification considered as nitrite being further oxidized to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria and achieved a stable partial nitritation operation wang et al 2016 2015 kindaichi et al 2004 noophan et al 2004 contrarily harper and co workers showed that hydroxylamine addition boosted ammonium consumption in the short term but negatively impacted conversion on the long term resulting into a disaggregation of microcolonies harper et al 2009 the scattering or morphological changes were also observed in kindiachi et al 2004 most of these studies used a pulse like feeding strategy of hydroxylamine with generally high hydroxylamine concentrations high concentrations of hydroxylamine are not usual in natural environments and might have caused inhibitory effects as it is a highly reactive compound instead using a rate limiting continuous feeding would limit the potential toxicity of hydroxylamine and would mimic putative environmental conditions of hydroxylamine exposure due to transient accumulation the only study that supplied rate limitng concentrations of hydroxylamine was by de bruijn et al 1995 with a planktonic chemostat culture of nitrosomonas europaea in this study hydroxylamine led to a higher biomass yield as compared to growth on ammonium only they also observed a soluble nitrogen loss that increased with increasing hydroxylamine load as no and or n2o was formed de bruijn et al 1995 additionally mathematical models developed to describe no and n2o emissions from nitrifying sludge included the description of the hydroxylamine oxidation by declaring hydroxylamine concentration as state variable ni and yuan 2015 most of the modeling calibrations to determine the kinetic parameters related to hydroxylamine oxidation were performed by fitting other measured nitrogen species do and or n2o law et al 2012 ni et al 2014 2011 but without direct measurements of hydroxylamine concentration the exception is the study by domingo felez et al 2017 that included hydroxylamine concentration measured data in order to estimate the parameters of hydroxylamine oxidation step and n2o production domingo félez et al 2017 a more comprehensive understanding of the hydroxylamine metabolism by aob is needed since its metabolism has a complex kinetic regulation and it is involved in a wide range of engineered systems factors leading to hydroxylamine accumulation and its impact on n2o emissions are missing not only hydroxylamine affects n2o emissions but also it is known to inhibit nob hydroxylamine pulse addition has been proposed as a strategy to avoid nob proliferation in partial nitritation systems wang et al 2016 2015 kindaichi et al 2004 still the mechanisms leading to nob inhibition by hydroxylamine or information on how hydroxylamine impacts typical nitrification side communities i e anammox denitrification is scarce overall from an engineering point of view understanding hydroxylamine metabolism in typical biofilm systems used in wastewater treatment i e activated sludge or emerging granular sludge technologies where different microbial communities are clustered together could help to design more efficient wastewater treatment plants and minimize n2o emissions sabba et al 2015 in this work we focus on granular sludge as an emerging technology for wastewater treatment but insights obtained equally apply for biofilm and activated sludge systems the main objective of the present study was to investigate how rate limiting feeding of hydroxylamine similar to a putative exposure in natural environments can impact aerobic ammonium oxidizing conversions both on short term i e pulse feed exposure of aob to hydroxylamine as on long term i e continuous exposure to hydroxylamine short term exposure tests were performed by comparing batch tests with ammonium to fed batch tests performed with an ammonium pulse and continuous hydroxylamine feeding performed at different dissolved oxygen tensions furthermore long term hydroxylamine feeding was performed in an aerobic granular sludge reactor performing partial nitritation to study the impact on the metabolism and microbial community dynamics the results were analyzed using a simplified kinetic model that helped to identify the rate limiting steps depending on the substrate conditions and it was also used to explain the hydroxylamine accumulation dynamics finally the apparent kinetic parameters related to the hydroxylamine oxidation were roughly estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two different airlift reactors were operated in this study r1 with a 5 l working volume and r2 with a 2 6 l working volume figs s2 s4 and s6 inoculum characteristics and synthetic medium are described in si two different reactors were used as r1 showed biomass attachment in the settler from day 180 fig s2 to solve this problem r2 was used which had a different settler geometry the ph and the dissolved oxygen do concentrations were measured using online sensors but they were not controlled air flow was controlled with a rotameter aalborg denmark in both r1 and r2 air flow rate and influent rate were adjusted when needed to maintain partial nitritation see figs s2 s4 and s6a during r2 operation with hydroxylamine loading air flow was maintained at 6 l h air flow for r1 can be found in fig s2a between days 140 and 240 of operation of r2 figs s4 and s6 the reactor operation was maintained but not fully characterized due to impossibility to go often to the laboratory n2o in the liquid phase was measured when needed and when possible using a clark type sensor unisense denmark located in the settler of the reactor temperature was controlled with an external water jacket and subsequent external cryostat at ca 22 c when needed during r1 operation fig s2b temperature in r2 was only controlled during the start up at ca 25 c for ca 100 days fig s4b however during the hydroxylamine loading experiments temperature was not controlled but remained rather stable at ca 22 c fig s6b periodically samples were withdrawn from the reactor for further analysis of dissolved nitrogen compounds concentrations biomass concentration average size distribution settling velocity tests fish and 16 s analysis 2 2 short term hydroxylamine feeding batch and fed batch tests to assess the short term impact of hydroxylamine in aob a first ammonium pulse was dosed to granular sludge performing partial nitritation once ammonium was totally consumed a fed batch test was performed with a pulse ammonium and continuous rate limiting hydroxylamine feeding thus the ammonium consumption by aob could be studied with and without hydroxylamine feeding granular sludge from two reactors r1 and r2 see si for further details performing partial nitritation was used the rationale behind using a continuous addition strategy for the hydroxylamine feeding was to mimic what could happen in natural environments where hydroxylamine can transiently accumulate in the bulk liquid liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 su et al 2019b yu et al 2018 instead of using pulse like additions with high initial hydroxylamine concentrations as it has been previously done chandran and smets 2008 wang et al 2015 the batch tests performed with biomass from r1 were performed at different days of operation and also targeting different hydroxylamine loading rates consequently different dissolved oxygen concentrations were reached at each test table 1 a targeted study of the do impact was performed with biomass from r2 and in 4 consecutive days to perform batch and fed batch tests 6 to 9 in table 1 when these tests were performed n2o was also measured as there was a n2o probe available in between experimental days the r2 biomass was aerated and left with an ammonium pulse to avoid as much as possible starvation thus the next morning the biomass was washed with free nitrogen medium and the procedure for the tests started to perform the tests 1 l of r1 or r2 biomass was withdrawn from the reactor and washed twice with nitrogen free synthetic medium r1 biomass was resuspended in 1 l of free nitrogen medium and transferred to a 1 2 l vessel to perform the batch fed batch tests the final volume of the vessel used with biomass from r2 was 0 8 l as 1 l vessel was used a magnetic stirrer was used for agitation tests were performed at 25 c controlling the temperature with an external water bath ph was controlled at ph 8 0 075 with a ph sensor wtw sentix 81 and acid 1 m hcl or base 1 m naoh addition with a microburete an o2 sensor wtw cellox 325 and an n2o sensor unisense were used to monitor dissolved oxygen and dissolved nitrous oxide online compressed air or nitrogen when needed were sparged using a stone diffuser at a flow rate controlled with a mass flow controller bronckhorst f201 c after stabilization of all online signals do ph once ph control was started the oxygen gas transfer coefficient kla was estimated for each batch tests by stopping the air flow or sparging with nitrogen followed by air sparging again see si afterwards the batch tests b were started by a pulse addition of ammonium to the targeted initial concentrations table 1 once the batch was finalized the fed batch test was started by combining a pulse of ammonium and fed batch fb addition of hydroxylamine at the desired load with a programable microburete a cometabolization com in table 1 test of hydroxylamine and ammonium was performed by pulse addition of both substrates to assess putative hydroxylamine inhibition liquid samples 3 4 ml were withdrawn over time filtered and stored in the fridge for further analysis of nitrogen compounds for hydroxylamine determination 1 8 ml of sample were mixed with 0 2 ml of sulfamic acid at 5 g ml biomass concentration during the test was analyzed at the end see physiochemical analysis section for further details rate calculations n2o emissions factor and other calculations related to the batch tests are described in the si 2 3 long term hydroxylamine continuous feeding hydroxylamine long term dosing was performed in r2 from days 254 to 372 by supplying the usual synthetic medium see si and adding an extra dosing pump for hydroxylamine addition hydroxylamine addition was performed separately from the original medium to avoid any type of reaction prior to reaching the reactor hydroxylamine addition flow rate was maintained constant at 1 17 0 04 l d while hydroxylamine influent concentration was increased in each phase in order to increase the hydroxylamine loading rate hydroxylamine solution concentrations used were 57 12 84 6 135 7 and 132 8 mg n l for phase i ii iii and deterioration respectively samples were

assess the impact of hydroxylamine in partial nitritation aerobic granular sludge 3 1 1 dissolved oxygen regulates ammonium and hydroxylamine consumption as well as n2o production granular sludge from two different reactors was used for batch b tests with an ammonium pulse followed with fed batch fb tests with the same ammonium pulse but with hydroxylamine continuous feeding see fig 1 comparing the ammonium consumption rate results of tests with only ammonium and the tests where hydroxylamine was also continuously fed the impact of a low limiting hydroxylamine concentration in the medium on the ammonium uptake rate qnh4 in table 1 could be assessed depending on the dissolved oxygen concentration during the test two different trends where observed i at low do to middle do range 0 8 to 3 6 mg o2 l being tests 1 2 3 4 8 and 9 in table 1 hydroxylamine dosing resulted in a slight increase 1 5 in the ammonium uptake rate tests 3 7 and 9 in table 1 or a 1 31 decrease in the ammonium uptake rate tests 1 2 4 and 8 in table 1 ii at a high do concentration 3 6 to 5 8 mg o2 l test 5 and 6 in table 1 the ammonium uptake rate increased when hydroxylamine was also dosed to the system 13 and 19 increase respectively notice that an increased ammonium consumption at high do was observed with tests performed with biomass from two different reactors r1 and r2 total nitrogen oxidation activity i e including n ammonium and n hydroxylamine was generally increased see fig 1 overall with granular sludge from both r1 and r2 do concentration was the variable impacting the most the metabolism of ammonium and hydroxylamine consumption the effect of do concentration can be observed specially with tests 6 9 fig 1b and table 1 dissolved oxygen do strongly affected ammonium consumption rates as it ranged from ca 30 to 93 mg n gvss h depending on the do instead hydroxylamine consumption rate was slightly influenced being rather constant around 10 13 mg n gvss h table 1 and fig 1b interestingly do not only impacted consumption rates but also hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o emissions fig 2 only when hydroxylamine was dosed continuously during the fed bath tests lower do led to higher hydroxylamine accumulation as hydroxylamine accumulation went from 0 35 mg n l to 1 4 mg n l when oxygen went down from 4 5 to 0 8 mg o2 l fig 2a furthermore lower do also resulted in higher n2o emissions factor the n2o emission factor went from 1 3 to 3 at do 1 8 5 mg o2 l up to ca 21 at do of 0 8 mg o2 l fig 2b when hydroxylamine was continuously added in the tests consequently lower do resulted in higher hydroxylamine accumulation and higher n2o emissions as just mentioned in some fed batch tests hydroxylamine was accumulating up to relatively high concentrations 1 mg n l see table 1 to specifically investigate the effect of elevated hydroxylamine concentrations the co metabolization of hydroxylamine and ammonium was evaluated in tests were a pulse of both hydroxylamine and ammonium where added after a nitrification batch test without hydroxylamine addition the initial hydroxylamine concentration was 7 mg n l for test 9 see table 1 thus hydroxylamine concentrations were higher during the co metabolization experiments than those observed in the tests with continuous hydroxylamine addition the ammonium oxidation rate was 61 mg n gvss h during the batch with only ammonium and 56 mg n gvss h when hydroxylamine and ammonium were both present summarizing at low do hydroxylamine addition resulted in decreased or slightly increased ammonium consumption rate hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o production whereas at high do hydroxylamine addition increased ammonium consumption with less hydroxylamine accumulating and less n2o produced figs 1 and 2 3 2 long term impact of hydroxylamine feeding to a continuous flow partial nitritation reactor 3 2 1 hydroxylamine is transformed to nitrite and reduces ammonium consumption a stable operating continuous flow granular sludge nitritation reactor was subjected to adding hydroxylamine at various loading rates the impact on the nitrogen conversion processes and the microbial population dynamics were assessed the hydroxylamine load to the granular sludge airlift reactor was gradually increased during 3 operational phases phase i ii and iii in figs s6 and s8 the air flow was maintained stable during the whole operation the do gradually increased from 3 6 0 2 mg o2 l without hydroxylamine addition to 4 3 0 4 4 4 0 9 and 5 2 0 5 mg o2 l in phase i ii and iii respectively see figs s6b and s8b the ph did not vary significantly during the operation figs s6b and s8c granule size and particle size distribution was stable over time fig s7 as well as biomass concentration during phase i ii and iii figs s6c and s8a interestingly ammonium consumption rate decreased with increasing hydroxylamine loading rate see fig 3 a nitrite production remained the same with or without hydroxylamine the decreased ammonium conversion and constant nitrite production indicates that the hydroxylamine conversion to nitrite compensated the decreased ammonium conversion the stoichiometric ratio calculated from the produced nitrite over total nitrogen consumed including nh2oh and ammonium consumption was close to the theoretical value of 1 fig 3d a maximum of ca 2 7 nitrogen was unaccounted in the nitrogen balance during the whole reactor operation which can be due to accumulated measurement error combined with n2o production for instance occasional n2o was detected in the liquid phase specially at the beginning of hydroxylamine feeding during phase i but decreased after few hours see fig s9a occasionally n2o peaks were detected in the liquid 1 mg n l but not in a consistent and continuous way see fig s9b more n2o measurements could not be performed during the rest of the phases due to technical problems with the sensor 3 2 2 microbial community dynamics the microbial population dynamics during the airlift reactor operation without and with hydroxylamine feeding was investigated using fish and 16s rrna sequencing fish performed in pottered biomass indicated that the majority of the population was formed by aob over time a slight increase in nob population and a decrease of the eub signal was observed in the slides for pottered sludge samples fig s10 when observing cryosectioned granules a very low number of nob could be observed fig s11 the relative abundance of aob nitrosomonas sp in the 16s rrna analysis was stable at 42 6 of the otu s over the full operational period fig 4 which corresponded with the generally distributed hybridization of nso190 probe in the fish three different otus were identified as nitrosomonas one of them nitrosomonas sp 2 in fig 4 significantly increased from the beginning of the hydroxylamine feeding from 5 2 to 13 3 in days 102 283 and days 296 332 respectively the nitrosomonas out s could not be conclusively allocated to a cluster see table s3 for the raw sequences interestingly no nob otu s were detected with 16s rna analysis in accordance with fish performed on cryosectioned granules and with the low nitrate production observed during cultivation still contradicting partially the fish results for pottered biomass samples where nob signal although at a low intensity was detected in some of the samples the side population as observed by 16s rrna sequencing showed a considerable change when hydroxylamine was fed for instance acidovorax went from ca 6 1 in the control phase up to ca 25 3 in phase i and ii however in phase iii it decreased again up to 14 2 and the side population switched to unclassified microorganisms from the family xanthomonadaceae thermomonas and brevundimonas 3 2 3 experimental assessment of apparent hydroxylamine consumption kinetics in the present work during the continuous feeding of hydroxylamine and ammonium to the continuous flow granular sludge airlift reactor residual hydroxylamine was measured daily for each hydroxylamine loading rate taking into account that total hydroxylamine consumption by the reactor is derived from the inflow hydroxylamine as well as from the ammonium oxidation as hydroxylamine is an intermediate step the apparent half saturation coefficient and apparent maximum consumption rate for the granular sludge system was estimated using curve fitting of the data to a typical monod consumption kinetic model fig 5 maximum hydroxylamine consumption was estimated to be 359 16 mg n l d 46 22 mg n gvss h and hydroxylamine half saturation coefficient was estimated as 0 015 0 006 mg n l 4 discussion 4 1 dissolved oxygen governs hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o production the do concentration was identified as the main factor governing hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o production in a nitrification process fig 2 additionally the ammonium consumption rate was impacted by hydroxylamine dosage depending on the do concentration figs 1 and 2 in order to be able to explain the observed impact of hydroxylamine addition on ammonium oxidation the kinetics and factors governing ammonium oxidation are crucial see fig 6 three main reactions are responsible for the observed ammonia oxidation rates i ammonium transformation to hydroxylamine mediated by amo ii hydroxylamine oxidation to nitrite mediated by hao and iii the electron transport chain e t c these reactions are all linked by the reduced mred or oxidized forms of the electron carriers mox see fig 6 when both ammonium and oxygen concentrations are high their corresponding monod terms will tend towards one see rnh3 and ro2 in fig 6 resulting in the simplified eqs 16 and 17 the availability of mred will depend on the hydroxylamine consumption rate rnh2oh consequently rnh2oh will determine the process velocity in such conditions hydroxylamine is not likely to accumulate as sufficiently mox should be available and hydroxylamine consumption will determine both rnh3 and ro2 by providing them with mred consequently rmax of each reaction and the affinities for mred will govern the rnh3 and ro2 kinetic rates see eqs 7 and 8 7 r n h 3 r m a x n h 3 c m r e d c m r e d k m r e d n h 3 8 r o 2 r max o 2 c mred c mred k mred etc on the contrary if ammonium concentration is high and dissolved oxygen concentration is low the conversion of hydroxylamine rnh2oh will be limited by the turnover of mox once mred is used during ammonium consumption or the oxygen electron consumption in the terminal electron acceptor chain in such conditions the ammonium monod term or rnh3 will not play an important role as it will approach 1 see rnh3 in fig 6 as oxygen concentrations are low oxygen affinities and maximum rates will now play an important role and small differences in these values will determine if rnh3 or ro2 is the rate limiting process see eqs 9 and 10 thus hydroxylamine and putatively other intermediates will tend to accumulate if the mox needed for the reaction is not regenerated fast enough as a strategy to avoid nh2oh and other intermediates accumulation mred can be used to convert nitrite or no generated from hydroxylamine to n2o and generating mox as it does not depend on oxygen availability 9 r n h 3 r max n h 3 c o 2 c o 2 k o 2 n h 3 c mred c mred k mred n h 3 10 r o 2 r max o 2 c o 2 c o 2 k o 2 c mred c mred k mred etc overall ammonium oxidation is highly regulated by the availability and turnover of mred and mox the affinities for substrates and the difference of maximum rates between the amo hao and the e t c corresponding reactions might impact the process regulation see eqs 15 to 9 depending on the ammonium and oxygen consumption parameters hydroxylamine accumulation will be most likely at high ammonium concentrations and limiting oxygen concentrations the kinetic explanation is in agreement with the experimental observations reported here for instance in the fed batch tests where hydroxylamine was continuously dosed and performed at lower do and high initial ammonium concentrations batches 8 and 9 in table 1 and fig 2a hydroxylamine accumulated the most more n2o was produced at lower do concentrations fig 2b as a strategy to use the available mred to generate mox without consuming oxygen when do was higher less hydroxylamine accumulated and less n2o was produced fig 2 overall the impact of do on hydroxylamine accumulation shows that somehow the limiting step for the process is the mox production either resulting from ammonium consumption or oxygen consumption in e t c the kinetic analysis proposed here also easily fits with observed transient accumulation events of hydroxylamine reported in literature without external addition of hydroxylamine for instance hydroxylamine has been transiently detected when switching from anoxic to aerobic conditions in planktonic chemostat cultures of nitrosomonas eruopaea yu et al 2010 2017 2018 at such conditions the oxidized form of the electron carriers will be limiting at the beginning of the aeration phase limiting the availability of mox for hydroxylamine consumption it makes it likely that hydroxylamine transiently accumulates until sufficient mox is generated indeed n2o peaks were detected just after the switch from anoxic to aerobic conditions in nitrification cultures yu et al 2010 2017 2018 consequently n2o was generated at the beginning of the transition to aerobic conditions to use the available mred and convert it to mox to generate sufficient mox for hydroxylamine conversion similarly in sbr processes with mixed cultures transient hydroxylamine production right after the start of the feeding phase has been detected su et al 2019b a step increase in ammonium loading rate also showed to generate transient accumulation events in continuous systems hu et al 2017 poot et al 2016 when a step increase in ammonium load occurs the system will tend to be more kinetically oxygen limited finally when performing batch tests with only ammonium hydroxylamine has also been shown to accumulate liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 the initial high concentration of ammonium allowing a fast conversion can easily lead to oxygen uptake limitations and higher levels of mred and accumulation of some hydroxylamine liu et al 2017 measured higher hydroxylamine concentration peaks with higher initial ammonium concentrations the higher the ammonium concentration the more likely it will be kinetically limited by oxygen liu et al 2017 also observed different hydroxylamine accumulation pattern in different aob aoa and comammox strains this would fit with the high dependency of hydroxylamine accumulation on the affinities and maximum rates of amo and e t c conversions thus depending on the affinities or maximum velocities of the different aob aoa comammox strains they will be able to maintain a sufficiently high mox supply or reducing ammonium consumption to avoid hydroxylamine accumulation in the present study during the batches b with only ammonium as substrate no hydroxylamine accumulation was observed independent of the do concentration imposed however increased hydroxylamine accumulation was observed with decreasing oxygen concentration during fed batch tests fig 2 thus it could be expected that in inner zones of the biofilm hydroxylamine could accumulate as do is lower however once hydroxylamine diffuses to outer layers of the biofilm with higher do concentrations it might be consumed there and not seen in the bulk liquid consequently the granular structure of our sludge might have masked putative transient accumulation of hydroxylamine during batches with only ammonium thus hydroxylamine could be transformed before reaching the bulk liquid as also discussed in poot et al 2016 overall it should be highlighted that when having conditions with low oxygen and high ammonium concentrations the ammonium oxidation or the consumption of oxygen in electron transport chain could be limiting the hydroxylamine conversion step thus favoring hydroxylamine accumulation if the oxidized electron mediators are not provided fast enough 4 2 ammonium consumption is regulated based on hydroxylamine and electron donor availability the do concentration not only triggered hydroxylamine accumulation but also had a direct impact on the ammonium consumption rate in the batch tests with continuous hydroxylamine feeding ammonium consumption was increased when hydroxylamine was present at high do batches 5 and 6 in fig 1 and table 1 however if do was low ammonium consumption was maintained or slightly reduced when hydroxylamine was fed fig 1 table 1 this can be explained because at high do hydroxylamine conversion will be less limited by mox fig 6 when hydroxylamine is added extra the available mred will increase which can boost the ammonium consumption see fig 7 a in previous studies the impact of hydroxylamine was only investigated during the so called acceleration phase but never during continuous exposure the acceleration phase is related to the delay observed on reaching the maximum ammonium consumption capacity when adding an ammonium pulse to a nitrification system chandran and smets 2008 guisasola et al 2006 the hypothesis was that the level of reduced electron mediator was initially limiting the ammonium oxidation guisasola et al 2006 adding hydroxylamine in form of a pulse to an aerated system before the addition of ammonium reduced dramatically the acceleration phase chandran and smets 2008 it was hypothesized that hydroxylamine would increase the level of reduced electron mediator allowing ammonium to proceed at maximal rate from the start of ammonium addition chandran and smets 2008 however our study did not focus on the initial ammonium consumption rate as in chandran and smets 2008 guisasola et al 2006 but rather on the ammonium consumption rate once stable do was reached thus indicating that extra hydroxylamine can increase ammonium consumption when sufficient oxygen is available when do was low and hydroxylamine was provided ammonium consumption was either maintained slightly increased or reduced and hydroxylamine accumulated resulting in high n2o formation in the fed batch tests figs 1 and 2 when hydroxylamine was fed continuously to the airlift reactor at different loading rates ammonium oxidation was also reduced and do increased gradually indicating a decrease on the oxygen uptake rate figs 3a and si during the long term feeding of hydroxylamine the do might have been rate limiting especially in the inner parts of the granules the conditions observed during the continuous feeding might have been comparable to the middle do conditions of the fed batch test experiments low amounts of hydroxylamine accumulated and a low n2o production was observed while ammonium consumption decreased with increasing hydroxylamine loading rates fig 3a the range of do triggering higher ammonium consumption rates might be impacted by other conditions continuous long term operation was performed at lower ph and temperature ca 7 6 and 22 c than the batch tests ph 8 and 30 c at lower temperature and lower ph the ammonium consumption rate is decreased jubany et al 2008 consequently maximum ammonium consumption rate will be lower and extra hydroxylamine dosing might have a different impact as limiting do ranges will differ the reduction of ammonium consumption when hydroxylamine was provided and do was kinetically limiting might be explained as follows from a kinetic point of view other process competing for similar substrates oxygen and mred are relatively faster than ammonium consumption resulting in the reduced ammonium oxidation rate alternatively when supplying extra hydroxylamine more mred is generated with higher do thus the affinity for mred is less critical if do is not sufficiently high the extra generated mred is not redistributed to increase ammonium consumption oxygen will then limit the turnover of mred to mox not providing the mox needed for hydroxylamine conversion having a slightly faster oxygen consumption in the e t c than for ammonium consumption when oxygen is limiting makes sense as a strategy to avoid as much as possible intermediates accumulation nh2oh or no under oxygen limiting conditions this is what was actually observed in the continuous airlift reactor where ammonium consumption was reduced and dissolved oxygen in the system increased with increasing hydroxylamine loading rates see figs 3a and si it should be highlighted that even ammonium consumption was reduced total nitrite production was not fig 3 indicating that hydroxylamine was mainly being transformed to nitrite fig 3 with the observed increased bulk do concentration over time it would have been expected for aob to use such extra do to consume more ammonium however ammonium consumption rate was reduced suggesting that the e t c rate was the main rate governing factor in the process as if more electrons were derived from nh2oh there was less demand to derive electrons from full ammonium oxidation to nitrite consequently the use of electrons from hydroxylamine conversion reduced both the ammonium and oxygen consumption overall small differences between the parameters will efficiently regulate the whole process as oxygen consumption during ammonium consumption needs to be generally faster than the e t c otherwise ammonium consumption would not take place understanding the coupling between each process would allow to further understand the central nitrogen metabolism regulation n2o formation was detected both in the batch tests and during the continuous airlift reactor feeding figs 2 and s9 specifically higher n2o emissions were detected during the batch tests with hydroxylamine feeding at low do concentration fig 2 at the conditions at which the tests were performed ph 8 and 25 c and low nitritre concentrations the abiotic reaction of hydroxylamine and free nitrous acid is not likely soler jofra et al 2016 su et al 2019a the traditional biochemical pathway resulting in n2o emissions when oxygen concentration is low is called nitrifier denitrification stein 2011 nitrite is reduced to n2o to compensate limiting amounts of oxygen as terminal electron acceptor however in our experiments hydroxylamine accumulation might be more direct related to n2o formation recently a biochemical route from hydroxylamine to n2o was proposed to be mediated by cytp460 caranto et al 2016 in the absence of oxygen at the low do in granular sludge systems the deeper layers in the granules will be deprived of oxygen to further confirm if either nitrite or hydroxylamine was being consumed to form n2o 15n or and site preference studies will be necessary furthermore an initial high n2o production was observed at the beginning of the hydroxylamine long term dosing in the airlift reactor fig s9 this initial high n2o production might have been a transient metabolic solution in order to provide sufficient mred to consume the extra hydroxylamine dosed and avoid its accumulation most likely do was initially insufficiently high to cope with the extra dosing of hydroxylamine using n2o production as a solution targeted experiments to understand no n2o production with rate limiting hydroxylamine feeding and how the metabolism rearranges from a transcriptomic proteomic point of view would be crucial to understand such complex behaviors overall when oxygen is high the hydroxylamine oxidation step is in charge on regulating the whole aob metabolism at these conditions if external hydroxylamine is available ammonium consumption is boosted by the extra formation of mred it is interesting to realize that the maximal ammonium oxidation rate can be increased in the presence of externally added hydroxylamine when oxygen is limiting the preferential use of oxygen as terminal electron acceptor will reduce the ammonium oxidation rate preventing accumulation of nitrification intermediates indirectly hydroxylamine oxidation will be also regulated by the oxygen use in the e t c if not sufficient mox is provided hydroxylamine will accumulate consequently the differences between the ammonium oxidation rate and the turnover of terminal acceptor will determine the putative accumulation of hydroxylamine 4 3 more hydroxylamine rate limiting continuous feeding studies are needed to understand the long term impact of hydroxylamine on ammonium oxidation in the continuous airlift reactor hydroxylamine was efficiently transformed to nitrite combined with a reduced ammonium oxidation however after ca 3 months of operation with hydroxylamine feeding the reactor operation deteriorated quite quickly see fig s6 other indications of deterioration are the decreased eub signal observed with fish over time and the appearance of a mainly oligotrophic side population figs 4 s10 and s11 different possibilities might explain this deterioration at the working conditions ph 7 7 hydroxylamine is mainly unprotonated see fig s11b thus it can diffuse over the cell membrane this gives an uncoupling effect and results in extra energy demand reducing the growth of bacteria another possibility was that the cell could not cope with the reduced ammonium consumption increased e t c velocity and growth at the same time previous studies with hydroxylamine were mainly performed by pulse like addition strategies harper et al 2009 okabe et al 2011 wan et al 2016 wang et al 2015 with these type of feedings a negative impact of hydroxylamine was reported by harper and co workers on the long run harper et al 2009 while other studies used hydroxylamine as a strategy to promote partial nitrification over full nitrification wan et al 2016 wang et al 2015 the only comparable study in terms of feeding strategies was performed by de bruijn et al 1995 a higher growth yield was reported when feeding mixotrophically ammonium and hydroxylamine than when feeding only with ammonium ammonium oxidation was not deteriorated in de brujin study indicating that nitrosomonas europaea could grow mixotrophically with hydroxylamine this would fit with the fact that nitrosomonas was the predominant aob in the present study fig 4 and that the biomass concentration was maintained during the different hydroxylamine feeding figs s8a and 6c de bruijn et al 1995 also observed a bigger nitrogen imbalance than observed in the present study their experiments were performed with planktonic cells and conditions i e 30 do saturation ph 8 and 30 c that are deviating from those in the present study i e granular sludge 22 3 1 2 c ph 7 4 0 1 do from 3 6 0 2 to 5 2 0 5 mg o2 l see figure s8 one putative explanation for the higher nitrogen imbalance observed by de bruijn is that at higher ph and temperature ammonium consumption is promoted see fig s12 thus if on top of that an intermediate like hydroxylamine is fed it is more likely that hydroxylamine accumulates promoting a bigger nitrogen imbalance and the formation of n2o emissions as seen in the experiments of de bruijn et al 1995 it would be interesting to have a better characterization of no n2o emissions as due to technical problems n2o was not followed during the whole operation with hydroxylamine overall to assess the possible long term impact of hydroxylamine feeding transcriptomics and proteomics will be crucial to give more insight on the impact of hydroxylamine in nitrification more studies will be needed with limiting hydroxylamine feeding to reach definitive conclusions 4 4 importance of the hydroxylamine oxidation step in modeling n2o emissions the hydroxylamine accumulation and the no or n2o production as a function of the oxygen concentration will be very sensitive to the kinetic parameters half saturation coefficient and maximum rate governing each process step in a mathematical model the importance of parameter estimations in model applications is crucial for a good model use and process understanding petersen et al 2003 sin et al 2005 the widely used activated sludge models asm did not include intermediate processes such as nitrite or hydroxylamine henze et al 2000 this was justified by the main model purpose estimating the effluent concentrations the concentrations of intermediates of ammonium conversion to nitrate have a marginal impact on the nitrogen mass balance of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in recent years the asm have been extended for nitrite because of the interest in partial nitrification anammox process hao and van loosdrecht 2004 with the growing interest in greenhouse gas emissions also other intermediates in nitrogen conversion processes no and n2o became state variables in activated sludge models ni and yuan 2015 parameters related to the hydroxylamine oxidation step in nitrification rnh2oh in fig 6 such as hydroxylamine half saturation coefficient knh2oh or maximum hydroxylamine oxidation rate μnh2oh knh2oh or rmax nh3 in d 1 or mg n gvss h depending on the nomenclature and notation used are usually not evaluated from dedicated experiments even more importantly the oxygen affinity of the e t c during hydroxylamine oxidation as single substrate has rarely been determined hydroxylamine conversion related parameters have usually been obtained from multivariable optimization of a large set of parameters through ammonium nitrite do and or n2o data fitting law et al 2012 ni et al 2011 recently domingo felez et al 2017 presented a calibration methodology to obtain such parameters which takes into account hydroxylamine measurement data and dedicated respirometry experiments there are hardly or no good hydroxylamine conversion data with mixed cultures and only few experimental data with hydroxylamine conversion by pure cultures de bruijn et al 1995 frijlink et al 1992 stein et al 1997 furthermore in view of the do impact on ammonium and hydroxylamine oxidation rates as well as on the n2o formation see figs 1 and 2 kinetic parameter determinations will be really sensible to oxygen concentrations for instance to be able to determine maximum ammonium consumption rates one should be aware to avoid or reduce as much as possible oxygen limitations with the hydroxylamine continuous addition experiments performed in the present study an apparent maximum hydroxylamine conversion coefficient and apparent affinity constant were estimated fig 5 it should be noted that the parameters presented here are all apparent and performed with granular sludge thus they might differ depending on the biofilm type structure and microbial composition apparent kinetic parameters are commonly used in asm modeling still obtaining intrinsic parameters would be desirable however to obtain intrinsic parameters from floc or biofilm systems is not trivial as several parameters impact the determination from calculations van den berg et al 2020 for example substrate diffusivities granule size granule porosity and density etc even if all the parameters could be determined accurately microcolony size and distribution within the granule structure will impact the parameter estimation see picioreanu et al 2016 consequently planktonic pure cultures will be needed for obtaining intrinsic kinetic parameters the experimental set up used here and in de bruijn et al 1995 continuous rate limiting feeding of hydroxylamine could be used for hydroxylamine kinetic parameters determination in planktonic cultures also the inclusion of no measurements would allow for a better understanding of the role of this other intermediate in nitrification hao and van loosdrecht 2004 kampschreur et al 2008a 2008b no measurements during hydroxylamine feeding might also be of interest to see if this compound transiently accumulates or is emitted when hydroxylamine is added overall if hydroxylamine is introduced as a state variable in a model its kinetic apparent parameters are to be calibrated accordingly which is not commonly performed 4 5 implication of the findings and future challenges in the present study the effect of do on hydroxylamine by an aob enriched granular sludge biomass was studied one important aspect that was not investigated is the ph effect the dissociation of nitrogen compounds has in general a strong impact on nitrification processes anthonisen 1976 hydroxylamine is a weak base pka value 5 94 at 25 c haynes 2014 and will therefore change from nh3oh to nh2oh in the physiological ph range see fig s11b in the simplified model proposed fig 6 ph can have several effects on the different reactions involved in ammonium oxidation i the equilibrium between protonated and unprotonated form of ammonium and hydroxylamine might impact its diffusion through the membrane ii frijlink et al 1992 showed that ammonium oxidation was highly impacted by ph whereas hydroxylamine oxidation was not reducing ammonium oxidation with lower ph iii the difference in proton concentration between the periplasm and cytoplasm will impact the e t c and potentially also the energy generation step moreover the intrinsic impact of ph on substrates and each conversion step rates ph gradients usually exist in biofilm systems and granule systems thus different consumption rates might be expected depending on the location in the biofilm this overall complexity of influence of ph on hydroxylamine conversion warrants a more detailed investigation in the future the impact of intermediates no and hydroxylamine on nitrous oxide production during nitrification can only be understood when the detailed biochemistry of these conversion has been revealed soler jofra et al 2020 stein 2011 proteomics and transcriptomics techniques have emerged and strongly developed in recent years transcriptomics and proteomic studies in similar systems as the one studied here might help to reveal the enzymes involved in n2o productions or the putative enzyme involved in no conversion to nitrite if there is one as if forcing hydroxylamine conversion one would expect that the enzymes related to its transformation to be upregulated as also discussed in the present study the combination of rate limiting hydroxylamine feeding with 15n and site preference techniques could help also to elucidate and further understand the fate of hydroxylamine in such systems depending on the conditions for example helping to reveal if it is nitrite or hydroxylamine the one being transformed to n2o at low dissolved oxygen concentrations finally it should be highlighted that most of the wastewater treatment facilities operate at low do concentrations to minimise aeration energy and costs furthermore fluctuations in ammonium concentrations are usually occurring chen et al 2020 these form the perfect conditions for hydroxylamine accumulation according to what has been discussed in the present work and the transient hydroxylamine accumulations events observed in literature liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 su et al 2019b the transient accumulation that is seen in the bulk liquid is the result of consumption and production processes inside flocs and biofilms conditions also vary and do is low thus accumulation of hydroxylamine in the inner parts of the biofilms is likely even due to the reactivity of hydroxylamine it cannot be measured in the bulk liquid consequently the understanding of how small quantities of hydroxylamine might impact common side communities of aob such as nob anammox dnra denitrifiers or neighboring cells of aob is important more interestingly the contribution of hydroxylamine to produce n2o anoxically has still to be further investigated highlighting the importance of understanding intermediate steps to be able to understand the process as a whole 5 conclusions the main objective of the present study was to further understand how rate limiting hydroxylamine feeding similar to a putative exposure in natural environments could impact aerobic ammonium oxidizing metabolism by means of different experiments involving hydroxylamine continuous rate limiting feeding with aerobic granular sludge performing partial nitritation the following conclusions were reached hydroxylamine short term continuous rate limiting feeding triggered n2o emissions in comparison with the batch tests with only ammonium as substrate where no n2o was detected do combined with high ammonium concentrations kinetically governed hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o emissions an increasing trend was observed for both hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o emissions with lower do do also determines the impact of hydroxylamine in ammonium consumption when do is sufficiently high ammonium consumption can be increased as more reducing equivalents are generated from supplemented hydroxylamine oxidation on the contrary when do is low ammonium consumption will be reduced long term hydroxylamine feeding reduced ammonium consumption while nitrite production was maintained dissolved oxygen increased with increasing loading rate and those extra electrons generated from hydroxylamine were allocated in the electron transport chain instead of ammonium oxidation nitrosomonas remained rather dominant during long term airlift

16440,hydroxylamine is a nitrogen intermediate of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob that can transiently accumulate during nitrification the impact of hydroxylamine on aerobic ammonium oxidations is still obscure in the present study the short and long term impact of hydroxylamine on partial nitritation granular sludge was investigated dissolved oxygen was the governing factor determining the hydroxylamine impact in short term studies with continuous hydroxylamine feeding continuous short term hydroxylamine feeding together with low dissolved oxygen resulted in higher hydroxylamine accumulation higher n2o production and decreased or maintained ammonium consumption instead high dissolved oxygen reduced hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o production and increased ammonium consumption long term continuous hydroxylamine feeding reduced ammonium consumption rate while the constant nitrite production rate indicated that dosed hydroxylamine was mainly transformed to nitrite this indicates that hydroxylamine was preferred over ammonium as substrate nitrosomonas sp was shown to be predominant during continuous hydroxylamine feeding while the side community shifted graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonium nitrite hydroxylamine ammonium oxidizing bacteria 1 introduction aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob have been studied for over a century these autotrophic organisms are able to transform ammonium to nitrite aerobically hydroxylamine was postulated as intermediate in ammonium oxidation by lees and coworkers lees 1952 thus according to the current aob central nitrogen metabolism ammonium is transformed to hydroxylamine by the enzyme ammonium monooxygenase amo see eq 1 the transformation of ammonium by amo requires oxygen and two electrons then produced hydroxylamine is subsequently transformed to nitrite see eq 2 by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao it has also been proposed that hao only catalyses the transformation of hydroxylamine to no see eq 3 while no is further transformed to no2 chemically or by a yet unidentified enzyme eq 4 caranto and lancaster 2017 hooper and terry 1979 independently of the intermediate steps the conversion of hydroxylamine to nitrite results in 4 electron being produced it is generally accepted that two of these electrons are funneled back to amo while two are dedicated to energy generation within the terminal electron acceptor arp and stein 2003 simon and klotz 2013 stein 2011 where oxygen generally acts as terminal electron acceptor eq 5 1 n h 3 o 2 2 h 2 e n h 2 o h h 2 o 2 n h 2 o h h 2 o n o 2 5 h 4 e 3 n h 2 o h n o 3 h 3 e 4 n o h 2 o n o 2 2 h 1 e 5 1 2 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o two n2o production pathways have been described in aob when there is not sufficient terminal electron acceptor anoxic conditions nitrite can act as terminal electron acceptor while generating n2o the use of nitrite as electron acceptor is the so called nitrifier denitrification pathway stein 2011 the anoxic conversion of hydroxylamine to n2o has been recently proposed to be mediated by the cytp460 of hao caranto et al 2016 contrarily the hydroxylamine oxidation pathway producing n2o is generally associated with high oxygen concentrations leading to hydroxylamine partial oxidation to no or n2o stein 2011 yu et al 2010 hydroxylamine is seldom measured or experimentally evaluated in wastewater treatment related research only few studies have reported transient hydroxylamine accumulation events with concentrations ranging from 0 003 up to 4 3 mg n l hu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 soler jofra et al 2016 stüven et al 1992 su et al 2019b yu et al 2010 2018 generally reported data are associated with sbr operations hu et al 2017 su et al 2019b batch tests liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 or switching conditions from aerobic anoxic environments yu and chandran 2010 yu et al 2018 the mechanisms leading to such transient hydroxylamine accumulations are not fully understood different studies have investigated the impact of hydroxylamine on aob communities with contradictory results for instance some studies proposed the use of hydroxylamine to avoid complete nitrification considered as nitrite being further oxidized to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria and achieved a stable partial nitritation operation wang et al 2016 2015 kindaichi et al 2004 noophan et al 2004 contrarily harper and co workers showed that hydroxylamine addition boosted ammonium consumption in the short term but negatively impacted conversion on the long term resulting into a disaggregation of microcolonies harper et al 2009 the scattering or morphological changes were also observed in kindiachi et al 2004 most of these studies used a pulse like feeding strategy of hydroxylamine with generally high hydroxylamine concentrations high concentrations of hydroxylamine are not usual in natural environments and might have caused inhibitory effects as it is a highly reactive compound instead using a rate limiting continuous feeding would limit the potential toxicity of hydroxylamine and would mimic putative environmental conditions of hydroxylamine exposure due to transient accumulation the only study that supplied rate limitng concentrations of hydroxylamine was by de bruijn et al 1995 with a planktonic chemostat culture of nitrosomonas europaea in this study hydroxylamine led to a higher biomass yield as compared to growth on ammonium only they also observed a soluble nitrogen loss that increased with increasing hydroxylamine load as no and or n2o was formed de bruijn et al 1995 additionally mathematical models developed to describe no and n2o emissions from nitrifying sludge included the description of the hydroxylamine oxidation by declaring hydroxylamine concentration as state variable ni and yuan 2015 most of the modeling calibrations to determine the kinetic parameters related to hydroxylamine oxidation were performed by fitting other measured nitrogen species do and or n2o law et al 2012 ni et al 2014 2011 but without direct measurements of hydroxylamine concentration the exception is the study by domingo felez et al 2017 that included hydroxylamine concentration measured data in order to estimate the parameters of hydroxylamine oxidation step and n2o production domingo félez et al 2017 a more comprehensive understanding of the hydroxylamine metabolism by aob is needed since its metabolism has a complex kinetic regulation and it is involved in a wide range of engineered systems factors leading to hydroxylamine accumulation and its impact on n2o emissions are missing not only hydroxylamine affects n2o emissions but also it is known to inhibit nob hydroxylamine pulse addition has been proposed as a strategy to avoid nob proliferation in partial nitritation systems wang et al 2016 2015 kindaichi et al 2004 still the mechanisms leading to nob inhibition by hydroxylamine or information on how hydroxylamine impacts typical nitrification side communities i e anammox denitrification is scarce overall from an engineering point of view understanding hydroxylamine metabolism in typical biofilm systems used in wastewater treatment i e activated sludge or emerging granular sludge technologies where different microbial communities are clustered together could help to design more efficient wastewater treatment plants and minimize n2o emissions sabba et al 2015 in this work we focus on granular sludge as an emerging technology for wastewater treatment but insights obtained equally apply for biofilm and activated sludge systems the main objective of the present study was to investigate how rate limiting feeding of hydroxylamine similar to a putative exposure in natural environments can impact aerobic ammonium oxidizing conversions both on short term i e pulse feed exposure of aob to hydroxylamine as on long term i e continuous exposure to hydroxylamine short term exposure tests were performed by comparing batch tests with ammonium to fed batch tests performed with an ammonium pulse and continuous hydroxylamine feeding performed at different dissolved oxygen tensions furthermore long term hydroxylamine feeding was performed in an aerobic granular sludge reactor performing partial nitritation to study the impact on the metabolism and microbial community dynamics the results were analyzed using a simplified kinetic model that helped to identify the rate limiting steps depending on the substrate conditions and it was also used to explain the hydroxylamine accumulation dynamics finally the apparent kinetic parameters related to the hydroxylamine oxidation were roughly estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two different airlift reactors were operated in this study r1 with a 5 l working volume and r2 with a 2 6 l working volume figs s2 s4 and s6 inoculum characteristics and synthetic medium are described in si two different reactors were used as r1 showed biomass attachment in the settler from day 180 fig s2 to solve this problem r2 was used which had a different settler geometry the ph and the dissolved oxygen do concentrations were measured using online sensors but they were not controlled air flow was controlled with a rotameter aalborg denmark in both r1 and r2 air flow rate and influent rate were adjusted when needed to maintain partial nitritation see figs s2 s4 and s6a during r2 operation with hydroxylamine loading air flow was maintained at 6 l h air flow for r1 can be found in fig s2a between days 140 and 240 of operation of r2 figs s4 and s6 the reactor operation was maintained but not fully characterized due to impossibility to go often to the laboratory n2o in the liquid phase was measured when needed and when possible using a clark type sensor unisense denmark located in the settler of the reactor temperature was controlled with an external water jacket and subsequent external cryostat at ca 22 c when needed during r1 operation fig s2b temperature in r2 was only controlled during the start up at ca 25 c for ca 100 days fig s4b however during the hydroxylamine loading experiments temperature was not controlled but remained rather stable at ca 22 c fig s6b periodically samples were withdrawn from the reactor for further analysis of dissolved nitrogen compounds concentrations biomass concentration average size distribution settling velocity tests fish and 16 s analysis 2 2 short term hydroxylamine feeding batch and fed batch tests to assess the short term impact of hydroxylamine in aob a first ammonium pulse was dosed to granular sludge performing partial nitritation once ammonium was totally consumed a fed batch test was performed with a pulse ammonium and continuous rate limiting hydroxylamine feeding thus the ammonium consumption by aob could be studied with and without hydroxylamine feeding granular sludge from two reactors r1 and r2 see si for further details performing partial nitritation was used the rationale behind using a continuous addition strategy for the hydroxylamine feeding was to mimic what could happen in natural environments where hydroxylamine can transiently accumulate in the bulk liquid liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 su et al 2019b yu et al 2018 instead of using pulse like additions with high initial hydroxylamine concentrations as it has been previously done chandran and smets 2008 wang et al 2015 the batch tests performed with biomass from r1 were performed at different days of operation and also targeting different hydroxylamine loading rates consequently different dissolved oxygen concentrations were reached at each test table 1 a targeted study of the do impact was performed with biomass from r2 and in 4 consecutive days to perform batch and fed batch tests 6 to 9 in table 1 when these tests were performed n2o was also measured as there was a n2o probe available in between experimental days the r2 biomass was aerated and left with an ammonium pulse to avoid as much as possible starvation thus the next morning the biomass was washed with free nitrogen medium and the procedure for the tests started to perform the tests 1 l of r1 or r2 biomass was withdrawn from the reactor and washed twice with nitrogen free synthetic medium r1 biomass was resuspended in 1 l of free nitrogen medium and transferred to a 1 2 l vessel to perform the batch fed batch tests the final volume of the vessel used with biomass from r2 was 0 8 l as 1 l vessel was used a magnetic stirrer was used for agitation tests were performed at 25 c controlling the temperature with an external water bath ph was controlled at ph 8 0 075 with a ph sensor wtw sentix 81 and acid 1 m hcl or base 1 m naoh addition with a microburete an o2 sensor wtw cellox 325 and an n2o sensor unisense were used to monitor dissolved oxygen and dissolved nitrous oxide online compressed air or nitrogen when needed were sparged using a stone diffuser at a flow rate controlled with a mass flow controller bronckhorst f201 c after stabilization of all online signals do ph once ph control was started the oxygen gas transfer coefficient kla was estimated for each batch tests by stopping the air flow or sparging with nitrogen followed by air sparging again see si afterwards the batch tests b were started by a pulse addition of ammonium to the targeted initial concentrations table 1 once the batch was finalized the fed batch test was started by combining a pulse of ammonium and fed batch fb addition of hydroxylamine at the desired load with a programable microburete a cometabolization com in table 1 test of hydroxylamine and ammonium was performed by pulse addition of both substrates to assess putative hydroxylamine inhibition liquid samples 3 4 ml were withdrawn over time filtered and stored in the fridge for further analysis of nitrogen compounds for hydroxylamine determination 1 8 ml of sample were mixed with 0 2 ml of sulfamic acid at 5 g ml biomass concentration during the test was analyzed at the end see physiochemical analysis section for further details rate calculations n2o emissions factor and other calculations related to the batch tests are described in the si 2 3 long term hydroxylamine continuous feeding hydroxylamine long term dosing was performed in r2 from days 254 to 372 by supplying the usual synthetic medium see si and adding an extra dosing pump for hydroxylamine addition hydroxylamine addition was performed separately from the original medium to avoid any type of reaction prior to reaching the reactor hydroxylamine addition flow rate was maintained constant at 1 17 0 04 l d while hydroxylamine influent concentration was increased in each phase in order to increase the hydroxylamine loading rate hydroxylamine solution concentrations used were 57 12 84 6 135 7 and 132 8 mg n l for phase i ii iii and deterioration respectively samples were

assess the impact of hydroxylamine in partial nitritation aerobic granular sludge 3 1 1 dissolved oxygen regulates ammonium and hydroxylamine consumption as well as n2o production granular sludge from two different reactors was used for batch b tests with an ammonium pulse followed with fed batch fb tests with the same ammonium pulse but with hydroxylamine continuous feeding see fig 1 comparing the ammonium consumption rate results of tests with only ammonium and the tests where hydroxylamine was also continuously fed the impact of a low limiting hydroxylamine concentration in the medium on the ammonium uptake rate qnh4 in table 1 could be assessed depending on the dissolved oxygen concentration during the test two different trends where observed i at low do to middle do range 0 8 to 3 6 mg o2 l being tests 1 2 3 4 8 and 9 in table 1 hydroxylamine dosing resulted in a slight increase 1 5 in the ammonium uptake rate tests 3 7 and 9 in table 1 or a 1 31 decrease in the ammonium uptake rate tests 1 2 4 and 8 in table 1 ii at a high do concentration 3 6 to 5 8 mg o2 l test 5 and 6 in table 1 the ammonium uptake rate increased when hydroxylamine was also dosed to the system 13 and 19 increase respectively notice that an increased ammonium consumption at high do was observed with tests performed with biomass from two different reactors r1 and r2 total nitrogen oxidation activity i e including n ammonium and n hydroxylamine was generally increased see fig 1 overall with granular sludge from both r1 and r2 do concentration was the variable impacting the most the metabolism of ammonium and hydroxylamine consumption the effect of do concentration can be observed specially with tests 6 9 fig 1b and table 1 dissolved oxygen do strongly affected ammonium consumption rates as it ranged from ca 30 to 93 mg n gvss h depending on the do instead hydroxylamine consumption rate was slightly influenced being rather constant around 10 13 mg n gvss h table 1 and fig 1b interestingly do not only impacted consumption rates but also hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o emissions fig 2 only when hydroxylamine was dosed continuously during the fed bath tests lower do led to higher hydroxylamine accumulation as hydroxylamine accumulation went from 0 35 mg n l to 1 4 mg n l when oxygen went down from 4 5 to 0 8 mg o2 l fig 2a furthermore lower do also resulted in higher n2o emissions factor the n2o emission factor went from 1 3 to 3 at do 1 8 5 mg o2 l up to ca 21 at do of 0 8 mg o2 l fig 2b when hydroxylamine was continuously added in the tests consequently lower do resulted in higher hydroxylamine accumulation and higher n2o emissions as just mentioned in some fed batch tests hydroxylamine was accumulating up to relatively high concentrations 1 mg n l see table 1 to specifically investigate the effect of elevated hydroxylamine concentrations the co metabolization of hydroxylamine and ammonium was evaluated in tests were a pulse of both hydroxylamine and ammonium where added after a nitrification batch test without hydroxylamine addition the initial hydroxylamine concentration was 7 mg n l for test 9 see table 1 thus hydroxylamine concentrations were higher during the co metabolization experiments than those observed in the tests with continuous hydroxylamine addition the ammonium oxidation rate was 61 mg n gvss h during the batch with only ammonium and 56 mg n gvss h when hydroxylamine and ammonium were both present summarizing at low do hydroxylamine addition resulted in decreased or slightly increased ammonium consumption rate hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o production whereas at high do hydroxylamine addition increased ammonium consumption with less hydroxylamine accumulating and less n2o produced figs 1 and 2 3 2 long term impact of hydroxylamine feeding to a continuous flow partial nitritation reactor 3 2 1 hydroxylamine is transformed to nitrite and reduces ammonium consumption a stable operating continuous flow granular sludge nitritation reactor was subjected to adding hydroxylamine at various loading rates the impact on the nitrogen conversion processes and the microbial population dynamics were assessed the hydroxylamine load to the granular sludge airlift reactor was gradually increased during 3 operational phases phase i ii and iii in figs s6 and s8 the air flow was maintained stable during the whole operation the do gradually increased from 3 6 0 2 mg o2 l without hydroxylamine addition to 4 3 0 4 4 4 0 9 and 5 2 0 5 mg o2 l in phase i ii and iii respectively see figs s6b and s8b the ph did not vary significantly during the operation figs s6b and s8c granule size and particle size distribution was stable over time fig s7 as well as biomass concentration during phase i ii and iii figs s6c and s8a interestingly ammonium consumption rate decreased with increasing hydroxylamine loading rate see fig 3 a nitrite production remained the same with or without hydroxylamine the decreased ammonium conversion and constant nitrite production indicates that the hydroxylamine conversion to nitrite compensated the decreased ammonium conversion the stoichiometric ratio calculated from the produced nitrite over total nitrogen consumed including nh2oh and ammonium consumption was close to the theoretical value of 1 fig 3d a maximum of ca 2 7 nitrogen was unaccounted in the nitrogen balance during the whole reactor operation which can be due to accumulated measurement error combined with n2o production for instance occasional n2o was detected in the liquid phase specially at the beginning of hydroxylamine feeding during phase i but decreased after few hours see fig s9a occasionally n2o peaks were detected in the liquid 1 mg n l but not in a consistent and continuous way see fig s9b more n2o measurements could not be performed during the rest of the phases due to technical problems with the sensor 3 2 2 microbial community dynamics the microbial population dynamics during the airlift reactor operation without and with hydroxylamine feeding was investigated using fish and 16s rrna sequencing fish performed in pottered biomass indicated that the majority of the population was formed by aob over time a slight increase in nob population and a decrease of the eub signal was observed in the slides for pottered sludge samples fig s10 when observing cryosectioned granules a very low number of nob could be observed fig s11 the relative abundance of aob nitrosomonas sp in the 16s rrna analysis was stable at 42 6 of the otu s over the full operational period fig 4 which corresponded with the generally distributed hybridization of nso190 probe in the fish three different otus were identified as nitrosomonas one of them nitrosomonas sp 2 in fig 4 significantly increased from the beginning of the hydroxylamine feeding from 5 2 to 13 3 in days 102 283 and days 296 332 respectively the nitrosomonas out s could not be conclusively allocated to a cluster see table s3 for the raw sequences interestingly no nob otu s were detected with 16s rna analysis in accordance with fish performed on cryosectioned granules and with the low nitrate production observed during cultivation still contradicting partially the fish results for pottered biomass samples where nob signal although at a low intensity was detected in some of the samples the side population as observed by 16s rrna sequencing showed a considerable change when hydroxylamine was fed for instance acidovorax went from ca 6 1 in the control phase up to ca 25 3 in phase i and ii however in phase iii it decreased again up to 14 2 and the side population switched to unclassified microorganisms from the family xanthomonadaceae thermomonas and brevundimonas 3 2 3 experimental assessment of apparent hydroxylamine consumption kinetics in the present work during the continuous feeding of hydroxylamine and ammonium to the continuous flow granular sludge airlift reactor residual hydroxylamine was measured daily for each hydroxylamine loading rate taking into account that total hydroxylamine consumption by the reactor is derived from the inflow hydroxylamine as well as from the ammonium oxidation as hydroxylamine is an intermediate step the apparent half saturation coefficient and apparent maximum consumption rate for the granular sludge system was estimated using curve fitting of the data to a typical monod consumption kinetic model fig 5 maximum hydroxylamine consumption was estimated to be 359 16 mg n l d 46 22 mg n gvss h and hydroxylamine half saturation coefficient was estimated as 0 015 0 006 mg n l 4 discussion 4 1 dissolved oxygen governs hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o production the do concentration was identified as the main factor governing hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o production in a nitrification process fig 2 additionally the ammonium consumption rate was impacted by hydroxylamine dosage depending on the do concentration figs 1 and 2 in order to be able to explain the observed impact of hydroxylamine addition on ammonium oxidation the kinetics and factors governing ammonium oxidation are crucial see fig 6 three main reactions are responsible for the observed ammonia oxidation rates i ammonium transformation to hydroxylamine mediated by amo ii hydroxylamine oxidation to nitrite mediated by hao and iii the electron transport chain e t c these reactions are all linked by the reduced mred or oxidized forms of the electron carriers mox see fig 6 when both ammonium and oxygen concentrations are high their corresponding monod terms will tend towards one see rnh3 and ro2 in fig 6 resulting in the simplified eqs 16 and 17 the availability of mred will depend on the hydroxylamine consumption rate rnh2oh consequently rnh2oh will determine the process velocity in such conditions hydroxylamine is not likely to accumulate as sufficiently mox should be available and hydroxylamine consumption will determine both rnh3 and ro2 by providing them with mred consequently rmax of each reaction and the affinities for mred will govern the rnh3 and ro2 kinetic rates see eqs 7 and 8 7 r n h 3 r m a x n h 3 c m r e d c m r e d k m r e d n h 3 8 r o 2 r max o 2 c mred c mred k mred etc on the contrary if ammonium concentration is high and dissolved oxygen concentration is low the conversion of hydroxylamine rnh2oh will be limited by the turnover of mox once mred is used during ammonium consumption or the oxygen electron consumption in the terminal electron acceptor chain in such conditions the ammonium monod term or rnh3 will not play an important role as it will approach 1 see rnh3 in fig 6 as oxygen concentrations are low oxygen affinities and maximum rates will now play an important role and small differences in these values will determine if rnh3 or ro2 is the rate limiting process see eqs 9 and 10 thus hydroxylamine and putatively other intermediates will tend to accumulate if the mox needed for the reaction is not regenerated fast enough as a strategy to avoid nh2oh and other intermediates accumulation mred can be used to convert nitrite or no generated from hydroxylamine to n2o and generating mox as it does not depend on oxygen availability 9 r n h 3 r max n h 3 c o 2 c o 2 k o 2 n h 3 c mred c mred k mred n h 3 10 r o 2 r max o 2 c o 2 c o 2 k o 2 c mred c mred k mred etc overall ammonium oxidation is highly regulated by the availability and turnover of mred and mox the affinities for substrates and the difference of maximum rates between the amo hao and the e t c corresponding reactions might impact the process regulation see eqs 15 to 9 depending on the ammonium and oxygen consumption parameters hydroxylamine accumulation will be most likely at high ammonium concentrations and limiting oxygen concentrations the kinetic explanation is in agreement with the experimental observations reported here for instance in the fed batch tests where hydroxylamine was continuously dosed and performed at lower do and high initial ammonium concentrations batches 8 and 9 in table 1 and fig 2a hydroxylamine accumulated the most more n2o was produced at lower do concentrations fig 2b as a strategy to use the available mred to generate mox without consuming oxygen when do was higher less hydroxylamine accumulated and less n2o was produced fig 2 overall the impact of do on hydroxylamine accumulation shows that somehow the limiting step for the process is the mox production either resulting from ammonium consumption or oxygen consumption in e t c the kinetic analysis proposed here also easily fits with observed transient accumulation events of hydroxylamine reported in literature without external addition of hydroxylamine for instance hydroxylamine has been transiently detected when switching from anoxic to aerobic conditions in planktonic chemostat cultures of nitrosomonas eruopaea yu et al 2010 2017 2018 at such conditions the oxidized form of the electron carriers will be limiting at the beginning of the aeration phase limiting the availability of mox for hydroxylamine consumption it makes it likely that hydroxylamine transiently accumulates until sufficient mox is generated indeed n2o peaks were detected just after the switch from anoxic to aerobic conditions in nitrification cultures yu et al 2010 2017 2018 consequently n2o was generated at the beginning of the transition to aerobic conditions to use the available mred and convert it to mox to generate sufficient mox for hydroxylamine conversion similarly in sbr processes with mixed cultures transient hydroxylamine production right after the start of the feeding phase has been detected su et al 2019b a step increase in ammonium loading rate also showed to generate transient accumulation events in continuous systems hu et al 2017 poot et al 2016 when a step increase in ammonium load occurs the system will tend to be more kinetically oxygen limited finally when performing batch tests with only ammonium hydroxylamine has also been shown to accumulate liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 the initial high concentration of ammonium allowing a fast conversion can easily lead to oxygen uptake limitations and higher levels of mred and accumulation of some hydroxylamine liu et al 2017 measured higher hydroxylamine concentration peaks with higher initial ammonium concentrations the higher the ammonium concentration the more likely it will be kinetically limited by oxygen liu et al 2017 also observed different hydroxylamine accumulation pattern in different aob aoa and comammox strains this would fit with the high dependency of hydroxylamine accumulation on the affinities and maximum rates of amo and e t c conversions thus depending on the affinities or maximum velocities of the different aob aoa comammox strains they will be able to maintain a sufficiently high mox supply or reducing ammonium consumption to avoid hydroxylamine accumulation in the present study during the batches b with only ammonium as substrate no hydroxylamine accumulation was observed independent of the do concentration imposed however increased hydroxylamine accumulation was observed with decreasing oxygen concentration during fed batch tests fig 2 thus it could be expected that in inner zones of the biofilm hydroxylamine could accumulate as do is lower however once hydroxylamine diffuses to outer layers of the biofilm with higher do concentrations it might be consumed there and not seen in the bulk liquid consequently the granular structure of our sludge might have masked putative transient accumulation of hydroxylamine during batches with only ammonium thus hydroxylamine could be transformed before reaching the bulk liquid as also discussed in poot et al 2016 overall it should be highlighted that when having conditions with low oxygen and high ammonium concentrations the ammonium oxidation or the consumption of oxygen in electron transport chain could be limiting the hydroxylamine conversion step thus favoring hydroxylamine accumulation if the oxidized electron mediators are not provided fast enough 4 2 ammonium consumption is regulated based on hydroxylamine and electron donor availability the do concentration not only triggered hydroxylamine accumulation but also had a direct impact on the ammonium consumption rate in the batch tests with continuous hydroxylamine feeding ammonium consumption was increased when hydroxylamine was present at high do batches 5 and 6 in fig 1 and table 1 however if do was low ammonium consumption was maintained or slightly reduced when hydroxylamine was fed fig 1 table 1 this can be explained because at high do hydroxylamine conversion will be less limited by mox fig 6 when hydroxylamine is added extra the available mred will increase which can boost the ammonium consumption see fig 7 a in previous studies the impact of hydroxylamine was only investigated during the so called acceleration phase but never during continuous exposure the acceleration phase is related to the delay observed on reaching the maximum ammonium consumption capacity when adding an ammonium pulse to a nitrification system chandran and smets 2008 guisasola et al 2006 the hypothesis was that the level of reduced electron mediator was initially limiting the ammonium oxidation guisasola et al 2006 adding hydroxylamine in form of a pulse to an aerated system before the addition of ammonium reduced dramatically the acceleration phase chandran and smets 2008 it was hypothesized that hydroxylamine would increase the level of reduced electron mediator allowing ammonium to proceed at maximal rate from the start of ammonium addition chandran and smets 2008 however our study did not focus on the initial ammonium consumption rate as in chandran and smets 2008 guisasola et al 2006 but rather on the ammonium consumption rate once stable do was reached thus indicating that extra hydroxylamine can increase ammonium consumption when sufficient oxygen is available when do was low and hydroxylamine was provided ammonium consumption was either maintained slightly increased or reduced and hydroxylamine accumulated resulting in high n2o formation in the fed batch tests figs 1 and 2 when hydroxylamine was fed continuously to the airlift reactor at different loading rates ammonium oxidation was also reduced and do increased gradually indicating a decrease on the oxygen uptake rate figs 3a and si during the long term feeding of hydroxylamine the do might have been rate limiting especially in the inner parts of the granules the conditions observed during the continuous feeding might have been comparable to the middle do conditions of the fed batch test experiments low amounts of hydroxylamine accumulated and a low n2o production was observed while ammonium consumption decreased with increasing hydroxylamine loading rates fig 3a the range of do triggering higher ammonium consumption rates might be impacted by other conditions continuous long term operation was performed at lower ph and temperature ca 7 6 and 22 c than the batch tests ph 8 and 30 c at lower temperature and lower ph the ammonium consumption rate is decreased jubany et al 2008 consequently maximum ammonium consumption rate will be lower and extra hydroxylamine dosing might have a different impact as limiting do ranges will differ the reduction of ammonium consumption when hydroxylamine was provided and do was kinetically limiting might be explained as follows from a kinetic point of view other process competing for similar substrates oxygen and mred are relatively faster than ammonium consumption resulting in the reduced ammonium oxidation rate alternatively when supplying extra hydroxylamine more mred is generated with higher do thus the affinity for mred is less critical if do is not sufficiently high the extra generated mred is not redistributed to increase ammonium consumption oxygen will then limit the turnover of mred to mox not providing the mox needed for hydroxylamine conversion having a slightly faster oxygen consumption in the e t c than for ammonium consumption when oxygen is limiting makes sense as a strategy to avoid as much as possible intermediates accumulation nh2oh or no under oxygen limiting conditions this is what was actually observed in the continuous airlift reactor where ammonium consumption was reduced and dissolved oxygen in the system increased with increasing hydroxylamine loading rates see figs 3a and si it should be highlighted that even ammonium consumption was reduced total nitrite production was not fig 3 indicating that hydroxylamine was mainly being transformed to nitrite fig 3 with the observed increased bulk do concentration over time it would have been expected for aob to use such extra do to consume more ammonium however ammonium consumption rate was reduced suggesting that the e t c rate was the main rate governing factor in the process as if more electrons were derived from nh2oh there was less demand to derive electrons from full ammonium oxidation to nitrite consequently the use of electrons from hydroxylamine conversion reduced both the ammonium and oxygen consumption overall small differences between the parameters will efficiently regulate the whole process as oxygen consumption during ammonium consumption needs to be generally faster than the e t c otherwise ammonium consumption would not take place understanding the coupling between each process would allow to further understand the central nitrogen metabolism regulation n2o formation was detected both in the batch tests and during the continuous airlift reactor feeding figs 2 and s9 specifically higher n2o emissions were detected during the batch tests with hydroxylamine feeding at low do concentration fig 2 at the conditions at which the tests were performed ph 8 and 25 c and low nitritre concentrations the abiotic reaction of hydroxylamine and free nitrous acid is not likely soler jofra et al 2016 su et al 2019a the traditional biochemical pathway resulting in n2o emissions when oxygen concentration is low is called nitrifier denitrification stein 2011 nitrite is reduced to n2o to compensate limiting amounts of oxygen as terminal electron acceptor however in our experiments hydroxylamine accumulation might be more direct related to n2o formation recently a biochemical route from hydroxylamine to n2o was proposed to be mediated by cytp460 caranto et al 2016 in the absence of oxygen at the low do in granular sludge systems the deeper layers in the granules will be deprived of oxygen to further confirm if either nitrite or hydroxylamine was being consumed to form n2o 15n or and site preference studies will be necessary furthermore an initial high n2o production was observed at the beginning of the hydroxylamine long term dosing in the airlift reactor fig s9 this initial high n2o production might have been a transient metabolic solution in order to provide sufficient mred to consume the extra hydroxylamine dosed and avoid its accumulation most likely do was initially insufficiently high to cope with the extra dosing of hydroxylamine using n2o production as a solution targeted experiments to understand no n2o production with rate limiting hydroxylamine feeding and how the metabolism rearranges from a transcriptomic proteomic point of view would be crucial to understand such complex behaviors overall when oxygen is high the hydroxylamine oxidation step is in charge on regulating the whole aob metabolism at these conditions if external hydroxylamine is available ammonium consumption is boosted by the extra formation of mred it is interesting to realize that the maximal ammonium oxidation rate can be increased in the presence of externally added hydroxylamine when oxygen is limiting the preferential use of oxygen as terminal electron acceptor will reduce the ammonium oxidation rate preventing accumulation of nitrification intermediates indirectly hydroxylamine oxidation will be also regulated by the oxygen use in the e t c if not sufficient mox is provided hydroxylamine will accumulate consequently the differences between the ammonium oxidation rate and the turnover of terminal acceptor will determine the putative accumulation of hydroxylamine 4 3 more hydroxylamine rate limiting continuous feeding studies are needed to understand the long term impact of hydroxylamine on ammonium oxidation in the continuous airlift reactor hydroxylamine was efficiently transformed to nitrite combined with a reduced ammonium oxidation however after ca 3 months of operation with hydroxylamine feeding the reactor operation deteriorated quite quickly see fig s6 other indications of deterioration are the decreased eub signal observed with fish over time and the appearance of a mainly oligotrophic side population figs 4 s10 and s11 different possibilities might explain this deterioration at the working conditions ph 7 7 hydroxylamine is mainly unprotonated see fig s11b thus it can diffuse over the cell membrane this gives an uncoupling effect and results in extra energy demand reducing the growth of bacteria another possibility was that the cell could not cope with the reduced ammonium consumption increased e t c velocity and growth at the same time previous studies with hydroxylamine were mainly performed by pulse like addition strategies harper et al 2009 okabe et al 2011 wan et al 2016 wang et al 2015 with these type of feedings a negative impact of hydroxylamine was reported by harper and co workers on the long run harper et al 2009 while other studies used hydroxylamine as a strategy to promote partial nitrification over full nitrification wan et al 2016 wang et al 2015 the only comparable study in terms of feeding strategies was performed by de bruijn et al 1995 a higher growth yield was reported when feeding mixotrophically ammonium and hydroxylamine than when feeding only with ammonium ammonium oxidation was not deteriorated in de brujin study indicating that nitrosomonas europaea could grow mixotrophically with hydroxylamine this would fit with the fact that nitrosomonas was the predominant aob in the present study fig 4 and that the biomass concentration was maintained during the different hydroxylamine feeding figs s8a and 6c de bruijn et al 1995 also observed a bigger nitrogen imbalance than observed in the present study their experiments were performed with planktonic cells and conditions i e 30 do saturation ph 8 and 30 c that are deviating from those in the present study i e granular sludge 22 3 1 2 c ph 7 4 0 1 do from 3 6 0 2 to 5 2 0 5 mg o2 l see figure s8 one putative explanation for the higher nitrogen imbalance observed by de bruijn is that at higher ph and temperature ammonium consumption is promoted see fig s12 thus if on top of that an intermediate like hydroxylamine is fed it is more likely that hydroxylamine accumulates promoting a bigger nitrogen imbalance and the formation of n2o emissions as seen in the experiments of de bruijn et al 1995 it would be interesting to have a better characterization of no n2o emissions as due to technical problems n2o was not followed during the whole operation with hydroxylamine overall to assess the possible long term impact of hydroxylamine feeding transcriptomics and proteomics will be crucial to give more insight on the impact of hydroxylamine in nitrification more studies will be needed with limiting hydroxylamine feeding to reach definitive conclusions 4 4 importance of the hydroxylamine oxidation step in modeling n2o emissions the hydroxylamine accumulation and the no or n2o production as a function of the oxygen concentration will be very sensitive to the kinetic parameters half saturation coefficient and maximum rate governing each process step in a mathematical model the importance of parameter estimations in model applications is crucial for a good model use and process understanding petersen et al 2003 sin et al 2005 the widely used activated sludge models asm did not include intermediate processes such as nitrite or hydroxylamine henze et al 2000 this was justified by the main model purpose estimating the effluent concentrations the concentrations of intermediates of ammonium conversion to nitrate have a marginal impact on the nitrogen mass balance of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in recent years the asm have been extended for nitrite because of the interest in partial nitrification anammox process hao and van loosdrecht 2004 with the growing interest in greenhouse gas emissions also other intermediates in nitrogen conversion processes no and n2o became state variables in activated sludge models ni and yuan 2015 parameters related to the hydroxylamine oxidation step in nitrification rnh2oh in fig 6 such as hydroxylamine half saturation coefficient knh2oh or maximum hydroxylamine oxidation rate μnh2oh knh2oh or rmax nh3 in d 1 or mg n gvss h depending on the nomenclature and notation used are usually not evaluated from dedicated experiments even more importantly the oxygen affinity of the e t c during hydroxylamine oxidation as single substrate has rarely been determined hydroxylamine conversion related parameters have usually been obtained from multivariable optimization of a large set of parameters through ammonium nitrite do and or n2o data fitting law et al 2012 ni et al 2011 recently domingo felez et al 2017 presented a calibration methodology to obtain such parameters which takes into account hydroxylamine measurement data and dedicated respirometry experiments there are hardly or no good hydroxylamine conversion data with mixed cultures and only few experimental data with hydroxylamine conversion by pure cultures de bruijn et al 1995 frijlink et al 1992 stein et al 1997 furthermore in view of the do impact on ammonium and hydroxylamine oxidation rates as well as on the n2o formation see figs 1 and 2 kinetic parameter determinations will be really sensible to oxygen concentrations for instance to be able to determine maximum ammonium consumption rates one should be aware to avoid or reduce as much as possible oxygen limitations with the hydroxylamine continuous addition experiments performed in the present study an apparent maximum hydroxylamine conversion coefficient and apparent affinity constant were estimated fig 5 it should be noted that the parameters presented here are all apparent and performed with granular sludge thus they might differ depending on the biofilm type structure and microbial composition apparent kinetic parameters are commonly used in asm modeling still obtaining intrinsic parameters would be desirable however to obtain intrinsic parameters from floc or biofilm systems is not trivial as several parameters impact the determination from calculations van den berg et al 2020 for example substrate diffusivities granule size granule porosity and density etc even if all the parameters could be determined accurately microcolony size and distribution within the granule structure will impact the parameter estimation see picioreanu et al 2016 consequently planktonic pure cultures will be needed for obtaining intrinsic kinetic parameters the experimental set up used here and in de bruijn et al 1995 continuous rate limiting feeding of hydroxylamine could be used for hydroxylamine kinetic parameters determination in planktonic cultures also the inclusion of no measurements would allow for a better understanding of the role of this other intermediate in nitrification hao and van loosdrecht 2004 kampschreur et al 2008a 2008b no measurements during hydroxylamine feeding might also be of interest to see if this compound transiently accumulates or is emitted when hydroxylamine is added overall if hydroxylamine is introduced as a state variable in a model its kinetic apparent parameters are to be calibrated accordingly which is not commonly performed 4 5 implication of the findings and future challenges in the present study the effect of do on hydroxylamine by an aob enriched granular sludge biomass was studied one important aspect that was not investigated is the ph effect the dissociation of nitrogen compounds has in general a strong impact on nitrification processes anthonisen 1976 hydroxylamine is a weak base pka value 5 94 at 25 c haynes 2014 and will therefore change from nh3oh to nh2oh in the physiological ph range see fig s11b in the simplified model proposed fig 6 ph can have several effects on the different reactions involved in ammonium oxidation i the equilibrium between protonated and unprotonated form of ammonium and hydroxylamine might impact its diffusion through the membrane ii frijlink et al 1992 showed that ammonium oxidation was highly impacted by ph whereas hydroxylamine oxidation was not reducing ammonium oxidation with lower ph iii the difference in proton concentration between the periplasm and cytoplasm will impact the e t c and potentially also the energy generation step moreover the intrinsic impact of ph on substrates and each conversion step rates ph gradients usually exist in biofilm systems and granule systems thus different consumption rates might be expected depending on the location in the biofilm this overall complexity of influence of ph on hydroxylamine conversion warrants a more detailed investigation in the future the impact of intermediates no and hydroxylamine on nitrous oxide production during nitrification can only be understood when the detailed biochemistry of these conversion has been revealed soler jofra et al 2020 stein 2011 proteomics and transcriptomics techniques have emerged and strongly developed in recent years transcriptomics and proteomic studies in similar systems as the one studied here might help to reveal the enzymes involved in n2o productions or the putative enzyme involved in no conversion to nitrite if there is one as if forcing hydroxylamine conversion one would expect that the enzymes related to its transformation to be upregulated as also discussed in the present study the combination of rate limiting hydroxylamine feeding with 15n and site preference techniques could help also to elucidate and further understand the fate of hydroxylamine in such systems depending on the conditions for example helping to reveal if it is nitrite or hydroxylamine the one being transformed to n2o at low dissolved oxygen concentrations finally it should be highlighted that most of the wastewater treatment facilities operate at low do concentrations to minimise aeration energy and costs furthermore fluctuations in ammonium concentrations are usually occurring chen et al 2020 these form the perfect conditions for hydroxylamine accumulation according to what has been discussed in the present work and the transient hydroxylamine accumulations events observed in literature liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 su et al 2019b the transient accumulation that is seen in the bulk liquid is the result of consumption and production processes inside flocs and biofilms conditions also vary and do is low thus accumulation of hydroxylamine in the inner parts of the biofilms is likely even due to the reactivity of hydroxylamine it cannot be measured in the bulk liquid consequently the understanding of how small quantities of hydroxylamine might impact common side communities of aob such as nob anammox dnra denitrifiers or neighboring cells of aob is important more interestingly the contribution of hydroxylamine to produce n2o anoxically has still to be further investigated highlighting the importance of understanding intermediate steps to be able to understand the process as a whole 5 conclusions the main objective of the present study was to further understand how rate limiting hydroxylamine feeding similar to a putative exposure in natural environments could impact aerobic ammonium oxidizing metabolism by means of different experiments involving hydroxylamine continuous rate limiting feeding with aerobic granular sludge performing partial nitritation the following conclusions were reached hydroxylamine short term continuous rate limiting feeding triggered n2o emissions in comparison with the batch tests with only ammonium as substrate where no n2o was detected do combined with high ammonium concentrations kinetically governed hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o emissions an increasing trend was observed for both hydroxylamine accumulation and n2o emissions with lower do do also determines the impact of hydroxylamine in ammonium consumption when do is sufficiently high ammonium consumption can be increased as more reducing equivalents are generated from supplemented hydroxylamine oxidation on the contrary when do is low ammonium consumption will be reduced long term hydroxylamine feeding reduced ammonium consumption while nitrite production was maintained dissolved oxygen increased with increasing loading rate and those extra electrons generated from hydroxylamine were allocated in the electron transport chain instead of ammonium oxidation nitrosomonas remained rather dominant during long term airlift

16441,particulate organic carbon poc is an important component of lake organic carbon c pools of which different factors drive vertical distributions and sources this study used the dual stable isotope δ13c and δ15n approach to investigate vertical poc sources and drivers in a large floodplain lake system findings showed that poc composition gradually changed from endogenous dominant to exogenous dominant sequentially from the surface layer to the bottom layer of lake poyang environmental factors associated with phytoplankton photosynthesis as well as nutrient levels primarily drove surface poc moreover soil erosion sediment deposition and resuspension strongly affected poc distribution and composition in the middle and bottom layers of the lake poc sources were also affected by factors associated with vertical mixing such as wind speed and water depth litter from c3 plants significantly contributed to poc concentrations in the middle and bottom layers of the lake results from this study can benefit our overall understanding of the potential driving mechanisms of lake c cycling processes aquatic ecosystem functions and pollutant migration keywords particulate organic carbon source vertical stratification stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes lake poyang 1 introduction lake carbon c cycling is a main focal point of current lake research being a key component of the global c cycle and associated c sources and sinks le quéré et al 2015 westberry and meredith 2016 particulate organic carbon poc is a key component of lake organic c pools and has a significant regulatory effect on organic and inorganic c pool via deposition degradation and mineralization behrenfeld et al 2013 siegel et al 2014 moreover poc also plays a significant role in c and energy flow within lake systems and to a large extent governs the transport of macronutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p as well as metal and organic contaminants foster et al 2000 adams et al 2015 according to its geochemical characteristics poc can be separated into endogenous and exogenous organic c which are associated with terrestrial inputs from soil erosion endogenous phytoplanktonic primary production and macrophyte debris in lake systems zigah et al 2011 adams et al 2015 both young terrestrial poc and endogenous poc can easily mineralize to carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 through heterotrophic mechanisms galy et al 2015 conversely exogenously aged poc is preferentially trapped in lake sediment subsequently contributing to long term c cycling battin et al 2008 guillemette et al 2017 supplemental labile organic matter can effectively decompose aged poc which is known as the priming effect guenet et al 2010 bianchi 2011 previous studies have suggested that the priming effect significantly increases the extent of organic c mineralization in soil and water by 400 1100 and 10 500 respectively guenet et al 2010 bianchi 2011 processes associated with anabatic soil erosion can transport large quantities of poc and nutrients to lake systems galy et al 2015 leading to enhanced eutrophication and algal blooms paerl 2017 an increase in the volume of endogenous poc via eutrophication and algal bloom outbreaks will alter the poc composition of lake systems previously dominated by terrestrial poc which will effectively modify both the role and effect of transitional lake processes on the global c cycle accordingly such compositional poc alterations will lead to a significant change in greenhouse gas emissions and c sequestration processes in lake systems given their influence on the global c cycle poc flux concentrations and pools in river lake and oceanic systems have been widely studied mcclelland et al 2016 huang et al 2017 however our limited knowledge on poc composition and associative driving mechanisms have restrained the utilization of poc flux concentration and pool data on the global c cycle as well as regulatory compositional effects related to poc sequestration and mineralization gudasz et al 2012 watanabe and kuwae 2015 mixing or stratification processes in lake water has significant environmental and ecological significance particularly in analyzing the consumption of dissolved oxygen do nutrients and algae distribution in the bottom layer of lake systems bouchez et al 2014 chen et al 2018 the mixing or stratification of lake water may be a continuous decadal process or a short term process that only takes a few hours which mainly depends on the mixing energy caused by lotic lake inflow and outflow and the energy transfer at the water air interface caused by meteorological factors such as wind and sunlight zigah et al 2011 poc as an important part of the biological pump would be transformed through food web physical mixing and deposition which transfers poc from the upper water to the lower water gao et al 2021 the strong bottom currents re suspended poc from the surface sediments and the density driven vertical mixing of the water column and turbulent flow could further carry it to the upper water along with numerous nutrients pollutants and heavy metals may have been released concurrently adams et al 2015 therefore under complex processes inherent to a hydrodynamic lake water environment it is of great practical significance to explore the distribution of c and other environmental factors in vertical water which can improve both the evaluation and sustainable management of the lake water environment into the future however to date poc sources and cycling processes have yet to be adequately delineated chen et al 2018 considering the complex changes associated with lake hydrodynamics and environmental conditions it is critical to clarify stratified vertical sources and circulation patterns of lake poc to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of lake c cycling processes and greenhouse gas emissions zigah et al 2011 chen et al 2018 the isotopic signature δ13c which measures stable isotope ratios can be used as a tracer to quantify c sources and explore the transformation of various c forms marwick et al 2015 xie et al 2020 however δ13c signatures of c deriving from different sources can overlap considerably leading to significant uncertainty in distinguishing between c sources raymond and bauer 2001 however this problem can be resolved by applying δ13c and δ15n in combination both δ13c and δ15n provide linear quantities that can be directly applied to isotopic mixing models which quantitatively favor discriminating between organic c sources these two signatures are often used to trace the fate and origin of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems dang et al 2018 amir et al 2019 in this study we adopted these dual stable isotopic signatures δ13c and δ15n for end member mixing analysis emma to 1 investigate vertically stratified distribution poc characteristics and associated stable isotopes in lake poyang 2 to quantitatively estimate vertically stratified poc sources in lake poyang and 3 to explore drivers of poc sources and features in lake poyang an in depth investigation on vertically stratified poc sources and drivers in a large floodplain lake system is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of cn p coupling cycles aquatic ecosystem functions and pollutant migration and transformation processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites lake poyang 115 49 e 116 46 e 28 24 n 29 46 n the largest freshwater lake in china is situated at the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river ye et al 2019 in recent years many scholars have built two dimensional hydrodynamic numerical models to investigate c cycle and budget characteristics of lake systems although these models have been widely used and developed they have rarely considered the vertical stratification of water bodies hence there is a critical lack of water quality models to further evaluate the process and role of c cycling in lake systems although it is generally accepted by most scholars that lake poyang is a shallow water lake system and consequently characteristics and changes to its vertical structure can be ignored there is not enough data to support this claim li et al 2015 the available data that does exist has shown that lake poyang undergoes considerable water level fluctuations i e 7 9 19 4 m liu et al 2015b moreover annual mean precipitation is approximately 1622 mm throughout the entire region under this typical warm and humid subtropical climate jin et al 2012 the rainy season is mostly concentrated from april to june accounting for between 42 and 53 of the total annual rainfall wu et al 2014 lake poyang is also influenced by anthropogenic activities such as land reclamation fisheries dam construction sand excavation operations and transportation and it is consequently subject to serious environmental stress such as eutrophication wang et al 2021a a total of 24 sampling sites were established in lake poyang for this study based on different geomorphic units environmental conditions spatial distributions and sampling processes fig 1 sampling sites 1 8 those situated in the western and eastern regions of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established in sub lake areas sampling sites 9 14 those situated in the southern and central regions of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established within the main lake area sampling sites 15 24 those situated in the northern region of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established within the water channel 2 2 sampling and analysis in april 2021 a water sampler was used to collect water samples 0 5 m below the water surface at half lake depth and 0 5 m above the bottom sediment layer at all sampling sites if the collected bottom water sample 0 5 m above the bottom sediment disturbed the sediment we re sampled the water sampleat this sample point 2 2 1 environmental variables we used the ultrameter 6p instrument myron the united states of america to measure conductivity cond and ph in situ an expendable bathythermograph xbt dt100pro was used to measure water temperature wt and water depth wd in situ the portable fluorescence dissolved oxygen meter yellow springs instruments the united states of america was used to measure do in situ a secchi disk was used to measure secchi depth sd in situ an anemometer was used to measure wind speed ws in situ 2 2 2 chemical parameters c n p si and chl a in water water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane filters which were first treated in a water bath 80 c for 8 h prior to filtering the vario toc analyzer elementar germany was used to measure dissolved total carbon dtc dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations while a segmented continuous flow analyzer futura france was used to analyze dissolved total nitrogen dtn nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n concentrations an automated discrete analyzer smartchem 200 italy was used to measure dissolved total phosphorus dtp phosphate po4 p and dissolved silicon dsi concentrations total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were tested using a digestion method jia et al 2017 that employed a segmented continuous flow analyzer futura france the chl a concentrations were measured using a hydrolab ds5 multi parameter water quality sonde ott hydromet the united states of america in situ 2 2 3 tsm poc and associated c and n isotopes total suspended matter tsm and poc samples were collected as per the protocols issued by the joint global ocean flux study jgofs knap et al 1996 for poc sampling in situ water samples were immediately filtered through whatman glass fiber filters gf f 0 7 μm and φ47 mm prior to filtration the gf f filters were combusted at 450 c for 5 h and packed in aluminum foil following filtration the filters were re packed in aluminum foil knap et al 1996 for tsm sampling in situ water samples were filtered through sartorius cellulose acetate membranes 0 45 μm and φ47 mm which had been dried at 45 c for 4 h repeatedly until the weight difference was 0 1 mg which was done to obtain the weight of the empty filter following filtration filters were rinsed with purified milli q water to remove salt and dissolved matter and then finally placed in plastic petri dishes all poc and tsm samples were stored at 20 c until laboratory analysis in the lab an open container of 10 hydrochloric acid hcl was placed on the bottom of a desiccator to ensure all poc samples were acidified with saturated hcl fumes for 8 h to remove particulate inorganic c hedges and stern 1984 using a similar procedure to wang et al 2012 poc content was measured via high temperature combustion 680 c using a toc analyzer shimadzu corporation japan additionally tsm content was determined gravimetrically by drying filters at 40 c for 6 8 h repeatedly until the weight difference was 0 1 mg which was done to obtain its total weight strickland and parsons 1972 tsm weight was then calculated by subtracting the weight of the empty filters from the total weight in total 60 poc and 62 tsm samples were collected further details on the poc and tsm collection procedures can be found in liu et al 2015a finally δ13c and δ15n were analyzed using an integrated continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer approach euro ea elemental analyzer eurovector and isoprime cf irms 2 3 end member mixing model end member mixing analysis emma can be used to quantitatively calculate the relative contribution of different potential poc sources in samples dittmar et al 2001 gonneea et al 2004 the ternary mixing model can generally satisfy poc source discrimination using the formulas based on δ13c and δ15n as follows δ13c sample fa δ13ca fb δ13cb fc δ13cc δ15n sample fa δ15na fb δ15nb fc δ15nc fa fb fc 1 where a b and c are the potential poc end members and f represents the contributory percentage of each end member in combination with findings from previous studies on aquatic ecosystems δ13c and δ15n can provide effective information on the relative contribution of different end members endogenous production primarily phytoplankton and submerged plants and exogenous imports are the main poc sources of lake systems however significant inputs from exogenous sources derive from terrestrial plant sources i e c3 and c4 plants as well as surface soil when present in a watershed moyer et al 2012 the rarity of c4 plants in the lake poyang watershed is due to its hot and humid climate this watershed mainly comprises of tall densely packed c3 plants which remote sensing has confirmed this strongly indicates that c4 plants may have little effect on poc sources in lake poyang jia and peng 2003 zhang et al 2014 which has also been confirmed by lake poyang δ13c and δ15n distribution patterns fig 5a our study considered three potential poc sources i e som c3 plants and phytoplankton to quantify relative contributions from multiple sources based on typical δ13c and δ15n values fig 5b phytoplankton δ13c values were between 42 and 24 with an average value of 30 kendall et al 2001 krull et al 2008 while phytoplankton δ15n values ranged from 4 to 10 with a mean value of 6 wang et al 2020 moreover som δ13c values were between 25 and 22 goñi et al 2003 while som δ15n values varied from 4 to 9 mariotti et al 1988 accordingly these values were regarded as the end member values in our study based on the distribution of the main c3 plant types in the study area we determined that for c3 plants δ13c values were from 32 to 24 and δ15n values were from 3 7 herbeck et al 2011 kaiser et al 2013 which is generally consistent with the c3 terrestrial plant range reported by lamb et al 2006 2 4 statistical analyses the kruskal wallis h test and pairwise comparisons applying the wilcoxon rank sum test were conducted in r version 3 5 3 de muth 2014 which were used to test significant differences in environmental parameters and nutrients within the three vertically stratified zones in the three regions investigated additionally arcmap version 10 2 was used to plot poc concentrations in these three different vertical layers by adding attributes and modifying properties symbology charts the partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem was adopted using smartpls version 3 3 3 ringle et al 2015 to analyze the relationship between environmental factors poc concentrations and isotopes in these three stratified layers 3 results 3 1 environmental parameters as fig 2 shows most environmental parameters except for chl a doc dtc nh4 n and po4 p differed significantly among the three regions investigated in lake poyang with p values

the main lake 133 65 μs and the water channel 148 96 μs while the mean ph of the water channel 7 49 was significantly higher than that of the sub lakes 7 05 and the main lake 7 23 fig 2b c p 0 01 additionally the tsm of the main lake ranged from 4 60 mg l 1 to 85 67 mg l 1 which was significantly higher than that of the water channel fig 2d p 0 05 results also showed that the mean dic concentration differed significantly among the three regions investigated in lake poyang which was lowest in the sub lakes 4 70 mg l 1 and highest in the water channel 7 87 mg l 1 fig 2g p 0 01 moreover doc concentrations ranged significantly from 2 66 mg l 1 to 21 10 mg l 1 with a mean value of 5 27 mg l 1 in lake poyang fig 2f regarding different n form concentrations no3 n dtn and tn concentrations of the sub lakes were significantly lower than that of the main lake and water channel fig 2i k and l p 0 01 the mean dtp was lowest in the sub lakes 0 014 mg l 1 and highest in the

significantly lower than that of the main lake and the water channel fig 2p p 0 05 however except for tsm and dtn other environmental factors did not show significant differences among the three vertically stratified layers fig 2 the mean tsm exhibited an increasing trend from the surface layer 11 57 mg l 1 to the bottom layer 44 10 mg l 1 fig 2d p 0 01 and the mean dtn concentration of the bottom layer 1 74 mg l 1 was significantly higher than that of the surface layer 1 31 mg l 1 and middle layer 1 45 mg l 1 fig 2k p 0 05 furthermore the do concentrations in the main lake were significantly lower than that of the water channel and sd values in the sub lakes were also significantly lower than that of the water channel fig 2q s p 0 05 the mean wd of the water channel was 12 89 m which was twice that of the mean wd of the main lake 6 20 m fig 2t p 0 01 3 2 spatial poc δ13c and δ15n patterns lake poyang poc values significantly differed among the three vertically stratified layers p 0 01 fig 3 the mean poc value was highest in the bottom layer 1 60 mg l 1 and ranged considerably from 0 76 mg l 1 to 2 95 mg l 1 fig 3 although mean poc values between the surface 0 96 mg l 1 and the middle 0 85 mg l 1 layers were roughly the same a wider range of poc concentrations were observed in the middle layer 0 56 mg l 1 1 58 mg l 1 fig 3 moreover sub lake and water channel poc values differed significantly p 0 05 and sub lake poc values were both relatively higher and wider in range 0 45 mg l 1 2 35 mg l 1 while the mean poc in the water channel was lowest overall 0 67 mg l 1 fig 3 an increasing trend in mean δ13c values was observed sequentially from the surface to the bottom layer and mean δ13c values on the surface layer 29 07 were significantly lower than that of the bottom layer 27 90 fig 4 a p 0 01 moreover the mean δ13c value of the sub lakes 27 07 was significantly higher than that of the main lake 28 77 and the water channel 29 25 fig 4a additionally δ15n values among the three regions investigated in lake poyang and the three vertically stratified layers showed no significant difference fig 4b finally δ15n values of lake poyang varied from 2 20 to 10 15 with the average of 5 65 fig 4b 3 3 quantitative poc source estimation emma results showed poc was almost entirely driven by exogenous sources in the sub lakes including c3 plants 33 and som 66 fig 5 c poc sources changed from an endogenous source to an exogenous source sequentially from the surface layer to the bottom layer in the main lake and water channel of lake poyang in the surface layer of the main lake endogenous and exogenous sources each accounted for half fig 5c exogenous sources accounted for 78 in the middle layer of the main lake for which the c3 plant source was 53 however the c3 plant source dominated the bottom layer 70 with a total phytoplankton source of only 7 fig 5c in the water channel poc driven by endogenous production accounted for 67 in the surface layer 46 in the middle layer and 18 in the bottom layer fig 5c 4 discussion lake poyang being a typical large subtropical floodplain lake system is subject to spatial differences in physical chemical and biological factors which results in the spatial heterogeneity of potential poc sources our study showed that among the different vertically stratified layers the surface layer was endogenously dominant the middle layer was mixed and the bottom layer was exogenously dominant fig 5 fig 7 moreover poc distribution and composition in the water column were dominated by the physical regime of the lake photosynthetic processes of phytoplankton and aquatic plants degradation of organic matter microbial activity and sediment resuspension and were indirectly affected by environmental factors such as sunlight temperature lake topography do wind speed turbidity and nutrient levels chen et al 2018 meng et al 2021 4 1 driving mechanism of endogenous poc the contribution of endogenous poc is mainly influenced by photosynthetic and respiratory phytoplankton processes which will result in c isotopic fractionation kendall et al 2001 our results showed that the contribution of endogenous poc in the surface layer of the sun lakes was extremely low while it was dominant in the main lake and the water channel fig 5c liang et al 2016 also found a small endogenous contribution of poc in the study of lake bang a sub lake of lake poyang the dominant role of endogenous poc has been shown in many studies of floodplain systems such as the danube and curuai floodplain besemer et al 2009 moreira turcq et al 2013 the proportion of endogenous poc was in the order of the sub lakes the main lake the water channel which is consistent with factors related to phytoplankton photosynthesis such as do and sd fig 2 fig 5c this confirmed that factors that affected the surface poc contribution were mainly environmental factors related to photosynthesis do sd and wt pls sem model results also showed that factors related to photosynthesis had an important influence on surface chl a and poc concentration fig 6 a in riverine ecosystems phytoplankton photosynthesis is a major c transformation process which involves the conversion from dic to poc liu et al 2010 basu and mackey 2018 given that biological and physicochemical c transformation processes are associated with different degrees of isotopic fractionation poc composition can provide information on dominant processes raymond and bauer 2001 schulte et al 2011 it is well established that primary productivity is a fundamental factor that affects aqueous inorganic c dynamics and the isotopic fractionation of organic matter gu et al 2006 in eutrophic lakes phytoplankton induced primary productivity contributes greater than 80 to endogenous poc jones et al 2012 phytoplankton preferentially utilize lighter 12c isotopes compared to heavier 13c isotopes during dic uptake when dic is abundant leading to a decrease in poc based δ13c values choudhary et al 2009 through means of its influence on sunlight availability within the water column turbidity has an important indirect effect on phytoplankton photosynthesis moreover do is an important indicator that reflects the physicochemical processes that occur in aquatic ecosystems such as water gas exchange aquatic photosynthesis and respiration mineral oxidation and the mixing and recycling of water mader et al 2017 and aquatic photosynthetic processes are a significant source of do parker et al 2005 additionally nutrient levels i e n and p are critical for phytoplankton growth and primary production wang et al 2021b and this study has shown that n and p both had an important effect on poc concentration and composition in the surface layer fig 7 a further confirming the important contribution that primary production has on poc in surface layers cole et al 2007 shih et al 2010 at the same time n transformation processes that occur in aquatic environments such as n fixation nitrification and denitrification exert strong effects on isotopic fractionation moreover certain processes frequently act synergistically with or against each other to influence δ15n kendall et al 2001 hadas et al 2009 4 2 driving mechanism of exogenous poc from the surface layer to the bottom layer results from this study showed that poc composition gradually changed sequentially from endogenous dominant to exogenous dominant previous studies have shown that phytoplankton cell density decreased from the surface layer to the bottom layer in lake fuxian china chen et al 2018 terrestrial poc mainly consists of a mixture of terrestrial plant debris and som which contains both old and modern terrestrial organic c components in general physical erosion is the primary controlling factor of riverine poc concentrations galy et al 2015 soil erosion is a key means of poc transport from land to surface water smith et al 2005 soil erosion has been shown to mobilize 52 tg yr 1 of soil organic c in the continental united states of america and it may play a dominant role in regulating riverine poc cycling processes yang et al 2016 being a significant indicator of physical erosion tsm had a significant positive effect on poc in the middle and bottom layers of the lake fig 6 indicating that poc transportation in the middle and bottom layers was strongly affected by physical erosion anthropogenic activities such as cultivation road construction and overgrazing will accelerate soil erosion which may be an important source of terrestrially derived tsm and poc leithold et al 2006 regnier et al 2013 land use changes influence aquatic ecosystem characteristics such as water body quality nutrient loading and organic matter distribution el khoury et al 2015 zorzal almeida et al 2018 additionally runoff significantly controls poc migration transformation and distribution tesi et al 2013 ye et al 2017 under high sediment levels soil minerals tend to dilute poc content galy et al 2015 suspended sediment also only represents a small portion of total eroded sediment yang et al 2016 thus causing complex erosional impacts on poc furthermore c inputs along with sediment deposition and resuspension may further complicate the contribution of different c sources blair et al 2004 trimmer et al 2012 results from this study showed that the poc that derived from som sources in the surface and middle layers was extremely low in the deep water area of the lake the water channel fig 5c this is probably because most som sources derive from recalcitrant terrestrial organic matter in the water channel which are characterized by coarser particles thus these particles are more easily deposited and more difficult to resuspend toonen et al 2015 the deposition of suspended sediment will significantly reduce total mobilized particulate materials that derive from soil erosion processes lal 2003 for example it has been estimated that approx 94 49 tg c yr 1 of eroded c is impounded in surface water or other depositional sites in the united states of america stets and striegl 2012 resuspended sedimental poc refers to poc that has resuspended from surface sediment due to strong bottom currents which can be further transported into the upper water layers by density driven vertical mixing of the water column and turbulent flow based on the observed relationship between poc and tsm in the middle and bottom layers of lake poyang fig 6 a considerable amount of poc in the water column has been assumed to originate from sediment resuspension urban et al 2005 zigah et al 2012 poc from som sources deriving from the bottom layer of the water channel accounted for one quarter of all poc fig 5c confirming that sediment resuspension processes do in fact transport a considerable amount of poc from the bottom sediment layer to overlying water and many nutrients e g n and p heavy metals and organic pollutants must therefore also be released under such conditions foster et al 2000 adams et al 2015 and transported to other places by the current increasing risks of algal blooms and water quality deterioration ho and michalak 2015 hanifzadeh et al 2017 the higher contribution from terrestrial organic matter in lake systems is caused by its relatively higher tsm induced by lower in situ production during the sampling periods we observed many sandmining boats on lake poyang although many studies have argued that sand mining will reduce the overall sediment load chu et al 2009 yang et al 2007 noted that sand mining acts to resuspend fine particles and subsequently leads to an increase in the sediment load from lake poyang to its mainstream water level as one of the important hydrology factors of lake has an important impact on the lake hydrodynamic chemical and ecological processes wu et al 2014 our previous study showed that the water level of lake poyang varied significantly in different seasons p 0 01 with the seasonal variation ranging from 7 61 m to 20 82 m wang et al 2021a the high fluctuation of water level in lake poyang leads to the complex hydrological process which leads to the significant difference of poc sources in different water level periods liang et al 2016 the δ13c of lake poyang and its main tributaries showed a relatively consistent trend which was lower in wet season and higher in dry season and exogenous poc dominated in both seasons wang et al 2014 ye et al 2017 found that poc carried by the river increases significantly during the wet season in the pearl river estuary floodplain system tesi et al 2013 also noted that flood events account for at least one third of annual particulate matter exports organic c and n in the po river watershed furthermore for open water areas with shallow water depths i e the sub lake and main lake areas of lake poyang wind disturbances may affect the distribution of endogenous and exogenous fractions resulting in no clear observed dominance wind speeds greater than 3 7 4 0 m s 1 have been shown to strongly affect sediment in a vertical direction zheng et al 2015 for which the organic matter deposited in sediment will be resuspended affecting the distribution of organic matter from potential sources our results also showed that wind speed and wd which are both related to vertical mixing strongly correlated to poc and its associated isotopes fig 6 intense wind conditions may also cause the resuspension of som in certain lakeshore and offshore areas cai et al 2012 dong et al 2014 even transporting organic matter into central lake system areas the combination of wind and lake area topography may also significantly affect flow velocity thus affecting the distribution pattern of poc composition while potentially changing characteristics of its original composition although both som and algae growth significantly impacted poc concentrations a large proportion of poc variability remained unaccounted for fig 5 fig 6 the contribution of poc that derived from c3 plants in the middle and bottom layers of the main lake and the water channel was greater than half of all poc showing that allochthonous litter inputs are important in explaining vertical and spatial poc patterns hagen et al 2010 due to the dense plant canopy of certain areas of the lake poyang watershed litterfall is the main c source in certain areas of the lake wang et al 2014 revealed that c3 plants were the main source of poc in lake poyang and its inflow rivers additionally organic matter degradation is also an important dic source that impacts lake system poc concentrations yi et al 2021 different degradation processes also have an important effect on poc composition in different vertical layers photodegradation is dominant in the surface layer of water while biodegradation is dominant in the bottom layer of water yi et al 2021 macrophyte detritus was also revealed to be the main source of particulate organic matter in floodplain lakes of the central brazilian amazon basin during the dry season mortillaro et al 2011 differences and diversity among the impacts between vertical poc distribution and various driving factors further illustrate the complexity of c cycling processes of large floodplain lake systems fig 7 and underlying driving processes related to the distribution of poc concentration and composition may be specific to spatial scales sobek et al 2007 hanson et al 2014 5 conclusions in this study we adopted dual stable isotopes δ13c and δ15n and end member mixing analysis emma to quantitatively estimate vertically stratified poc sources and explore drivers of poc sources and features in lake poyang we found significant vertical and spatial differences in both poc and δ13c distribution in lake poyang owing to the lower endogenous production caused by high turbidity and other environmental characteristics in this region the poc of the sub lakes was almost entirely driven by exogenous sources however findings showed that poc composition gradually changed from endogenous dominant to exogenous dominant sequentially from the surface layer to the bottom layer of lake poyang moreover environmental factors associated with phytoplankton photosynthesis as well as nutrient nitrogen n and phosphorus p levels primarily drove surface poc as determined by dissolved oxygen do secchi depth sd and water temperature wt measurements poc distribution and composition in the middle and bottom layers of lake poyang were strongly affected by soil erosion sediment deposition and resuspension anthropogenic activities i e land use change sand dredging dam building etc can significantly disrupt these processes additionally factors associated with vertical mixing such as wind speed and water depth wd which may also significantly affect flow velocity also played an important role in poc distribution and sources due to the dense plant canopy distribution in some areas of lake poyang the c3 plant litter contribution was significant in the middle and bottom layers of the lake water flow velocity lake area topography as well as different degradation processes may also have important effects on poc composition in different vertically stratified water layers and areas effective differences among poc and various influencing factors further illustrate that the underlying processes that regulate c cycling and poc composition may be complex and specific to spatial scales this study provided an in depth analysis of the different driving processes of vertically stratified poc sources in a large floodplain lake system which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the potential driving

16441,particulate organic carbon poc is an important component of lake organic carbon c pools of which different factors drive vertical distributions and sources this study used the dual stable isotope δ13c and δ15n approach to investigate vertical poc sources and drivers in a large floodplain lake system findings showed that poc composition gradually changed from endogenous dominant to exogenous dominant sequentially from the surface layer to the bottom layer of lake poyang environmental factors associated with phytoplankton photosynthesis as well as nutrient levels primarily drove surface poc moreover soil erosion sediment deposition and resuspension strongly affected poc distribution and composition in the middle and bottom layers of the lake poc sources were also affected by factors associated with vertical mixing such as wind speed and water depth litter from c3 plants significantly contributed to poc concentrations in the middle and bottom layers of the lake results from this study can benefit our overall understanding of the potential driving mechanisms of lake c cycling processes aquatic ecosystem functions and pollutant migration keywords particulate organic carbon source vertical stratification stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes lake poyang 1 introduction lake carbon c cycling is a main focal point of current lake research being a key component of the global c cycle and associated c sources and sinks le quéré et al 2015 westberry and meredith 2016 particulate organic carbon poc is a key component of lake organic c pools and has a significant regulatory effect on organic and inorganic c pool via deposition degradation and mineralization behrenfeld et al 2013 siegel et al 2014 moreover poc also plays a significant role in c and energy flow within lake systems and to a large extent governs the transport of macronutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p as well as metal and organic contaminants foster et al 2000 adams et al 2015 according to its geochemical characteristics poc can be separated into endogenous and exogenous organic c which are associated with terrestrial inputs from soil erosion endogenous phytoplanktonic primary production and macrophyte debris in lake systems zigah et al 2011 adams et al 2015 both young terrestrial poc and endogenous poc can easily mineralize to carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 through heterotrophic mechanisms galy et al 2015 conversely exogenously aged poc is preferentially trapped in lake sediment subsequently contributing to long term c cycling battin et al 2008 guillemette et al 2017 supplemental labile organic matter can effectively decompose aged poc which is known as the priming effect guenet et al 2010 bianchi 2011 previous studies have suggested that the priming effect significantly increases the extent of organic c mineralization in soil and water by 400 1100 and 10 500 respectively guenet et al 2010 bianchi 2011 processes associated with anabatic soil erosion can transport large quantities of poc and nutrients to lake systems galy et al 2015 leading to enhanced eutrophication and algal blooms paerl 2017 an increase in the volume of endogenous poc via eutrophication and algal bloom outbreaks will alter the poc composition of lake systems previously dominated by terrestrial poc which will effectively modify both the role and effect of transitional lake processes on the global c cycle accordingly such compositional poc alterations will lead to a significant change in greenhouse gas emissions and c sequestration processes in lake systems given their influence on the global c cycle poc flux concentrations and pools in river lake and oceanic systems have been widely studied mcclelland et al 2016 huang et al 2017 however our limited knowledge on poc composition and associative driving mechanisms have restrained the utilization of poc flux concentration and pool data on the global c cycle as well as regulatory compositional effects related to poc sequestration and mineralization gudasz et al 2012 watanabe and kuwae 2015 mixing or stratification processes in lake water has significant environmental and ecological significance particularly in analyzing the consumption of dissolved oxygen do nutrients and algae distribution in the bottom layer of lake systems bouchez et al 2014 chen et al 2018 the mixing or stratification of lake water may be a continuous decadal process or a short term process that only takes a few hours which mainly depends on the mixing energy caused by lotic lake inflow and outflow and the energy transfer at the water air interface caused by meteorological factors such as wind and sunlight zigah et al 2011 poc as an important part of the biological pump would be transformed through food web physical mixing and deposition which transfers poc from the upper water to the lower water gao et al 2021 the strong bottom currents re suspended poc from the surface sediments and the density driven vertical mixing of the water column and turbulent flow could further carry it to the upper water along with numerous nutrients pollutants and heavy metals may have been released concurrently adams et al 2015 therefore under complex processes inherent to a hydrodynamic lake water environment it is of great practical significance to explore the distribution of c and other environmental factors in vertical water which can improve both the evaluation and sustainable management of the lake water environment into the future however to date poc sources and cycling processes have yet to be adequately delineated chen et al 2018 considering the complex changes associated with lake hydrodynamics and environmental conditions it is critical to clarify stratified vertical sources and circulation patterns of lake poc to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of lake c cycling processes and greenhouse gas emissions zigah et al 2011 chen et al 2018 the isotopic signature δ13c which measures stable isotope ratios can be used as a tracer to quantify c sources and explore the transformation of various c forms marwick et al 2015 xie et al 2020 however δ13c signatures of c deriving from different sources can overlap considerably leading to significant uncertainty in distinguishing between c sources raymond and bauer 2001 however this problem can be resolved by applying δ13c and δ15n in combination both δ13c and δ15n provide linear quantities that can be directly applied to isotopic mixing models which quantitatively favor discriminating between organic c sources these two signatures are often used to trace the fate and origin of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems dang et al 2018 amir et al 2019 in this study we adopted these dual stable isotopic signatures δ13c and δ15n for end member mixing analysis emma to 1 investigate vertically stratified distribution poc characteristics and associated stable isotopes in lake poyang 2 to quantitatively estimate vertically stratified poc sources in lake poyang and 3 to explore drivers of poc sources and features in lake poyang an in depth investigation on vertically stratified poc sources and drivers in a large floodplain lake system is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of cn p coupling cycles aquatic ecosystem functions and pollutant migration and transformation processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites lake poyang 115 49 e 116 46 e 28 24 n 29 46 n the largest freshwater lake in china is situated at the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river ye et al 2019 in recent years many scholars have built two dimensional hydrodynamic numerical models to investigate c cycle and budget characteristics of lake systems although these models have been widely used and developed they have rarely considered the vertical stratification of water bodies hence there is a critical lack of water quality models to further evaluate the process and role of c cycling in lake systems although it is generally accepted by most scholars that lake poyang is a shallow water lake system and consequently characteristics and changes to its vertical structure can be ignored there is not enough data to support this claim li et al 2015 the available data that does exist has shown that lake poyang undergoes considerable water level fluctuations i e 7 9 19 4 m liu et al 2015b moreover annual mean precipitation is approximately 1622 mm throughout the entire region under this typical warm and humid subtropical climate jin et al 2012 the rainy season is mostly concentrated from april to june accounting for between 42 and 53 of the total annual rainfall wu et al 2014 lake poyang is also influenced by anthropogenic activities such as land reclamation fisheries dam construction sand excavation operations and transportation and it is consequently subject to serious environmental stress such as eutrophication wang et al 2021a a total of 24 sampling sites were established in lake poyang for this study based on different geomorphic units environmental conditions spatial distributions and sampling processes fig 1 sampling sites 1 8 those situated in the western and eastern regions of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established in sub lake areas sampling sites 9 14 those situated in the southern and central regions of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established within the main lake area sampling sites 15 24 those situated in the northern region of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established within the water channel 2 2 sampling and analysis in april 2021 a water sampler was used to collect water samples 0 5 m below the water surface at half lake depth and 0 5 m above the bottom sediment layer at all sampling sites if the collected bottom water sample 0 5 m above the bottom sediment disturbed the sediment we re sampled the water sampleat this sample point 2 2 1 environmental variables we used the ultrameter 6p instrument myron the united states of america to measure conductivity cond and ph in situ an expendable bathythermograph xbt dt100pro was used to measure water temperature wt and water

sd in situ an anemometer was used to measure wind speed ws in situ 2 2 2 chemical parameters c n p si and chl a in water water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane filters which were first treated in a water bath 80 c for 8 h prior to filtering the vario toc analyzer elementar germany was used to measure dissolved total carbon dtc dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations while a segmented continuous flow analyzer futura france was used to analyze dissolved total nitrogen dtn nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n concentrations an automated discrete analyzer smartchem 200 italy was used to measure dissolved total phosphorus dtp phosphate po4 p and dissolved silicon dsi concentrations total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were tested using a digestion method jia et al 2017 that employed a segmented continuous flow analyzer futura france the chl a concentrations were measured using a hydrolab ds5 multi parameter water quality sonde ott hydromet the united states of america in situ 2 2 3 tsm poc and associated c and n isotopes total suspended matter tsm and poc samples were collected as per the protocols issued by the joint global ocean flux study jgofs knap et al 1996 for poc sampling in situ water samples were immediately filtered through whatman glass fiber filters gf f 0 7 μm and φ47 mm prior to filtration the gf f filters were combusted at 450 c for 5 h and packed in aluminum foil following filtration the filters were re packed in aluminum foil knap et al 1996 for tsm sampling in situ water samples were filtered through sartorius cellulose acetate membranes 0 45 μm and φ47 mm which had been dried at 45 c for 4 h repeatedly until the weight difference was 0 1 mg which was done to obtain the weight of the empty filter following filtration filters were rinsed with purified milli q water to remove salt and dissolved matter and then finally placed in plastic petri dishes all poc and tsm samples were stored at 20 c until laboratory analysis in the lab an open container of 10 hydrochloric acid hcl was placed on the bottom of a desiccator to ensure all poc samples were acidified with saturated hcl fumes for 8 h to remove particulate inorganic c hedges and stern 1984 using a similar procedure to wang et al 2012 poc content was measured via high temperature combustion 680 c using a toc analyzer shimadzu corporation japan additionally tsm content was determined gravimetrically by drying filters at 40 c for 6 8 h repeatedly until the weight difference was 0 1 mg which was done to obtain its total weight strickland and parsons 1972 tsm weight was then calculated by subtracting the weight of the empty filters from the total weight in total 60 poc and 62 tsm samples were collected further details on the poc and tsm collection procedures can be found in liu et al 2015a finally δ13c and δ15n were analyzed using an integrated continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer approach euro ea elemental analyzer eurovector and isoprime cf irms 2 3 end member mixing model end member mixing analysis emma can be used to quantitatively calculate the relative contribution of different potential poc sources in samples dittmar et al 2001 gonneea et al 2004 the ternary mixing model can generally satisfy poc source discrimination using the formulas based on δ13c and δ15n as follows δ13c sample fa δ13ca fb δ13cb fc δ13cc δ15n sample fa δ15na fb δ15nb fc δ15nc fa fb fc 1 where a b and c are the potential poc end members and f represents the contributory percentage of each end member in combination with findings from previous studies on aquatic ecosystems δ13c and δ15n can provide effective information on the relative contribution of different end members endogenous production primarily phytoplankton and submerged plants and exogenous imports are the main poc sources of lake systems however significant inputs from exogenous sources derive from terrestrial plant sources i e c3 and c4 plants as well as surface soil when present in a watershed moyer et al 2012 the rarity of c4 plants in the lake poyang watershed is due to its hot and humid climate this watershed mainly comprises of tall densely packed c3 plants which remote sensing has confirmed this strongly indicates that c4 plants may have little effect on poc sources in lake poyang jia and peng 2003 zhang et al 2014 which has also been confirmed by lake poyang δ13c and δ15n distribution patterns fig 5a our study considered three potential poc sources i e som c3 plants and phytoplankton to quantify relative contributions from multiple sources based on typical δ13c and δ15n values fig 5b phytoplankton δ13c values were between 42 and 24 with an average value of 30 kendall et al 2001 krull et al 2008 while phytoplankton δ15n values ranged from 4 to 10 with a mean value of 6 wang et al 2020 moreover som δ13c values were between 25 and 22 goñi et al 2003 while som δ15n values varied from 4 to 9 mariotti et al 1988 accordingly these values were regarded as the end member values in our study based on the distribution of the main c3 plant types in the study area we determined that for c3 plants δ13c values were from 32 to 24 and δ15n values were from 3 7 herbeck et al 2011 kaiser et al 2013 which is generally consistent with the c3 terrestrial plant range reported by lamb et al 2006 2 4 statistical analyses the kruskal wallis h test and pairwise comparisons applying the wilcoxon rank sum test were conducted in r version 3 5 3 de muth 2014 which were used to test significant differences in environmental parameters and nutrients within the three vertically stratified zones in the three regions investigated additionally arcmap version 10 2 was used to plot poc concentrations in these three different vertical layers by adding attributes and modifying properties symbology charts the partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem was adopted using smartpls version 3 3 3 ringle et al 2015 to analyze the relationship between environmental factors poc concentrations and isotopes in these three stratified layers 3 results 3 1 environmental parameters as fig 2 shows most environmental parameters except for chl a doc dtc nh4 n and po4 p differed significantly among the three regions investigated in lake poyang with p values

the main lake 133 65 μs and the water channel 148 96 μs while the mean ph of the water channel 7 49 was significantly higher than that of the sub lakes 7 05 and the main lake 7 23 fig 2b c p 0 01 additionally the tsm of the main lake ranged from 4 60 mg l 1 to 85 67 mg l 1 which was significantly higher than that of the water channel fig 2d p 0 05 results also showed that the mean dic concentration differed significantly among the three regions investigated in lake poyang which was lowest in the sub lakes 4 70 mg l 1 and highest in the water channel 7 87 mg l 1 fig 2g p 0 01 moreover doc concentrations ranged significantly from 2 66 mg l 1 to 21 10 mg l 1 with a mean value of 5 27 mg l 1 in lake poyang fig 2f regarding different n form concentrations no3 n dtn and tn concentrations of the sub lakes were significantly lower than that of the main lake and water channel fig 2i k and l p 0 01 the mean dtp was lowest in the sub lakes 0 014 mg l 1 and highest in the

significantly lower than that of the main lake and the water channel fig 2p p 0 05 however except for tsm and dtn other environmental factors did not show significant differences among the three vertically stratified layers fig 2 the mean tsm exhibited an increasing trend from the surface layer 11 57 mg l 1 to the bottom layer 44 10 mg l 1 fig 2d p 0 01 and the mean dtn concentration of the bottom layer 1 74 mg l 1 was significantly higher than that of the surface layer 1 31 mg l 1 and middle layer 1 45 mg l 1 fig 2k p 0 05 furthermore the do concentrations in the main lake were significantly lower than that of the water channel and sd values in the sub lakes were also significantly lower than that of the water channel fig 2q s p 0 05 the mean wd of the water channel was 12 89 m which was twice that of the mean wd of the main lake 6 20 m fig 2t p 0 01 3 2 spatial poc δ13c and δ15n patterns lake poyang poc values significantly differed among the three vertically stratified layers p 0 01 fig 3 the mean poc value was highest in the bottom layer 1 60 mg l 1 and ranged considerably from 0 76 mg l 1 to 2 95 mg l 1 fig 3 although mean poc values between the surface 0 96 mg l 1 and the middle 0 85 mg l 1 layers were roughly the same a wider range of poc concentrations were observed in the middle layer 0 56 mg l 1 1 58 mg l 1 fig 3 moreover sub lake and water channel poc values differed significantly p 0 05 and sub lake poc values were both relatively higher and wider in range 0 45 mg l 1 2 35 mg l 1 while the mean poc in the water channel was lowest overall 0 67 mg l 1 fig 3 an increasing trend in mean δ13c values was observed sequentially from the surface to the bottom layer and mean δ13c values on the surface layer 29 07 were significantly lower than that of the bottom layer 27 90 fig 4 a p 0 01 moreover the mean δ13c value of the sub lakes 27 07 was significantly higher than that of the main lake 28 77 and the water channel 29 25 fig 4a additionally δ15n values among the three regions investigated in lake poyang and the three vertically stratified layers showed no significant difference fig 4b finally δ15n values of lake poyang varied from 2 20 to 10 15 with the average of 5 65 fig 4b 3 3 quantitative poc source estimation emma results showed poc was almost entirely driven by exogenous sources in the sub lakes including c3 plants 33 and som 66 fig 5 c poc sources changed from an endogenous source to an exogenous source sequentially from the surface layer to the bottom layer in the main lake and water channel of lake poyang in the surface layer of the main lake endogenous and exogenous sources each accounted for half fig 5c exogenous sources accounted for 78 in the middle layer of the main lake for which the c3 plant source was 53 however the c3 plant source dominated the bottom layer 70 with a total phytoplankton source of only 7 fig 5c in the water channel poc driven by endogenous production accounted for 67 in the surface layer 46 in the middle layer and 18 in the bottom layer fig 5c 4 discussion lake poyang being a typical large subtropical floodplain lake system is subject to spatial differences in physical chemical and biological factors which results in the spatial heterogeneity of potential poc sources our study showed that among the different vertically stratified layers the surface layer was endogenously dominant the middle layer was mixed and the bottom layer was exogenously dominant fig 5 fig 7 moreover poc distribution and composition in the water column were dominated by the physical regime of the lake photosynthetic processes of phytoplankton and aquatic plants degradation of organic matter microbial activity and sediment resuspension and were indirectly affected by environmental factors such as sunlight temperature lake topography do wind speed turbidity and nutrient levels chen et al 2018 meng et al 2021 4 1 driving mechanism of endogenous poc the contribution of endogenous poc is mainly influenced by photosynthetic and respiratory phytoplankton processes which will result in c isotopic fractionation kendall et al 2001 our results showed that the contribution of endogenous poc in the surface layer of the sun lakes was extremely low while it was dominant in the main lake and the water channel fig 5c liang et al 2016 also found a small endogenous contribution of poc in the study of lake bang a sub lake of lake poyang the dominant role of endogenous poc has been shown in many studies of floodplain systems such as the danube and curuai floodplain besemer et al 2009 moreira turcq et al 2013 the proportion of endogenous poc was in the order of the sub lakes the main lake the water channel which is consistent with factors related to phytoplankton photosynthesis such as do and sd fig 2 fig 5c this confirmed that factors that affected the surface poc contribution were mainly environmental factors related to photosynthesis do sd and wt pls sem model results also showed that factors related to photosynthesis had an important influence on surface chl a and poc concentration fig 6 a in riverine ecosystems phytoplankton photosynthesis is a major c transformation process which involves the conversion from dic to poc liu et al 2010 basu and mackey 2018 given that biological and physicochemical c transformation processes are associated with different degrees of isotopic fractionation poc composition can provide information on dominant processes raymond and bauer 2001 schulte et al 2011 it is well established that primary productivity is a fundamental factor that affects aqueous inorganic c dynamics and the isotopic fractionation of organic matter gu et al 2006 in eutrophic lakes phytoplankton induced primary productivity contributes greater than 80 to endogenous poc jones et al 2012 phytoplankton preferentially utilize lighter 12c isotopes compared to heavier 13c isotopes during dic uptake when dic is abundant leading to a decrease in poc based δ13c values choudhary et al 2009 through means of its influence on sunlight availability within the water column turbidity has an important indirect effect on phytoplankton photosynthesis moreover do is an important indicator that reflects the physicochemical processes that occur in aquatic ecosystems such as water gas exchange aquatic photosynthesis and respiration mineral oxidation and the mixing and recycling of water mader et al 2017 and aquatic photosynthetic processes are a significant source of do parker et al 2005 additionally nutrient levels i e n and p are critical for phytoplankton growth and primary production wang et al 2021b and this study has shown that n and p both had an important effect on poc concentration and composition in the surface layer fig 7 a further confirming the important contribution that primary production has on poc in surface layers cole et al 2007 shih et al 2010 at the same time n transformation processes that occur in aquatic environments such as n fixation nitrification and denitrification exert strong effects on isotopic fractionation moreover certain processes frequently act synergistically with or against each other to influence δ15n kendall et al 2001 hadas et al 2009 4 2 driving mechanism of exogenous poc from the surface layer to the bottom layer results from this study showed that poc composition gradually changed sequentially from endogenous dominant to exogenous dominant previous studies have shown that phytoplankton cell density decreased from the surface layer to the bottom layer in lake fuxian china chen et al 2018 terrestrial poc mainly consists of a mixture of terrestrial plant debris and som which contains both old and modern terrestrial organic c components in general physical erosion is the primary controlling factor of riverine poc concentrations galy et al 2015 soil erosion is a key means of poc transport from land to surface water smith et al 2005 soil erosion has been shown to mobilize 52 tg yr 1 of soil organic c in the continental united states of america and it may play a dominant role in regulating riverine poc cycling processes yang et al 2016 being a significant indicator of physical erosion tsm had a significant positive effect on poc in the middle and bottom layers of the lake fig 6 indicating that poc transportation in the middle and bottom layers was strongly affected by physical erosion anthropogenic activities such as cultivation road construction and overgrazing will accelerate soil erosion which may be an important source of terrestrially derived tsm and poc leithold et al 2006 regnier et al 2013 land use changes influence aquatic ecosystem characteristics such as water body quality nutrient loading and organic matter distribution el khoury et al 2015 zorzal almeida et al 2018 additionally runoff significantly controls poc migration transformation and distribution tesi et al 2013 ye et al 2017 under high sediment levels soil minerals tend to dilute poc content galy et al 2015 suspended sediment also only represents a small portion of total eroded sediment yang et al 2016 thus causing complex erosional impacts on poc furthermore c inputs along with sediment deposition and resuspension may further complicate the contribution of different c sources blair et al 2004 trimmer et al 2012 results from this study showed that the poc that derived from som sources in the surface and middle layers was extremely low in the deep water area of the lake the water channel fig 5c this is probably because most som sources derive from recalcitrant terrestrial organic matter in the water channel which are characterized by coarser particles thus these particles are more easily deposited and more difficult to resuspend toonen et al 2015 the deposition of suspended sediment will significantly reduce total mobilized particulate materials that derive from soil erosion processes lal 2003 for example it has been estimated that approx 94 49 tg c yr 1 of eroded c is impounded in surface water or other depositional sites in the united states of america stets and striegl 2012 resuspended sedimental poc refers to poc that has resuspended from surface sediment due to strong bottom currents which can be further transported into the upper water layers by density driven vertical mixing of the water column and turbulent flow based on the observed relationship between poc and tsm in the middle and bottom layers of lake poyang fig 6 a considerable amount of poc in the water column has been assumed to originate from sediment resuspension urban et al 2005 zigah et al 2012 poc from som sources deriving from the bottom layer of the water channel accounted for one quarter of all poc fig 5c confirming that sediment resuspension processes do in fact transport a considerable amount of poc from the bottom sediment layer to overlying water and many nutrients e g n and p heavy metals and organic pollutants must therefore also be released under such conditions foster et al 2000 adams et al 2015 and transported to other places by the current increasing risks of algal blooms and water quality deterioration ho and michalak 2015 hanifzadeh et al 2017 the higher contribution from terrestrial organic matter in lake systems is caused by its relatively higher tsm induced by lower in situ production during the sampling periods we observed many sandmining boats on lake poyang although many studies have argued that sand mining will reduce the overall sediment load chu et al 2009 yang et al 2007 noted that sand mining acts to resuspend fine particles and subsequently leads to an increase in the sediment load from lake poyang to its mainstream water level as one of the important hydrology factors of lake has an important impact on the lake hydrodynamic chemical and ecological processes wu et al 2014 our previous study showed that the water level of lake poyang varied significantly in different seasons p 0 01 with the seasonal variation ranging from 7 61 m to 20 82 m wang et al 2021a the high fluctuation of water level in lake poyang leads to the complex hydrological process which leads to the significant difference of poc sources in different water level periods liang et al 2016 the δ13c of lake poyang and its main tributaries showed a relatively consistent trend which was lower in wet season and higher in dry season and exogenous poc dominated in both seasons wang et al 2014 ye et al 2017 found that poc carried by the river increases significantly during the wet season in the pearl river estuary floodplain system tesi et al 2013 also noted that flood events account for at least one third of annual particulate matter exports organic c and n in the po river watershed furthermore for open water areas with shallow water depths i e the sub lake and main lake areas of lake poyang wind disturbances may affect the distribution of endogenous and exogenous fractions resulting in no clear observed dominance wind speeds greater than 3 7 4 0 m s 1 have been shown to strongly affect sediment in a vertical direction zheng et al 2015 for which the organic matter deposited in sediment will be resuspended affecting the distribution of organic matter from potential sources our results also showed that wind speed and wd which are both related to vertical mixing strongly correlated to poc and its associated isotopes fig 6 intense wind conditions may also cause the resuspension of som in certain lakeshore and offshore areas cai et al 2012 dong et al 2014 even transporting organic matter into central lake system areas the combination of wind and lake area topography may also significantly affect flow velocity thus affecting the distribution pattern of poc composition while potentially changing characteristics of its original composition although both som and algae growth significantly impacted poc concentrations a large proportion of poc variability remained unaccounted for fig 5 fig 6 the contribution of poc that derived from c3 plants in the middle and bottom layers of the main lake and the water channel was greater than half of all poc showing that allochthonous litter inputs are important in explaining vertical and spatial poc patterns hagen et al 2010 due to the dense plant canopy of certain areas of the lake poyang watershed litterfall is the main c source in certain areas of the lake wang et al 2014 revealed that c3 plants were the main source of poc in lake poyang and its inflow rivers additionally organic matter degradation is also an important dic source that impacts lake system poc concentrations yi et al 2021 different degradation processes also have an important effect on poc composition in different vertical layers photodegradation is dominant in the surface layer of water while biodegradation is dominant in the bottom layer of water yi et al 2021 macrophyte detritus was also revealed to be the main source of particulate organic matter in floodplain lakes of the central brazilian amazon basin during the dry season mortillaro et al 2011 differences and diversity among the impacts between vertical poc distribution and various driving factors further illustrate the complexity of c cycling processes of large floodplain lake systems fig 7 and underlying driving processes related to the distribution of poc concentration and composition may be specific to spatial scales sobek et al 2007 hanson et al 2014 5 conclusions in this study we adopted dual stable isotopes δ13c and δ15n and end member mixing analysis emma to quantitatively estimate vertically stratified poc sources and explore drivers of poc sources and features in lake poyang we found significant vertical and spatial differences in both poc and δ13c distribution in lake poyang owing to the lower endogenous production caused by high turbidity and other environmental characteristics in this region the poc of the sub lakes was almost entirely driven by exogenous sources however findings showed that poc composition gradually changed from endogenous dominant to exogenous dominant sequentially from the surface layer to the bottom layer of lake poyang moreover environmental factors associated with phytoplankton photosynthesis as well as nutrient nitrogen n and phosphorus p levels primarily drove surface poc as determined by dissolved oxygen do secchi depth sd and water temperature wt measurements poc distribution and composition in the middle and bottom layers of lake poyang were strongly affected by soil erosion sediment deposition and resuspension anthropogenic activities i e land use change sand dredging dam building etc can significantly disrupt these processes additionally factors associated with vertical mixing such as wind speed and water depth wd which may also significantly affect flow velocity also played an important role in poc distribution and sources due to the dense plant canopy distribution in some areas of lake poyang the c3 plant litter contribution was significant in the middle and bottom layers of the lake water flow velocity lake area topography as well as different degradation processes may also have important effects on poc composition in different vertically stratified water layers and areas effective differences among poc and various influencing factors further illustrate that the underlying processes that regulate c cycling and poc composition may be complex and specific to spatial scales this study provided an in depth analysis of the different driving processes of vertically stratified poc sources in a large floodplain lake system which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the potential driving

16442,human urine can be used as a fertilizer however due to the high water content 97 concentration is required to make transportation economically feasible reverse osmosis ro has been identified as an energy efficient concentration method furthermore to maximize nitrogen recovery from source separated urine it should be stabilized with an acid or base to prevent urea hydrolysis however the method of stabilization will have an impact on the downstream ro process calcium hydroxide is often used as a base stabilization method for human urine but would require pre treatment to remove excess calcium and subsequent membrane scaling three pre treatment methods such as air bubbling nahco3 addition and nh4hco3 addition were investigated in this study each method successfully reduced the scaling potential and air bubbling was determined to be the most effective method as it resulted in the highest nutrient recovery during concentration and did not require the addition of any chemicals base stabilization with air bubbling pre treatment was then compared to urine stabilized with citric acid acid stabilized urine had a higher nitrogen recovery 7 6 higher however solids formed in the real acidified urine and during concentration a brown organic compound formed on the membrane surface the crystals were identified as uric acid dihydrate and the brown organic fouling resulted in a significant decrease in permeate flux as compared to the base stabilized urine with air bubbling pre treatment at a 60 water recovery 85 5 of the urea and 99 2 of the potassium was recovered in the brine stream and more than 99 9 of the phosphorus was recovered as a separate solid calcium phosphate fertilizer whilst nutrient recovery was higher with acid stabilization the membrane fouling that occurred with this stabilization method meant that base stabilization with air bubbling pre treatment was the preferred treatment option it is recommended that acid stabilized urine be concentrated using evaporation processes instead graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords air bubbling acidification fertilizers phosphorus source separation fouling 1 introduction urine is rich in three key components required for inorganic fertilizer production nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k when fresh about 85 of the n in urine is present as urea putnam 1971 a key fertilizer urea is produced synthetically at high temperatures and pressures meessen 2014 from ammonia and requires substantial energy 54 mj kg n 1 patyk and reinhardt 1997 furthermore limited reserves of phosphate rock are the main source of p used in fertilizers cordell 2013 the mining of which has significant environmental impacts hakkou et al 2016 in addition urine contributes the majority of n and p 81 and 56 respectively but only 1 the volume of domestic wastewaters höglund 2001 source separation and resource recovery from urine therefore has the potential to provide a more sustainable source of p whilst simultaneously reducing the energy load of traditional wastewater treatment plants kjerstadius et al 2017 it is common to apply urine directly to land as a fertilizer in rural communities udert and wächter 2012 however as urine is 97 water the cost of large scale collection and transportation from urban areas to agricultural land would not always be economical chipako and randall 2020 this has led to the investigation of a variety of methods of varying complexity to concentrate urine including evaporation simha et al 2020a udert and wächter 2012 freeze concentration lind et al 2001 randall and nathoo 2018 electrodialysis pronk et al 2006 membrane distillation zhao et al 2013 and forward osmosis ray et al 2019 volpin et al 2019 reverse osmosis ro has also been identified as a promising yet understudied concentration technique because it is energy efficient when compared to other concentration methods udert and wächter 2012 reverse osmosis is also used widely to desalinate seawater greenlee et al 2009 and urine has a similar total dissolved solids tds concentration 30 40 g l 1 to that of seawater whilst ro has been investigated for a wide range of wastewater streams the research on concentrating human urine using ro has been predominately limited to hydrolyzed urine ek et al 2006 that is urine where all the urea has degraded to ammonium and carbonate ions however significant nitrogen can be lost from hydrolyzed urine because of ammonia volatilization to maximize nitrogen recovery urine should be stabilized to prevent urea hydrolysis enzymatic urea hydrolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme urease callahan et al 2005 which is commonly produced by bacteria found in the urinary tract mclean et al 1988 and the environment acidification ray et al 2018 and alkalinization randall et al 2016 are methods that have both been shown to be effective for stabilizing human urine citric acid ray et al 2018 and calcium hydroxide randall et al 2016 were identified as promising options for urine stabilization as they are both solids and could be pre dosed and therefore would not require expensive dosing equipment and pumps however each stabilization method has pros and cons that will affect the operation of an ro system and whether pre treatment is required urine stabilization with ca oh 2 results in the precipitation of sparingly soluble salts such as calcium phosphate and magnesium hydroxide flanagan and randall 2018 these solids can be removed by filtration thus potentially reducing ro membrane scaling however the filtrate will be saturated with ca oh 2 which will precipitate during ro concentration or form caco3 due to reactions with co2 in the air pradhan et al 2017 thus resulting in ro membrane scaling calcium carbonate is the most problematic scaling compound for ro systems greenlee et al 2009 and pre treatment will be required to ensure efficient membrane operation air bubbling courtney et al 2021 and bicarbonate ion addition courtney and randall 2021 have both been shown to be appropriate pre treatment methods to remove excess calcium from urine stabilized with ca oh 2 however their effectivity in preventing ro membrane scaling has not yet been tested during the concentration of stabilized urine the treated solutions will also have varying ph values approximately 8 5 after air bubbling 9 5 after nh4hco3 addition and 12 after nahco3 addition which may also influence the ion rejection through the ro membranes stabilizing urine by acidification would in theory not require a pre treatment and all ions would remain in solution therefore all npk nutrients could be theoretically recovered in the brine during acidification stabilization unlike with base stabilization where p is removed via filtration as solid calcium phosphate the chosen stabilization method will also affect the osmotic pressure of the feed stream which will influence the permeate flux and the potential volume reduction the key factors affecting the operation of an ro system are ion rejection permeate flux and scaling fouling recovery of p and k in the brine is not challenging as these species generally have high rejections 98 by ro membranes ek et al 2006 however the rejection of urea is more challenging as it is a small uncharged particle and is therefore difficult to remove by size and charge exclusion yoon and lueptow 2005 rejection of urea from wastewater has shown to vary between 19 and 74 for various low pressure ro membranes 27 bar lee and lueptow 2001 ray et al 2020 yoon and lueptow 2005 however there is currently no known literature available on the rejection of urea using seawater ro swro membranes which operates at higher pressures 55 bar compared to 27 bar in addition the above studies were conducted with dead end stirred cells desc which do not accurately mimic the cross flow that occurs in commercial ro nf systems to our best knowledge only two ro studies with real urine have been conducted ray et al 2020 investigated urea rejection with brackish water ro membranes operating pressure of 27 bar using real urine stabilized with naoh 50 ph 12 5 and acetic acid 62 ph 5 this study used a desc system and a low water recovery of 8 no indication of how the rejection of different salts and urea would be affected as the feed concentration increases was given as this was not the objective of this study secondly no permeate flux data was presented therefore it is not possible to draw conclusions on whether any scaling or fouling occurred or what possible volume reductions are achievable this is critical for the design of full scale ro processes for higher water removals ek et al 2006 achieved an 80 water removal using a swro membrane however this study was conducted using dilute and hydrolyzed urine with h2so4 addition to reduce the ph and improve ammonia rejection pronk et al 2006 also investigated membrane separation of real urine however this study used nanofiltration membranes and the focus was on the rejection of pharmaceutical compounds this study also did not address water removal potential no studies have investigated urine stabilized specifically with ca oh 2 or citric acid and high water removals 60 using ro systems importantly the method of stabilization will also impact feed osmotic pressure ph and membrane permeability if scaling occurs it is therefore important to consider membrane flux in conjunction with ion rejection the main aim of this work was therefore to determine the preferred stabilization method acidification or alkalinization to concentrate human urine using a swro for maximum nutrient recovery specifically the work aimed to investigate using synthetic urine whether air bubbling nahco3 or nh4hco3 addition are effective pre treatment ro methods for ca oh 2 stabilized urine based on flux and ion rejection determine a preferred pre treatment ro method and compare the results to synthetic urine stabilized with citric acid investigate which stabilization method alkalinization or acidification gives the highest nutrient recoveries and how the stabilization method affects flux ion rejection and scaling fouling for real urine 2 materials and methods 2 1 real and synthetic urine to ensure consistency between certain experiments synthetic urine was used as the composition could be kept constant unlike with real urine where the composition varies the recipe for fresh synthetic urine was determined based on concentrations of ions measured in real urine and composed using salts recommended by pronk et al 2006 see table s1 in the supplementary information for a detailed synthetic urine recipe real and synthetic urine was stabilized with either 10 g l 1 ca oh 2 randall et al 2016 or 7 8 g l 1 citric acid the amount required to reach a ph of 3 5 at which bacterial inactivation would occur rektorschek et al 1998 real urine was collected in waterless urinals flanagan and randall 2018 from at least 10 men and women working in the new engineering building at the university of cape town to ensure the urine composition for the real urine experiments was the same fresh urine was collected and then stabilized within 12 h with either ca oh 2 or citric acid a detailed description of the pre treatment methods for ca oh 2 stabilized urine as well as the compositions of the real urine are available in sections s1 2 and s1 3 of the supplementary information respectively table 1 summarizes the type of urine pre treatment and operating conditions used for each experiment synthetic urine was used to determine the effect of stabilization method and pre treatment on the key operating parameters volume reduction factor flux rejection scaling fouling the optimum pre treatment method for ca oh 2 stabilized urine and urine stabilized with citric acid was compared with real urine to obtain more realistic results and whether or not fouling occurred due to the presence of organics in the urine 2 2 membranes and equipment setup a dow filmtec sw30 membrane was used for all experiments a swro membrane was chosen as there is currently no available data on urea rejection characteristics of swro membranes in addition this membrane was used in a previous urine concentration study by ek et al 2006 the complete membrane filtration equipment consisted of a feed tank that was temperature controlled with a chiller hh 25 jeiotech south korea and water circulation the feed was circulated through a cross flow cf cell sepa cf sterlitech usa using a high pressure pump m 03s hydra cell minneapolis usa the cf cell housed the flat sheet membrane with an active area of 140 cm2 the brine flow rate was measured with a flow meter lzt 1002 g 1 7 l min 1 wet technologies strand south africa the permeate stream was collected and continuously weighed on a digital mass balance ps 8100 x 2 radwag poland to determine the permeate flux the pressure pt100r 13 lu2 h1131 turck germany temperature and conductivity mettler toledo usa and ph h1 5221 hanna johannesburg south africa of the permeate and brine was also continuously measured 2 3 experimental procedure a new flat sheet membrane was used for each experiment and pre soaked in de ionized water for at least 30 min before an experiment commenced before each experiment de ionized water was also circulated through the system at atmospheric pressure the pressure in the system was then slowly increased to the desired operating pressure and the de ionized water was circulated at 55 bar for 30 min for each experiment the starting volume was 5 l the start volume was chosen to ensure each experiment could be completed in one day and whilst in theory the solution could have been concentrated further the experiment was stopped at 60 water removal due to a minimum liquid volume 2 l in the feed tank being required to protect the pump for synthetic urine stabilized with ca oh 2 and real urine stabilized with citric acid the experiment was stopped at 50 water removal due to a significant decline in flux the feed flow rate was 6 4 l min 1 which corresponds to a tangential velocity of 0 58 m s 1 after each experiment the membrane was removed and dried the system was then flushed with tap water and cleaned with a dilute hcl solution 2 ph 3 to remove any potential scaling components in the system 2 4 analytical methods colorimetric methods were used to determine the concentration of urea nh4 po4 p mg2 ca2 so4 2 cl na and k where required this process was automated with a gallery discrete analyzer thermofisher scientific massachusetts the samples were diluted and the ph adjusted to between 7 and 8 to prevent ammonia volatilization where necessary all liquid samples were analyzed within 30 min of sampling to determine the presence of scaling the membrane surface was characterized by scanning electron microscope fei nova sem 230 fei usa equipped with an oxford x max energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds detector oxford instruments england in addition an elemental analysis was used to characterize the precipitate on the membrane surface using eds with the analysis carried out on the oxford inca software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of pre treatment methods for base stabilized synthetic urine urine stabilized with ca oh 2 is likely to cause significant membrane scaling if concentrated using ro three potential pre treatment methods air bubbling nahco3 addition or nh4hco3 addition were investigated to reduce the membrane scaling the urea and potassium rejection normalized permeate flux and permeate conductivity as a function of volume reduction factor vrf are shown in fig 1 phosphorus was precipitated during base stabilization and was therefore not detectable in the feed stream as expected with ca oh 2 stabilized urine without pre treatment there was an immediate steep decline in permeate flux fig 1c caused by membrane scaling this was confirmed visually as a white powder covering the active membrane surface and via sem and eds fig s6b the eds analysis detected no carbon present in the white powder and the ratio of calcium to oxygen suggests that the scaling component was ca oh 2 the rejection of urea and k were both poor and showed significant decline upon concentration fig 1a and b the concentration of other ions in the permeate was also significant resulting in high permeate conductivity that was similar to the initial feed conductivity at a vrf of 2 ray et al 2020 also investigated urea rejection at a ph 12 5 with a bwro membrane outside the designed membrane operating range 2 11 however their deviation in rejection was much smaller than observed in this study this may because they used naoh to raise the ph which would not have resulted in prolific scaling as with ca oh 2 because naoh is significantly more soluble comparing the three pre treatment options with regards to permeate flux fig 1c it is evident that all pre treatment methods equally reduced membrane scaling in order of increasing permeate conductivity and decreasing urea and k rejection air bubbling provided the highest rejection followed by nh4hco3 addition and then nahco3 addition as pre treatment methods urea rejection remained constant across all pre treatment methods with a maximum decline of 8 with increasing vrf at a vrf of 2 5 79 77 and 74 of the urea was recovered in the brine for the air nh4hco3 and nahco3 pre treated alkalinized urine respectively potassium rejection was greater than 95 and k recovery in the brine at a vrf of 2 5 was also greater than 95 in all cases for all pre treatment methods permeate conductivity increased with increasing vrf again indicating a decline in salt rejection with increasing water recovery in addition pre treatment with nahco3 resulted in a solution with a ph of approximately 11 85 which is above the upper membrane ph operating limit of 11 long term operation at high ph values can lead to a membrane swelling effect and increased passage of sodium ions franks et al 2009 and most likely urea as observed with the ca oh 2 stream and the higher conductivity of the nahco3 permeate whilst pre treatment with nh4hco3 results in the addition of nh4 ions which are more favorable than na ions with regards to fertilizers ammonia emissions should be considered as this has both safety and environmental implications skjøth et al 2008 at least 20 of the ammonia was lost through volatilization whilst all pre treatment methods provide adequate reduction in scaling the most suitable pre treatment method is air bubbling this process can be slow though courtney et al 2021 but it provides a high rejection of the key nutrients urea n and k does not add additional undesired ions such as sodium this method also does not pose any health and safety implications as with nh4hco3 dosing whilst simultaneously sequestering co2 from the atmosphere 3 2 comparison of acid and base stabilization for real and synthetic urine synthetic and real urine was stabilized with citric acid or ca oh 2 and then the base stabilized urine was pre treated with air bubbling the stabilized solutions were then concentrated to a vrf of 2 5 except for real urine stabilized with citric acid where the experiment was stopped at a vrf of 2 due to a significant flux decline the urea n p and k rejections and normalized permeate flux are shown in fig 2 with regards to ion rejection in all cases the rejection rates in acidified urine were higher than base stabilized urine interestingly there appears to be a correlation to urea rejection and feed ph section 2 8 in the supplementary information in addition rejection rates for real urine were higher than in synthetic urine this was also observed by pronk et al 2006 in a study that used nanofiltration to remove pharmaceuticals from real and synthetic urine this was hypothesized to be either due to the formation of a fouling layer which then acts as a secondary membrane schäfer et al 2002 or due to the organic matrix of the natural substances in urine uric oxalic and proteins boyce 1968 these matrices would increase compound size and therefore ion rejections whilst fouling was observed for the acidified urine fig s7 it was not observed for base stabilized urine fig s7 therefore the formation of a secondary membrane seems unlikely for both citric acid and air bubbling real urine urea rejection decreased by less than 0 5 up to a vrf of 2 this increased to 2 4 at a vrf of 2 5 for stabilized urine pre treated with air bubbling urea rejection was 90 7 for real acidified urine and 82 5 for real air bubbled urine vrf 2 5 high rejection of p for acidified urine 99 4 and k 98 was achieved for both stabilization methods with regards to flux the addition of citric acid to stabilize the urine results in an increase in osmotic pressure and therefore a smaller initial absolute flux fig s3 this may have implications with the extent of water recovery as the osmotic pressure increases the flux decline for both acidified real urine was steeper than for air bubbled real urine fig 2e visual inspection of the membranes showed the formation of visible brown fouling of the membrane for acidified urine analysis of the air bubbled real urine membrane surface via sem fig s7b showed minimal scaling with only a small number of organic solids present the presence of inorganic fig s7c and organic compounds fig s7d on the citric acid real urine treated membrane surface was higher organics are more soluble at higher ph values franks et al 2009 which could explain why organic fouling was observed with the acidified urine but not with base stabilized urine 3 3 formation of solid components during acid stabilization and further concentration base stabilized urine was dosed with ca oh 2 in excess which resulted in a solid mixture of calcium phosphate magnesium hydroxide and undissolved ca oh 2 the solid mixture was allowed to settle before filtration filtration filter pore size of 1 2 µm of the supernatant of this mixture resulted in minimal blocking of the filter paper however filtering a well mixed solution caused significant blocking of the filter paper as expected during the stabilization of real urine with citric acid the formation of red crystals was observed as with the base stabilized urine the solids in the acid stabilized urine were also allowed to settle before filtration however in this case when filtering the supernatant the filter paper was still quickly blocked filtration of the settled crystals also caused significant blocking of the filter paper fig s8 in the supplementary information shows all four filter papers after filtration the red crystals were identified as uric acid dihydrate fig s9 uric acid compounds have a decreasing solubility with decreasing ph wang and königsberger 1998 and would explain their formation in the acidified but not in basic urine furthermore many other compounds can form from acidified urine as typical kidney stones which would also lead to membrane scaling during ro concentration frassetto and kohlstadt 2011 both ek et al 2006 and ray et al 2020 investigated the ro of acidified urine however those studies were conducted at ph values of 6 and 5 respectively which may not have been low enough to cause precipitation of undesired compounds alternatively lack of solids formation may be due to differences in urine composition as well during the concentration of real urine with ro that had been stabilized with citric acid a dark red brown substance began to form on the walls of the feed tank visual inspection of the ro membrane at the end of the experiment also showed visible formation of a brown scaling fouling on the membrane surface and this was confirmed by the observed flux decline fig 2e whilst analysis of the membrane surface and the brown substance from the tank wall via eds could not confirm what the compound was there was a high weight percent of carbon c and oxygen o which suggest that it is an organic substance the molar ratio of c o of the substance on the membrane and tank walls was also the same which confirms that this is likely the same compound that forms as the acidified urine is concentrated by ro it is also expected that during long term operation of an ro system to concentrate stabilized urine treated with citric acid significant biological growth will occur because of the addition of an extra carbon source for acid tolerant bacteria this would lead to excessive bio fouling of the ro membrane these results have implications for the treatment and concentration of human urine using ro it implies that ro should ideally not be used to concentrate acidified urine because these components cannot be easily removed as with base stabilized urine by air bubbling or chemical addition de supersaturation of the major precipitating cation or anion furthermore the ph of the acidified urine cannot be further decreased as with base stabilized urine since this will be outside the lower recommended ph operating range of the membranes it is recommended that dehydration by evaporation be used instead to concentrate acidified urine as the process does not entail membranes and subsequent issues with scaling and bio fouling 3 4 nutrient recovery during concentration using reverse osmosis in terms of nutrient recovery fig 3 compares the overall npk recovery from acid and base stabilized real urine after 50 water removal by ro the shaded region for n recovery represents the portion of n recovered as total ammoniacal nitrogen tan during base stabilization 99 8 of the p is precipitated as calcium phosphate and recovered as a solid this has been shown to be an effective solid calcium phosphate based fertilizer meyer et al 2018 after air bubbling and concentration vrf 2 using ro 86 1 of the n urea tan 9 45 g n l 1 and 99 2 of the k 2 83 g l 1 is recovered in the brine stream concentration of acid stabilized urine results in a recovery 99 9 of the p 0 88 g l 1 99 6 of the k 2 86 g l 1 and 93 7 of the n urea tan 10 73 g l 1 final concentrations will vary based on the initial urine compositions though urea recovery in acidified urine was only slightly higher than for basic urine 89 2 vs 93 6 however the tan recovery in acidified urine is much higher 97 4 vs 18 6 this is due to ammonia stripping during the air bubbling pre treatment as well as poor rejection of tan in ro because the solution ph favored the formation of nh3 over nh4 ions which is easier to reject a detailed mass balance for both the acidified and base stabilized urine can be found in section s2 4 in the supplementary information whilst acidification results in a higher recovery of nutrients the associated issues with observed membrane fouling are problematic and would likely increase during long term operation therefore base stabilized urine pre treated with air bubbling was determined to be the preferred urine concentration method 3 5 other considerations 3 5 1 salinity implications in fertilizer products whilst urine contains the key nutrients of inorganic fertilizers n p and k it also contains other salts salinity that could be concentrated in the brine stream of an ro process salinity can affect soil structure and plant growth friedler et al 2013 and therefore may impact the effectiveness of using an ro brine stream as a liquid fertilizer to ensure optimum plant growth application rates should be varied based on crop sensitivity to salinity mnkeni et al 2008 and irrigation and soil drainage should be considered guizani et al 2016 it is possible for salts to be flushed during rainfall and irrigation guizani et al 2016 but fertilizer application would need to be monitored in arid regions and soils with poor drainage hydrolyzed urine has been previously applied as a fertilizer for beetroots salt tolerant and carrots salt sensitive and yields peaked at an application rate of 800 kg n ha 1 for the beetroots compared to 50 kg n ha 1 for the carrots mnkeni et al 2008 it is important to note that in the work of mnkeni et al 2008 the ratio of na n in the fertilizer was 1 2 whilst in this study the concentrated brine 60 water removal was lower na n ratio of 0 42 this is because the urine was stabilized and therefore there was significantly less n losses due to urea hydrolysis and ammonia volatilization therefore in theory at a similar application rate of n significantly less salinity would be added 3 5 2 pharmaceuticals and pathogens urine is not necessarily sterile hilt et al 2014 and pathogens can be present from urinary tract infections ferreira et al 2010 furthermore up to 64 27 of any pharmaceutical activated compounds phac consumed are excreted in urine lienert et al 2007 nanofiltration has shown a high rejection of pathogens patterson et al 2012 and phacs pronk et al 2006 and any micropollutants present in the urine will be concentrated in the brine stream therefore if the concentrated urine is to be used as a high quality fertilizer additional treatment will be required to remove any micropollutants urine stabilized with ca oh 2 will have a high ph 12 in which many pathogens are inactivated senecal et al 2018 whilst granular activated carbon gac has been shown to be effective at removing micropollutants köpping et al 2020 from nitrified urine urea is also absorbed by gac and therefore would not be suitable for acid or base stabilized urine where the aim is to concentrate urea as in this current study advanced oxidation processes uv ozone hydrogen peroxide or a combination have shown promise at removing phacs from urine zhang et al 2015 however these processes do not degrade the urea and therefore could be an effective pretreatment method for acid or base stabilized urine electrolysis of fresh urine clark et al 2021 and hydrodynamic cavitation thanekar et al 2018 have also shown to be effective at degrading phacs however because these techniques are not absorption processes like with gac the phacs are only broken down into other compounds and hence would still be present in the brine stream the exact influence of this on the quality of the fertilizer product produced from stabilized urine would have to be further tested 3 5 3 further concentration and energy considerations this study only investigated concentrating stabilized urine up to 60 maximizing water removal is important to reduce the costs of transporting the final liquid fertilizer product maurer et al 2006 as urine has a tds concentration similar to seawater high osmotic pressure the water recovery may be limited as not to exceed pressure limits of the membrane to limit energy consumption or to limit salt and urea passage to the permeate due to concentration polarization dupont 2021 however new swro membranes have been developed to operate at pressures up to 120 bar dupont 2020 alternatively ro could be used in conjunction with other water removal technologies such as evaporation simha et al 2020b membrane distillation md volpin et al 2019 or freeze concentration randall and nathoo 2018 base stabilization of fresh urine followed by pre treatment with air bubbling was determined to be the most promising treatment train before ro to optimize nutrient recovery and operation whilst ek et al 2006 reported an energy requirement of 12 kwh m 3 80 water recovery vrf 5 to concentrate dilute urine the typical energy consumption for a full scale swro plant including pre and post treatment ranges from 4 to 6 kwh m 3 feed feria díaz et al 2021 courtney et al 2021 reported an energy requirement of 10 kwh m 3 for air bubbling as a pre treatment method of stabilized urine assuming 6 kwh m 3 for ro the air bubbling would therefore account for two thirds of the process s energy requirements this is not unusual as aeration at wastewater treatment plants can account for up to 50 of total energy consumption wilsenach and van loosdrecht 2004 converting to a per kg n basis see supplementary information for conversion factors the combined air bubbling and ro process would require 11 5 mj kg n 1 this energy requirement is significantly less than those reported by patyk and reinhardt 1997 and maurer et al 2003 for the production of synthetic urea and treatment of n in domestic wastewater respectively table 2 compares the water removal npk recovery and energy consumption of ro to other concentration technologies whilst alkaline dehydration provides high water removal and npk recoveries at an operating temperature range of 50 60 c the energy requirements are 6 5 times greater than ro even with energy recovery nitrification and distillation also provides high npk relative to the starting concentration and water removal recoveries udert and wächter 2012 however it should be noted that the percentage of n recovery does not account for n losses due to urea hydrolysis and p losses due to solids precipitation during storage and transportation of fresh urine in the piping systems in a 12 h storage period udert et al 2003 observed urea losses of 11 24 due to hydrolysis in addition approximately 30 of p will spontaneously precipitate as struvite barbosa et al 2016 if urine hydrolyzes whilst energy recovery could be used for both dehydration and nitrification distillation udert and wächter 2012 proposed that ro could be used in conjunction to reduce energy requirements a hybrid forward osmosis membrane distillation fo md process could also be used however whilst the energy requirements for fo are low the thermal energy requirements which drive the hybrid separation process using md are higher than ro reverse osmosis is also the standard membrane process used globally and works well at different scales greenlee et al 2009 each concentration method has various pros and cons but they also produce diverse products with different energy requirements 4 conclusions we have shown that pre treatment of base ca oh 2 stabilized urine with air bubbling nahco3 addition or nh4hco3 addition are all sufficient methods to reduce the potential for ro membrane scaling however air bubbling was determined to be the preferred pre treatment method as it added no additional ions to the solution resulted in a feed ph of 8 0 8 5 which is within the operating range of most commercial ro membranes and achieved high nutrient recoveries in the brine stream acidified urine resulted in a higher recovery of key npk nutrients but the permeate flux was lower due to increased feed osmotic pressure from the acid addition and significant scaling on the ro membrane the results from this work showed that ro should not ideally be used to concentrate acidified urine because the acidification of fresh urine could result in the formation of uric acid dihydrate crystals and further concentration results in the formation of an unidentified organic compound neither of these could be removed by filtration or air bubbling as with base stabilized urine therefore concentrating acidified urine would be best achieved using an evaporation process in this study 60 of the water was removed from pre treated base stabilized urine using ro producing a liquid concentrate with 11 2 g n l 1 and 3 66 g k l 1 and a separate solid phosphate based fertilizer the process recovered approximately 86 of the urea and 99 of the potassium in the ro brine stream and more than 99 of the phosphorus in a solid fertilizer this research also highlights the importance of using real urine to validate results had only synthetic urine been used the formation of uric acid dihydrate crystals and the organic foulant would not have been identified in addition rejection of urea differed significantly for real and synthetic urine the use of synthetic urine to allow for consistency and repeatability is valuable however real urine should always be used when designing different treatment processes it is recommended that the integrated urine concentration process be tested at a pilot scale and that higher water recoveries 60 be investigated in addition a detailed economic analysis of the process and products produced should also be conducted along with crop field trials of the fertilizers produced declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work would not have been possible without the financial

16442,human urine can be used as a fertilizer however due to the high water content 97 concentration is required to make transportation economically feasible reverse osmosis ro has been identified as an energy efficient concentration method furthermore to maximize nitrogen recovery from source separated urine it should be stabilized with an acid or base to prevent urea hydrolysis however the method of stabilization will have an impact on the downstream ro process calcium hydroxide is often used as a base stabilization method for human urine but would require pre treatment to remove excess calcium and subsequent membrane scaling three pre treatment methods such as air bubbling nahco3 addition and nh4hco3 addition were investigated in this study each method successfully reduced the scaling potential and air bubbling was determined to be the most effective method as it resulted in the highest nutrient recovery during concentration and did not require the addition of any chemicals base stabilization with air bubbling pre treatment was then compared to urine stabilized with citric acid acid stabilized urine had a higher nitrogen recovery 7 6 higher however solids formed in the real acidified urine and during concentration a brown organic compound formed on the membrane surface the crystals were identified as uric acid dihydrate and the brown organic fouling resulted in a significant decrease in permeate flux as compared to the base stabilized urine with air bubbling pre treatment at a 60 water recovery 85 5 of the urea and 99 2 of the potassium was recovered in the brine stream and more than 99 9 of the phosphorus was recovered as a separate solid calcium phosphate fertilizer whilst nutrient recovery was higher with acid stabilization the membrane fouling that occurred with this stabilization method meant that base stabilization with air bubbling pre treatment was the preferred treatment option it is recommended that acid stabilized urine be concentrated using evaporation processes instead graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords air bubbling acidification fertilizers phosphorus source separation fouling 1 introduction urine is rich in three key components required for inorganic fertilizer production nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k when fresh about 85 of the n in urine is present as urea putnam 1971 a key fertilizer urea is produced synthetically at high temperatures and pressures meessen 2014 from ammonia and requires substantial energy 54 mj kg n 1 patyk and reinhardt 1997 furthermore limited reserves of phosphate rock are the main source of p used in fertilizers cordell 2013 the mining of which has significant environmental impacts hakkou et al 2016 in addition urine contributes the majority of n and p 81 and 56 respectively but only 1 the volume of domestic wastewaters höglund 2001 source separation and resource recovery from urine therefore has the potential to provide a more sustainable source of p whilst simultaneously reducing the energy load of traditional wastewater treatment plants kjerstadius et al 2017 it is common to apply urine directly to land as a fertilizer in rural communities udert and wächter 2012 however as urine is 97 water the cost of large scale collection and transportation from urban areas to agricultural land would not always be economical chipako and randall 2020 this has led to the investigation of a variety of methods of varying complexity to concentrate urine including evaporation simha et al 2020a udert and wächter 2012 freeze concentration lind et al 2001 randall and nathoo 2018 electrodialysis pronk et al 2006 membrane distillation zhao et al 2013 and forward osmosis ray et al 2019 volpin et al 2019 reverse osmosis ro has also been identified as a promising yet understudied concentration technique because it is energy efficient when compared to other concentration methods udert and wächter 2012 reverse osmosis is also used widely to desalinate seawater greenlee et al 2009 and urine has a similar total dissolved solids tds concentration 30 40 g l 1 to that of seawater whilst ro has been investigated for a wide range of wastewater streams the research on concentrating human urine using ro has been predominately limited to hydrolyzed urine ek et al 2006 that is urine where all the urea has degraded to ammonium and carbonate ions however significant nitrogen can be lost from hydrolyzed urine because of ammonia volatilization to maximize nitrogen recovery urine should be stabilized to prevent urea hydrolysis enzymatic urea hydrolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme urease callahan et al 2005 which is commonly produced by bacteria found in the urinary tract mclean et al 1988 and the environment acidification ray et al 2018 and alkalinization randall et al 2016 are methods that have both been shown to be effective for stabilizing human urine citric acid ray et al 2018 and calcium hydroxide randall et al 2016 were identified as promising options for urine stabilization as they are both solids and could be pre dosed and therefore would not require expensive dosing equipment and pumps however each stabilization method has pros and cons that will affect the operation of an ro system and whether pre treatment is required urine stabilization with ca oh 2 results in the precipitation of sparingly soluble salts such as calcium phosphate and magnesium hydroxide flanagan and randall 2018 these solids can be removed by filtration thus potentially reducing ro membrane scaling however the filtrate will be saturated with ca oh 2 which will precipitate during ro concentration or form caco3 due to reactions with co2 in the air pradhan et al 2017 thus resulting in ro membrane scaling calcium carbonate is the most problematic scaling compound for ro systems greenlee et al 2009 and pre treatment will be required to ensure efficient membrane operation air bubbling courtney et al 2021 and bicarbonate ion addition courtney and randall 2021 have both been shown to be appropriate pre treatment methods to remove excess calcium from urine stabilized with ca oh 2 however their effectivity in preventing ro membrane scaling has not yet been tested during the concentration of stabilized urine the treated solutions will also have varying ph values approximately 8 5 after air bubbling 9 5 after nh4hco3 addition and 12 after nahco3 addition which may also influence the ion rejection through the ro membranes stabilizing urine by acidification would in theory not require a pre treatment and all ions would remain in solution therefore all npk nutrients could be theoretically recovered in the brine during acidification stabilization unlike with base stabilization where p is removed via filtration as solid calcium phosphate the chosen stabilization method will also affect the osmotic pressure of the feed stream which will influence the permeate flux and the potential volume reduction the key factors affecting the operation of an ro system are ion rejection permeate flux and scaling fouling recovery of p and k in the brine is not challenging as these species generally have high rejections 98 by ro membranes ek et al 2006 however the rejection of urea is more challenging as it is a small uncharged particle and is therefore difficult to remove by size and charge exclusion yoon and lueptow 2005 rejection of urea from wastewater has shown to vary between 19 and 74 for various low pressure ro membranes 27 bar lee and lueptow 2001 ray et al 2020 yoon and lueptow 2005 however there is currently no known literature available on the rejection of urea using seawater ro swro membranes which operates at higher pressures 55 bar compared to 27 bar in addition the above studies were conducted with dead end stirred cells desc which do not accurately mimic the cross flow that occurs in commercial ro nf systems to our best knowledge only two ro studies with real urine have been conducted ray et al 2020 investigated urea rejection with brackish water ro membranes operating pressure of 27 bar using real urine stabilized with naoh 50 ph 12 5 and acetic acid 62 ph 5 this study used a desc system and a low water recovery of 8 no indication of how the rejection of different salts and urea would be affected as the feed concentration increases was given as this was not the objective of this study secondly no permeate flux data was presented therefore it is not possible to draw conclusions on whether any scaling or fouling occurred or what possible volume reductions are achievable this is critical for the design of full scale ro processes for higher water removals ek et al 2006 achieved an 80 water removal using a swro membrane however this study was conducted using dilute and hydrolyzed urine with h2so4 addition to reduce the ph and improve ammonia rejection pronk et al 2006 also investigated membrane separation of real urine however this study used nanofiltration membranes and the focus was on the rejection of pharmaceutical compounds this study also did not address water removal potential no studies have investigated urine stabilized specifically with ca oh 2 or citric acid and high water removals 60 using ro systems importantly the method of stabilization will also impact feed osmotic pressure ph and membrane permeability if scaling occurs it is therefore important to consider membrane flux in conjunction with ion rejection the main aim of this work was therefore to determine the preferred stabilization method acidification or alkalinization to concentrate human urine using a swro for maximum nutrient recovery specifically the work aimed to investigate using synthetic urine whether air bubbling nahco3 or nh4hco3 addition are effective pre treatment ro methods for ca oh 2 stabilized urine based on flux and ion rejection determine a preferred pre treatment ro method and compare the results to synthetic urine stabilized with citric acid investigate which stabilization method alkalinization or acidification gives the highest nutrient recoveries and how the stabilization method affects flux ion rejection and scaling fouling for real urine 2 materials and methods 2 1 real and synthetic urine to ensure consistency between certain experiments synthetic urine was used as the composition could be kept constant unlike with real urine where the composition varies the recipe for fresh synthetic urine was determined based on concentrations of ions measured in real urine and composed using salts recommended by pronk et al 2006 see table s1 in the supplementary information for a detailed synthetic urine recipe real and synthetic urine was stabilized with either 10 g l 1 ca oh 2 randall et al 2016 or 7 8 g l 1 citric acid the amount required to reach a ph of 3 5 at which bacterial inactivation would occur rektorschek et al 1998 real urine was collected in waterless urinals flanagan and randall 2018 from at least 10 men and women working in the new engineering building at the university of cape town to ensure the urine composition for the real urine experiments was the same fresh urine was collected and then stabilized within 12 h with either ca oh 2 or citric acid a detailed description of the pre treatment methods for ca oh 2 stabilized urine as well as the compositions of the real urine are available in sections s1 2 and s1 3 of the supplementary information respectively table 1 summarizes the type of urine pre treatment and operating conditions used for each experiment synthetic urine was used to determine the effect of stabilization method and pre treatment on the key operating parameters volume reduction factor flux rejection scaling fouling the optimum pre treatment method for ca oh 2 stabilized urine and urine stabilized with citric acid was compared with real urine to obtain more realistic results and whether or not fouling occurred due to the presence of organics in the urine 2 2 membranes and equipment setup a dow filmtec sw30 membrane was used for all experiments a swro membrane was chosen as there is currently no available data on urea rejection characteristics of swro membranes in addition this membrane was used in a previous urine concentration study by ek et al 2006 the complete membrane filtration equipment consisted of a feed tank that was temperature controlled with a chiller hh 25 jeiotech south korea and water circulation the feed was circulated through a cross flow cf cell sepa cf sterlitech usa using a high pressure pump m 03s hydra cell minneapolis usa the cf cell housed the flat sheet membrane with an active area of 140 cm2 the brine flow rate was measured with a flow meter lzt 1002 g 1 7 l min 1 wet technologies strand south africa the permeate stream was collected and continuously weighed on a digital mass balance ps 8100 x 2 radwag poland to determine the permeate flux the pressure pt100r 13 lu2 h1131 turck germany temperature and conductivity mettler toledo usa and ph h1 5221 hanna johannesburg south africa of the permeate and brine was also continuously measured 2 3 experimental procedure a new flat sheet membrane was used for each experiment and pre soaked in de ionized water for at least 30 min before an experiment commenced before each experiment de ionized water was also circulated through the system at atmospheric pressure the pressure in the system was then slowly increased to the desired operating pressure and the de ionized water was circulated at 55 bar for 30 min for each experiment the starting volume was 5 l the start volume was chosen to ensure each experiment could be completed in one day and whilst in theory the solution could have been concentrated further the experiment was stopped at 60 water removal due to a minimum liquid volume 2 l in the feed tank being required to protect the pump for synthetic urine stabilized with ca oh 2 and real urine stabilized with citric acid the experiment was stopped at 50 water removal due to a significant decline in flux the feed flow rate was 6 4 l min 1 which corresponds to a tangential velocity of 0 58 m s 1 after each experiment the membrane was removed and dried the system was then flushed with tap water and cleaned with a dilute hcl solution 2 ph 3 to remove any potential scaling components in the system 2 4 analytical methods colorimetric methods were used to determine the concentration of urea nh4 po4 p mg2 ca2 so4 2 cl na and k where required this process was automated with a gallery discrete analyzer thermofisher scientific massachusetts the samples were diluted and the ph adjusted to between 7 and 8 to prevent ammonia volatilization where necessary all liquid samples were analyzed within 30 min of sampling to determine the presence of scaling the membrane surface was characterized by scanning electron microscope fei nova sem 230 fei usa equipped with an oxford x max energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds detector oxford instruments england in addition an elemental analysis was used to characterize the precipitate on the membrane surface using eds with the analysis carried out on the oxford inca software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of pre treatment methods for base stabilized synthetic urine urine stabilized with ca oh 2 is likely to cause significant membrane scaling if concentrated using ro three potential pre treatment methods air bubbling nahco3 addition or nh4hco3 addition were investigated to reduce the membrane scaling the urea and potassium rejection normalized permeate flux and permeate conductivity as a function of volume reduction factor vrf are shown in fig 1 phosphorus was precipitated during base stabilization and was therefore not detectable in the feed stream as expected with ca oh 2 stabilized urine without pre treatment there was an immediate steep decline in permeate flux fig 1c caused by membrane scaling this was confirmed visually as a white powder covering the active membrane surface and via sem and eds fig s6b the eds analysis detected no carbon present in the white powder and the ratio of calcium to oxygen suggests that the scaling component was ca oh 2 the rejection of urea and k were both poor and showed significant decline upon concentration fig 1a and b the concentration of other ions in the permeate was also significant resulting in high permeate conductivity that was similar to the initial feed conductivity at a vrf of 2 ray et al 2020 also investigated urea rejection at a ph 12 5 with a bwro membrane outside the designed membrane operating range 2 11 however their deviation in rejection was much smaller than observed in this study this may because they used naoh to raise the ph which would not have resulted in prolific scaling as with ca oh 2 because naoh is significantly more soluble comparing the three pre treatment options with regards to permeate flux fig 1c it is evident that all pre treatment methods equally reduced membrane scaling in order of increasing permeate conductivity and decreasing urea and k rejection air bubbling provided the highest rejection followed by nh4hco3 addition and then nahco3 addition as pre treatment methods urea rejection remained constant across all pre treatment methods with a maximum decline of 8 with increasing vrf at a vrf of 2 5 79 77 and 74 of the urea was recovered in the brine for the air nh4hco3 and nahco3 pre treated alkalinized urine respectively potassium rejection was greater than 95 and k recovery in the brine at a vrf of 2 5 was also greater than 95 in all cases for all pre treatment methods permeate conductivity increased with increasing vrf again indicating a decline in salt rejection with increasing water recovery in addition pre treatment with nahco3 resulted in a solution with a ph of approximately 11 85 which is above the upper membrane ph operating limit of 11 long term operation at high ph values can lead to a membrane swelling effect and increased passage of sodium ions franks et al 2009 and most likely urea as observed with the ca oh 2 stream and the higher conductivity of the nahco3 permeate whilst pre treatment with nh4hco3 results in the addition of nh4 ions which are more favorable than na ions with regards to fertilizers ammonia emissions should be considered as this has both safety and environmental implications skjøth et al 2008 at least 20 of the ammonia was lost through volatilization whilst all pre treatment methods provide adequate reduction in scaling the most suitable pre treatment method is air bubbling this process can be slow though courtney et al 2021 but it provides a high rejection of the key nutrients urea n and k does not add additional undesired ions such as sodium this method also does not pose any health and safety implications as with nh4hco3 dosing whilst simultaneously sequestering co2 from the atmosphere 3 2 comparison of acid and base stabilization for real and synthetic urine synthetic and real urine was stabilized with citric acid or ca oh 2 and then the base stabilized urine was pre treated with air bubbling the stabilized solutions were then concentrated to a vrf of 2 5 except for real urine stabilized with citric acid where the experiment was stopped at a vrf of 2 due to a significant flux decline the urea n p and k rejections and normalized permeate flux are shown in fig 2 with regards to ion rejection in all cases the rejection rates in acidified urine were higher than base stabilized urine interestingly there appears to be a correlation to urea rejection and feed ph section 2 8 in the supplementary information in addition rejection rates for real urine were higher than in synthetic urine this was also observed by pronk et al 2006 in a study that used nanofiltration to remove pharmaceuticals from real and synthetic urine this was hypothesized to be either due to the formation of a fouling layer which then acts as a secondary membrane schäfer et al 2002 or due to the organic matrix of the natural substances in urine uric oxalic and proteins boyce 1968 these matrices would increase compound size and therefore ion rejections whilst fouling was observed for the acidified urine fig s7 it was not observed for base stabilized urine fig s7 therefore the formation of a secondary membrane seems unlikely for both citric acid and air bubbling real urine urea rejection decreased by less than 0 5 up to a vrf of 2 this increased to 2 4 at a vrf of 2 5 for stabilized urine pre treated with air bubbling urea rejection was 90 7 for real acidified urine and 82 5 for real air bubbled urine vrf 2 5 high rejection of p for acidified urine 99 4 and k 98 was achieved for both stabilization methods with regards to flux the addition of citric acid to stabilize the urine results in an increase in osmotic pressure and therefore a smaller initial absolute flux fig s3 this may have implications with the extent of water recovery as the osmotic pressure increases the flux decline for both acidified real urine was steeper than for air bubbled real urine fig 2e visual inspection of the membranes showed the formation of visible brown fouling of the membrane for acidified urine analysis of the air bubbled real urine membrane surface via sem fig s7b showed minimal scaling with only a small number of organic solids present the presence of inorganic fig s7c and organic compounds fig s7d on the citric acid real urine treated membrane surface was higher organics are more soluble at higher ph values franks et al 2009 which could explain why organic fouling was observed with the acidified urine but not with base stabilized urine 3 3 formation of solid components during acid stabilization and further concentration base stabilized urine was dosed with ca oh 2 in excess which resulted in a solid mixture of calcium phosphate magnesium hydroxide and undissolved ca oh 2 the solid mixture was allowed to settle before filtration filtration filter pore size of 1 2 µm of the supernatant of this mixture resulted in minimal blocking of the filter paper however filtering a well mixed solution caused significant blocking of the filter paper as expected during the stabilization of real urine with citric acid the formation of red crystals was observed as with the base stabilized urine the solids in the acid stabilized urine were also allowed to settle before filtration however in this case when filtering the supernatant the filter paper was still quickly blocked filtration of the settled crystals also caused significant blocking of the filter paper fig s8 in the supplementary information shows all four filter papers after filtration the red crystals were identified as uric acid dihydrate fig s9 uric acid compounds have a decreasing solubility with decreasing ph wang and königsberger 1998 and would explain their formation in the acidified but not in basic urine furthermore many other compounds can form from acidified urine as typical kidney stones which would also lead to membrane scaling during ro concentration frassetto and kohlstadt 2011 both ek et al 2006 and ray et al 2020 investigated the ro of acidified urine however those studies were conducted at ph values of 6 and 5 respectively which may not have been low enough to cause precipitation of undesired compounds alternatively lack of solids formation may be due to differences in urine composition as well during the concentration of real urine with ro that had been stabilized with citric acid a dark red brown substance began to form on the walls of the feed tank visual inspection of the ro membrane at the end of the experiment also showed visible formation of a brown scaling fouling on the membrane surface and this was confirmed by the observed flux decline fig 2e whilst analysis of the membrane surface and the brown substance from the tank wall via eds could not confirm what the compound was there was a high weight percent of carbon c and oxygen o which suggest that it is an organic substance the molar ratio of c o of the substance on the membrane and tank walls was also the same which confirms that this is likely the same compound that forms as the acidified urine is concentrated by ro it is also expected that during long term operation of an ro system to concentrate stabilized urine treated with citric acid significant biological growth will occur because of the addition of an extra carbon source for acid tolerant bacteria this would lead to excessive bio fouling of the ro membrane these results have implications for the treatment and concentration of human urine using ro it implies that ro should ideally not be used to concentrate acidified urine because these components cannot be easily removed as with base stabilized urine by air bubbling or chemical addition de supersaturation of the major precipitating cation or anion furthermore the ph of the acidified urine cannot be further decreased as with base stabilized urine since this will be outside the lower recommended ph operating range of the membranes it is recommended that dehydration by evaporation be used instead to concentrate acidified urine as the process does not entail membranes and subsequent issues with scaling and bio fouling 3 4 nutrient recovery during concentration using reverse osmosis in terms of nutrient recovery fig 3 compares the overall npk recovery from acid and base stabilized real urine after 50 water removal by ro the shaded region for n recovery represents the portion of n recovered as total ammoniacal nitrogen tan during base stabilization 99 8 of the p is precipitated as calcium phosphate and recovered as a solid this has been shown to be an effective solid calcium phosphate based fertilizer meyer et al 2018 after air bubbling and concentration vrf 2 using ro 86 1 of the n urea tan 9 45 g n l 1 and 99 2 of the k 2 83 g l 1 is recovered in the brine stream concentration of acid stabilized urine results in a recovery 99 9 of the p 0 88 g l 1 99 6 of the k 2 86 g l 1 and 93 7 of the n urea tan 10 73 g l 1 final concentrations will vary based on the initial urine compositions though urea recovery in acidified urine was only slightly higher than for basic urine 89 2 vs 93 6 however the tan recovery in acidified urine is much higher 97 4 vs 18 6 this is due to ammonia stripping during the air bubbling pre treatment as well as poor rejection of tan in ro because the solution ph favored the formation of nh3 over nh4 ions which is easier to reject a detailed mass balance for both the acidified and base stabilized urine can be found in section s2 4 in the supplementary information whilst acidification results in a higher recovery of nutrients the associated issues with observed membrane fouling are problematic and would likely increase during long term operation therefore base stabilized urine pre treated with air bubbling was determined to be the preferred urine concentration method 3 5 other considerations 3 5 1 salinity implications in fertilizer products whilst urine contains the key nutrients of inorganic fertilizers n p and k it also contains other salts salinity that could be concentrated in the brine stream of an ro process salinity can affect soil structure and plant growth friedler et al 2013 and therefore may impact the effectiveness of using an ro brine stream as a liquid fertilizer to ensure optimum plant growth application rates should be varied based on crop sensitivity to salinity mnkeni et al 2008 and irrigation and soil drainage should be considered guizani et al 2016 it is possible for salts to be flushed during rainfall and irrigation guizani et al 2016 but fertilizer application would need to be monitored in arid regions and soils with poor drainage hydrolyzed urine has been previously applied as a fertilizer for beetroots salt tolerant and carrots salt sensitive and yields peaked at an application rate of 800 kg n ha 1 for the beetroots compared to 50 kg n ha 1 for the carrots mnkeni et al 2008 it is important to note that in the work of mnkeni et al 2008 the ratio of na n in the fertilizer was 1 2 whilst in this study the concentrated brine 60 water removal was lower na n ratio of 0 42 this is because the urine was stabilized and therefore there was significantly less n losses due to urea hydrolysis and ammonia volatilization therefore in theory at a similar application rate of n significantly less salinity would be added 3 5 2 pharmaceuticals and pathogens urine is not necessarily sterile hilt et al 2014 and pathogens can be present from urinary tract infections ferreira et al 2010 furthermore up to 64 27 of any pharmaceutical activated compounds phac consumed are excreted in urine lienert et al 2007 nanofiltration has shown a high rejection of pathogens patterson et al 2012 and phacs pronk et al 2006 and any micropollutants present in the urine will be concentrated in the brine stream therefore if the concentrated urine is to be used as a high quality fertilizer additional treatment will be required to remove any micropollutants urine stabilized with ca oh 2 will have a high ph 12 in which many pathogens are inactivated senecal et al 2018 whilst granular activated carbon gac has been shown to be effective at removing micropollutants köpping et al 2020 from nitrified urine urea is also absorbed by gac and therefore would not be suitable for acid or base stabilized urine where the aim is to concentrate urea as in this current study advanced oxidation processes uv ozone hydrogen peroxide or a combination have shown promise at removing phacs from urine zhang et al 2015 however these processes do not degrade the urea and therefore could be an effective pretreatment method for acid or base stabilized urine electrolysis of fresh urine clark et al 2021 and hydrodynamic cavitation thanekar et al 2018 have also shown to be effective at degrading phacs however because these techniques are not absorption processes like with gac the phacs are only broken down into other compounds and hence would still be present in the brine stream the exact influence of this on the quality of the fertilizer product produced from stabilized urine would have to be further tested 3 5 3 further concentration and energy considerations this study only investigated concentrating stabilized urine up to 60 maximizing water removal is important to reduce the costs of transporting the final liquid fertilizer product maurer et al 2006 as urine has a tds concentration similar to seawater high osmotic pressure the water recovery may be limited as not to exceed pressure limits of the membrane to limit energy consumption or to limit salt and urea passage to the permeate due to concentration polarization dupont 2021 however new swro membranes have been developed to operate at pressures up to 120 bar dupont 2020 alternatively ro could be used in conjunction with other water removal technologies such as evaporation simha et al 2020b membrane distillation md volpin et al 2019 or freeze concentration randall and nathoo 2018 base stabilization of fresh urine followed by pre treatment with air bubbling was determined to be the most promising treatment train before ro to optimize nutrient recovery and operation whilst ek et al 2006 reported an energy requirement of 12 kwh m 3 80 water recovery vrf 5 to concentrate dilute urine the typical energy consumption for a full scale swro plant including pre and post treatment ranges from 4 to 6 kwh m 3 feed feria díaz et al 2021 courtney et al 2021 reported an energy requirement of 10 kwh m 3 for air bubbling as a pre treatment method of stabilized urine assuming 6 kwh m 3 for ro the air bubbling would therefore account for two thirds of the process s energy requirements this is not unusual as aeration at wastewater treatment plants can account for up to 50 of total energy consumption wilsenach and van loosdrecht 2004 converting to a per kg n basis see supplementary information for conversion factors the combined air bubbling and ro process would require 11 5 mj kg n 1 this energy requirement is significantly less than those reported by patyk and reinhardt 1997 and maurer et al 2003 for the production of synthetic urea and treatment of n in domestic wastewater respectively table 2 compares the water removal npk recovery and energy consumption of ro to other concentration technologies whilst alkaline dehydration provides high water removal and npk recoveries at an operating temperature range of 50 60 c the energy requirements are 6 5 times greater than ro even with energy recovery nitrification and distillation also provides high npk relative to the starting concentration and water removal recoveries udert and wächter 2012 however it should be noted that the percentage of n recovery does not account for n losses due to urea hydrolysis and p losses due to solids precipitation during storage and transportation of fresh urine in the piping systems in a 12 h storage period udert et al 2003 observed urea losses of 11 24 due to hydrolysis in addition approximately 30 of p will spontaneously precipitate as struvite barbosa et al 2016 if urine hydrolyzes whilst energy recovery could be used for both dehydration and nitrification distillation udert and wächter 2012 proposed that ro could be used in conjunction to reduce energy requirements a hybrid forward osmosis membrane distillation fo md process could also be used however whilst the energy requirements for fo are low the thermal energy requirements which drive the hybrid separation process using md are higher than ro reverse osmosis is also the standard membrane process used globally and works well at different scales greenlee et al 2009 each concentration method has various pros and cons but they also produce diverse products with different energy requirements 4 conclusions we have shown that pre treatment of base ca oh 2 stabilized urine with air bubbling nahco3 addition or nh4hco3 addition are all sufficient methods to reduce the potential for ro membrane scaling however air bubbling was determined to be the preferred pre treatment method as it added no additional ions to the solution resulted in a feed ph of 8 0 8 5 which is within the operating range of most commercial ro membranes and achieved high nutrient recoveries in the brine stream acidified urine resulted in a higher recovery of key npk nutrients but the permeate flux was lower due to increased feed osmotic pressure from the acid addition and significant scaling on the ro membrane the results from this work showed that ro should not ideally be used to concentrate acidified urine because the acidification of fresh urine could result in the formation of uric acid dihydrate crystals and further concentration results in the formation of an unidentified organic compound neither of these could be removed by filtration or air bubbling as with base stabilized urine therefore concentrating acidified urine would be best achieved using an evaporation process in this study 60 of the water was removed from pre treated base stabilized urine using ro producing a liquid concentrate with 11 2 g n l 1 and 3 66 g k l 1 and a separate solid phosphate based fertilizer the process recovered approximately 86 of the urea and 99 of the potassium in the ro brine stream and more than 99 of the phosphorus in a solid fertilizer this research also highlights the importance of using real urine to validate results had only synthetic urine been used the formation of uric acid dihydrate crystals and the organic foulant would not have been identified in addition rejection of urea differed significantly for real and synthetic urine the use of synthetic urine to allow for consistency and repeatability is valuable however real urine should always be used when designing different treatment processes it is recommended that the integrated urine concentration process be tested at a pilot scale and that higher water recoveries 60 be investigated in addition a detailed economic analysis of the process and products produced should also be conducted along with crop field trials of the fertilizers produced declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work would not have been possible without the financial

economy of basin designs over 100 years of research has been devoted to elucidate clarification functionality and developing indices and models for basin design and regulation early studies have proposed semi empirical models based on data and physical indices from basins brune 1953 chen 1975 hazen 1904 heinemarm 1981 nix 1982 rausch and schreiber 1981 verstraeten and poesen 2000 in particular the model proposed by brune 1953 for pm separation or trap efficiency te based on capacity inflow ratio analogous to mean residence time rt was widely adopted later with the application of

in some cases with protected water bodies an additional 50 permanent pool volume and a minimum rt of 21 days are required st johns river water management district 2018 notwithstanding the widespread adoption of rt to index basin clarification the basis for rt from first principles to scale basin clarification is unclear and potentially not robust there is significant documentation to illustrate

et al 2018 verstraeten and poesen 2000 yet the rt index is agnostic to all of these input parameters therefore the robustness of rt to scale basin pm separation performance requires examination over a wide range of system geometrics pm granulometry and loading conditions this examination is critical from an economic perspective considering the significant basin land and construction cost hundreds of thousands to tens of millions usd as shown in fig s1 that result from current rt based regulation criteria such an effort was and remains a critical need as identified several decades ago and more recently beckingham et al 2019 verstraeten and poesen 2000 without a clear illustration of predictive capability or potential liability of rt criteria basin design will continue to be guided by potentially less robust methods or indices hindering the effort and progress towards economical basin design and sustainable urban water management on the order hand advanced basin design and regulation tools such as cfd while providing capability and accuracy do require that the stakeholder whether as industry planning management or regulatory to have or redevelop knowledge and skills for such tools as compared to existing rt criteria the hesitancy to more frequently apply cfd has historically posed a challenge for wider implementation and regulatory acceptance of cfd for urban water systems despite the existence of decades of practice based implementation in chemical mechanical and aeronautical engineering indeed liu et al 2020 concludes that cfd is deployed to a lesser extent by civil and environmental professionals such a lack of deployment and demand for cfd may also be responsible for the previously illustrated gap between research and empirically based engineering practice for basin design retrofits and regulation to reduce such a gap and accelerate the translation of research outcomes to practice based planning and engineering a method is critically needed to leverage the robust predictive capability of cfd models while provides user friendly basin design experience implementable outcomes from cfd as provided by current digital tools e g spreadsheets are needed for basins as a sustainable and resilient urban water management unit artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml can potentially provide such a solution ml offers a wide range of techniques to analyze information identify patterns from data and has been applied to diverse disciplines such as image recognition language processing autonomous vehicles medicine real time flooding control bartos and kerkez 2021 kerkez et al 2016 mullapudi et al 2020 and new physics discoveries cranmer et al 2020 ml models such as artificial neural network ann are able to learn the multi dimensional and non linear correlations between input features and output labels from data as supervised learning brunton et al 2020 steven l brunton 2019 in this respect ml models can be similarly developed to approximate the mapping relation between basin geometric parameters features and basin clarification or water chemistry functionality labels for example based on the higher fidelity cfd simulations of pm transport and fate compared with the empirical and lumped models such trained ml models preserve the dependence of pm separation to detailed system geometrics loading condition and pm granulometry compared with the higher fidelity cfd models trained ml models obviate the time consuming cfd computation and facilitate a simple and efficient examination of basin geometrics retrofit of impaired basins and regulation for practical application this research enhances and extends the existing research of urban water clarification basin design and regulation by developing a cfd augmented ml model for pm separation a novel approach hybridizing cfd and ml models i e decision tree random forest ann and symbolic regression is proposed to facilitate robust and simple basin analysis and geometric design the objectives are 1 examine the system pm separation with a validated cfd model over a range of common design geometrics e g basin aspect ratio depth inlet and outlet locations pm characteristics pm density particle size distribution psd and loading condition e g mean wet season flowrate 2 examine the robustness of rt as an index to characterize and scale basin pm separation performance 3 assess the dependence of basin pm separation performance on various nondimensional groups based on dynamic similarity and 4 develop a cfd augmented ml model for urban water clarification basin analysis design and regulation in part as a tool for creating physically based generalizable and simple algebraic expressions to map the functionality of basin inputs through basin parameters to basin outputs of interest in this case basin pm separation 2 materials and methods the background information on current basin design and regulatory presumptive guidance based on rt is introduced in the subsection of background for basin geometrics and regulation the cfd methodology for basin pm separation simulation is provided in the subsection of cfd simulation of pm transport and fate the last subsection of data driven ml models for pm separation describes the ml model selection development training and test 2 1 background for basin geometrics and regulation fig 1 illustrates a typical system configuration of a polygon shape for a clarification basin polygonal clarification basin geometries are considered because of their predominate presence 71 in the survey from the florida department of transportation fdot as shown in fig s2 conceptually a clarification basin can primarily comprise of three volumes by convention 1 permanent pool volume which can be designated as a water quality volume wqv 2 a treatment volume and 3 a peak safety storage volume during the dry or low flowrate period or season flow is drained through a hydraulically restrictive discharge outlet such as an orifice and only the permanent pool volume is retained below this outlet elevation during the wet season because of the imbalance between the influent and effluent controlled by drain down outflow structures such as an orifice the basin water elevation varies and a treatment volume is generated for detention volume storage and flowrate attenuation in the case of a larger storm event e g 25 year 24 hr return period storm a high hydraulic capacity outlet such as a weir facilitates high effluent flowrates the peak storage volume provides additional storage volume and prevents hydraulic volumetric discharge overloading excursions from the basin the basin geometric guidance and criteria while varying among jurisdictions and regulatory agencies are directionally similar with the following main components first the orifice invert is configured at or above the normal water table or tailwater elevation if present then the treatment volume is determined based on the drainage area hydrologic conditions as one example for 2 54 cm 1 in of runoff over the entire drainage area for the basin or 6 35 cm 2 5 in of runoff over the impervious area the orifice can be sized based on discharge requirements as one example to discharge 50 of the treatment volume within 48 hours or to discharge the full treatment volume within the mean time between events for a given location and within a given seasonal period with a weir overflow structure at the top elevation of the treatment volume the weir is sized in an iterative method by flow routing analysis to allow the design storm e g 25 year 24 hr return period storm discharge without hydraulic volumetric overloading to a downstream conveyance system or receiving water these components are for management of hydraulic volumetric quantities with respect to downstream systems to meet the water chemistry and load control criteria for example as indexed with 80 pm separation the permanent pool volume is determined by a minimum of a 14 or 21 days rt criteria st johns river water management district 2018 the rt is defined in eq 1 note that the permanent pool volume is solely sized to meet this load control criteria and does not provide storage for water quantity control except as a result of drought conditions or during a dry season when the water elevation drop below the normal water level nwl moreover under the existing 14 days rt criteria the permanent pool volume is typically 3 to 8 times in some cases 27 to 30 times larger than the treatment volume thereby generating the leading cost in basin land and construction shown in fig s3 furthermore the depth of the permanent pool is required to be shallow typically 1 to 3 m for human safety concern and to mitigate the potential generation of anoxic condition that are induced by the benthic sediments and thermal stratification massachusetts department of environmental protection et al 1997 united states environmental protection agency 1999 as a result a large permanent pool volume can only be accommodated by enlarging the basin surface area i e land and construction costs and much higher costs under retrofit conditions where the basin is geometrically expanded compared to the hydraulic volumetric criteria the load control requirements and permanent pool volume are the controlling factors for basin spatial surface area and volume geometrics and overall cost weiss et al 2005 therefore the pm separation facilitated by various permanent pool configurations are examined in the following section 1 rt v q in this equation v is permanent pool volume and q is mean wet season e g june october flowrate 2 2 cfd simulation of pm transport and fate while physical validation of a basin model is a practice that requires more adherence in situ physical modeling of a basin as the sole or only assessment method for basin behavior is costly and potentially not representative because of the limited sampling locations and frequencies florida department of transportation 2016 garcía et al 2005 li et al 2021c urban water resources research council gross solid technical committee 2009 however with the development of a cfd model to guide basin planning design or retrofitting the model can also be a tool for representative physical monitoring design potentially reducing the cost of physical monitoring requirements nevertheless assessing pm separation and scaling behavior over a range of basin geometric configurations pm characteristics and loading conditions through physical models based on monitoring is even more economically prohibitive basin geometric configurations are a critical modeling consideration considering the high land and construction cost from tens of thousands to millions of usd us dollars per clarification basin as shown in fig s1 to overcomes such economic constraints for basin sizing and in situ field monitoring to assess resulting basin behavior higher fidelity cfd simulations are adopted here to examine basin pm separation the cfd model implemented basinfoam is developed for simulation of solutes and pm fate in sedimentation filtration adsorption stormwater basins basinfoam has been previously benchmarked and validated with a bench scale physical model of a clarification basin for pm separation of heterodisperse pm li and sansalone 2021b additionally basinfoam has also been applied to study basin elution behavior and also benchmarked against a 40 day field tracer monitoring for a large scale clarification basin in southwest florida li et al 2021c the depth averaged continuity momentum and pm transport equations of basinfoam are defined in eqs 2 4 2 h t h u 0 3 h u t h u u g h h h 0 h ν ν t u τ b ρ 4 h c j t h u

li and sansalone 2021b li et al 2021c a range of basin configurations pm granulometry and loading conditions are examined herein by cfd model runs as summarized in table 1 these parameters with their symbols are geometrically illustrated in fig 1 the ranges for parameters are determined based on the common geometric guidance and recommendations from stormwater design manuals that published by regulatory agencies in the usa massachusetts department of environmental protection et al 1997 minnesota pollution control agency 2021 new jersey department of environmental protection 2021b north carolina department of environmental quality 2020 st johns river water management district 2018 united states environmental protection agency 1999 as well as synthesized from 38 basin designs across florida these ranges are also extended to include relatively smaller clarification basins i e l x 10 m and basins with relatively higher surface loading rate slr three 3 heterodisperse siliceous psds nominally finer medium coarser representing the range of commonly observed in urban runoff are considered sansalone et al 1998 as shown in fig 2 the d 50 pm diameter of the gravimetric distributions for finer medium and coarser psd are 10 μ m 25 μ m 75 μ m ten 10 pm settling velocities w s ranges from 9 0 10 4 mm s to 1 6 10 2 mm s are considered this pm settling velocity range are equivalent to 1 μ m to 1000 μ m for the siliceous pm density of 2650 kg m 3 or 4 06 μ m to 7 9 mm for organic pm density of 1100 kg m 3 in total 1 6 10 5 16 000 design conditions 10 pm diameters number of combinations encompassing basin geometric configurations pm granulometry and loading conditions are selected for cfd simulation based on latin hypercube sampling lhs adams et al 2020 alternatively parameter sampling can be based on observed probabilistic distribution of basin geometric configurations and loading conditions however such information is not available in the existing literature therefore lhs is used in addition because ml models training prefer larger and more diverse database friedman et al 2017 jia et al 2021 the sampling number is selected as high as possible based on the available computational resources this large number of cfd simulations are carried out with 2048 cores of intel xeon e5 2698 v3 processor on high performance computing hpc of hipergator 3 0 university of florida 2021 at the university of florida the wall clock time for a single cfd simulation ranges from 2 to 12 hr with an intel xeon e5 2698 v3 processor varying based on the basin geometry i e computational grid size and loading conditions i e numerical stability constraints simulation of basin pm separation can be conducted under either transient and quasi steady conditions li and sansalone 2021b li et al 2021c since the current design criteria and regulation examines the basin seasonal pm separation based on the mean wet season flowrate in contrast to a historical event or a given return storm pm separation under the mean wet season flowrate is implemented in the cfd simulations a well maintained basin condition with in place scouring prevention measures or nominal scouring of the benthic sedimentation layer is hypothesized hence a strickler coefficient of 40 m 1 3 s for excavated channels clean after weathering condition is used for the bed shear stress chow 2008 and pm resuspension is not included moreover hydrodynamics in clarification basins are primarily driven by pressure gradients induced by runoff and pm loading are generally dilute with a heterodisperse pm as suspended sediment concentration ssc that can range from 4 mg l to 200 mg l for conditions where the drainage area acts as a surface to trap detritus and coarser particles in the coarser sediment and settleable pm size range li et al 2021c vezzaro et al 2011 this gravimetric concentration range for the transportable fraction of pm suspended settleable and finer sediment fractions is equivalent to a maximum pm volume fraction of 7 5 10 5 dilute condition therefore one way momentum coupling between flow and pm is considered balachandar and eaton 2010 elghobashi 1991 furthermore because of the linearity of the pm transport equation and one way momentum coupling the basin pm separation δ j for the j th diameter particle or discrete increment range between selected diameters and total pm separation δ as defined in eqs 5 and 6 do not depend on the influent pm as ssc value for constant pm loading li and sansalone 2021a in this study pm separation refers to δ j unless total pm separation δ is specified 5 δ j c j i c j e c j i 6 δ j m j δ j in this equation c j i and c j e are the influent and effluent concentration of j particle m j is the mass fraction of the j particle in a heterodisperse psd in the calculation of total pm separation δ pm separation and mass fraction are upsampled by linear interpolation in the cfd simulation the model governing equations eqs 2 4 are solved by a finite volume method fvm with the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm moukalled et al 2016 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the dirichlet boundary conditions of h u based on the mean wet season flowrate q are applied at the basin inlet the permanent pool depth h is used as the boundary condition at the outlet li and sansalone 2021b a pm concentration of unity is applied at the inlet i e pm separation does not depend on the pm influent concentration at the dilute condition type i sedimentation li et al 2021a a pseudo time stepping method is employed to accelerate the model time evolution to the quasi steady condition moukalled et al 2016 a second order total variation diminishing tvd scheme of van leer van leer 1979 is adopted for evaluating continuity and momentum fluxes orthogonal computational grids with grid sizes ranging from 19 600 to 313 600 are used varying with the basin geometries such grid resolutions are determined based on the numerical convergence study as shown in fig s4 and li and sansalone 2021b 2 3 data driven ml models for pm separation based on the dimensional analysis and buckingham π theorem the physical variables of basin configuration loading conditions and pm characteristics table 1 can be expressed by a set of nondimensional groups the nondimensional groups for geometric similarity are basin horizontal aspect ratio a r h vertical aspect ratio a r v relative inlet location ϕ i and relative outlet location ϕ o as defined in eq 7 7 ar h l x l y ar v l m h ϕ i l i l y and ϕ o l o l y the nondimensional groups for dynamic similarity are reynolds number re schmidt number sc hazen number ha also known as nondimensional pm settling velocity as defined in eq 8 8 re u l ν sc ν d and ha w s u in these equations u is the characteristic velocity scale and is defined by surface loading rate slr q l x l y l is the characteristic length scale and is defined by the geometric mean of basin horizontal length l m l x l y d is the pm brownian diffusivity dynamic similarity theory barenblatt 2014 implies the basin pm separation is a function f of applicable system nondimensional groups as illustrated in eq 9 given a set of basin geometric and loading conditions functions f maps these input parameters to a basin pm separation performance level deriving an explicit algebraic expression of the mapping function f from the first principle physical based approach is challenging because the partial differential equations in this case eqs 2 4 that govern the basin hydrodynamics and pm transport typically do not have analytical solutions whereas in the perspective of data driven modeling of basin pm separation eq 9 resembles the classic ml problem of supervised machine learning ng 2018 that is given a number of paired data x y ml models are trained to learn the non linear relationship f that maps x i e basin geometric features loading condition to y i e basin pm separation therefore four 4 classic data driven ml algorithms namely decision tree dt random forest rf artificial neural network ann and symbolic regression sr are developed and tested huang et al 2021 steven l brunton 2019 wu et al 2007 9 δ j f a r h a r v ϕ i ϕ o re sc ha fig 3 provides an illustrative diagram for training and deployment of the four ml models the databases generated from cfd simulations for a wide range of geometric configurations pm granulometry and loading conditions table 1 a total number of 1 6 10 5 combinations are first nondimensionalized to compress the dimensions of the features summarized in eq 9 for efficient model training as illustrated in fig 3b then basin configurations with the horizontal aspect ratio ar h 1 0 i e 80 000 out of 1 6 10 5 combinations physically corresponding to short wide basins are split from the databases and preserved for examining the generalizability of trained ml models for extrapolation the cfd database of ar h 1 0 the other 80 000 combinations of 1 6 10 5 combinations physically corresponding to long narrow basins is randomly divided to training validation and test datasets with a splitting ratio of 8 1 1 ng 2018 in total there are 64 000 8000 and 8000 i e ratio of 8 1 1 numbers of cfd generated paired data x y in the training validation and test datasets the datasets structure layouts for the ml model development are illustrated in fig 3b for example in the case of train dataset the ml model input x is a 64 000 by 7 matrix and the ml model output y is a 64 000 by 1 vector where the matrix column number of 7 corresponds to the seven 7 nondimensional groups derived from the dynamic similarity the lower and upper bounds of the input parameters in the training dataset are provided in table s1 similarly in the validation and test datasets the ml model inputs x are 8000 by 7 matrices and the ml model outputs y are a 8000 by 1 vectors in the ml model development the training dataset is used to optimize the ml model parameters such as weights and bias in ann the validation dataset is for optimizing the ml model architecture e g depth of tree in dt number of hidden layers in ann and controlling the learning process e g learning rate learning epochs known as hyperparameter optimization tuning the test dataset is applied to examine the ml models predictive capability on the datasets that are not seen by the ml models the test dataset is different from the extrapolation dataset ar h 1 0 even though the test dataset is not seen by the ml models the test dataset is similar to and in the range of the training data whereas the extrapolation dataset ar h 1 0 are beyond the range of basin configurations in the training dataset ar h 1 0 examination of ml models for exploration is particularly important as such assessment infers the generalizability of ml models in the application scenarios that are not only not seen by the ml models but also dissimilar from the basin configurations assembled in the training dataset friedman et al 2017 steven l brunton 2019 2 3 1 decision tree dt and random forest rf dt and rf are among the most popular approaches in data mining and ml rokach and maimon 2014 recently dt and rf are applied for detecting adverse water quality events in las vegas wash thompson and dickenson 2021 and predicting physical chemical characteristics of fecal sludge ward et al 2021 dt assembles a tree like model to estimate the mapping relations between input features and output labels as illustrated in eq 9 and fig 3c dt splits the data into subsets based on optimal splitting criteria that minimize the residual sum of squares or other objective functions such as weighted variance or information gain in each subset this splitting process recursively repeats for each derived subset the dt tree structure develops until the terminal node leaf is reached or termination criteria e g maximum tree depth minimum samples of a leaf are met compared with ml models such as ann and rf dt shows improved interpretability as a function of tree depth and the tree structure can be visualized the model prediction processes can be easily explained by the boolean logic in the tree structure such improved interpretability can elucidate the underlying patterns in a dataset notwithstanding dt can be prone to over fitting and also fail to generalize dt model structure can also be sensitive to the training dataset as the child branch splitting depends on the parent splitting small variation in the training dataset can result in a drastically different tree structure to mitigate potential over fitting the dt model structure is optimized with maximum tree depth and minimum samples of a leaf as shown in fig s5 a maximum tree depth of 30 and a minimum sample of a leaf of 8 is determined to improve upon dt random forest rf is developed based on the idea of ensemble learning i e bootstrap aggregating friedman et al 2017 rf is an ensemble of randomized dts as shown in fig 3c by aggregating and averaging the results of parallel dts the predictive capability is improved and over fitting is controlled in rf compared to dt rf has shown improved generalizability and generally outperforms dt friedman et al 2017 an optimal rf structure with a maximum tree depth of 30 a minimum sample of a leaf of 8 and the number of trees of 400 is determined by hyperparameter optimization probst et al 2019 as shown in fig s6 in this study dt and rf are implemented and developed based on a python based ml library of sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 2 3 2 artificial neural network ann as a universal approximator ann is shown to be capable of representing any function with sufficient artificial neurons hornik et al 1989 as illustrated in fig 4 artificial neurons are mathematical conceptualization of the neurons in a biological brain which receive signals form other neurons i e inputs process the signals such as g q w q x q b and pass the signal to the next neurons i e output as shown in fig 3d the ann applied here is a fully connected feed forward neural network ffnn i e a network of nested artificial neurons which is also known as a multi layer perceptron mpl the ann model is developed based on a python based imperative high performance deep learning library pytorch paszke et al 2019 the ann model consists of an input layer two hidden layers and an output layer forty 40 hidden neurons are used in both hidden layers the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons are determined by hyperparameter optimization as shown in fig s7 the activation function of the leaky rectified linear unit leaky relu is applied the standard logistic function is used in the output layer applying such a logistic function to bound the predicted pm separation can yield more efficient model training as illustrated by the learning curves in fig s8 the model training is terminated when the mean squared error mse on the validation dataset starts to increase while the mse on the training dataset continues to decrease 2 3 3 symbolic regression sr another ml technique applied to approximate the mapping function is sr as shown in fig 3e sr uses an evolutionary algorithm to search for an algebraic expression that best describes the relationship between input and output evolutionary algorithms are inspired by darwin s theory based on survival of the fittest and mimic the biological evolutionary process of reproduction mutation recombination and selection goldberg 1989 sr is particularly attractive for physics oriented ml because of the higher interpretability as compared to other ml techniques such as ann recently sr has been demonstrated to provide the capability of learning and discovering laws of physics and system dynamics from data without prior knowledge and assumptions brunton et al 2016 cranmer et al 2020 udrescu and tegmark 2020 moreover closed form algebraic expressions derived from sr are typically mathematically compact and do not require any special computation tools which are particularly suitable for practical engineering applications the sr applied here is based on a python based genetic programming library gplearn stephens 2016 in the application of sr the nondimensional groups are used as input and the pm separation defined in eqs 5 and 9 is used as output as illustrated in eq 9 and fig 3b no prior model structure is specified instead the evolutionary algorithm automatically explore the space of mathematical operations e g ln and assembles the algebraic expression with respect to a fitness function e g mean squared error mse sr aims to uncover and reveal the underlying relationships and model structures between the input and output data through the data driven approach this is different from the conventional regression analysis where a model structure is often presumed e g linear and log function in the model training an initial population size of 8000 is used in the evolutionary algorithms with a total generation of 100 similar to other ml models training the sr model training is terminated when the mse on the validation dataset increases i e overfitting in addition a parsimony coefficient of 0 001 is used to encourage the sr model training towards parsimonious model formulation i e less complex algebraic expressions the law of parsimony also known as occam s razor suggests when two model formulations yield similar predictions the less complex model formulation potentially generalizes better steven l brunton 2019 moreover because the sr model input features i e nondimensional groups are deduced from the dynamic similarity rather from arbitrary selection the physics knowledge of dynamic similarity is embedded into the sr model training improving the model generalizability 3 results 3 1 rt as a scaling index for separation of pm and total pm fig 5 illustrates the dependence of pm separation on the basin rt index in plot a for different pm settling velocity function of pm diameters pm density also shown in plot b is the predictive capability of an rt based empirical model of harper and baker 2003 that florida regulatory agencies currently adopt for evaluating basin pm separation st johns river water management district 2018 the expression for the harper and baker 2003 model is provided in table s2 fig 5 illustrates that rt alone is not a robust index to characterize the basin pm separation for the same rt value a wide range of pm separation can be expected as a function of pm settling velocity for a given pm settling velocity the pm separation generally increases as the rt increases however for the same rt there is high variability up to 40 this variability of pm separation for the same pm settling velocity and same rt is introduced by variation of detailed basin geometrics such as the aspect ratios previously identified li and sansalone 2021b additionally fig 5b implies that the rt based empirical model currently implemented for thousands of basins in recent decades is not an accurate representation for presumptive guidance with respect to basin pm separation on a per pm diameter basis δ j as indicated by the negative coefficient of determination r 2 0 167 since pm is never delivered from a drainage area to a uo such as a basin in a single discrete diameter or diameter range the results of fig 5 also point to a further examination of robustness of rt as an index for basin total pm separation δ in which δ j for the j th diameter particle or discrete increment range between selected diameters is integrated over the influent psd through application of eqs 5 and 6 fig 6 summarizes results of cfd simulation for basin total pm separation for three 3 heterodisperse psds finer medium and coarser in fig 2 with respect to rt previously proposed empirical models for basin total pm separation of brune 1953 harper and baker 2003 heinemarm 1981 united states department of agriculture 1983 are also plotted along with two field monitoring databases reported by harper and baker 2003 heinemarm 1981 the formulas of rt based empirical models are shown in table s2 in these empirical models brune 1953 and united states department of agriculture 1983 empirical models are developed with data from 40 large scale reservoirs with drainage area up to 478 km 2 the heinemarm 1981 formula is based on data from 20 smaller agricultural reservoirs with length range from 137 2 to 2254 6 m and drainage area range from 0 8 to 36 3 km 2 harper and baker 2003 formula is developed based on data of 13 urban stormwater basins with the length ranges approximately from 213 to 1310 m additionally plotted in fig 6 is a database of 159 total pm separation results from 26 commercially available urban water clarifiers from publicly available 3rd party testing reports li and sansalone 2020a this database is generated by physical modeling i e full scale testing with the coarser psd fig 2 reported and verified by the regulatory agencies in north america new jersey corporation for advanced technology njcat and canadian environmental technology verification cetv each of the 159 pm separation results plotted are based on sampling across a consistent and controlled regulatory specified set of loading conditions psd specific gravity surface loading rate flow duration and flow temperature for all clarifiers new jersey department of environmental protection 2021a cfd simulation results indicate that for a given psd as rt increases the total pm separation increases as in the case of pm however total pm separation is also significantly influenced by the psds and basin configuration parameters e g aspect ratios inlet outlet locations as expected for a given rt basins subject to coarser psd loading yield higher total pm separation especially at lower rt 10 hr the difference between coarser and finer psd can be as high as 40 with respect to total pm separation at the same time the dependence of total pm separation on basin configurations introduces additional variability for a given rt and psd a wide range of total pm separation instead of a single value is observed in these results compared with coarser psd this variability induced by basin configuration is much more pronounced for the finer psd 75 of the psd mass represented by the suspended fraction ranging from 20 to 40 moreover these differences and variability induced by psds and basin configuration decrease as the rt increases for rt 1000 hr minimal differences 10 in total pm separation between different psds are observed at this higher rt gravitational force dominates over the hydrodynamic drag force resulting in reduced dependence of total pm separation on the psd and basin configurations li and sansalone 2021c the consideration that arises is not a de minimus increases in basin performance above a given level i e 80 but basin economics for rt values in the range of several hundred to thousand hours at a given level of performance which will be illustrated in the discussion section meanwhile cfd results agree well with field data reported by harper and baker 2003 heinemarm 1981 except for 2 data points at rt of 30 hr 31 of the 33 field data sets from these datasets are reported to have a basin rt 200 hr for which the different empirical models agree at 10 with respect to cfd results especially for the finer psds differences between empirical models and cfd results are primarily observed for rt 200 hr for smaller basins but likely representing the majority of basins in urban land uses models of brune 1953 heinemarm 1981 united states department of agriculture 1983 predict lower total pm separations compared to the cfd results for models of brune 1953 united states department of agriculture 1983 their divergence from cfd results can be potentially explained noting that the databases of these model are not as representative of urban clarification basins for example an urban clarification basin typically has a much smaller depth than the large scale reservoirs used by hydropower plants and water supply verstraeten and poesen 2000 pm generated by urban activity and transported in rainfall runoff to clarification basins are also of significantly different psds as compared to the psds for large scale reservoirs sansalone et al 1998 in the case of the heinemarm 1981 model although the database is comprised of smaller reservoirs because of the nature of the regression technique the model prediction for rt 300 hr is solely controlled by these 2 data points at an rt 30 hr developing a model for rt 300 hr based on such limited samples number is not robust especially considering the basin total pm separation can exhibit larger variability influenced by the different basin configurations in the lower rt range as illustrated in fig 6 among the empirical models the harper and baker 2003 model yields improved agreement with cfd results for the finer psd specifically the harper and baker 2003 model and cfd predict a consistent trend of total pm separation with a finer psd for rt 200 hr however the harper and baker 2003 model and other empirical models are agnostic to the dependence of total pm separation on pm granulometry psd and particle specific gravity and predict 30 to 60 lower total pm separation for coarser psds at rt values of 200 hr these inaccurate predictions from empirical models for the coarser psds are illustrated by the physical modeling results of urban water clarifiers li and sansalone 2020a in contrast the cfd results of basin total pm separation for coarser psd show similar trends to the reported physical modeling results for urban water clarifiers note that the psd used in physical modeling for urban water clarifiers li and sansalone 2020a is identical to the coarser psd examined in this study the formulation of empirical models also did not consider the influence of basin geometric configuration on pm and total pm separation examined in the following section 3 2 scaling behavior for pm separation fig 7 illustrates the dependence of pm separation on various nondimensional groups compared to the relative inlet and outlet location the system pm separation is more dependent on the hazen number reynolds vertical and horizontal aspect ratios as indicated by the value of the pearson correlation coefficient r in each plot in particular the hazen number shows a clear and dominant influence on pm separation as all data are collapsed into a s shape curve for ha 1000 pm is completely separated δ j 1 0 irrespective of other nondimensional groups similarly for ha 0 01 minimal pm separation is observed for all cfd results this strong positive dependence with respect to the hazen number does indeed aligns with classical theoretical models for clarification such as surface overflow rate sor plug flow reactor pfr and continuous stirred tank reactor cstr for which the hazen number dependence has been hypothesized these theoretical models are shown in table s3 however a comparison with these classical theoretical models also illuminates the limitations of these models as shown in fig 8 a basin pm separation can be significantly different from and is primarily lower than the prediction of these classical models for a given hazen number a basin system can exhibit a wide range of pm separation 30 to 50 suggesting that only considering the hazen number dependence in predicting basin pm separation is necessary but not sufficient as the single nondimensional group in an analysis nevertheless a comparison between figs 7 and fig 5 demonstrates that the hazen number is a much more robust variable than an rt index for pm separation the hazen number is much more robust primarily because this nondimensional number takes into account the influence of pm settling velocity hazen number can be defined as a measure of rt normalized by the pm settling time scale t s h w s dhamotharan et al 1981 to investigate this multivariate dependence with respect to pm separation pm separation is examined as a function of the hazen number and colored by other nondimensional groups in fig 8 fig 8a and 8b illustrates that the variability in pm separation for a given hazen number can be primarily explained by the variation in the horizontal and vertical aspect ratios of a basin for a given hazen number the greater the basin horizontal aspect ratio physically corresponding to more long linear basin geometry instead of a lower basin horizontal aspect ratio as is the case for a square polygon basin geometry results in a higher pm separation this result agrees with previous studies of li and sansalone 2021b persson et al 1999 in which a long linear basin geometry is shown to mitigate potential short circuiting and promotes more favorable hydrodynamic conditions for pm separation compared to square basin geometry in addition for the range of basin depth considered 1 to 3 m a decrease in the basin vertical aspect ratio e g increase of basin depth yields higher pm separation harper and baker 2007 in contrast to the horizontal and vertical aspect ratios no clear trend in pm separation is observed for the relative inlet ϕ i and outlet locations ϕ o to account for these additional non linear effects on pm separation ml models are developed and examined in the following section 3 3 development and evaluation of ml models fig 9 compares the ml models of dt rf ann and sr for training validation test and an extrapolation dataset because training and validation datasets are used for model training and hyperparameter optimization they are not robust measures of model predictive capability the test dataset is not seen by the models and is therefore a more robust metric to evaluate the performance of the trained ml models ng 2018 across the test dataset in general all examined ml models provide high predictive capability with a coefficient of determination r 2 consistently above 0 990 the ann model yields the highest r 2 0 994 closely followed by rf dt and sr the ann predicted pm separation is within 15 of cfd simulations which are significant improvements in comparison to the rt based empirical model r 2 0 167 fig 5 and hazen based theoretical model fig 8a in contrast to the good performance in the test dataset the ml models degenerate in the extrapolation dataset the predictive capability of the ml models in terms of r 2 decreases and ranges from 0 889 to 0 979 in the extrapolation dataset ml models of dt rf and sr show comparable predictive capability in the extrapolation dataset with r 2 0 972 conversely the ann model that yields the highest r 2 in the test dataset exhibits the weakest generalizability in the extrapolation dataset differences between ann model prediction and cfd simulation in the extrapolation dataset are primarily observed for higher levels of pm separation and can be as large as 80 these results indicate the challenge and risk in applying ml models to basin configurations that are not included in or are not similar to the training dataset suggesting the robust ml models development needs a large and diverse dataset for the training among the ml models evaluated the sr model is the most mathematically compact and physically interpretative the sr model indicates the basin pm separation is primarily a function of the hazen number and the horizontal aspect ratio as defined by eqs 10 and 11 these two features of the sr model were not defined in the model training but are an outcome of the evolutionary optimization this result for the functionality of the hazen number and horizontal aspect ratio as the primary features reinforces and is consistent with previous observations in figs 7 and 8 in these figures the hazen number shows a dominant effect with respect to pm separation with the additional influence of the horizontal aspect ratio both of which have a physical basis as shown in fig 10 the feature importance computed from rf also identifies the significance of these two parameters in which hazen number and horizontal aspect ratio are the basin features that represent the first two leading factors 10 h ln ha 3 2 0 62 and ar ln ar h 0 67 1 24 11 δ j s 2 h exp s ar h in this equation h and ar are model parameters s x 1 1 exp x is the standard logistic function with respect to total pm separation fig 11 and table 2 illustrate that the ml models such as ann and sr provide a significant improvement as compared to the rt based empirical model of harper and baker 2003 ml models correctly capture the dependence of total pm separation based on the psd and the r 2 of ml models ranges from 0 978 and 0 983 with a prediction accuracy within 15 as shown in table 2 compared to ann the sr illustrates a comparable level of predictive capability the difference in predictive capability between ann and sr in the pm separation δ j fig 9 is reduced in the total pm separation δ this reduced difference in predictive capability is because the total pm separation as a comparison metric is less sensitive to the modeling error in comparison to the pm separation li and sansalone 2021c as illustrated by eqs 5 and 6 m j δ j δ j for m j 1 0 meanwhile compared to ann the model representation and computation based on sr are drastically simplified the developed ann model is comprised of two 2 hidden layers with 40 neurons in each which results in a total number of 2001 model parameters weights and bias ann computation can be complex and may require a designated platform e g sklearn pytorch tensorflow even though ann can be deployed as a software or web application in contrast sr is completely defined by only two 2 algebraic equations such a simple surrogate formulation is critical for efficient application in practical engineering planning and regulatory settings the computation of sr is also straightforward and can be facilitated by conventional and common digital tools such as spreadsheets 4 discussion 4 1 pareto frontier and the economy of basin design the observed scaling behavior with respect to separation of pm and also total pm has critical implications for the economy of basin design and urban water management as highlighted in the following case fig 12 illustrates the basin design economy by a pareto frontier diagram for an example site in southwest florida with a mean wet season flowrate of 0 1 m 3 s and coarser heterodisperse influent psd these site hydrological conditions and pm loading characteristics are measured from a 12 month in situ field monitoring florida department of transportation 2016 li et al 2021c previously cfd results for this basin and watershed conditions table 1 are plotted along with different design methods and their corresponding construction cost the total unit construction cost including annual operating and maintenance costs for a 20 year life of a basin in the year 2021 is estimated to 87 9 usd m 3 with respect to permanent pool volume based on the reported unit construction cost of 70 6 usd m 3 for the year 2010 minnesota pollution control agency 2021 and an average annual inflation rate of 2 02 between the year 2010 to 2021 u s bureau of labor statistics 2021 to achieve 80 for total pm separation a common presumptive guidance level current rt guidance 14 days rt and empirical models of harper and baker 2003 heinemarm 1981 require a basin with a permanent pool volume of 1 8 10 5 m 3 6 4 10 6 ft 3 and a construction cost of 16 million usd in contrast cfd simulation and a more robust sr model indicate a permanent pool volume of 1 3 10 3 m 3 4 7 10 4 ft 3 with a construction cost of 117 thousand usd resulting in a direct cost reduction of approximately 15 8 million usd for coarser psd loading and δ 0 8 the sr model consistently yields at least two order magnitude smaller basin geometry compared to the empirical models of harper and baker 2003 heinemarm 1981 furthermore the application of the sr model eqs 10 11 as a simple algebraic function may be more direct than current regulatory guidance and empirical models the only additional information that the sr model requires is the site pm granulometry psd density which are now reasonably documented nevertheless such information can be obtained through field sampling and the measurement cost of psd is nominal to negligible as compared to the potentially reduced construction cost 15 8 million usd in this case in most states psd data are available for surficial soil types and from soil surveys therefore applying the proposed sr model along with field psd measurement or tabulated psds from soil surveys in basin design and regulation is a nominal requirement that can readily transcend to the current state of the practice moreover cfd simulations and the sr model in fig 12 reveals the basin construction cost scales exponentially to the total pm separation note that construction cost is plotted on a logarithmic scale an important observation is that a relatively small improvement in total pm separation requires an exponential investment in system dimensions and cost such an exponential scaling behavior is magnified with a higher total pm separation range δ 0 8 and finer psd for example suppose the proposed basin is required to enhance total pm separation from 80 to 95 typically a regulatory requirement for a listed or protected receiving water body in this scenario the basin dimension needs to be enlarged by two orders of magnitude and this increase extends to the basin cost in an even more common scenario where an existing basin has become impaired not achieving presumptive guidance because of initial design or increased constituent loads from the drainage area development or re development such as infill a basin retrofit is generally addressed through a conventional approach of increasing surface area and volume which would directionally result in a significant cost escalation the re dimensioning of an impaired basin is even more physically and economically challenging than that of a proposed basin given the potential modification to infrastructure adjacency that has developed since the basin was initially constructed this exponential scaling in cost indicates the design and retrofit of a basin to improve the total pm or pm partitioned chemicals separation by only enlarging the system dimension is not a cost effective approach especially when a higher total pm separation of 95 is desired or having to achieve for example the initial presumptive guidance of 80 from the current impaired basin behavior this particularly challenges the existing rt based basin design guidance and regulation since an increase in rt can only be accommodated by enlarging system dimension and basin construction and land costs instead basin design or retrofit design should be optimized to minimize cost escalation largely driven by lost opportunity cost of land by exploring the more effective design configuration that is beyond the current pareto frontier offered by conventional basin configurations i e polygon shape fig 1 a demonstrated approach integrates cfd with an evolutionary algorithm to strategically configuring adsorption filtration permeable baffle system into the existing configuration and size of a basin without increasing basin dimensions li and sansalone 2021b li et al 2021c shows that with such a method a relative increase of 58 8 in total pm separation can be achieved by baffled basin design compared to the conventional basin design i e plain polygon basin 4 2 ml models as an adjuvant of cfd for practical application adoption and acceptance of cfd for water infrastructure is an indisputable trend yet reinvigorating the user s hydrodynamic and numerical methods educational tools that have not been exercised as a result of time and the existing state of the practice represent a major barrier for the immediate and widespread adoption of cfd in the water related industries in parallel to the ongoing efforts of enhancing the education in computing techniques in current civil and environmental engineering curricula liu et al 2020 this study presents a method of utilizing ml models as an adjuvant tool for robust and efficient dissemination and application of cfd simulations to engineering planning and regulatory stakeholders such ml models once developed do not require cfd skill to apply and can be seamlessly integrated with current planning engineering and regulatory practices application of such ml models results such as from sr shown herein are as simple as existing rules of thumb yet such ml models leverage the predictive capability of cfd such an ml based adjuvant tool is particularly attractive to complex and repetitive engineering design applications where the quantity of interest e g pm separation chemicals temperature is a non linear function of numerous design parameters the ml model not only can approximate the mapping function but also can identify the dominant design features parameters and guide the design optimization as shown in fig 10 notwithstanding applications of such ml models should be treated with careful consideration when the ml models are extrapolated to engineering design and situations that are not included in nor similar to the training dataset fig 9 illustrates the performance degeneration and potential limitation of ml models in such application scenarios fig 9 also implies that for robust development of such ml models the training data should be sufficiently large and diverse such that in an application the ml model operates more through interpolation rather than by extrapolation steven l brunton 2019 however in many civil and environmental engineering cases obtaining such a large number of high quality and diverse training data is a significant challenge and often laborious and of added cost e g basin data in this study in such a small data regime direct applying the common ml model is not robust raissi et al 2019 even though this is commonly carried out in recent literature one method that has been proposed to circumvent this issue is integrating the physical laws and develop physics informed ml models karniadakis et al 2021 another possible approach is taking advantage of massively parallel computing resources and use cfd models to generate a large and diverse training database for ml model training as illustrated by this study future research should extend current effort and examine more complex basin configurations and conditions such as multiple inlets khan et al 2011 vegetated littoral zones sonnenwald et al 2019 cohesive pm as sediment zhang et al 2018 internal baffling garofalo and sansalone 2018 and irregular geometries sonnenwald et al 2018 the influence of unsteady hydraulic pm granulometry and chemical loadings partitioning on the basin clarification performance over a long time scale e g years also requires further investigation and characterization helping to mitigate the common outcome of basin impairment especially for the nexus of land redevelopment and continued climate change moreover the illustrated cfd augmented ml modeling approach can be potentially extended to improve the parameterization of water chemistry functionality of a wide range of bmps in the process based dynamics model e g swmm for watershed scale simulation last the current research can be potentially further improved by extending the depth averaged cfd model to 3d multi phase unsteady rans with availability of additional computational resources 5 conclusions this study examines the robustness of residence time rt and also of nondimensional groups of geometric and dynamic similarity as potential indices to scale clarification basin performance as pm and total pm separation cfd simulation of pm transport and fate for a wide range of basin configuration loading conditions and pm characteristics are carried out with a total number of parametric combinations of 1 6 10 5 cfd results agree well with the basin field monitoring data and physical modeling results of urban water clarifiers as reported in the literature based on the database generated by cfd machine learning ml models of decision tree dt random forest rf artificial neural networks ann and symbolic regression sr are developed and compared for interpolation and extrapolation an sr model is distilled from cfd simulations and is proposed to provide simple surrogate equations for basin geometric design and regulation the results of this study yield the following conclusions rt as a sole index is not a robust index to scale pm nor total pm separation and by extension pm partitioned chemicals pm and total pm separation depends on pm granulometry and basin geometrics to which rt criteria are agnostic consequently the existing rt based empirical models are not representative for a wide range of basin configurations and conditions in particular rt based empirical models underpredict the total pm separation for coarser psd by 30 to 60 compared to cfd simulation and physical modeling of urban water clarifiers rt based empirical models developed by regression are sensitive to the choice of regression data the sample number of empirical models is particularly limited for rt 200 hr corresponding to small basins or basins that receive high hydraulic loading for large basins or basins that receive low hydraulic loading rt 2000 hr good agreement 10 between empirical models and cfd are observed simply because of the increased influence of gravitational forces on pm separation dominates potential misrepresentations by empirical models basin pm separation can be primarily characterized by a nondimensional hazen number followed by basin horizontal aspect ratio and vertical aspect ratio with lesser dependence on relative inlet and outlet locations the hazen number as an index for pm separation is improved from rt criteria by additionally considering the pm granulometry the hazen number can be thought of as rt normalized by pm settling time scale t s notwithstanding the hazen number alone is not sufficient to characterize pm separation for example the basin horizontal aspect ratio can affect pm separation by 30 to 50 as shown in figs 8 and 10 in the examined basin configuration a higher horizontal aspect ratio promotes pm separation ml models can serve as an adjuvant tool for simple and efficient and application of cfd in practical basin design and regulation trained ml models of dt rf ann and sr predict cfd simulations of total pm separation within 15 representing significant improvement compared with empirical formulas and theoretical models of sor as shown in 11 the proposed sr model as defined in eqs 10 and 11 is well suited for practical engineering applications because of the explicit closed form expression and simple computations basin construction cost scales exponentially to the total pm separation such scaling behavior is further magnified at higher pm separation δ 80 as a function of psd linear increase in total pm separation demands an exponentially increased system dimension and basin cost this suggests improving the basin pm separation by simply enlarging system dimension increasing the rt is not a cost effective approach especially when a higher total pm separation of 95 is targeted or required cost effective basin design should consider the site specific pm granulometry psd density and explore more efficient basin design for pm separation and pm partitioned chemicals such as strategically configuring with internal baffles without increasing surface area

are not accurate or generalizable for basin pm separation with significant differences between cfd and rt models primarily for rt 200 hr 2 rt models are agnostic to basin configurations and pm granulometrics and therefore do not reproduce total pm separation 3 trained ml models provide high predictive capability with r 2 above 0 99 and prediction for total pm separation within 15 in particular the sr model distilled from cfd simulations is entirely defined by only two compact algebraic equations allowing use in a spreadsheet tool the sr model has a physical basis and indicates pm

and a presumptive best management practice bmp by regulatory agencies li et al 2021c st johns river water management district 2018 renwick et al 2006 estimated that the number of constructed basins by 2006 ranged from 2 6 to 9 million in the united states us with a spatial number density of at least 5 km 2 for urban suburban areas in florida and louisiana such a number of constructed basins modifies rainfall runoff phenomena with the potential benefit to urban water clarification human and ecological habitat interaction with urban water and the potential as a reclaimed water beckingham et al 2019 li et al 2021c luthy et al 2020 there has been a long history of research to quantify clarification benefits facilitated by basins hydrologic benefits notwithstanding and to improve the economy of basin designs over 100 years of research has been devoted to elucidate clarification functionality and developing indices and models for basin design and regulation early studies have proposed semi empirical models based on data and physical indices from basins brune 1953 chen 1975 hazen 1904 heinemarm 1981 nix 1982 rausch and schreiber 1981 verstraeten and poesen 2000 in particular the model proposed by brune 1953 for pm separation or trap efficiency te based on capacity inflow ratio analogous to mean residence time rt was widely adopted later with the application of digital computers basin functionality was examined with numerical models dhamotharan et al 1981 based on reactor theory and assumption of idealized flow hydrodynamics i e complete mixing flow or plug flow huber 1984 huber et al 2006 nix et al 1988 developed process based lumped dynamics model for basin clarification process such as continuous stirred tank reactor cstr models such dynamic models constitute the theoretical foundation for the current most prominent and leading urban water simulation tool the storm water management model swmm rossman 2015 as computational resources continue to increase more recent studies have built upon this foundation with models such as swmm and moved towards hydrodynamic resolving computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations gao and stenstrom 2018 zhang et al 2014 a range of cfd tools for basin clarification simulation have been developed such as the shallow water equation swe guan et al 2018 hinterberger et al 2007 li et al 2021c nadaoka and yagi

hydrodynamics turbulence with coupled clarification and water chemistry functionality liu et al 2020 spelman and sansalone 2017 in contrast to almost a half century of clarification modeling progress decades of regulatory design and management guidance for clarification basins have been and are still based on empirical techniques and lumped indices that were postulated in the 1960s brune 1953 new jersey department of environmental protection 2021b nix et al 1988 specifically presumptive criteria based on rt or hydraulic rt hrt to achieve a level of pm separation for example 80 are still widely adopted by regulatory agencies california stormwater quality association 2003 clar et al 2004 florida administration code 2005 united states environmental protection agency 2009 vijay m vulava 2019 the definition of rt while variable e g mean annual rt is typically defined as the ratio between permanent pool volume also known as water quality volume and mean wet season flowrate atlanta regional commission 2016 minnesota pollution control agency 2021 st johns river water management district 2018 design guidance based on rt also varies some agencies suggest basins should be sized with an rt

others require a minimum 14 day rt massachusetts department of environmental protection et al 1997 north carolina department of environmental quality 2020 st johns river water management district 2018 in some cases with protected water bodies an additional 50 permanent pool volume and a minimum rt of 21 days are required st johns river water management district 2018 notwithstanding the widespread adoption of rt to index basin clarification the basis for rt from first principles to scale basin clarification is unclear and potentially not robust there is significant documentation to illustrate the substantial influence of system configuration loading conditions hydrodynamics and pm granulometry on basin clarification of pm guzman et al 2018 krajewski et al 2017 persson et al 1999 sonnenwald et al 2018 verstraeten and poesen 2000 yet the rt index is agnostic to all of these input parameters therefore the robustness of rt to scale basin pm separation performance requires examination over a wide range of system geometrics pm granulometry and loading conditions this examination is critical from an economic perspective considering the significant basin land and construction cost hundreds of thousands to tens of millions usd as shown in fig s1 that result from current rt based regulation criteria such an effort was and remains a critical need as identified several decades ago and more recently beckingham et al 2019 verstraeten and poesen 2000 without a clear illustration of predictive capability or potential liability of rt criteria basin design will continue to be guided by potentially less robust methods or indices hindering the effort and progress towards economical basin design and sustainable urban water management on the order hand advanced basin design and regulation tools such as cfd while providing capability and accuracy do require that the stakeholder whether as industry planning management or regulatory to have or redevelop knowledge and skills for such tools as compared to existing rt criteria the hesitancy to more frequently apply cfd has historically posed a challenge for wider implementation and regulatory acceptance of cfd for urban water systems despite the existence of decades of practice based implementation in chemical mechanical and aeronautical engineering indeed liu et al 2020 concludes that cfd is deployed to a lesser extent by civil and environmental professionals such a lack of deployment and demand for cfd may also be responsible for the previously illustrated gap between research and empirically based engineering practice for basin design retrofits and regulation to reduce such a gap and accelerate the translation of research outcomes to practice based planning and engineering a method is critically needed to leverage the robust predictive capability of cfd models while provides user friendly basin design experience implementable outcomes from cfd as provided by current digital tools e g spreadsheets are needed for basins as a sustainable and resilient urban water management unit artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml can potentially provide such a solution ml offers a wide range of techniques to analyze information identify patterns from data and has been applied to diverse disciplines such as image recognition language processing autonomous vehicles medicine real time flooding control bartos and kerkez 2021 kerkez et al 2016 mullapudi et al 2020 and new physics discoveries cranmer et al 2020 ml models such as artificial neural network ann are able to learn the multi dimensional and non linear correlations between input features and output labels from data as supervised learning brunton et al 2020 steven l brunton 2019 in this respect ml models can be similarly developed to approximate the mapping relation between basin geometric parameters features and basin clarification or water chemistry functionality labels for example based on the higher fidelity cfd simulations of pm transport and fate compared with the empirical and lumped models such trained ml models preserve the dependence of pm separation to detailed system geometrics loading condition and pm granulometry compared with the higher fidelity cfd models trained ml models obviate the time consuming cfd computation and facilitate a simple and efficient examination of basin geometrics retrofit of impaired basins and regulation for practical application this research enhances and extends the existing research of urban water clarification basin design and regulation by developing a cfd augmented ml model for pm separation a novel approach hybridizing cfd and ml models i e decision tree random forest ann and symbolic regression is proposed to facilitate robust and simple basin analysis and geometric design the objectives are 1 examine the system pm separation with a validated cfd model over a range of common design geometrics e g basin aspect ratio depth inlet and outlet locations pm characteristics pm density particle size distribution psd and loading condition e g mean wet season flowrate 2 examine the robustness of rt as an index to characterize and scale basin pm separation performance 3 assess the dependence of basin pm separation performance on various nondimensional groups based on dynamic similarity and 4 develop a cfd augmented ml model for urban water clarification basin analysis design and regulation in part as a tool for creating physically based generalizable and simple algebraic expressions to map the functionality of basin inputs through basin parameters to basin outputs of interest in this case basin pm separation 2 materials and methods the background information on current basin design and regulatory presumptive guidance based on rt is introduced in the subsection of background for basin geometrics and regulation the cfd methodology for basin pm separation simulation is provided in the subsection of cfd simulation of pm transport and fate the last subsection of data driven ml models for pm separation describes the ml model selection development training and test 2 1 background for basin geometrics and regulation fig 1 illustrates a typical system configuration of a polygon shape for a clarification basin polygonal clarification basin geometries are considered because of their predominate presence 71 in the survey from the florida department of transportation fdot as shown in fig s2 conceptually a clarification basin can primarily comprise of three volumes by convention 1 permanent pool volume which can be designated as a water quality volume wqv 2 a treatment volume and 3 a peak safety storage volume during the dry or low flowrate period or season flow is drained through a hydraulically restrictive discharge outlet such as an orifice and only the permanent pool volume is retained below this outlet elevation during the wet season because of the imbalance between the influent and effluent controlled by drain down outflow structures such as an orifice the basin water elevation varies and a treatment volume is generated for detention volume storage and flowrate attenuation in the case of a larger storm event e g 25 year 24 hr return period storm a high hydraulic capacity outlet such as a weir facilitates high effluent flowrates the peak storage volume provides additional storage volume and prevents hydraulic volumetric discharge overloading excursions from the basin the basin geometric guidance and criteria while varying among jurisdictions and regulatory agencies are directionally similar with the following main components first the orifice invert is configured at or above the normal water table or tailwater elevation if present then the treatment volume is determined based on the drainage area hydrologic conditions as one example for 2 54 cm 1 in of runoff over the entire drainage area for the basin or 6 35 cm 2 5 in of runoff over the impervious area the orifice can be sized based on discharge requirements as one example to discharge 50 of the treatment volume within 48 hours or to discharge the full treatment volume within the mean time between events for a given location and within a given seasonal period with a weir overflow structure at the top elevation of the treatment volume the weir is sized in an iterative method by flow routing analysis to allow the design storm e g 25 year 24 hr return period storm discharge without hydraulic volumetric overloading to a downstream conveyance system or receiving water these components are for management of hydraulic volumetric quantities with respect to downstream systems to meet the water chemistry and load control criteria for example as indexed with 80 pm separation the permanent pool volume is determined by a minimum of a 14 or 21 days rt criteria st johns river water management district 2018 the rt is defined in eq 1 note that the permanent pool volume is solely sized to meet this load control criteria and does not provide storage for water quantity control except as a result of drought conditions or during a dry season when the water elevation drop below the normal water level nwl moreover under the existing 14 days rt criteria the permanent pool volume is typically 3 to 8 times in some cases 27 to 30 times larger than the treatment volume thereby generating the leading cost in basin land and construction shown in fig s3 furthermore the depth of the permanent pool is required to be shallow typically 1 to 3 m for human safety concern and to mitigate the potential generation of anoxic condition that are induced by the benthic sediments and thermal stratification massachusetts department of environmental protection et al 1997 united states environmental protection agency 1999 as a result a large permanent pool volume can only be accommodated by enlarging the basin surface area i e land and construction costs and much higher costs under retrofit conditions where the basin is geometrically expanded compared to the hydraulic volumetric criteria the load control requirements and permanent pool volume are the controlling factors for basin spatial surface area and volume geometrics and overall cost weiss et al 2005 therefore the pm separation facilitated by various permanent pool configurations are examined in the following section 1 rt v q in this equation v is permanent pool volume and q is mean wet season e g june october flowrate 2 2 cfd simulation of pm transport and fate while physical validation of a basin model is a practice that requires more adherence in situ physical modeling of a basin as the sole or only assessment method for basin behavior is costly and potentially not representative because of the limited sampling locations and frequencies florida department of transportation 2016 garcía et al 2005 li et al 2021c urban water resources research council gross solid technical committee 2009 however with the development of a cfd model to guide basin planning design or retrofitting the model can also be a tool for representative physical monitoring design potentially reducing the cost of physical monitoring requirements nevertheless assessing pm separation and scaling behavior over a range of basin geometric configurations pm characteristics and loading conditions through physical models based on monitoring is even more economically prohibitive basin geometric configurations are a critical modeling consideration considering the high land and construction cost from tens of thousands to millions of usd us dollars per clarification basin as shown in fig s1 to overcomes such economic constraints for basin sizing and in situ field monitoring to assess resulting basin behavior higher fidelity cfd simulations are adopted here to examine basin pm separation the cfd model implemented basinfoam is developed for simulation of solutes and pm fate in sedimentation filtration adsorption stormwater basins basinfoam has been previously benchmarked and validated with a bench scale physical model of a clarification basin for pm separation of heterodisperse pm li and sansalone 2021b additionally basinfoam has also been applied to study basin elution behavior and also benchmarked against a 40 day field tracer monitoring for a large scale clarification basin in southwest florida li et al 2021c the depth averaged continuity momentum and pm transport equations of basinfoam are defined in eqs 2 4 2 h t h u 0 3 h u t h u u g h h h 0 h ν ν t u τ b ρ 4 h c j t h u

li and sansalone 2021b li et al 2021c a range of basin configurations pm granulometry and loading conditions are examined herein by cfd model runs as summarized in table 1 these parameters with their symbols are geometrically illustrated in fig 1 the ranges for parameters are determined based on the common geometric guidance and recommendations from stormwater design manuals that published by regulatory agencies in the usa massachusetts department of environmental protection et al 1997 minnesota pollution control agency 2021 new jersey department of environmental protection 2021b north carolina department of environmental quality 2020 st johns river water management district 2018 united states environmental protection agency 1999 as well as synthesized from 38 basin designs across florida these ranges are also extended to include relatively smaller clarification basins i e l x 10 m and basins with relatively higher surface loading rate slr three 3 heterodisperse siliceous psds nominally finer medium coarser representing the range of commonly observed in urban runoff are considered sansalone et al 1998 as shown in fig 2 the d 50 pm diameter of the gravimetric distributions for finer medium and coarser psd are 10 μ m 25 μ m 75 μ m ten 10 pm settling velocities w s ranges from 9 0 10 4 mm s to 1 6 10 2 mm s are considered this pm settling velocity range are equivalent to 1 μ m to 1000 μ m for the siliceous pm density of 2650 kg m 3 or 4 06 μ m to 7 9 mm for organic pm density of 1100 kg m 3 in total 1 6 10 5 16 000 design conditions 10 pm diameters number of combinations encompassing basin geometric configurations pm granulometry and loading conditions are selected for cfd simulation based on latin hypercube sampling lhs adams et al 2020 alternatively parameter sampling can be based on observed probabilistic distribution of basin geometric configurations and loading conditions however such information is not available in the existing literature therefore lhs is used in addition because ml models training prefer larger and more diverse database friedman et al 2017 jia et al 2021 the sampling number is selected as high as possible based on the available computational resources this large number of cfd simulations are carried out with 2048 cores of intel xeon e5 2698 v3 processor on high performance computing hpc of hipergator 3 0 university of florida 2021 at the university of florida the wall clock time for a single cfd simulation ranges from 2 to 12 hr with an intel xeon e5 2698 v3 processor varying based on the basin geometry i e computational grid size and loading conditions i e numerical stability constraints simulation of basin pm separation can be conducted under either transient and quasi steady conditions li and sansalone 2021b li et al 2021c since the current design criteria and regulation examines the basin seasonal pm separation based on the mean wet season flowrate in contrast to a historical event or a given return storm pm separation under the mean wet season flowrate is implemented in the cfd simulations a well maintained basin condition with in place scouring prevention measures or nominal scouring of the benthic sedimentation layer is hypothesized hence a strickler coefficient of 40 m 1 3 s for excavated channels clean after weathering condition is used for the bed shear stress chow 2008 and pm resuspension is not included moreover hydrodynamics in clarification basins are primarily driven by pressure gradients induced by runoff and pm loading are generally dilute with a heterodisperse pm as suspended sediment concentration ssc that can range from 4 mg l to 200 mg l for conditions where the drainage area acts as a surface to trap detritus and coarser particles in the coarser sediment and settleable pm size range li et al 2021c vezzaro et al 2011 this gravimetric concentration range for the transportable fraction of pm suspended settleable and finer sediment fractions is equivalent to a maximum pm volume fraction of 7 5 10 5 dilute condition therefore one way momentum coupling between flow and pm is considered balachandar and eaton 2010 elghobashi 1991 furthermore because of the linearity of the pm transport equation and one way momentum coupling the basin pm separation δ j for the j th diameter particle or discrete increment range between selected diameters and total pm separation δ as defined in eqs 5 and 6 do not depend on the influent pm as ssc value for constant pm loading li and sansalone 2021a in this study pm separation refers to δ j unless total pm separation δ is specified 5 δ j c j i c j e c j i 6 δ j m j δ j in this equation c j i and c j e are the influent and effluent concentration of j particle m j is the mass fraction of the j particle in a heterodisperse psd in the calculation of total pm separation δ pm separation and mass fraction are upsampled by linear interpolation in the cfd simulation the model governing equations eqs 2 4 are solved by a finite volume method fvm with the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm moukalled et al 2016 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the dirichlet boundary conditions of h u based on the mean wet season flowrate q are applied at the basin inlet the permanent pool depth h is used as the boundary condition at the outlet li and sansalone 2021b a pm concentration of unity is applied at the inlet i e pm separation does not depend on the pm influent concentration at the dilute condition type i sedimentation li et al 2021a a pseudo time stepping method is employed to accelerate the model time evolution to the quasi steady condition moukalled et al 2016 a second order total variation diminishing tvd scheme of van leer van leer 1979 is adopted for evaluating continuity and momentum fluxes orthogonal computational grids with grid sizes ranging from 19 600 to 313 600 are used varying with the basin geometries such grid resolutions are determined based on the numerical convergence study as shown in fig s4 and li and sansalone 2021b 2 3 data driven ml models for pm separation based on the dimensional analysis and buckingham π theorem the physical variables of basin configuration loading conditions and pm characteristics table 1 can be expressed by a set of nondimensional groups the nondimensional groups for geometric similarity are basin horizontal aspect ratio a r h vertical aspect ratio a r v relative inlet location ϕ i and relative outlet location ϕ o as defined in eq 7 7 ar h l x l y ar v l m h ϕ i l i l y and ϕ o l o l y the nondimensional groups for dynamic similarity are reynolds number re schmidt number sc hazen number ha also known as nondimensional pm settling velocity as defined in eq 8 8 re u l ν sc ν d and ha w s u in these equations u is the characteristic velocity scale and is defined by surface loading rate slr q l x l y l is the characteristic length scale and is defined by the geometric mean of basin horizontal length l m l x l y d is the pm brownian diffusivity dynamic similarity theory barenblatt 2014 implies the basin pm separation is a function f of applicable system nondimensional groups as illustrated in eq 9 given a set of basin geometric and loading conditions functions f maps these input parameters to a basin pm separation performance level deriving an explicit algebraic expression of the mapping function f from the first principle physical based approach is challenging because the partial differential equations in this case eqs 2 4 that govern the basin hydrodynamics and pm transport typically do not have analytical solutions whereas in the perspective of data driven modeling of basin pm separation eq 9 resembles the classic ml problem of supervised machine learning ng 2018 that is given a number of paired data x y ml models are trained to learn the non linear relationship f that maps x i e basin geometric features loading condition to y i e basin pm separation therefore four 4 classic data driven ml algorithms namely decision tree dt random forest rf artificial neural network ann and symbolic regression sr are developed and tested huang et al 2021 steven l brunton 2019 wu et al 2007 9 δ j f a r h a r v ϕ i ϕ o re sc ha fig 3 provides an illustrative diagram for training and deployment of the four ml models the databases generated from cfd simulations for a wide range of geometric configurations pm granulometry and loading conditions table 1 a total number of 1 6 10 5 combinations are first nondimensionalized to compress the dimensions of the features summarized in eq 9 for efficient model training as illustrated in fig 3b then basin configurations with the horizontal aspect ratio ar h 1 0 i e 80 000 out of 1 6 10 5 combinations physically corresponding to short wide basins are split from the databases and preserved for examining the generalizability of trained ml models for extrapolation the cfd database of ar h 1 0 the other 80 000 combinations of 1 6 10 5 combinations physically corresponding to long narrow basins is randomly divided to training validation and test datasets with a splitting ratio of 8 1 1 ng 2018 in total there are 64 000 8000 and 8000 i e ratio of 8 1 1 numbers of cfd generated paired data x y in the training validation and test datasets the datasets structure layouts for the ml model development are illustrated in fig 3b for example in the case of train dataset the ml model input x is a 64 000 by 7 matrix and the ml model output y is a 64 000 by 1 vector where the matrix column number of 7 corresponds to the seven 7 nondimensional groups derived from the dynamic similarity the lower and upper bounds of the input parameters in the training dataset are provided in table s1 similarly in the validation and test datasets the ml model inputs x are 8000 by 7 matrices and the ml model outputs y are a 8000 by 1 vectors in the ml model development the training dataset is used to optimize the ml model parameters such as weights and bias in ann the validation dataset is for optimizing the ml model architecture e g depth of tree in dt number of hidden layers in ann and controlling the learning process e g learning rate learning epochs known as hyperparameter optimization tuning the test dataset is applied to examine the ml models predictive capability on the datasets that are not seen by the ml models the test dataset is different from the extrapolation dataset ar h 1 0 even though the test dataset is not seen by the ml models the test dataset is similar to and in the range of the training data whereas the extrapolation dataset ar h 1 0 are beyond the range of basin configurations in the training dataset ar h 1 0 examination of ml models for exploration is particularly important as such assessment infers the generalizability of ml models in the application scenarios that are not only not seen by the ml models but also dissimilar from the basin configurations assembled in the training dataset friedman et al 2017 steven l brunton 2019 2 3 1 decision tree dt and random forest rf dt and rf are among the most popular approaches in data mining and ml rokach and maimon 2014 recently dt and rf are applied for detecting adverse water quality events in las vegas wash thompson and dickenson 2021 and predicting physical chemical characteristics of fecal sludge ward et al 2021 dt assembles a tree like model to estimate the mapping relations between input features and output labels as illustrated in eq 9 and fig 3c dt splits the data into subsets based on optimal splitting criteria that minimize the residual sum of squares or other objective functions such as weighted variance or information gain in each subset this splitting process recursively repeats for each derived subset the dt tree structure develops until the terminal node leaf is reached or termination criteria e g maximum tree depth minimum samples of a leaf are met compared with ml models such as ann and rf dt shows improved interpretability as a function of tree depth and the tree structure can be visualized the model prediction processes can be easily explained by the boolean logic in the tree structure such improved interpretability can elucidate the underlying patterns in a dataset notwithstanding dt can be prone to over fitting and also fail to generalize dt model structure can also be sensitive to the training dataset as the child branch splitting depends on the parent splitting small variation in the training dataset can result in a drastically different tree structure to mitigate potential over fitting the dt model structure is optimized with maximum tree depth and minimum samples of a leaf as shown in fig s5 a maximum tree depth of 30 and a minimum sample of a leaf of 8 is determined to improve upon dt random forest rf is developed based on the idea of ensemble learning i e bootstrap aggregating friedman et al 2017 rf is an ensemble of randomized dts as shown in fig 3c by aggregating and averaging the results of parallel dts the predictive capability is improved and over fitting is controlled in rf compared to dt rf has shown improved generalizability and generally outperforms dt friedman et al 2017 an optimal rf structure with a maximum tree depth of 30 a minimum sample of a leaf of 8 and the number of trees of 400 is determined by hyperparameter optimization probst et al 2019 as shown in fig s6 in this study dt and rf are implemented and developed based on a python based ml library of sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 2 3 2 artificial neural network ann as a universal approximator ann is shown to be capable of representing any function with sufficient artificial neurons hornik et al 1989 as illustrated in fig 4 artificial neurons are mathematical conceptualization of the neurons in a biological brain which receive signals form other neurons i e inputs process the signals such as g q w q x q b and pass the signal to the next neurons i e output as shown in fig 3d the ann applied here is a fully connected feed forward neural network ffnn i e a network of nested artificial neurons which is also known as a multi layer perceptron mpl the ann model is developed based on a python based imperative high performance deep learning library pytorch paszke et al 2019 the ann model consists of an input layer two hidden layers and an output layer forty 40 hidden neurons are used in both hidden layers the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons are determined by hyperparameter optimization as shown in fig s7 the activation function of the leaky rectified linear unit leaky relu is applied the standard logistic function is used in the output layer applying such a logistic function to bound the predicted pm separation can yield more efficient model training as illustrated by the learning curves in fig s8 the model training is terminated when the mean squared error mse on the validation dataset starts to increase while the mse on the training dataset continues to decrease 2 3 3 symbolic regression sr another ml technique applied to approximate the mapping function is sr as shown in fig 3e sr uses an evolutionary algorithm to search for an algebraic expression that best describes the relationship between input and output evolutionary algorithms are inspired by darwin s theory based on survival of the fittest and mimic the biological evolutionary process of reproduction mutation recombination and selection goldberg 1989 sr is particularly attractive for physics oriented ml because of the higher interpretability as compared to other ml techniques such as ann recently sr has been demonstrated to provide the capability of learning and discovering laws of physics and system dynamics from data without prior knowledge and assumptions brunton et al 2016 cranmer et al 2020 udrescu and tegmark 2020 moreover closed form algebraic expressions derived from sr are typically mathematically compact and do not require any special computation tools which are particularly suitable for practical engineering applications the sr applied here is based on a python based genetic programming library gplearn stephens 2016 in the application of sr the nondimensional groups are used as input and the pm separation defined in eqs 5 and 9 is used as output as illustrated in eq 9 and fig 3b no prior model structure is specified instead the evolutionary algorithm automatically explore the space of mathematical operations e g ln and assembles the algebraic expression with respect to a fitness function e g mean squared error mse sr aims to uncover and reveal the underlying relationships and model structures between the input and output data through the data driven approach this is different from the conventional regression analysis where a model structure is often presumed e g linear and log function in the model training an initial population size of 8000 is used in the evolutionary algorithms with a total generation of 100 similar to other ml models training the sr model training is terminated when the mse on the validation dataset increases i e overfitting in addition a parsimony coefficient of 0 001 is used to encourage the sr model training towards parsimonious model formulation i e less complex algebraic expressions the law of parsimony also known as occam s razor suggests when two model formulations yield similar predictions the less complex model formulation potentially generalizes better steven l brunton 2019 moreover because the sr model input features i e nondimensional groups are deduced from the dynamic similarity rather from arbitrary selection the physics knowledge of dynamic similarity is embedded into the sr model training improving the model generalizability 3 results 3 1 rt as a scaling index for separation of pm and total pm fig 5 illustrates the dependence of pm separation on the basin rt index in plot a for different pm settling velocity function of pm diameters pm density also shown in plot b is the predictive capability of an rt based empirical model of harper and baker 2003 that florida regulatory agencies currently adopt for evaluating basin pm separation st johns river water management district 2018 the expression for the harper and baker 2003 model is provided in table s2 fig 5 illustrates that rt alone is not a robust index to characterize the basin pm separation for the same rt value a wide range of pm separation can be expected as a function of pm settling velocity for a given pm settling velocity the pm separation generally increases as the rt increases however for the same rt there is high variability up to 40 this variability of pm separation for the same pm settling velocity and same rt is introduced by variation of detailed basin geometrics such as the aspect ratios previously identified li and sansalone 2021b additionally fig 5b implies that the rt based empirical model currently implemented for thousands of basins in recent decades is not an accurate representation for presumptive guidance with respect to basin pm separation on a per pm diameter basis δ j as indicated by the negative coefficient of determination r 2 0 167 since pm is never delivered from a drainage area to a uo such as a basin in a single discrete diameter or diameter range the results of fig 5 also point to a further examination of robustness of rt as an index for basin total pm separation δ in which δ j for the j th diameter particle or discrete increment range between selected diameters is integrated over the influent psd through application of eqs 5 and 6 fig 6 summarizes results of cfd simulation for basin total pm separation for three 3 heterodisperse psds finer medium and coarser in fig 2 with respect to rt previously proposed empirical models for basin total pm separation of brune 1953 harper and baker 2003 heinemarm 1981 united states department of agriculture 1983 are also plotted along with two field monitoring databases reported by harper and baker 2003 heinemarm 1981 the formulas of rt based empirical models are shown in table s2 in these empirical models brune 1953 and united states department of agriculture 1983 empirical models are developed with data from 40 large scale reservoirs with drainage area up to 478 km 2 the heinemarm 1981 formula is based on data from 20 smaller agricultural reservoirs with length range from 137 2 to 2254 6 m and drainage area range from 0 8 to 36 3 km 2 harper and baker 2003 formula is developed based on data of 13 urban stormwater basins with the length ranges approximately from 213 to 1310 m additionally plotted in fig 6 is a database of 159 total pm separation results from 26 commercially available urban water clarifiers from publicly available 3rd party testing reports li and sansalone 2020a this database is generated by physical modeling i e full scale testing with the coarser psd fig 2 reported and verified by the regulatory agencies in north america new jersey corporation for advanced technology njcat and canadian environmental technology verification cetv each of the 159 pm separation results plotted are based on sampling across a consistent and controlled regulatory specified set of loading conditions psd specific gravity surface loading rate flow duration and flow temperature for all clarifiers new jersey department of environmental protection 2021a cfd simulation results indicate that for a given psd as rt increases the total pm separation increases as in the case of pm however total pm separation is also significantly influenced by the psds and basin configuration parameters e g aspect ratios inlet outlet locations as expected for a given rt basins subject to coarser psd loading yield higher total pm separation especially at lower rt 10 hr the difference between coarser and finer psd can be as high as 40 with respect to total pm separation at the same time the dependence of total pm separation on basin configurations introduces additional variability for a given rt and psd a wide range of total pm separation instead of a single value is observed in these results compared with coarser psd this variability induced by basin configuration is much more pronounced for the finer psd 75 of the psd mass represented by the suspended fraction ranging from 20 to 40 moreover these differences and variability induced by psds and basin configuration decrease as the rt increases for rt 1000 hr minimal differences 10 in total pm separation between different psds are observed at this higher rt gravitational force dominates over the hydrodynamic drag force resulting in reduced dependence of total pm separation on the psd and basin configurations li and sansalone 2021c the consideration that arises is not a de minimus increases in basin performance above a given level i e 80 but basin economics for rt values in the range of several hundred to thousand hours at a given level of performance which will be illustrated in the discussion section meanwhile cfd results agree well with field data reported by harper and baker 2003 heinemarm 1981 except for 2 data points at rt of 30 hr 31 of the 33 field data sets from these datasets are reported to have a basin rt 200 hr for which the different empirical models agree at 10 with respect to cfd results especially for the finer psds differences between empirical models and cfd results are primarily observed for rt 200 hr for smaller basins but likely representing the majority of basins in urban land uses models of brune 1953 heinemarm 1981 united states department of agriculture 1983 predict lower total pm separations compared to the cfd results for models of brune 1953 united states department of agriculture 1983 their divergence from cfd results can be potentially explained noting that the databases of these model are not as representative of urban clarification basins for example an urban clarification basin typically has a much smaller depth than the large scale reservoirs used by hydropower plants and water supply verstraeten and poesen 2000 pm generated by urban activity and transported in rainfall runoff to clarification basins are also of significantly different psds as compared to the psds for large scale reservoirs sansalone et al 1998 in the case of the heinemarm 1981 model although the database is comprised of smaller reservoirs because of the nature of the regression technique the model prediction for rt 300 hr is solely controlled by these 2 data points at an rt 30 hr developing a model for rt 300 hr based on such limited samples number is not robust especially considering the basin total pm separation can exhibit larger variability influenced by the different basin configurations in the lower rt range as illustrated in fig 6 among the empirical models the harper and baker 2003 model yields improved agreement with cfd results for the finer psd specifically the harper and baker 2003 model and cfd predict a consistent trend of total pm separation with a finer psd for rt 200 hr however the harper and baker 2003 model and other empirical models are agnostic to the dependence of total pm separation on pm granulometry psd and particle specific gravity and predict 30 to 60 lower total pm separation for coarser psds at rt values of 200 hr these inaccurate predictions from empirical models for the coarser psds are illustrated by the physical modeling results of urban water clarifiers li and sansalone 2020a in contrast the cfd results of basin total pm separation for coarser psd show similar trends to the reported physical modeling results for urban water clarifiers note that the psd used in physical modeling for urban water clarifiers li and sansalone 2020a is identical to the coarser psd examined in this study the formulation of empirical models also did not consider the influence of basin geometric configuration on pm and total pm separation examined in the following section 3 2 scaling behavior for pm separation fig 7 illustrates the dependence of pm separation on various nondimensional groups compared to the relative inlet and outlet location the system pm separation is more dependent on the hazen number reynolds vertical and horizontal aspect ratios as indicated by the value of the pearson correlation coefficient r in each plot in particular the hazen number shows a clear and dominant influence on pm separation as all data are collapsed into a s shape curve for ha 1000 pm is completely separated δ j 1 0 irrespective of other nondimensional groups similarly for ha 0 01 minimal pm separation is observed for all cfd results this strong positive dependence with respect to the hazen number does indeed aligns with classical theoretical models for clarification such as surface overflow rate sor plug flow reactor pfr and continuous stirred tank reactor cstr for which the hazen number dependence has been hypothesized these theoretical models are shown in table s3 however a comparison with these classical theoretical models also illuminates the limitations of these models as shown in fig 8 a basin pm separation can be significantly different from and is primarily lower than the prediction of these classical models for a given hazen number a basin system can exhibit a wide range of pm separation 30 to 50 suggesting that only considering the hazen number dependence in predicting basin pm separation is necessary but not sufficient as the single nondimensional group in an analysis nevertheless a comparison between figs 7 and fig 5 demonstrates that the hazen number is a much more robust variable than an rt index for pm separation the hazen number is much more robust primarily because this nondimensional number takes into account the influence of pm settling velocity hazen number can be defined as a measure of rt normalized by the pm settling time scale t s h w s dhamotharan et al 1981 to investigate this multivariate dependence with respect to pm separation pm separation is examined as a function of the hazen number and colored by other nondimensional groups in fig 8 fig 8a and 8b illustrates that the variability in pm separation for a given hazen number can be primarily explained by the variation in the horizontal and vertical aspect ratios of a basin for a given hazen number the greater the basin horizontal aspect ratio physically corresponding to more long linear basin geometry instead of a lower basin horizontal aspect ratio as is the case for a square polygon basin geometry results in a higher pm separation this result agrees with previous studies of li and sansalone 2021b persson et al 1999 in which a long linear basin geometry is shown to mitigate potential short circuiting and promotes more favorable hydrodynamic conditions for pm separation compared to square basin geometry in addition for the range of basin depth considered 1 to 3 m a decrease in the basin vertical aspect ratio e g increase of basin depth yields higher pm separation harper and baker 2007 in contrast to the horizontal and vertical aspect ratios no clear trend in pm separation is observed for the relative inlet ϕ i and outlet locations ϕ o to account for these additional non linear effects on pm separation ml models are developed and examined in the following section 3 3 development and evaluation of ml models fig 9 compares the ml models of dt rf ann and sr for training validation test and an extrapolation dataset because training and validation datasets are used for model training and hyperparameter optimization they are not robust measures of model predictive capability the test dataset is not seen by the models and is therefore a more robust metric to evaluate the performance of the trained ml models ng 2018 across the test dataset in general all examined ml models provide high predictive capability with a coefficient of determination r 2 consistently above 0 990 the ann model yields the highest r 2 0 994 closely followed by rf dt and sr the ann predicted pm separation is within 15 of cfd simulations which are significant improvements in comparison to the rt based empirical model r 2 0 167 fig 5 and hazen based theoretical model fig 8a in contrast to the good performance in the test dataset the ml models degenerate in the extrapolation dataset the predictive capability of the ml models in terms of r 2 decreases and ranges from 0 889 to 0 979 in the extrapolation dataset ml models of dt rf and sr show comparable predictive capability in the extrapolation dataset with r 2 0 972 conversely the ann model that yields the highest r 2 in the test dataset exhibits the weakest generalizability in the extrapolation dataset differences between ann model prediction and cfd simulation in the extrapolation dataset are primarily observed for higher levels of pm separation and can be as large as 80 these results indicate the challenge and risk in applying ml models to basin configurations that are not included in or are not similar to the training dataset suggesting the robust ml models development needs a large and diverse dataset for the training among the ml models evaluated the sr model is the most mathematically compact and physically interpretative the sr model indicates the basin pm separation is primarily a function of the hazen number and the horizontal aspect ratio as defined by eqs 10 and 11 these two features of the sr model were not defined in the model training but are an outcome of the evolutionary optimization this result for the functionality of the hazen number and horizontal aspect ratio as the primary features reinforces and is consistent with previous observations in figs 7 and 8 in these figures the hazen number shows a dominant effect with respect to pm separation with the additional influence of the horizontal aspect ratio both of which have a physical basis as shown in fig 10 the feature importance computed from rf also identifies the significance of these two parameters in which hazen number and horizontal aspect ratio are the basin features that represent the first two leading factors 10 h ln ha 3 2 0 62 and ar ln ar h 0 67 1 24 11 δ j s 2 h exp s ar h in this equation h and ar are model parameters s x 1 1 exp x is the standard logistic function with respect to total pm separation fig 11 and table 2 illustrate that the ml models such as ann and sr provide a significant improvement as compared to the rt based empirical model of harper and baker 2003 ml models correctly capture the dependence of total pm separation based on the psd and the r 2 of ml models ranges from 0 978 and 0 983 with a prediction accuracy within 15 as shown in table 2 compared to ann the sr illustrates a comparable level of predictive capability the difference in predictive capability between ann and sr in the pm separation δ j fig 9 is reduced in the total pm separation δ this reduced difference in predictive capability is because the total pm separation as a comparison metric is less sensitive to the modeling error in comparison to the pm separation li and sansalone 2021c as illustrated by eqs 5 and 6 m j δ j δ j for m j 1 0 meanwhile compared to ann the model representation and computation based on sr are drastically simplified the developed ann model is comprised of two 2 hidden layers with 40 neurons in each which results in a total number of 2001 model parameters weights and bias ann computation can be complex and may require a designated platform e g sklearn pytorch tensorflow even though ann can be deployed as a software or web application in contrast sr is completely defined by only two 2 algebraic equations such a simple surrogate formulation is critical for efficient application in practical engineering planning and regulatory settings the computation of sr is also straightforward and can be facilitated by conventional and common digital tools such as spreadsheets 4 discussion 4 1 pareto frontier and the economy of basin design the observed scaling behavior with respect to separation of pm and also total pm has critical implications for the economy of basin design and urban water management as highlighted in the following case fig 12 illustrates the basin design economy by a pareto frontier diagram for an example site in southwest florida with a mean wet season flowrate of 0 1 m 3 s and coarser heterodisperse influent psd these site hydrological conditions and pm loading characteristics are measured from a 12 month in situ field monitoring florida department of transportation 2016 li et al 2021c previously cfd results for this basin and watershed conditions table 1 are plotted along with different design methods and their corresponding construction cost the total unit construction cost including annual operating and maintenance costs for a 20 year life of a basin in the year 2021 is estimated to 87 9 usd m 3 with respect to permanent pool volume based on the reported unit construction cost of 70 6 usd m 3 for the year 2010 minnesota pollution control agency 2021 and an average annual inflation rate of 2 02 between the year 2010 to 2021 u s bureau of labor statistics 2021 to achieve 80 for total pm separation a common presumptive guidance level current rt guidance 14 days rt and empirical models of harper and baker 2003 heinemarm 1981 require a basin with a permanent pool volume of 1 8 10 5 m 3 6 4 10 6 ft 3 and a construction cost of 16 million usd in contrast cfd simulation and a more robust sr model indicate a permanent pool volume of 1 3 10 3 m 3 4 7 10 4 ft 3 with a construction cost of 117 thousand usd resulting in a direct cost reduction of approximately 15 8 million usd for coarser psd loading and δ 0 8 the sr model consistently yields at least two order magnitude smaller basin geometry compared to the empirical models of harper and baker 2003 heinemarm 1981 furthermore the application of the sr model eqs 10 11 as a simple algebraic function may be more direct than current regulatory guidance and empirical models the only additional information that the sr model requires is the site pm granulometry psd density which are now reasonably documented nevertheless such information can be obtained through field sampling and the measurement cost of psd is nominal to negligible as compared to the potentially reduced construction cost 15 8 million usd in this case in most states psd data are available for surficial soil types and from soil surveys therefore applying the proposed sr model along with field psd measurement or tabulated psds from soil surveys in basin design and regulation is a nominal requirement that can readily transcend to the current state of the practice moreover cfd simulations and the sr model in fig 12 reveals the basin construction cost scales exponentially to the total pm separation note that construction cost is plotted on a logarithmic scale an important observation is that a relatively small improvement in total pm separation requires an exponential investment in system dimensions and cost such an exponential scaling behavior is magnified with a higher total pm separation range δ 0 8 and finer psd for example suppose the proposed basin is required to enhance total pm separation from 80 to 95 typically a regulatory requirement for a listed or protected receiving water body in this scenario the basin dimension needs to be enlarged by two orders of magnitude and this increase extends to the basin cost in an even more common scenario where an existing basin has become impaired not achieving presumptive guidance because of initial design or increased constituent loads from the drainage area development or re development such as infill a basin retrofit is generally addressed through a conventional approach of increasing surface area and volume which would directionally result in a significant cost escalation the re dimensioning of an impaired basin is even more physically and economically challenging than that of a proposed basin given the potential modification to infrastructure adjacency that has developed since the basin was initially constructed this exponential scaling in cost indicates the design and retrofit of a basin to improve the total pm or pm partitioned chemicals separation by only enlarging the system dimension is not a cost effective approach especially when a higher total pm separation of 95 is desired or having to achieve for example the initial presumptive guidance of 80 from the current impaired basin behavior this particularly challenges the existing rt based basin design guidance and regulation since an increase in rt can only be accommodated by enlarging system dimension and basin construction and land costs instead basin design or retrofit design should be optimized to minimize cost escalation largely driven by lost opportunity cost of land by exploring the more effective design configuration that is beyond the current pareto frontier offered by conventional basin configurations i e polygon shape fig 1 a demonstrated approach integrates cfd with an evolutionary algorithm to strategically configuring adsorption filtration permeable baffle system into the existing configuration and size of a basin without increasing basin dimensions li and sansalone 2021b li et al 2021c shows that with such a method a relative increase of 58 8 in total pm separation can be achieved by baffled basin design compared to the conventional basin design i e plain polygon basin 4 2 ml models as an adjuvant of cfd for practical application adoption and acceptance of cfd for water infrastructure is an indisputable trend yet reinvigorating the user s hydrodynamic and numerical methods educational tools that have not been exercised as a result of time and the existing state of the practice represent a major barrier for the immediate and widespread adoption of cfd in the water related industries in parallel to the ongoing efforts of enhancing the education in computing techniques in current civil and environmental engineering curricula liu et al 2020 this study presents a method of utilizing ml models as an adjuvant tool for robust and efficient dissemination and application of cfd simulations to engineering planning and regulatory stakeholders such ml models once developed do not require cfd skill to apply and can be seamlessly integrated with current planning engineering and regulatory practices application of such ml models results such as from sr shown herein are as simple as existing rules of thumb yet such ml models leverage the predictive capability of cfd such an ml based adjuvant tool is particularly attractive to complex and repetitive engineering design applications where the quantity of interest e g pm separation chemicals temperature is a non linear function of numerous design parameters the ml model not only can approximate the mapping function but also can identify the dominant design features parameters and guide the design optimization as shown in fig 10 notwithstanding applications of such ml models should be treated with careful consideration when the ml models are extrapolated to engineering design and situations that are not included in nor similar to the training dataset fig 9 illustrates the performance degeneration and potential limitation of ml models in such application scenarios fig 9 also implies that for robust development of such ml models the training data should be sufficiently large and diverse such that in an application the ml model operates more through interpolation rather than by extrapolation steven l brunton 2019 however in many civil and environmental engineering cases obtaining such a large number of high quality and diverse training data is a significant challenge and often laborious and of added cost e g basin data in this study in such a small data regime direct applying the common ml model is not robust raissi et al 2019 even though this is commonly carried out in recent literature one method that has been proposed to circumvent this issue is integrating the physical laws and develop physics informed ml models karniadakis et al 2021 another possible approach is taking advantage of massively parallel computing resources and use cfd models to generate a large and diverse training database for ml model training as illustrated by this study future research should extend current effort and examine more complex basin configurations and conditions such as multiple inlets khan et al 2011 vegetated littoral zones sonnenwald et al 2019 cohesive pm as sediment zhang et al 2018 internal baffling garofalo and sansalone 2018 and irregular geometries sonnenwald et al 2018 the influence of unsteady hydraulic pm granulometry and chemical loadings partitioning on the basin clarification performance over a long time scale e g years also requires further investigation and characterization helping to mitigate the common outcome of basin impairment especially for the nexus of land redevelopment and continued climate change moreover the illustrated cfd augmented ml modeling approach can be potentially extended to improve the parameterization of water chemistry functionality of a wide range of bmps in the process based dynamics model e g swmm for watershed scale simulation last the current research can be potentially further improved by extending the depth averaged cfd model to 3d multi phase unsteady rans with availability of additional computational resources 5 conclusions this study examines the robustness of residence time rt and also of nondimensional groups of geometric and dynamic similarity as potential indices to scale clarification basin performance as pm and total pm separation cfd simulation of pm transport and fate for a wide range of basin configuration loading conditions and pm characteristics are carried out with a total number of parametric combinations of 1 6 10 5 cfd results agree well with the basin field monitoring data and physical modeling results of urban water clarifiers as reported in the literature based on the database generated by cfd machine learning ml models of decision tree dt random forest rf artificial neural networks ann and symbolic regression sr are developed and compared for interpolation and extrapolation an sr model is distilled from cfd simulations and is proposed to provide simple surrogate equations for basin geometric design and regulation the results of this study yield the following conclusions rt as a sole index is not a robust index to scale pm nor total pm separation and by extension pm partitioned chemicals pm and total pm separation depends on pm granulometry and basin geometrics to which rt criteria are agnostic consequently the existing rt based empirical models are not representative for a wide range of basin configurations and conditions in particular rt based empirical models underpredict the total pm separation for coarser psd by 30 to 60 compared to cfd simulation and physical modeling of urban water clarifiers rt based empirical models developed by regression are sensitive to the choice of regression data the sample number of empirical models is particularly limited for rt 200 hr corresponding to small basins or basins that receive high hydraulic loading for large basins or basins that receive low hydraulic loading rt 2000 hr good agreement 10 between empirical models and cfd are observed simply because of the increased influence of gravitational forces on pm separation dominates potential misrepresentations by empirical models basin pm separation can be primarily characterized by a nondimensional hazen number followed by basin horizontal aspect ratio and vertical aspect ratio with lesser dependence on relative inlet and outlet locations the hazen number as an index for pm separation is improved from rt criteria by additionally considering the pm granulometry the hazen number can be thought of as rt normalized by pm settling time scale t s notwithstanding the hazen number alone is not sufficient to characterize pm separation for example the basin horizontal aspect ratio can affect pm separation by 30 to 50 as shown in figs 8 and 10 in the examined basin configuration a higher horizontal aspect ratio promotes pm separation ml models can serve as an adjuvant tool for simple and efficient and application of cfd in practical basin design and regulation trained ml models of dt rf ann and sr predict cfd simulations of total pm separation within 15 representing significant improvement compared with empirical formulas and theoretical models of sor as shown in 11 the proposed sr model as defined in eqs 10 and 11 is well suited for practical engineering applications because of the explicit closed form expression and simple computations basin construction cost scales exponentially to the total pm separation such scaling behavior is further magnified at higher pm separation δ 80 as a function of psd linear increase in total pm separation demands an exponentially increased system dimension and basin cost this suggests improving the basin pm separation by simply enlarging system dimension increasing the rt is not a cost effective approach especially when a higher total pm separation of 95 is targeted or required cost effective basin design should consider the site specific pm granulometry psd density and explore more efficient basin design for pm separation and pm partitioned chemicals such as strategically configuring with internal baffles without increasing surface area

16444,stormwater runoff typically contains significant quantities of metal contaminants that enter urban waterways over short durations and represent a potential risk to water quality the origin of metals within the catchment and processes that occur over the storm can control the partitioning of metals between a range of different forms understanding the fraction of metals present in a form that is potentially bioavailable to aquatic organisms is useful for environmental risk assessment to help provide this information the forms and dynamics of metal contaminants in an urban system were assessed across a storm temporal patterns in the concentration of metals in dissolved and particulate total suspended solids tss forms were assessed from water samples and diffusive gradients in thin films dgts were deployed to measure the dgt labile time integrated metal concentration results indicate that the concentrations of dissolved and tss associated metals increased during the storm with the metals al cd co cu pb and zn representing the greatest concern relative to water quality guideline values gvs the portion of labile metal as measured by dgt devices indicated that during the storm a substantial fraction 98 of metals were complexed and pose a lower risk of acute toxicity to aquatic organisms comparison of dgt results to gvs indicate that current gvs are likely quite conservative when assessing stormwater pollution risks with regards to metal contaminants this study provides valuable insight into the forms and dynamics of metals in an urban system receiving stormwater inputs and assists with the development of improved approaches for the assessment of short term intermittent discharge events graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioavailable dissolved organic matter water quality guidelines partitioning labile 1 introduction urban stormwater increases the pollutant loading of receiving waterbodies and is a major cause of water quality degradation pitt et al 1995 pollutants in stormwater occur in a diverse range of physical chemical and biological forms originating from various natural and anthropogenic processes makepeace et al 1995 metal contaminants are amongst the most commonly reported stormwater pollutants worldwide and continue to be identified as priority pollutants zgheib et al 2012 in stormwater high concentrations of metals are primarily attributed to anthropogenic sources including metal surfaces roofing and construction sites vehicles brake and tyre wear exhaust and runoff from commercial and industrial activities brown and peake 2006 the metals in stormwater can be present in a range of different forms which can strongly influence the risk posed by stormwater entering natural waterbodies morrison et al 1990 sansalone and buchberger 1997 of particular importance are metals that exist in bioavailable forms that can be taken up by and cross biological membranes and are specifically influenced by lability from dissolved complexes colloidal and particulate forms as well as other water quality characteristics batley et al 2004 simpson et al 2014 most simplistically measuring the labile free and easily dissociated metal concentration gives a good prediction of potential metal bioavailability apte et al 2005 labile metal species are operationally defined and include free metal ion species as well as weakly bound inorganic and organic complexes of metals batley et al 2004 the partitioning of metals between different forms can be controlled by a variety of factors including dry and wet period deposition processes surrounding water chemistry and surface characteristics dean et al 2005 lee et al 2004 specifically the ph of the surrounding water as well as the amount and composition of dissolved organic matter dom can strongly influence the dissolved metal speciation and potential hazard of the metals under acidic conditions with low buffering capacity free metal ion concentrations are higher increasing the proportion of labile metal forms dom is a ubiquitous component of natural waters and is commonly quantified by measuring the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc characterising the composition of dom is important as the chemical make up of dom specifically the proportion of humic substances hs inclusive of humic and fulvic acid determines the ability of dom to reduce the lability of metals in the surrounding aquatic environment macoustra et al 2021 trenfield et al 2011 although ubiquitous dom composition is not consistent and can change markedly between systems and in response to local processes such as rainfall and temperature holland et al 2018 macoustra et al 2020 water quality guideline values gvs are routinely used in urban environments as a first step in assessing the risk of adverse effects of a toxicant to aquatic organisms the gvs for metal toxicants are typically derived using species sensitivity distributions of toxic effects data e g effect concentration 10 ec10 obtained from laboratory based tests where animals are continuously exposed to dissolved metals warne et al 2018 in these bioassays metals are present in solution in highly labile and bioavailable forms predominantly as free metals ions or as weakly bound complexes when applying gvs it is appropriate to make comparisons to the measured concentration of labile metal forms in the case of stormwater runoff the proportion of dissolved metals in a labile form is expected to vary across the storm hydrograph as such an outstanding issue associated with the application of gvs to stormwater runoff is that aquatic biota accessing or inhabiting these urban waterways are frequently exposed to short term pules of metals therefore current gvs may not provide environmentally relevant assessments for stormwater runoff where such guidelines may be quite conservative diamond et al 2006 the continued assessment of urban waterways requires an improved understanding of contaminant dynamics in stormwater runoff while the concentration of metals in dissolved forms are typically reported for urban stormwater limited research has investigated the fraction of these metals that are likely to cause toxicity to aquatic biota to address these risks the current study aimed to investigate the forms of metals in a representative highly degraded urban creek system over the duration of a storm while also monitoring key water chemistry parameters that have been shown to influence metal speciation the changes in metal concentrations and forms e g dissolved and labile during the storm were investigated from water samples and diffusive gradients in thin films dgts and the potential for ecological risk evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study focused on the moonee ponds creek mpc sub catchment one of five major north south flowing tributaries of the yarra river in melbourne australia the mpc catchment area covers 136 km2 with a mix of recreational residential industrial and transport rail freeway and airport land uses see supporting information s1 it is highly modified and concrete lined along the middle and lower parts with several major stormwater drains entering the creek along its 25 km length samples were collected from the lower catchment 37 7908 144 9365 approximately 3 km upstream from where the mpc joins the yarra river the study site is surrounded by a grassed floodplain with minimal natural riparian habitat and is proximal to significant rail and road infrastructure see supporting information s1 s2 the study was conducted during the austral summer autumn period between the 23rd of february and the 18th of march 2021 2 2 sample collection all sampling equipment bottles and plasticware were

samples 1 l precleaned hdpe bottles nalgene were collected fig 1 sample bottles were preconditioned with site water prior to taking the sample water samples were collected over the rising limb of the storm hydrograph using purpose built rising stage samplers deployed as duplicates that enabled five 1 l samples to be collected as the creek levels rose for a full description of rising stage sampler production methods see the supporting information section s3 retrieval of water samples collected by the rising stage samplers occurred within 24 h of deployment when it was safe to enter the creek sample field blanks were included as follows clean bottles filled with milli q water were transported to the study site exposed briefly resealed and then transported back to the laboratory for analysis the dgts were purchased from dgt research lancaster uk as the lsnm np pre loaded solution deployment model with a 0 14 mm polyethersulphone filter membrane 0 8 mm apa agarose crosslinked polyacrylamide diffusive gel and chelex100 binding gel the diffusive boundary layer dbl has been previously shown to be an important factor in the accuracy of measuring dgt labile concentrations in the current study the simple use of dgts with a single diffusive gel thickness does not accommodate for variations in the dgt labile concentration due to variable creek streamflow where dgt labile concentrations may be underestimated by up to 50 turner et al 2012 however as linear flow rates were consistently above 0 02 m s table 1 the dbl would be thin and unlikely to significantly affect the overall precision of the device gimpel et al 2001 deployment and or collection of dgt devices coincided with the collection of grab samples over the storm hydrograph phases fig 1 five sets of dgts dgt

on the dgt was noted and photographed grab samples and dgts were transported back to an analytical chemistry laboratory and processed as described below in a laminar flow cabinet within 2 h of collection rising limb samples collected by the rising stage sampler samples rl 1 5 were collected as soon as it was safe to do so post storm this additional holding time 22 h prior to sample

oxygen and ph were not measured during the rising limb of the storm hydrograph due to unsafe sampling conditions the storm exhibited a relatively sharp hydrograph as expected for a flashy urban system table 1 figs 1 and 2 temperature values ranged from 17 to 21 c and were typical of late summer early autumn conditions electrical conductivity fluctuated over the storm decreasing from a maximum of 1770 µs cm before the event to a low of 205 µs cm on the falling limb low conductivity values over the falling limb and during baseline conditions stormtime 3 d 971 µs cm are both likely due to freshwater inputs entering the creek system during rainfall events dissolved oxygen do saturation varied during the storm and ranged between 52 and 95 saturation the ph was generally stable during

stormwater runoff kalev and toor 2020 doc concentrations rapidly decreased over the falling limb to baseline concentrations which were maintained post storm the increase in doc during the storm indicates an increase in the concentration of humic and fulvic acids which are the principal organic ligands attributed to metal complexation in natural waters tipping 1998 3 1 2 cdom components four main components of cdom were determined by feem scans followed by parafac analysis the parafac model used to determine the cdom components was compared against other published models in the openfluor

c2 humic like 2 c3 and protein like c4 temporal variation in the relative abundance of cdom components occurred across different phases of the storm hydrograph see supporting information s15 the baseline and post storm dom pool was equally dominated by the fulvic like and both humic like components described in the literature as being microbially and terrestrially derived respectively murphy et al 2011 williams et al 2013 during the rising limb of the storm hydrograph the fulvic like and smaller humic like 1 components were the most dominant with the protein like component making up a notably higher proportion of the dom pool f 3 24 54 76 p 0 001 compared to other phases rising limb samples were characterised by having considerable p 0 001 negative correlations to calculated molecular weight indices see supporting information s15 indicating the dominance of a more degraded humic component during the storm a decrease in aromaticity indices over the rising limb is associated with a spike in the amount of proteinaceous material produced by microbes and phytoplankton within the creek system possibly providing an indication of stormwater runoff contaminated with sewage and nutrient inputs murphy et al 2011 3 2 metal forms 3 2 1 dissolved metals all dissolved metal and metalloid concentrations cdm excluding selenium exhibited narrow pollutographs pollutant

case of the 13 mm storm sampled in this study pollutographs did not show a clear dilution effect during the storm as cdm peaks did not stagnate or decrease whilst peak flow remained high this suggests that the dissolved metal concentrations were influenced by rainfall volume and intensity and resulting streamflow dynamics but not catchment source depletion i e the source continued to release metals

contaminants are effectively mobilised from a number of high strength sources e g road dust building infrastructure via piped stormwater runoff resulting in flashy pollutographs it is worth noting that the dissolved metal fraction in this study was operationally defined and included colloids 0 001 0 45 µm as it is well recognised that the filtration of water through a 0 45 µm filter does not completely separate truly dissolved and colloidal metal forms van leeuwen and buffle 2009 as a result of this it is likely that a reasonable percentage 50 of dissolved al and fe would be present as inorganic colloidal forms and have reduced mobility van dam et al 2008 see section 3 2 3 3 2 2 total suspended solids and their metal concentrations total suspended solid tss concentrations ranged from 10 to 19 mg l during baseline conditions then increased substantially f 3 24 11 32 p 0 0013 during the rising limb of the storm hydrograph peaking at 307 mg l fig 3 post storm tss concentrations decreased over a period of five days to baseline concentrations measured patterns of tss are typical of storm events where the high tss concentrations during the storm reflect the increased mobilisation of tss from road side dusts atmospheric deposition and natural inputs baum et al 2021 the concentration of metals attached to the tss ctss increased rapidly over the rising limb of the storm hydrograph suggesting that stormwater runoff is a major source of tss associated metals the ctss hydrograph dynamics of the six key metals al cd co cu pb and zn is provided in fig 3 below with the ctss hydrograph dynamics of less significant metals and metalloids as cr fe mn ni and se provided in the supporting information section s17 partition coefficient values kd ctss cdm l kg values reported are log kd calculated for all metals were 4 l kg during baseline and post storm conditions suggesting a significant preference of metals for the solid phase during this time see supporting information s18 during the storm kd values substantially p 0 05 decreased over the rising limb for all metals except for cr ni and se indicating that during this time a greater proportion of metals existed in the operationally defined dissolved phase low kd values during this period were likely due to loosely bound metals dissolved colloidal and complexes desorbing from particulates as a function of ph rainfall intensity and pavement residence time doc has been found to play a key role in the partitioning of metals where interactions between metals and organic matter can result in the complexion of metals with hs thereby consolidating these metals in the dissolved phase herngren et al 2005 similarly colloidal metals may also contribute significantly towards the lower apparent kd values during the storm during the falling limb of the storm hydrograph kd values increased to above 4 l kg for all metals and metalloids excluding selenium most likely as a result of the repartitioning of metals onto particulates as fresh binding sites became available during the storm 3 2 3 dgt labile metals in general the dgt labile concentrations cdgt of key metal contaminants in the mpc increased during storm deployment except for co where the concentration remained stable over the storm table 2 one way anovas indicated that for al cd cu and zn these observed increases in cdgt during storm was considerable al f 2 4 15 22 p 0 014 cd f 3 8 22 55 p 0 001 cu f 3 11 63 66 p 0 001 zn f 3 11 111 6 p 0 001 the cdgt measured during this study corresponded to 1 of the total dissolved concentration for al 1 5 for cd co cu and pb and 6 12 for zn during baseline and post storm hydrograph phases table 2 during the storm measured percent dgt labile fractions were 2 for all key metals to determine whether the dgt labile metal concentrations across the storm hydrograph could be predicted using the open source speciation modelling visual minteq maximum dynamic concentration c dyn max outputs were compared to measured dgt labile concentrations as a percentage of the total dissolved metal concentration table 2 throughout all phases of the storm the labile fractions for all metals were overestimated by the model generally organic complexes dominated the predicted speciation for all metals except co where the speciation profile was dominated by the free ion see supporting information s19 for the complete visual minteq output the predicted metal speciation during the storm indicated that labile metal concentrations should be highly dynamic particularly during the rising limb when initial runoff entered and mixed with the creek waters e g the predicted total concentration of cd 2 increased from 1 to 28 over the rising limb see supporting information s19 this observation points to a key issue associated with using modelling programs to predict the forms of metals in a system during short term discharge events with highly variable water quality profiles specifically natural systems experience dynamic changes in water chemistry during a storm and are unlikely to be at equilibrium one of the major assumptions made by speciation modelling programs therefore speciation modelling of these dynamic conditions tends to underestimate the amount of labile metal present as equilibrium based speciation calculations assign metals to complexes that would otherwise contribute towards the labile fraction mebane et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 this suggests that an empirical approach to measuring labile metal concentrations e g passive sampling devices such as dgts rather than a modelling approach would provide more accurate results for regulation and management purposes the amount of measured dgt labile metal indicates that during the storm a substantial fraction of the key metals 99 were complexed colloidal or complexed with dom and likely to exhibit low mobility and bioavailability these low dgt labile concentrations are likely influenced by the elevated doc concentrations measured during the storm 15 0 20 1 mg l and the high proportion of hs present in the dom 84 it is well established that metal cations have a strong affinity for binding to dom especially cu and pb that form strong complexes with organic ligands present in stormwater ke et al 2018 in comparison zn is weakly complexed with dom and cd tends to have very low levels of complexion with organic matter simpson et al 2014 stockdale et al 2015 modelling undertaken with visual minteq predicted minimal 40 humic complexion for al co and zn this suggests that during the storm large fractions of these metals may have been complexed by anthropogenic chelating agents such as edta ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid nowack 2002 previous studies have observed synthetic chelating agents that can have a higher affinity for complexing metals than natural dom to be present and extremely persistent in urban waters baken et al 2011 3 3 water quality guideline values for assessing ecotoxicity risk the majority of dissolved metal concentrations cdm were below gvs for 90 species protection during the storm hydrograph period except for the six key metals al cd co cu pb and zn fig 2 it should be noted that the gv for cobalt is considered to have unknown reliability due to the limited data for the chronic toxicity of co to freshwater biota anzg 2018 these six metals exceeding gvs would be considered primary targets for stormwater management strategies with cu pb and zn previously identified as priority contaminants in stormwater runoff zgheib et al 2012 hardness adjusted gvs for metals in freshwater were not used in this study despite alkalinity concentrations measured below the limit of detection lod 1 mg caco3 l during the storm the reasoning for this choice is that alkalinity quickly surpassed the standard hardness value of 30 mg caco3 l post storm where hardness adjusted gvs may not be appropriate for short term use in a dynamic system to assess the ecological risk that the six key metals pose risk quotients for 90 species protection for each storm phase were calculated from the dgt labile and dissolved metal concentration to give a simple screening level estimate of high risk conditions as an interim measure in lieu of short term specific guidelines current gvs were applied to characterise the risk of metals in stormwater even though these guidelines are not relevant to such exposures as a result current gvs would at least be quite conservative assuming that there is no risk of latent effects if stormwater pulse exposures were frequent with minimal recovery periods cumulative effects may occur and current gvs would be appropriate throughout the storm dgt labile metal concentrations were below the risk quotients based on 90 species protection values fig 4 these results imply that while dissolved concentrations exceeded gvs and imply a risk of toxicity the portion of dgt labile and potentially bioavailable metal posed little risk of toxicity to 90 of species when applying the respective gv anzg 2018 results of this study demonstrated how dgts are useful for assessing the time averaged labile concentration of metals and the risk they pose to aquatic biota over a short term exposure given the cost effectiveness and ease of use current regulatory and management practices would benefit from incorporating dgts into stormwater monitoring hayman et al 2019 using this method a risk quotient approach derived from dgt measurements can be included in environmental impact assessments for waterways affected by intermittent pulse events that may result in highly variable pollutant profiles the results of this study indicate that for the storm sampled the dissolved metal concentrations should not pose a risk of adverse effects to most aquatic biota the simple application of gvs appears to offer sufficient protection for the highly disturbed mpc system during the sampled storm event in the context of stormwater runoff an outstanding issue with regards to intermittent short term pulse discharges is the response of aquatic organisms to metals at varying exposure durations and frequencies gvs based on chronic toxicity tests will generally achieve overly conservative outcomes since organisms can typically tolerate higher concentrations of dissolved metals for shorter exposure durations compared to continuous exposures diamond et al 2006 however short pulse exposures that are repeated over time are known to generally result in increased toxic effects gordon et al 2012 an option here is to modify existing gvs by a factor relating to the exposure duration frequency and magnitude to achieve protective but not overly conservative results for intermittent discharge scenarios the time averaged concentration tac allows for these modifications to be made where tacs have been found to be good predictors of pulse exposure metal toxicity for a range of aquatic organisms angel et al 2017 however for optimal prediction of pulse exposure toxicity the application of tacs to current gvs requires the concentration and duration of the pulse to be known this may prove to be a challenge for stormwater monitoring where storms can show high inter storm variability passive samplers such as the dgt devices used in this study measure a time integrated concentration and provide a useful way for regulatory authorities to monitor tacs during storm events 4 conclusions the detection of very low 1 labile metal concentrations in an urban system impacted by stormwater runoff is valuable for researchers and regulators principal factors influencing the concentration of dissolved metals and the fraction of dgt labile metals were ph and dom concentration and composition dgts are effective for stormwater monitoring and provide a way to translate the presence of metal contaminants to the risk posed understanding the differences in metal forms and

16444,stormwater runoff typically contains significant quantities of metal contaminants that enter urban waterways over short durations and represent a potential risk to water quality the origin of metals within the catchment and processes that occur over the storm can control the partitioning of metals between a range of different forms understanding the fraction of metals present in a form that is potentially bioavailable to aquatic organisms is useful for environmental risk assessment to help provide this information the forms and dynamics of metal contaminants in an urban system were assessed across a storm temporal patterns in the concentration of metals in dissolved and particulate total suspended solids tss forms were assessed from water samples and diffusive gradients in thin films dgts were deployed to measure the dgt labile time integrated metal concentration results indicate that the concentrations of dissolved and tss associated metals increased during the storm with the metals al cd co cu pb and zn representing the greatest concern relative to water quality guideline values gvs the portion of labile metal as measured by dgt devices indicated that during the storm a substantial fraction 98 of metals were complexed and pose a lower risk of acute toxicity to aquatic organisms comparison of dgt results to gvs indicate that current gvs are likely quite conservative when assessing stormwater pollution risks with regards to metal contaminants this study provides valuable insight into the forms and dynamics of metals in an urban system receiving stormwater inputs and assists with the development of improved approaches for the assessment of short term intermittent discharge events graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioavailable dissolved organic matter water quality guidelines partitioning labile 1 introduction urban stormwater increases the pollutant loading of receiving waterbodies and is a major cause of water quality degradation pitt et al 1995 pollutants in stormwater occur in a diverse range of physical chemical and biological forms originating from various natural and anthropogenic processes makepeace et al 1995 metal contaminants are amongst the most commonly reported stormwater pollutants worldwide and continue to be identified as priority pollutants zgheib et al 2012 in stormwater high concentrations of metals are primarily attributed to anthropogenic sources including metal surfaces roofing and construction sites vehicles brake and tyre wear exhaust and runoff from commercial and industrial activities brown and peake 2006 the metals in stormwater can be present in a range of different forms which can strongly influence the risk posed by stormwater entering natural waterbodies morrison et al 1990 sansalone and buchberger 1997 of particular importance are metals that exist in bioavailable forms that can be taken up by and cross biological membranes and are specifically influenced by lability from dissolved complexes colloidal and particulate forms as well as other water quality characteristics batley et al 2004 simpson et al 2014 most simplistically measuring the labile free and easily dissociated metal concentration gives a good prediction of potential metal bioavailability apte et al 2005 labile metal species are operationally defined and include free metal ion species as well as weakly bound inorganic and organic complexes of metals batley et al 2004 the partitioning of metals between different forms can be controlled by a variety of factors including dry and wet period deposition processes surrounding water chemistry and surface characteristics dean et al 2005 lee et al 2004 specifically the ph of the surrounding water as well as the amount and composition of dissolved organic matter dom can strongly influence the dissolved metal speciation and potential hazard of the metals under acidic conditions with low buffering capacity free metal ion concentrations are higher increasing the proportion of labile metal forms dom is a ubiquitous component of natural waters and is commonly quantified by measuring the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc characterising the composition of dom is important as the chemical make up of dom specifically the proportion of humic substances hs inclusive of humic and fulvic acid determines the ability of dom to reduce the lability of metals in the surrounding aquatic environment macoustra et al 2021 trenfield et al 2011 although ubiquitous dom composition is not consistent and can change markedly between systems and in response to local processes such as rainfall and temperature holland et al 2018 macoustra et al 2020 water quality guideline values gvs are routinely used in urban environments as a first step in assessing the risk of adverse effects of a toxicant to aquatic organisms the gvs for metal toxicants are typically derived using species sensitivity distributions of toxic effects data e g effect concentration 10 ec10 obtained from laboratory based tests where animals are continuously exposed to dissolved metals warne et al 2018 in these bioassays metals are present in solution in highly labile and bioavailable forms predominantly as free metals ions or as weakly bound complexes when applying gvs it is appropriate to make comparisons to the measured concentration of labile metal forms in the case of stormwater runoff the proportion of dissolved metals in a labile form is expected to vary across the storm hydrograph as such an outstanding issue associated with the application of gvs to stormwater runoff is that aquatic biota accessing or inhabiting these urban waterways are frequently exposed to short term pules of metals therefore current gvs may not provide environmentally relevant assessments for stormwater runoff where such guidelines may be quite conservative diamond et al 2006 the continued assessment of urban waterways requires an improved understanding of contaminant dynamics in stormwater runoff while the concentration of metals in dissolved forms are typically reported for urban stormwater limited research has investigated the fraction of these metals that are likely to cause toxicity to aquatic biota to address these risks the current study aimed to investigate the forms of metals in a representative highly degraded urban creek system over the duration of a storm while also monitoring key water chemistry parameters that have been shown to influence metal speciation the changes in metal concentrations and forms e g dissolved and labile during the storm were investigated from water samples and diffusive gradients in thin films dgts and the potential for ecological risk evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study focused on the moonee ponds creek mpc sub catchment one of five major north south flowing tributaries of the yarra river in melbourne australia the mpc catchment area covers 136 km2 with a mix of recreational residential industrial and transport rail freeway and airport land uses see supporting information s1 it is highly modified and concrete lined along the middle and lower parts with several major stormwater drains entering the creek along its 25 km length samples were collected from the lower catchment 37 7908 144 9365 approximately 3 km upstream from where the mpc joins the yarra river the study site is surrounded by a grassed floodplain with minimal natural riparian habitat and is proximal to significant rail and road infrastructure see supporting information

samples 1 l precleaned hdpe bottles nalgene were collected fig 1 sample bottles were preconditioned with site water prior to taking the sample water samples were collected over the rising limb of the storm hydrograph using purpose built rising stage samplers deployed as duplicates that enabled five 1 l samples to be collected as the creek levels rose for a full description of rising stage sampler production methods see the supporting information section s3 retrieval of water samples collected by the rising stage samplers occurred within 24 h of deployment when it was safe to enter the creek sample field blanks were included as follows clean bottles filled with milli q water were transported to the study site exposed briefly resealed and then transported back to the laboratory for analysis the dgts were purchased from dgt research lancaster uk as the lsnm np pre loaded solution deployment model with a 0 14 mm polyethersulphone filter membrane 0 8 mm apa agarose crosslinked polyacrylamide diffusive gel and chelex100 binding gel the diffusive boundary layer dbl has been previously shown to be an important factor in the accuracy of measuring dgt labile concentrations in the current study the simple use of dgts with a single diffusive gel thickness does not accommodate for variations in the dgt labile concentration due to variable creek streamflow where dgt labile concentrations may be underestimated by up to 50 turner et al 2012 however as linear flow rates were consistently above 0 02 m s table 1 the dbl would be thin and unlikely to significantly affect the overall precision of the device gimpel et al 2001 deployment and or collection of dgt devices coincided with the collection of grab samples over the storm hydrograph phases fig 1 five sets of dgts dgt

surface of all three devices this dgt set was removed from all further analyses no biofilm growth was observed on the surface of any other dgt sets baseline during storm inclusive of the rising and falling limb and post storm dgt labile concentration were calculated from dgt 2 dgt 3 and dgt 5 sets respectively fig 1 dgt 4 was used in conjunction with dgt 3 and 5 to investigate the suitability of the devices to monitor a short term pulse event this was subsequently validated see supporting information s5 to identify levels of contamination from devices exposed in the field dgt field blanks

2 3 sample processing water samples 1 l hdpe bottles were sealed in zip lock plastic bags and stored on ice in a cooler box until return to the laboratory the dgts were collected and biofouling if any on the dgt was noted and photographed grab samples and dgts were transported back to an analytical chemistry laboratory and processed as described below in a laminar flow cabinet within 2 h of collection rising limb samples collected by the rising stage sampler samples rl 1 5 were collected as soon as it was safe to do so post storm this additional holding time 22 h prior to sample processing may have allowed the sample to equilibrate possibly resulting in some changes to metal speciation sample bottles were shaken to homogenise the solids and then 200 ml of water was filtered

and discussion 3 1 creek water composition 3 1 1 water quality parameters general water quality data for each sampling timepoint are provided in table 1 temperature electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen and ph were not measured during the rising limb of the storm hydrograph due to unsafe sampling conditions the storm exhibited a relatively sharp hydrograph as expected for a flashy urban system table 1 figs 1 and 2 temperature values ranged from 17 to 21 c and were typical of late summer early autumn conditions electrical conductivity fluctuated over the storm decreasing from a maximum of 1770 µs cm before the event to a low of 205 µs cm on the falling limb low conductivity values over the falling limb and during baseline conditions stormtime 3 d 971 µs cm are both likely due to freshwater inputs entering the creek system during rainfall events dissolved oxygen do saturation varied during the storm and ranged between 52 and 95 saturation the ph was generally stable during baseline and post storm conditions ph 8 2 8 5 with a decrease measured over the falling limb ph 8 0 although ph was not measured during the storm in this study the ph values of stormwater in australian urban catchments has been found to range between 5 5 and 7 3 goonetilleke and lampard 2019 during the storm alkalinity decreased below the limit of detection lod 1 mg caco3 l with baseline

decreasing substantially over the rising limb of the storm hydrograph due to dilution from stormwater see supporting information s13 dissolved nitrate concentrations peaked over the rising limb before rapidly decreasing to baseline concentrations table 1 indicating inputs from domestic wastewater atmospheric sources and fertilisers jani et al 2020 the baseline doc concentrations ranged from 6 2 to

stormwater runoff kalev and toor 2020 doc concentrations rapidly decreased over the falling limb to baseline concentrations which were maintained post storm the increase in doc during the storm indicates an increase in the concentration of humic and fulvic acids which are the principal organic ligands attributed to metal complexation in natural waters tipping 1998 3 1 2 cdom components four main components of cdom were determined by feem scans followed by parafac analysis the parafac model used to determine the cdom components was compared against other published models in the openfluor database see supporting information s14 investigations of these comparisons within the database indicates that the four components c1 c4 can be described as the following fulvic like c1 humic like 1 c2 humic like 2 c3 and protein like c4 temporal variation in the relative abundance of cdom components occurred across different phases of the storm hydrograph see supporting information s15 the baseline and post storm dom pool was equally dominated by the fulvic like and both humic like components described in the literature as being microbially and terrestrially derived respectively murphy et al 2011 williams et al 2013 during the rising limb of the storm hydrograph the fulvic like and smaller humic like 1 components were the most dominant with the protein like component making up a notably higher proportion of the dom pool f 3 24 54 76 p 0 001 compared to other phases rising limb samples were characterised by having considerable p 0 001 negative correlations to calculated molecular weight indices see supporting information s15 indicating the dominance of a more degraded humic component during the storm a decrease in aromaticity indices over the rising limb is associated with a spike in the amount of proteinaceous material produced by microbes and phytoplankton within the creek system possibly providing an indication of stormwater runoff contaminated with sewage and nutrient inputs murphy et al 2011 3 2 metal forms 3 2 1 dissolved metals all dissolved metal and metalloid concentrations cdm excluding selenium exhibited narrow pollutographs pollutant concentration profile across the storm hydrograph where a rapid increase was followed by a rapid decrease over a 3 h period fig 2 post storm concentrations were similar to baseline conditions with

significant metals and metalloids as cr fe mn ni and se provided in the supporting information section s16 the six metals were identified as key contaminants as the cdm of each exceeded gvs for 90 species protection see section 4 3 for small to medium storm events total rainfall 15 mm contaminant pollutographs tend to be similar to streamflow dynamics metadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 in the case of the 13 mm storm sampled in this study pollutographs did not show a clear dilution effect during the storm as cdm peaks did not stagnate or decrease whilst peak flow remained high this suggests that the dissolved metal concentrations were influenced by rainfall volume and intensity and resulting streamflow dynamics but not catchment source depletion i e the source continued to release metals this observation is in keeping with the paradigm of highly modified urban creeks as channelised ditches with limited dilution capacities peter et al 2020 in these modified systems dissolved metal contaminants are effectively mobilised from a number of high strength sources e g road dust building infrastructure via piped stormwater runoff resulting in flashy pollutographs it is worth noting that the dissolved metal fraction in this study was operationally defined and included colloids 0 001 0 45 µm as it is well recognised that the filtration of water through a 0 45 µm filter does not completely separate truly dissolved and colloidal metal forms van leeuwen and buffle 2009 as a result of this it is likely that a reasonable percentage 50 of dissolved al and fe would be present as inorganic colloidal forms and have reduced mobility van dam et al 2008 see section 3 2 3 3 2 2 total suspended solids and their metal concentrations total suspended solid tss concentrations ranged from 10 to 19 mg l during baseline conditions then increased substantially f 3 24 11 32 p 0 0013 during the rising limb of the storm hydrograph peaking at 307 mg l fig 3 post storm tss concentrations decreased over a period of five days to baseline concentrations measured patterns of tss are typical of storm events where the high tss concentrations during the storm reflect the increased mobilisation of tss from road side dusts atmospheric deposition and natural inputs baum et al 2021 the concentration of metals attached to the tss ctss increased rapidly over the rising limb of the storm hydrograph suggesting that stormwater runoff is a major source of tss associated metals the ctss hydrograph dynamics of the six key metals al cd co cu pb and zn is provided in fig 3 below with the ctss hydrograph dynamics of less significant metals and metalloids as cr fe mn ni and se provided in the supporting information section s17 partition coefficient values kd ctss cdm l kg values reported are log kd calculated for all metals were 4 l kg during baseline and post storm conditions suggesting a significant preference of metals for the solid phase during this time see supporting information s18 during the storm kd values substantially p 0 05 decreased over the rising limb for all metals except for cr ni and se indicating that during this time a greater proportion of metals existed in the operationally defined dissolved phase low kd values during this period were likely due to loosely bound metals dissolved colloidal and complexes desorbing from particulates as a function of ph rainfall intensity and pavement residence time doc has been found to play a key role in the partitioning of metals where interactions between metals and organic matter can result in the complexion of metals with hs thereby consolidating these metals in the dissolved phase herngren et al 2005 similarly colloidal metals may also contribute significantly towards the lower apparent kd values during the storm during the falling limb of the storm hydrograph kd values increased to above 4 l kg for all metals and metalloids excluding selenium most likely as a result of the repartitioning of metals onto particulates as fresh binding sites became available during the storm 3 2 3 dgt labile metals in general the dgt labile concentrations cdgt of key metal contaminants in the mpc increased during storm deployment except for co where the concentration remained stable over the storm table 2 one way anovas indicated that for al cd cu and zn these observed increases in cdgt during storm was considerable al f 2 4 15 22 p 0 014 cd f 3 8 22 55 p 0 001 cu f 3 11 63 66 p 0 001 zn f 3 11 111 6 p 0 001 the cdgt measured during this study corresponded to 1 of the total dissolved concentration for al 1 5 for cd co cu and pb and 6 12 for zn during baseline and post storm hydrograph phases table 2 during the storm measured percent dgt labile fractions were 2 for all key metals to determine whether the dgt labile metal concentrations across the storm hydrograph could be predicted using the open source speciation modelling visual minteq maximum dynamic concentration c dyn max outputs were compared to measured dgt labile concentrations as a percentage of the total dissolved metal concentration table 2 throughout all phases of the storm the labile fractions for all metals were overestimated by the model generally organic complexes dominated the predicted speciation for all metals except co where the speciation profile was dominated by the free ion see supporting information s19 for the complete visual minteq output the predicted metal speciation during the storm indicated that labile metal concentrations should be highly dynamic particularly during the rising limb when initial runoff entered and mixed with the creek waters e g the predicted total concentration of cd 2 increased from 1 to 28 over the rising limb see supporting information s19 this observation points to a key issue associated with using modelling programs to predict the forms of metals in a system during short term discharge events with highly variable water quality profiles specifically natural systems experience dynamic changes in water chemistry during a storm and are unlikely to be at equilibrium one of the major assumptions made by speciation modelling programs therefore speciation modelling of these dynamic conditions tends to underestimate the amount of labile metal present as equilibrium based speciation calculations assign metals to complexes that would otherwise contribute towards the labile fraction mebane et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 this suggests that an empirical approach to measuring labile metal concentrations e g passive sampling devices such as dgts rather than a modelling approach would provide more accurate results for regulation and management purposes the amount of measured dgt labile metal indicates that during the storm a substantial fraction of the key metals 99 were complexed colloidal or complexed with dom and likely to exhibit low mobility and bioavailability these low dgt labile concentrations are likely influenced by the elevated doc concentrations measured during the storm 15 0 20 1 mg l and the high proportion of hs present in the dom 84 it is well established that metal cations have a strong affinity for binding to dom especially cu and pb that form strong complexes with organic ligands present in stormwater ke et al 2018 in comparison zn is weakly complexed with dom and cd tends to have very low levels of complexion with organic matter simpson et al 2014 stockdale et al 2015 modelling undertaken with visual minteq predicted minimal 40 humic complexion for al co and zn this suggests that during the storm large fractions of these metals may have been complexed by anthropogenic chelating agents such as edta ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid nowack 2002 previous studies have observed synthetic chelating agents that can have a higher affinity for complexing metals than natural dom to be present and extremely persistent in urban waters baken et al 2011 3 3 water quality guideline values for assessing ecotoxicity risk the majority of dissolved metal concentrations cdm were below gvs for 90 species protection during the storm hydrograph period except for the six key metals al cd co cu pb and zn fig 2 it should be noted that the gv for cobalt is considered to have unknown reliability due to the limited data for the chronic toxicity of co to freshwater biota anzg 2018 these six metals exceeding gvs would be considered primary targets for stormwater management strategies with cu pb and zn previously identified as priority contaminants in stormwater runoff zgheib et al 2012 hardness adjusted gvs for metals in freshwater were not used in this study despite alkalinity concentrations measured below the limit of detection lod 1 mg caco3 l during the storm the reasoning for this choice is that alkalinity quickly surpassed the standard hardness value of 30 mg caco3 l post storm where hardness adjusted gvs may not be appropriate for short term use in a dynamic system to assess the ecological risk that the six key metals pose risk quotients for 90 species protection for each storm phase were calculated from the dgt labile and dissolved metal concentration to give a simple screening level estimate of high risk conditions as an interim measure in lieu of short term specific guidelines current gvs were applied to characterise the risk of metals in stormwater even though these guidelines are not relevant to such exposures as a result current gvs would at least be quite conservative assuming that there is no risk of latent effects if stormwater pulse exposures were frequent with minimal recovery periods cumulative effects may occur and current gvs would be appropriate throughout the storm dgt labile metal concentrations were below the risk quotients based on 90 species protection values fig 4 these results imply that while dissolved concentrations exceeded gvs and imply a risk of toxicity the portion of dgt labile and potentially bioavailable metal posed little risk of toxicity to 90 of species when applying the respective gv anzg 2018 results of this study demonstrated how dgts are useful for assessing the time averaged labile concentration of metals and the risk they pose to aquatic biota over a short term exposure given the cost effectiveness and ease of use current regulatory and management practices would benefit from incorporating dgts into stormwater monitoring hayman et al 2019 using this method a risk quotient approach derived from dgt measurements can be included in environmental impact assessments for waterways affected by intermittent pulse events that may result in highly variable pollutant profiles the results of this study indicate that for the storm sampled the dissolved metal concentrations should not pose a risk of adverse effects to most aquatic biota the simple application of gvs appears to offer sufficient protection for the highly disturbed mpc system during the sampled storm event in the context of stormwater runoff an outstanding issue with regards to intermittent short term pulse discharges is the response of aquatic organisms to metals at varying exposure durations and frequencies gvs based on chronic toxicity tests will generally achieve overly conservative outcomes since organisms can typically tolerate higher concentrations of dissolved metals for shorter exposure durations compared to continuous exposures diamond et al 2006 however short pulse exposures that are repeated over time are known to generally result in increased toxic effects gordon et al 2012 an option here is to modify existing gvs by a factor relating to the exposure duration frequency and magnitude to achieve protective but not overly conservative results for intermittent discharge scenarios the time averaged concentration tac allows for these modifications to be made where tacs have been found to be good predictors of pulse exposure metal toxicity for a range of aquatic organisms angel et al 2017 however for optimal prediction of pulse exposure toxicity the application of tacs to current gvs requires the concentration and duration of the pulse to be known this may prove to be a challenge for stormwater monitoring where storms can show high inter storm variability passive samplers such as the dgt devices used in this study measure a time integrated concentration and provide a useful way for regulatory authorities to monitor tacs during storm events 4 conclusions the detection of very low 1 labile metal concentrations in an urban system impacted by stormwater runoff is valuable for researchers and regulators principal factors influencing the concentration of dissolved metals and the fraction of dgt labile metals were ph and dom concentration and composition dgts are effective for stormwater monitoring and provide a way to translate the presence of metal contaminants to the risk posed understanding the differences in metal forms and dynamics during a storm will improve the ability to effectively manage aquatic environments that are influenced by short term intermittent discharge events data citation mcdonald sarah 2021 metal
