15620,disposal of the overwhelming amounts of excess wastewater treatment plant wwtp sludge is an increasing financial and environmental problem and new methods to reduce the amount of excess sludge are therefore required in the natural environment interactions between multiple macroinvertebrate detritivores mediate the degradation of organic matter macroinvertebrates may thus also be able to degrade wwtp sludge but may meanwhile be impacted by the associated contaminants therefore the aim of the present study was to examine if wwtps contaminant concentrations and profiles affect the biotic interactions and macroinvertebrate mediated degradation of sludge assessing degradation of sludge from three wwtps differing in contaminant profile by combinations of three macroinvertebrate detritovore taxa revealed that macroinvertebrate enhanced sludge degradation was wwtp and taxa combination specific yet taxa combinations only had an additional positive effect on sludge degradation when compared to single taxa in sludge with a higher contaminant load this was confirmed by the results of a cu spiked sludge degradation experiment indicating a possible effect of biotic interactions it was concluded that macroinvertebrates are a potential tool for the reduction of excess wwtp sludge and that using multispecies assemblages of detritivorous macroinvertebrates may increase the resilience of this additional treatment step keywords waste treatment plants excess sludge macroinvertebrates biotic interactions stress gradient hypothesis data availability data are available from the mendeley data repository van der meer et al 2022 https data mendeley com datasets z6ys4b763s 1 1 introduction the world s wastewater treatment plants wwtps produce unprecedented amounts of excess sludge the 323 dutch wwtps alone already produce over 1 250 million kg of sludge yearly cbs 2021 this excess sludge has to be processed and disposed but options for land filling and agriculture as a means of disposal have become limited collivignarelli et al 2019 hence the costs of sludge processing and disposal can make up to 60 of the total operational costs of a wwtp buys et al 2008 therefore there is a high demand for new strategies and technologies to reduce the mass of excess sludge to lower the economic and environmental impact christodoulou and stamatelatou 2016 as several macroinvertebrate detritivores play an important role in the degradation of organic matter in the aquatic environment they may also be capable to degrade wwtp sludge possibly mitigating the environmental impacts van der meer et al 2021 and costs of excess sludge disposal to this end aquatic oligochaete worms have been employed which can feed on wwtp sludge thereby reducing the amount of organic matter produced emamjomeh et al 2018 while deploying these oligochaetes has produced some promising results on an experimental scale li et al 2019 lópez visoet al 2021 success rates in larger scale setups have been varying due to complicating factors such as uncontrollable population dynamics of the oligochaetes tamis et al 2011 and low sludge degradation rates lópez viso et al 2022 oligochaete worms are however not the only macroinvertebrate detritivores involved in organic matter degradation in the aquatic environment the degradation of organic matter is a complex process that is mediated by natural assemblages of detritivores these detritivores exhibit different feeding traits and can interact during the degradation of organic matter which can lead to increased organic matter degradation rates costantini and rossi 2010 heard 1994 however competition between detritivores might reduce organic matter degradation therefore only focusing on oligochaete worms would exclude the numerous traits and feeding habits that macroinvertebrates possess which may be harnessed for sludge reduction purposes opposing forces are however also at play since wwtps receive wastewater containing a plethora of contaminants including heavy metals pharmaceuticals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons personal care products and pesticides which may affect the interactions between the different macroinvertebrate species and reduce sludge degradation rates bundschuh et al 2021 according to the stress gradient hypothesis sgh proposed by bertness and callaway 1994 see also silknetter et al 2020 when stress levels in the environment increase competitive interactions will decrease and positive interactions such as facilitation will increase hence when the environment becomes more stressful due to the presence of toxic contaminants negative interactions such as competition for resources might become less rigorous while positive interactions such as trophic facilitation might become more prevalent in a wwtp setup this could potentially counteract the adverse effects of contaminants on wwtp sludge degradation by detritivorous macroinvertebrates as the potential decrease in single species degradation rates might be partly compensated by less stringent competitive interactions or even turn into facilitation however the effects of wwtp contaminants on sludge degradation by macroinvertebrate assemblages remains currently unknown the aim of the present study was therefore to examine if wwtp contaminant concentrations and profiles affect macroinvertebrate mediated degradation of sludge and the biotic interactions we hypothesized that 1 higher contaminant loads would reduce macroinvertebrate sludge degradation rates 2 sludge degradation rates by macroinvertebrate assemblages would be less impacted than sludge reduction by single taxa at higher contaminant loads due to altered biotic interactions within the multi taxa assemblages to test these hypotheses we performed a sludge degradation experiment with sludge from three wwtps differing in contaminant profile and with all possible combinations of three macroinvertebrate detritivores differing in feeding and bioturbation traits subsequently we performed a similar sludge degradation experiment with different concentrations of cu spiked sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge collection sludge was collected from the aeration tanks of the wwtp rhenen 46 103 population equivalents p e 51 58 26 7 n 5 31 54 9 e wwtp mijdrecht 70 103 p e 52 12 43 6 n 4 53 06 3 e and wwtp alkmaar 97 103 p e 52 38 36 8 n 4 44 27 6 e all located in the netherlands five or six 10 l buckets of sludge were scooped and transported to the laboratory and further processed within 2 h four to five buckets were used for the contaminant profiling and one was used for the sludge degradation experiment 2 2 test organisms and culture conditions for the experiments we selected larvae of the non biting midge chironomus riparius the snail physa acuta and tubificidae worms which all occur in organically rich contaminated environments such as wwtp impacted sites adler and courtney 2019 dos reis oliveira et al 2020 liang et al 2006 but differ in their feeding and bioturbation traits c riparius larvae bioturbate and bioirrigate sediments by constructing and ventilating tubes and deposit feed on the upper layer of the sediment whereas tubificidae worms are gallery diffusors and conveyer belt feeders feeding in deeper layers of the sediment and defecate at the sediment surface lagauzère et al 2009 p acuta snails on the other hand are primarily scraper grazers that move on top of the sediment costantini and rossi 2010 c riparius and p acuta were cultured in the laboratory at the university of amsterdam in dutch standard water dsw deionized water with an addition of 200 mg l 1 cacl2 2h2o 180 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 100 mg l 1 nahco3 and 20 mg l 1 khco3 at 20 1 c with a 12 12 h light dark photoperiod the tanks 20 l 30 20 20 cm l w h were gently aerated to maintain adequate 7 mg l 1 oxygen concentrations dsw was changed 1 2 times a week and deionized water was added to compensate for evaporation losses the c riparius tanks contained a sediment layer of 2 cm of quartz sand whereas p acuta was reared without a substrate c riparius was fed with a grinded 20 1 trouvit tetraphyll mixture p acuta was fed grinded tetraphyll twice a week tubificidae worms were bought from a fish feed wholesale and acclimatised to the same conditions as c riparius one week prior to the experiment additionally dried and shredded oak leaves were added to create an organic layer for the worms 2 3 experimental setup 2 3 1 degradation of wwtp sludge a 7 day degradation experiment with sludge from the three wwtps was run in which eight taxa assemblages were deployed n 5 consisting of a control without macroinvertebrates to assess initial degradation and 7 assemblages with equal macroinvertebrate biomass consisting of either one two or three taxa macroinvertebrate survival and sludge degradation were determined at the end of the experiment each experimental replicate consisted of a 50 ml glass beaker bottom surface area 11 3 cm2 to which 25 ml of homogenized sludge and 15 ml of dsw were added after approximately 30 min the sludge had settled on the bottom of the beaker forming a sediment like layer after 1 h the macroinvertebrates were added using either a plastic 5 ml pasteur pipette for the c riparius larvae and tubificidae worms or plastic tweezers for the p acuta snails to determine the sludge dw at the start of the experiment 5 additional beakers were prepared in the same way for each wwtp after which the overlying water was removed and the remaining sludge was dried in a stove at 65 c for 24 h to ensure equal biomass in all assemblages 8 9 mg dw 18 9 or 6 c riparius larvae 6 3 or 2 p acuta snails and 36 18 or 12 tubificidae worms were used in the single taxa c t and p two taxa ct cp and tp and three taxa ctp assemblages respectively based on currently established length dry weight relationships fig s1 early 4th stage c riparius larvae with a mean length of 9 7 mm sd 1 5 mm and snails with a length of 4 5 5 7 mm were used the weight of the tubificidae worms was based on the average of 30 individuals to ensure depuration of the gut content all macroinvertebrates were starved for 24 h before the start of the 7 day sludge degradation experiment during the 7 day experiment the beakers were kept under controlled conditions at 20 1 c with a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod and gently aerated to prevent anoxic conditions at the start half way and at the end of the experiment the ph conductivity and oxygen concentration were measured using a portable multi meter hach hq40 with the appropriate probes phc101 cdc401 ldo101 respectively the beakers were checked daily for emerged c riparius adults and p acuta egg packages and both were subsequently removed a new c riparius larvae was added for the removed adult to ensure equal biomass during the 7 day experiment out of the 598 initially used larvae 13 2 were replaced due to emergence of the adult in eleven replicates one adult was replaced and one replicate 2 adults were replaced at the end of the 7 day experiment the overlying water in the beakers was discarded to determine the survival of the macroinvertebrates these were collected using a plastic pasteur pipette or plastic tweezers and counted the remaining sludge was dried at 65 c for 24 h and subsequently weighed sludge degradation was determined as the difference between the average start dw and the individual replicate final dw of the sludge 2 3 2 degradation of cu spiked sludge to assess if macroinvertebrate interactions and macroinvertebrate mediated sludge degradation are affected by increased contaminant concentrations we performed a 7 day sludge degradation test with cu spiked sludge from rhenen and combinations of c riparius larvae and p acuta snails cu was chosen as a model contaminant and sludge from rhenen was selected as it was presumed that it had the lowest initial contaminant loads of the three wwtps this resulted in 4 species assemblages c riparius larvae c p acuta snails p c riparius p acuta cp and a control without macroinvertebrates in the single species assemblages either 28 c riparius larvae with a mean length of 7 5 mm sd 1 3 mm or 6 p acuta snails with a length of 5 5 6 5 mm were added in the cp assemblage 14 c riparius larvae and 3 p acuta snails were added all assemblages consisted of 4 replicates the same methods as in section 2 3 1 were followed to perform the experiment at the end of the 7 day experiment in addition to the methods mentioned in section 2 3 1 the c riparius larvae were pooled per replicate beaker dried at 65 c for 24 h and weighed to determine the average dw of the larvae to determine the growth of the larvae during the experiment the difference between the average initial larval dw based on the length dw correlation fig s1 and average final larval dw was calculated for each beaker the cu concentration in the sludge and the overlying water at the end of the experiment were determined using the methods described in section 2 4 2 2 4 sludge contaminant profiles and contaminant analyses the sludge solids in the buckets n 4 for alkmaar and rhenen n 5 for mijdrecht were allowed to precipitate for 1 h whereafter the overlying water was siphoned off and the remaining material was poured into a 2 l bottle which was stored at 4 c overnight the following day the overlying water was siphoned off again and the solids were frozen freeze dried ground with a ball grinder and stored in airtight bottles at room temperature until further analysis 2 4 1 metal analysis to determine the concentration of the metals al as ag cd cr cu fe mn ni pb se and zn in the sludge samples were digested by transferring 500 mg of dw sludge into a teflon bomb to which 10 ml of 65 hno3 was added the samples were heated to 175 c in 5 5 min and maintained at this temperature for another 4 5 min in a microwave multiwave pro anton paar and were then allowed to cool down for 1 h all according to the epa 3051a protocol u s epa 2007 as advised by the manufacturer anton paar the contents of the teflon bombs were poured into 25 ml volumetric flasks and the volume was adjusted to 25 ml with ultrapure water a subsample of 9 ml was taken from each flask and 1 ml of internal standard 0 5 ml of 20 ppm yttrium and 0 5 ml of 40 ppm caesiumchloride was added as a control two blank teflon bombs were added per microwave run subsequently the metal concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes optima 8000 icp oes perkinelmer detection limits can be found in supplementary table s1 2 4 2 organic contaminant analysis 2 4 2 1 sample preparation to extract the organic contaminants of each experimental replicate a quechers method validated in our laboratory was applied in short 10 g of dw sludge was added to 50 ml sterile polypropylene pp tubes filled with 6 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate mgso4 and 1 5 g of sodium acetate naac and spiked with 50 µl of a 200 µg l stock solution of internal standards 30 ml of acetonitrile was added mixed for one hour and subsequently centrifuged for 15 min the supernatant was then transferred into clean 50 ml sterile pp tubes and mixed for 15 min with the addition of 300 mg magnesium sulfate mgso4 100 mg primary secondary amine psa and 100 mg octyldecylsilane c18 whereafter the sample was evaporated to 0 5 ml under a gentle nitrogen flow subsequently 150 mg of active carbon was added to the sample and the sample was diluted to 15 ml by adding ultrapure water with these samples a second solid phase extraction was performed based on a slightly modified version of albergamo et al 2018 briefly extraction cartridges oasis hlb 60 µg waters were conditioned with 5 ml of methanol and equilibrated with 5 ml of ultrapure water the 15 ml sample was loaded on the cartridges and left to dry for 20 min after which the cartridges were eluted with 2 2 5 ml methanol by vacuum this extract was collected filtered 0 22 µm disk filter and evaporated to 0 5 ml prior to injection the extracts were diluted 5 times 2 4 2 2 lc hrms analysis to quantify the concentrations of 133 organic contaminants a six point calibration curve was created in ultrapure water spiked to 8 µg l and serially diluted to obtain six concentration factors with 250 ng l being the lowest concentration calibration lines displayed r squared values greater than 0 99 of the measured compounds 63 lacked an internal standard here an external standard calibration was used instead consequently this part of the data could only be used to compare relative concentrations between the simultaneously analysed wwtps supplementary table s2 for complete compound target list a liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry lc ms was performed on a maxis uhplc q tof system based on a slightly modified version of the instrumental method of albergamo et al 2018 in short ms detection separation of a 20 μl sample in both positive and negative esi mode was achieved with a core shell kinetex biphenyl column 100 2 1 mm 2 6 μm particle size and 100 å pore size phenomenex utrecht the netherlands the mobile phase consisted of two solutions i e a ultrapure water with acetic acid 0 05 and b methanol with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min the lc gradient was 0 methanol from 0 to 2 min increased linearly to 100 at 17 min and kept equal until 25 min the system was allowed to re equilibrate for 7 min before the next injection prior to each injection a 50 μm sodium acetate solution in h2o meoh 1 1 v v was introduced automatically for m z recalibration of the system during data processing the column oven was kept at 40 c ms and data independent ms ms data were acquired with positive and negative esi in separate runs with a resolving power typically of 30 000 60 000 fwhm full scan ms and msms spectra acquired in broad band collision induced dissociation mode bbcid were screened for the accurate masses retention time tr mass accuracy isotopic fit and msms for unambiguous identification of the targeted organic contaminants 2 4 3 cu spiked sludge for the sludge degradation experiment with cu spiked sludge 3 concentrations of cu spiked sludge were prepared by pouring 500 ml of sludge from rhenen into a single glass bottle per cu concentration the bottles were manually swerved and 5 ml of either deionized water 3585 µg l 1 or 7170 µg l 1 cucl2 2h2o stock solution was slowly added to each of the bottles this resulted in a nominal cu concentration of 200 mg kg 1 cu0 5940 mg kg 1 cul and 11 880 mg kg 1 cuh cu per dw sludge to ensure even mixing the bottles with spiked sludge were aerated for 16 h before the start of the experiment to determine the actual cu concentration in the sludge the methods from 2 1 2 a were followed for the cu concentration in the overlying water 9 ml water samples n 16 were directly analyzed with the icp aes after the addition of the internal standards 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 clustering analysis of chemical data the concentrations of the 55 contaminants that were present in at least one of the sludge samples were normalised so that a value of 1 represented the highest measured concentration of that specific contaminant the 13 sludge samples n 4 for alkmaar and rhenen n 5 for mijdrecht were then clustered based on these normalised concentrations as we aimed to assess the hierarchical structure of the wwtps based on the contaminant concentrations an agglomerative clustering technique agnes was applied on the normalized contaminant concentrations agnes grouped the sludge samples sequentially into larger clusters ending with a single cluster containing all samples for clustering decisions ward s criterion was used which aimed to minimize the within cluster variation of a potential new cluster after merging two lower tier clusters to assess which contaminant concentrations were correlated in the sludge samples the same cluster analysis was applied to the normalized contaminant concentrations to give an overview of the wwtp contaminant profiles the resulting dendrograms were presented as a heatmap kolde 2019 of the normalised contaminant concentrations we acknowledge that although we analysed 145 contaminants to create the chemical profiles wwtp sludges contain a plethora of other unknown contaminants this hampers the possibility to attribute observed effects on sludge degradation to specific measured groups of contaminants as the known measured contaminants often explain only a small fraction of observed effects when analysed in iceberg modeling studies escher et al 2020 neale et al 2017 2 5 2 calculation of predicted sludge degradation to assess if biotic interactions played a role during sludge degradation the predicted sludge degradation by the two and three taxa assemblages was calculated based on the sludge degradation by the single taxa assemblages if no biotic interactions would occur in the two or three taxa assemblages the expected degradation would be the average of the sludge degradation in the corresponding single taxa assemblages therefore the expected sludge degradation in the two or three taxa assemblages was calculated by averaging a random sample from one single taxa assemblage with a random sample from another single taxa assemblage until all samples in those assemblages were assigned fugère et al 2012 this created a new expected assemblage with the same number of replicates as the corresponding single taxa assemblages the same method was used to assess if the sludge degradation in the chironomus physa assemblage was affected differently by increased cu concentrations than what would be expected based on both single species assemblages 2 5 3 statistical analysis differences between locations in sludge dry weight and conductivity at the start of the experiment were assessed with a one way anova 1w aov and a tukeyhsd post hoc test to analyses if conductivity changed over time and was affected by macroinvertebrate assemblage a two way anova 2w aov was performed for each location separately with conductivity as a dependent variable and time start day 3 day 7 and taxa assemblage as independent variables to assess differences in survival between macroinvertebrate taxa and wwtp locations a general linear model glm with a binomial function was used with the number of surviving and deceased individuals as the dependent variable and taxa and wwtp location as independent variables including the interaction term a pairwise analysis of estimated marginal means was performed to calculate p values between groups to determine differences in baseline sludge degradation between wwtp locations a 1w aov was performed with the degradation of the control treatments of the three wwtps as a dependent variable and the wwtp location as an independent variable followed by a tukeyhsd post hoc test subsequently to assess differences in sludge degradation between macroinvertebrate assemblages and locations a 2w aov with taxa assemblage and wwtp location and their interaction term as independent variables was performed also followed by a tukeyhsd post hoc test to assess macroinvertebrate assemblage effect on degradation for each location separately three separate 1w aovs with subsequent tukeyhsd post hoc tests were performed for each location as the interaction term from the previous 2w aov was significant to compare the expected and observed sludge degradation of multi taxa assemblages a separate 1w aov was performed for each expected observed assemblage pair with degradation as the dependent variable although some deviations from the assumption of normality occurred we chose to use anovas as these are robust against these deviations to assess the effect of cu and species assemblage on survival of both c riparius and p acuta the growth of the c riparius larvae and the sludge degradation 2w aov tests were performed with cu concentration species assemblage and the interaction as independent variables and either survival of c riparius p acuta c riparius growth or degraded sludge as dependent variable if applicable these 2w anovas were followed by a tukeyhsd post hoc test to compare the expected and observed sludge degradation of the cp assemblages a separate 1w aov was performed for each expected observed pair per cu concentration to assess the effect of cu concentration and taxa assemblage on the conductivity in the experiments two 2w anovas were performed for the start and end of the experiment with the cu concentration and taxa assemblage as well as their interactions as independent variables and conductivity as a dependent variable statistical tests and the clustering analysis were performed in core r 3 6 1 r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 experimental conditions oxygen levels in

exception of the tubificids p 0 37 yet when evaluating the individual taxa assemblages per location for rhenen only the sludge degradation by p acuta and the chironomus physa combination was marginally higher than that of the control treatment p 0 08 and p 0 06 respectively this was mainly caused by a single outlier in the control as repeating the analysis with exclusion of this outlier resulted in all taxa assemblages except for the single tubificidae degrading significantly more sludge than the control p 0 05 in contrast to rhenen for mijdrecht and alkmaar the single and two taxa assemblages with either c riparius or p acuta always accomplished a significantly p 0 05 higher sludge degradation than the corresponding control furthermore the single tubificidae assemblage and chironomus tubificidae physa assemblage in alkmaar also degraded significantly p 0 05 more sludge than the control however the observed sludge degradation in the macroinvertebrate multi taxa assemblages was only higher than the predicted sludge degradation based on the single taxa assemblages for the tubificidae physa and chironomus tubificidae physa combinations in alkmaar f1 8 3 8 p 0 05 suggesting only limited biotic interactions 3 3 wwtp sludge contaminant profiles of the 133 organic contaminants and 12 heavy metals that were analysed a total of 44 organic contaminants and 11 heavy metals were present and quantified in the sludge samples of the three wwtps the cluster analysis of the chemical data generated an agglomerative coefficient of 0 73 scale 0 00 1 00 indicating a decent clustering structure which confirms that the ward s criterion was suitable for clustering the sludge samples the cluster analysis revealed that the contaminant profiles of the sludge from rhenen and mijdrecht were more similar compared to alkmaar and moreover the sludge from the wwtp of alkmaar contained the highest concentrations of 34 out of the 55 contaminants alkmaar was also characterized by several contaminants occurring only at that wwtp such as the herbicides dimethanamid p metamitron and metobrumoron the insecticide pyriproxyfen and the pharmaceuticals sulfamethazine ibuprofen and carbamazepine fig 2 1st cluster several other contaminants occurred only at mijdrecht such as the pesticides fenuron methiocarb and methyl pirimifos 3rd cluster there were no contaminants however that were solely measured in sludge from rhenen although higher concentrations of the antibiotics clindamycin and trimethoprim were characteristic for rhenen 2nd cluster a large group of contaminants was present in the sludge of all three wwtps occurring in the two lowest clusters which included common metals such as zn cr and ni but also widely used pharmaceuticals such as triclosan and paracetamol 4th and 5th cluster also notable is the presence of the pesticides mcpp 2 6 dichlorobenxamide and fipronil at alkmaar and mijdrecht which were absent at rhenen 3 4 macroinvertebrate survival growth and degradation of cu spiked sludge to evaluate the effects of contaminants on biotic interactions and sludge degradation in more detail sludge from the wwtp in rhenen was spiked with cu and subjected to the invertebrate assemblages the measured cu concentrations in the spiked sludge were close to the nominal concentrations supplementary table s3 at the end of the experiment the oxygen concentrations ranged between 5 5 and 8 0 mg l and the ph ranged between 6 5 and 7 5 in all treatments the conductivity was affected by the cu concentration at the start of the experiment 468 14 610 7 and 665 12 us cm se for cu0 cul and cuh respectively f2 45 82 0 p 0 001 and was higher at the end of the experiment 557 21 719 21 and 773 33 us cm se for cu0 cul and cuh

treatments survival of p acuta f2 18 100 p 0 001 was significantly lower at the highest cu concentration as no snails survived at this concentration both with and without the presence of c riparius the survival of c riparius was only significantly lower at the highest cu concentration in the presence of snails as indicated by the significant interaction term f2 18 100 p 0 001 fig 3 a greek letters growth of the c riparius larvae decreased significantly with increasing cu concentrations in the sludge f2 16 80 7 p 0 001 fig 3b latin letters but was positively affected by the presence of p acuta f1 16 14 1 p 0 01 although only at the low cu concentration p 0 05 fig 3b greek letters hence positive biotic interactions were manifested at the cul concentration and did not occur at cu0 nor at cuh likely due to the overall detrimental effect of cu on physa performance and thus high mortality at this concentration sludge degradation in all species assemblages was significantly lower at the highest cu concentration f2 36 24 5 p 0 001 compared to the cu0 and the low cu concentration both p 0 05 fig 4 latin letters the difference in sludge degradation was also marginally significant p 0 07 between the cu0 and cul concentration species assemblage had also a significant effect on sludge degradation f3 36 4 4 p 0 01 but only at the cul concentration as the c riparius larvae and the c riparius p acuta combination accomplished a higher sludge degradation than the control without invertebrates p 0 05 these effects were not significant though in the non spiked control sludge and the cuh sludge fig 4 greek letters at the highest cu concentration this was again likely due to the high physa mortality and inhibited c riparius larval growth the observed sludge degradation by the multispecies assemblage cp was only significantly higher than the predicted degradation predcp at the cul concentration f1 6 13 6 p 0 01 fig 4 indicated by the asterisk at cuh no effect on sludge degradation in cp was observed compared to the predicted sludge degradation predcp which was likely due to the high physa mortality and low chironomus growth and the very low sludge degradation in general at this cu concentration 4 discussion in line with our hypothesis wwtp contaminant profiles affected sludge degradation by macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates generally enhanced sludge degradation although the intensity of this enhancement was wwtp and taxa assemblage specific sludge degradation by combinations of taxa was however only higher than expected in sludges with a higher contaminant load indicating an effect of biotic interactions 4 1 wwtp specific sludge degradation the sludge degradation in absence of macroinvertebrates differed between the three wwtps this is not surprising as no wwtp is exactly alike due to a difference in incoming volumes and the origins of wastewater with different contaminant loads and profiles microbial communities and treatment steps with a range of settings elevated contaminant concentrations indeed affect the capability of wwtps to reduce sludge maal bared 2020 ren 2004 hence the presently observed differences in contaminant profiles and concentrations between the wwtps may explain the lower sludge degradation in alkmaar as it had the highest contaminant load and was characterized by the presence of multiple pesticides possibly indicating increased pressures from an agricultural origin the same was the case for mijdrecht with multiple pesticides present in the sludge rhenen on the other hand contained a lower concentration and number of contaminants and pesticides allowing for a higher sludge degradation macroinvertebrates were able to enhance the degradation of sludge in each wwtp but the magnitude of this enhancement differed between the wwtps as there was only a certain amount of organic matter to be degraded in our experimental setup a high initial degradation such as in rhenen would limit the contribution of macroinvertebrates to the overall high sludge degradation oppositely when contaminant concentrations in the sludge are high such as in alkmaar the initial sludge degradation of the wwtp as well as the macroinvertebrate performance may be hampered bundschuh et al 2021 leading to the lowest joint sludge degradation macroinvertebrates may have the highest positive impact on sludge degradation at wwtps like mijdrecht where the sludge degradation is relatively low due to an intermediate contaminant profile and load but where macroinvertebrate performance is not yet greatly affected here macroinvertebrates enhanced sludge degradation the most the results from the cu spike sludge experiment are in line with these observations as the c riparius larvae and p acuta snails enhanced the sludge degradation the most at the intermediate cu concentration at the lowest cu concentration sludge degradation was already high and therefore the macroinvertebrates increased the sludge degradation only slightly while at the highest cu concentration sludge degradation was low and the macroinvertebrates were severely hampered hence it was at the intermediate cu concentration that macroinvertebrates enhanced sludge degradation the most 4 2 positive biotic interactions may occur at moderate contaminant loads higher than expected sludge degradation only occurred at the wwtp in alkmaar which had the highest contaminant load as well as in intermediate cu spiked sludge from rhenen this higher than expected sludge degradation could be the result of the altered biotic interactions at these contaminant concentrations although the exact mechanisms underlying the observed increase in degradation remain to be unraveled our results are in line with the predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis bertness and callaway 1994 which states that in a more stressful environment the prevalence of positive biotic interactions increases while the intensity of negative interactions decrease however the high mortality and low growth and the low degradation at the highest cu concentration in the cu spiked sediment does emphasize that possible benefits of biotic interactions only occur below a certain contaminant level as above this level effects of contaminants on macroinvertebrates may be too severe in contrast with studies on the effect of macroinvertebrate interactions or richness on the degradation of natural organic matter and leaves costantini and rossi 2010 jabiol et al 2013 tonin et al 2018 we did observe relatively few biotic interactions this might be due to the homogenous composition of wwtp sludge whereas leave packs may contain multiple leave species which have nerves and more woody parts a more homogenous environment is more prone to competitive interactions whereas an environment with more substrate variation allows for more niche differentiation and resource partitioning townsend 1989 thus being more prone to positive biotic interactions the taxa assemblages degrading more sludge than expected were the tubificidae physa and chironomus tubificidae physa assemblages from alkmaar and the chironomus physa assemblage in cu spiked sludge from rhenen one of the causes of the increased sludge degradation in these treatments might be a decrease in movements of the snails brown et al 2012 gao et al 2017 which may cause photo and thigmotactic stimuli that cause retractions of the tubificidae and the c riparius larvae into the sediment drewes and fourtner 1989 gresens 1995 these frequent retractions may result in less time spend on feeding and therefore a lower sludge degradation hence lower snail activity may result in a higher joint sludge degradation on the other hand snails may benefit from the presence of other taxa as the burrowing and feeding behavior by the tubificidae and chironomus larvae could alter the fungal and bacterial composition of the sludge hunting et al 2012 poulsen et al 2014 samuiloviene et al 2019 making it a more suitable food source for the snails these positive interactions may also explain the increased sludge degradation and growth of the c riparius larvae in the chironomus physa assemblage at the cul concentration hence biotic interactions occurring between these invertebrates partly mitigate the negative impacts of increased contaminant concentrations other positive biotic interactions may have also occurred due to the snail presence as the snail feces might be a more suitable food for the tubificids phipps et al 1993 and the c riparius larvae than the sludge itself additionally pedal mucus produced by the snails might adsorb a part of the labile contaminants possibly reducing the contaminant concentration in the overlying water jugdaohsingh et al 1998 thus limiting exposure of the other macroinvertebrates another possibility for positive effects on the larval growth is the dampening of intraspecific competition in multi taxa assemblages under resource limited conditions intraspecific competition is often more stringent than interspecific competition and thus multi taxa assemblages could dampen the effect of intraspecific competition costantini and rossi 2010 mckie et al 2009 we do acknowledge that further research would be needed to confirm the exact mechanisms underlying the positive effects of multi taxa assemblages on sludge degradation such experiments may try to disentangle the direct behavioural interactions between macroinvertebrates gresens 1995 and indirect interactions such as alterations of the sludge environment by one macroinvertebrate regarding bacterial and fungal mass and composition costantini and rossi 2010 graça et al 1993 and organic contaminant concentrations van der meer et al 2022 ideally this would be accomplished by an experiment in which one species of invertebrate would be allowed to manipulate the sludge for a certain amount of time removed from the sludge and introducing another macroinvertebrate into the altered sludge 4 3 perspectives a role for macroinvertebrates in the reduction of the amount of excess wwtp sludge while previously the use of tubificidae in wwtps has garnered most attention in our setup their sludge degradation was consistently the lowest per unit of dw biomass of the selected taxa which is in line with our previous work van der meer et al 2021 the present study therefore emphasizes the need to widen the scope of research and to investigate the sludge degradation potential of other combinations of macroinvertebrate species which seems promising on the present experimental scale an additional advantage of using multiple macroinvertebrates for the degradation of sludge is the increased combined resilience to contaminants that such a system may have as positive biotic interactions between the different macroinvertebrates could limit the negative impact of elevated contaminant concentrations on sludge degradation to some extent contrary to wastewater treatment steps with tubificidae no attempts to scale up treatment steps with midges or snails have been made yet to achieve a successful treatment of sludge with these macroinvertebrates life cycle traits and population dynamics have to be taken into account as to assure consistent reproduction and to prevent negative intraspecific interactions cope and winterbourn 2004 on the other hand the chironomus density used in this experiment was still five times lower than some natural population densities groenendijk et al 1998 indicating that sludge degradation rates could even be higher due to the high growth rate high fertility and short life cycle of both c riparius and p acuta employing these species in wastewater treatment would result in the production of substantial amounts of invertebrate biomass this biomass could potentially be harvested removing additional organic matter chironomus riparius has the advantage that the terrestrial adult phase allows for a relatively easy collection and harvesting reyes maldonado et al 2021 the exuviae left behind after emergence containing often higher contaminant concentrations might be skimmed and collected from the water surface the solid shells of p acuta would likely allow a separation from sludge and overlying water by sieving if contaminant concentrations in the harvested biomass are below regulatory limits this macroinvertebrate mass might be used as a resource for novel products as is already the case with multiple species of duckweed grown on wastewater liu et al 2021 although bioaccumulation of contaminants may be limited van der meer et al 2022 care should be still taken to perform regular contaminant analysis on novel products produced with this mass the successful application of macroinvertebrates in the treatment of wastewater might offer an alternative to the more high tech energy consuming post treatment steps such as ozone or uv treatment moreover the reduction of operational costs relatively simple techniques possible production of new biomaterials and the global occurrence of macroinvertebrates with the appropriate traits may offer benefits to countries without the infrastructure to build these high tech post treatments 5 conclusions the contaminant profiles of wwtp sludges affected sludge degradation by macroinvertebrates with higher contaminant loads resulting in a lower sludge degradation nonetheless most single and multi taxa macroinvertebrate assemblages employed in this study enhanced sludge degradation moreover the degradation capacity of multi species macroinvertebrate assemblages may be more resilient to moderate contaminant loads of wwtp sludge the present study thus showed that macroinvertebrates are a potential tool for the reduction of excess wwtp sludge and that using multispecies assemblages of detritivorous macroinvertebrates may increase the resilience of this additional treatment step

15620,disposal of the overwhelming amounts of excess wastewater treatment plant wwtp sludge is an increasing financial and environmental problem and new methods to reduce the amount of excess sludge are therefore required in the natural environment interactions between multiple macroinvertebrate detritivores mediate the degradation of organic matter macroinvertebrates may thus also be able to degrade wwtp sludge but may meanwhile be impacted by the associated contaminants therefore the aim of the present study was to examine if wwtps contaminant concentrations and profiles affect the biotic interactions and macroinvertebrate mediated degradation of sludge assessing degradation of sludge from three wwtps differing in contaminant profile by combinations of three macroinvertebrate detritovore taxa revealed that macroinvertebrate enhanced sludge degradation was wwtp and taxa combination specific yet taxa combinations only had an additional positive effect on sludge degradation when compared to single taxa in sludge with a higher contaminant load this was confirmed by the results of a cu spiked sludge degradation experiment indicating a possible effect of biotic interactions it was concluded that macroinvertebrates are a potential tool for the reduction of excess wwtp sludge and that using multispecies assemblages of detritivorous macroinvertebrates may increase the resilience of this additional treatment step keywords waste treatment plants excess sludge macroinvertebrates biotic interactions stress gradient hypothesis data availability data are available from the mendeley data repository van der meer et al 2022 https data mendeley com datasets z6ys4b763s 1 1 introduction the world s wastewater treatment plants wwtps produce unprecedented amounts of excess sludge the 323 dutch wwtps alone already produce over 1 250 million kg of sludge yearly cbs 2021 this excess sludge has to be processed and disposed but options for land filling and agriculture as a means of disposal have become limited collivignarelli et al 2019 hence the costs of sludge processing and disposal can make up to 60 of the total operational costs of a wwtp buys et al 2008 therefore there is a high demand for new strategies and technologies to reduce the mass of excess sludge to lower the economic and environmental impact christodoulou and stamatelatou 2016 as several macroinvertebrate detritivores play an important role in the degradation of organic matter in the aquatic environment they may also be capable to degrade wwtp sludge possibly mitigating the environmental impacts van der meer et al 2021 and costs of excess sludge disposal to this end aquatic oligochaete worms have been employed which can feed on wwtp sludge thereby reducing the amount of organic matter produced emamjomeh et al 2018 while deploying these oligochaetes has produced some promising results on an experimental scale li et al 2019 lópez visoet al 2021 success rates in larger scale setups have been varying due to complicating factors such as uncontrollable population dynamics of the oligochaetes tamis et al 2011 and low sludge degradation rates lópez viso et al 2022 oligochaete worms are however not the only macroinvertebrate detritivores involved in organic matter degradation in the aquatic environment the degradation of organic matter is a complex process that is mediated by natural assemblages of detritivores these detritivores exhibit different feeding traits and can interact during the degradation of organic matter which can lead to increased organic matter degradation rates costantini and rossi 2010 heard 1994 however competition between detritivores might reduce organic matter degradation therefore only focusing on oligochaete worms would exclude the numerous traits and feeding habits that macroinvertebrates possess which may be harnessed for sludge reduction purposes opposing forces are however also at play since wwtps receive wastewater containing a plethora of contaminants including heavy metals pharmaceuticals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons personal care products and pesticides which may affect the interactions between the different macroinvertebrate species and reduce sludge degradation rates bundschuh et al 2021 according to the stress gradient hypothesis sgh proposed by bertness and callaway 1994 see also silknetter et al 2020 when stress levels in the environment increase competitive interactions will decrease and positive interactions such as facilitation will increase hence when the environment becomes more stressful due to the presence of toxic contaminants negative interactions such as competition for resources might become less rigorous while positive interactions such as trophic facilitation might become more prevalent in a wwtp setup this could potentially counteract the adverse effects of contaminants on wwtp sludge degradation by detritivorous macroinvertebrates as the potential decrease in single species degradation rates might be partly compensated by less stringent competitive interactions or even turn into facilitation however the effects of wwtp contaminants on sludge degradation by macroinvertebrate assemblages remains currently unknown the aim of the present study was therefore to examine if wwtp contaminant concentrations and profiles affect macroinvertebrate mediated degradation of sludge and the biotic interactions we hypothesized that 1 higher contaminant loads would reduce macroinvertebrate sludge degradation rates 2 sludge degradation rates by macroinvertebrate assemblages would be less impacted than sludge reduction by single taxa at higher contaminant loads due to altered biotic interactions within the multi taxa assemblages to test these hypotheses we performed a sludge degradation experiment with sludge from three wwtps differing in contaminant profile and with all possible combinations of three macroinvertebrate detritivores differing in feeding and bioturbation traits subsequently we performed a similar sludge degradation experiment with different concentrations of cu spiked sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge collection sludge was collected from the aeration tanks of the wwtp rhenen 46 103 population equivalents p e 51 58 26 7 n 5 31 54 9 e wwtp mijdrecht 70 103 p e 52 12

processed within 2 h four to five buckets were used for the contaminant profiling and one was used for the sludge degradation experiment 2 2 test organisms and culture conditions for the experiments we selected larvae of the non biting midge chironomus riparius the snail physa acuta and tubificidae worms which all occur in organically rich contaminated environments such as wwtp impacted sites adler and courtney 2019 dos reis oliveira et al 2020 liang et al 2006 but differ in their feeding and bioturbation traits c riparius larvae bioturbate and bioirrigate sediments by constructing and ventilating tubes and deposit feed on the upper layer of the sediment whereas tubificidae worms are gallery diffusors and conveyer belt feeders feeding in deeper layers of the sediment and defecate at the sediment surface lagauzère et al 2009 p acuta snails on the other hand are primarily scraper grazers that move on top of the sediment costantini and rossi 2010 c riparius and p acuta were cultured in the laboratory at the university of amsterdam in dutch standard water dsw deionized water with an addition of 200 mg l 1 cacl2 2h2o 180 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 100 mg l 1 nahco3 and 20 mg l 1 khco3 at 20 1 c with a 12 12 h light dark photoperiod the tanks 20 l 30 20 20 cm l w h were gently aerated to maintain adequate 7 mg l 1 oxygen concentrations dsw was changed 1 2 times a week and deionized water was added to compensate for evaporation losses the c riparius tanks contained a sediment layer of 2 cm of quartz sand whereas p acuta was reared without a substrate c riparius was fed with a grinded 20 1 trouvit tetraphyll mixture p acuta was fed grinded tetraphyll twice a week tubificidae worms were bought from a fish feed wholesale and acclimatised to the same conditions as c riparius one week prior to the experiment additionally dried and shredded oak leaves were added to create an organic layer for the worms 2 3 experimental setup 2 3 1 degradation of wwtp sludge a 7 day degradation experiment with sludge from the three wwtps was run in which eight taxa assemblages were deployed n 5 consisting of a control without macroinvertebrates to assess initial degradation and 7 assemblages with equal macroinvertebrate biomass consisting of either one two or three taxa macroinvertebrate survival and sludge degradation were determined at the end of the experiment each experimental replicate consisted of a 50 ml glass beaker bottom surface area 11 3 cm2 to which 25 ml of homogenized sludge and 15 ml of dsw were added after approximately 30 min the sludge had settled on the bottom of the beaker forming a sediment like layer after 1 h the macroinvertebrates were added using either a plastic 5 ml pasteur pipette for the c riparius larvae and tubificidae worms or plastic tweezers for the p acuta snails to determine the sludge dw at the start of the experiment 5 additional beakers were prepared in the same way for each wwtp after which the overlying water was removed and the remaining sludge was dried in a stove at 65 c for 24 h to ensure equal biomass in all assemblages 8 9 mg dw 18 9 or 6 c riparius larvae 6 3 or 2 p acuta snails and 36 18 or 12 tubificidae worms were used in the single taxa c t and p two taxa ct cp and tp and three taxa ctp assemblages respectively based on currently established length dry weight relationships fig s1 early 4th stage c riparius larvae with a mean length of 9 7 mm sd 1 5 mm and snails with a length of 4 5 5 7 mm were used the weight of the tubificidae worms was based on the average of 30 individuals to ensure depuration of the gut content all macroinvertebrates were starved for 24 h before the start of the 7 day sludge degradation experiment during the 7 day experiment the beakers were kept under controlled conditions at 20 1 c with a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod and gently aerated to prevent anoxic conditions at the start half way and at the end of the experiment the ph conductivity and oxygen concentration were measured using a portable multi meter hach hq40 with the appropriate probes phc101 cdc401 ldo101 respectively the beakers were checked daily for emerged c riparius adults and p acuta egg packages and both were subsequently removed a new c riparius larvae was added for the removed adult to ensure equal biomass during the 7 day experiment out of the 598 initially used larvae 13 2 were replaced due to emergence of the adult in eleven replicates one adult was replaced and one replicate 2 adults were replaced at the end of the 7 day experiment the overlying water in the beakers was discarded to determine the survival of the macroinvertebrates these were collected using a plastic pasteur pipette or plastic tweezers and counted the remaining sludge was dried at 65 c for 24 h and subsequently weighed sludge degradation was determined as the difference between the average start dw and the individual replicate final dw of the sludge 2 3 2 degradation of cu spiked sludge to assess if macroinvertebrate interactions and macroinvertebrate mediated sludge degradation are affected by increased contaminant concentrations we performed a 7 day sludge degradation test with cu spiked sludge from rhenen and combinations of c riparius larvae and p acuta snails cu was chosen as a model contaminant and sludge from rhenen was selected as it was presumed that it had the lowest initial contaminant loads of the three wwtps this resulted in 4 species assemblages c riparius larvae c p acuta snails p c riparius p acuta cp and a control without macroinvertebrates in the single species assemblages either 28 c riparius larvae with a mean length of 7 5 mm sd 1 3 mm or 6 p acuta snails with a length of 5 5 6 5 mm were added in the cp assemblage 14 c riparius larvae and 3 p acuta snails were added all assemblages consisted of 4 replicates the same methods as in section 2 3 1 were followed to perform the experiment at the end of the 7 day experiment in addition to the methods mentioned in section 2 3 1 the c riparius larvae were pooled per replicate beaker dried at 65 c for 24 h and weighed to determine the average dw of the larvae to determine the growth of the larvae during the experiment the difference between the average initial larval dw based on the length dw correlation fig s1 and average final larval dw was calculated for each beaker the cu concentration in the sludge and the overlying water at the end of the experiment were determined using the methods described in section 2 4 2 2 4 sludge contaminant profiles and contaminant analyses the sludge solids in the buckets n 4 for alkmaar and rhenen n 5 for mijdrecht were allowed to precipitate for 1 h whereafter the overlying water was siphoned off and the remaining material was poured into a 2 l bottle which was stored at 4 c overnight the following day the overlying water was siphoned off again and the solids were frozen freeze dried ground with a ball grinder and stored in airtight bottles at room temperature until further analysis 2 4 1 metal analysis to determine the concentration of the metals al as ag cd cr cu fe mn ni pb se and zn in the sludge samples were digested by transferring 500 mg of dw sludge into a teflon bomb to which 10 ml of 65 hno3 was added the samples were heated to 175 c in 5 5 min and maintained at this temperature for another 4 5 min in a microwave multiwave pro anton paar and were then allowed to cool down for 1 h all according to the epa 3051a protocol u s epa 2007 as advised by the manufacturer anton paar the contents of the teflon bombs were poured into 25 ml volumetric flasks and the volume was adjusted to 25 ml with ultrapure water a subsample of 9 ml was taken from each flask and 1 ml of internal standard 0 5 ml of 20 ppm yttrium and 0 5 ml of 40 ppm caesiumchloride was added as a control two blank teflon bombs were added per microwave run subsequently the metal concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes optima 8000 icp oes perkinelmer detection limits can be found in supplementary table s1 2 4 2 organic contaminant analysis 2 4 2 1 sample preparation to extract the organic contaminants of each experimental replicate a quechers method validated in our laboratory was applied in short 10 g of dw sludge was added to 50 ml sterile polypropylene pp tubes filled with 6 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate mgso4 and 1 5 g of sodium acetate naac and spiked with 50 µl of a 200 µg l stock solution of internal standards 30 ml of acetonitrile was added mixed for one hour and subsequently centrifuged for 15 min the supernatant was then transferred into clean 50 ml sterile pp tubes and mixed for 15 min with the addition of 300 mg magnesium sulfate mgso4 100 mg primary secondary amine psa and 100 mg octyldecylsilane c18 whereafter the sample was evaporated to 0 5 ml under a gentle nitrogen flow subsequently 150 mg of active carbon was added to the sample and the sample was diluted to 15 ml by adding ultrapure water with these samples a second solid phase extraction was performed based on a slightly modified version of albergamo et al 2018 briefly extraction cartridges oasis hlb 60 µg waters were conditioned with 5 ml of methanol and equilibrated with 5 ml of ultrapure water the 15 ml sample was loaded on the cartridges and left to dry for 20 min after which the cartridges were eluted with 2 2 5 ml methanol by vacuum this extract was collected filtered 0 22 µm disk filter and evaporated to 0 5 ml prior to injection the extracts were diluted 5 times 2 4 2 2 lc hrms analysis to quantify the concentrations of 133 organic contaminants a six point calibration curve was created in ultrapure water spiked to 8 µg l and serially diluted to obtain six concentration factors with 250 ng l being the lowest concentration calibration lines displayed r squared values greater than 0 99 of the measured compounds 63 lacked an internal standard here an external standard calibration was used instead consequently this part of the data could only be used to compare relative concentrations between the simultaneously analysed wwtps supplementary table s2 for complete compound target list a liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry lc ms was performed on a maxis uhplc q tof system based on a slightly modified version of the instrumental method of albergamo et al 2018 in short ms detection separation of a 20 μl sample in both positive and negative esi mode was achieved with a core shell kinetex biphenyl column 100 2 1 mm 2 6 μm particle size and 100 å pore size phenomenex utrecht the netherlands the mobile phase consisted of two solutions i e a ultrapure water with acetic acid 0 05 and b methanol with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min the lc gradient was 0 methanol from 0 to 2 min increased linearly to 100 at 17 min and kept equal until 25 min the system was allowed to re equilibrate for 7 min before the next injection prior to each injection a 50 μm sodium acetate solution in h2o meoh 1 1 v v was introduced automatically for m z recalibration of the system during data processing the column oven was kept at 40 c ms and data independent ms ms data were acquired with positive and negative esi in separate runs with a resolving power typically of 30 000 60 000 fwhm full scan ms and msms spectra acquired in broad band collision induced dissociation mode bbcid were screened for the accurate masses retention time tr mass accuracy isotopic fit and msms for unambiguous identification of the targeted organic contaminants 2 4 3 cu spiked sludge for the sludge degradation experiment with cu spiked sludge 3 concentrations of cu spiked sludge were prepared by pouring 500 ml of sludge from rhenen into a single glass bottle per cu concentration the bottles were manually swerved and 5 ml of either deionized water 3585 µg l 1 or 7170 µg l 1 cucl2 2h2o stock solution was slowly added to each of the bottles this resulted in a nominal cu concentration of 200 mg kg 1 cu0 5940 mg kg 1 cul and 11 880 mg kg 1 cuh cu per dw sludge to ensure even mixing the bottles with spiked sludge were aerated for 16 h before the start of the experiment to determine the actual cu concentration in the sludge the methods from 2 1 2 a were followed for the cu concentration in the overlying water 9 ml water samples n 16 were directly analyzed with the icp aes after the addition of the internal standards 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 clustering analysis of chemical data the concentrations of the 55 contaminants that were present in at least one of the sludge samples were normalised so that a value of 1 represented the highest measured concentration of that specific contaminant the 13 sludge samples n 4 for alkmaar and rhenen n 5 for mijdrecht were then clustered based on these normalised concentrations as we aimed to assess the hierarchical structure of the wwtps based on the contaminant concentrations an agglomerative clustering technique agnes was applied on the normalized contaminant concentrations agnes grouped the sludge samples sequentially into larger clusters ending with a single cluster containing all samples for clustering decisions ward s criterion was used which aimed to minimize the within cluster variation of a potential new cluster after merging two lower tier clusters to assess which contaminant concentrations were correlated in the sludge samples the same cluster analysis was applied to the normalized contaminant concentrations to give an overview of the wwtp contaminant profiles the resulting dendrograms were presented as a heatmap kolde 2019 of the normalised contaminant concentrations we acknowledge that although we analysed 145 contaminants to create the chemical profiles wwtp sludges contain a plethora of other unknown contaminants this hampers the possibility to attribute observed effects on sludge degradation to specific measured groups of contaminants as the known measured contaminants often explain only a small fraction of observed effects when analysed in iceberg modeling studies escher et al 2020 neale et al 2017 2 5 2 calculation of predicted sludge degradation to assess if biotic interactions played a role during sludge degradation the predicted sludge degradation by the two and three taxa assemblages was calculated based on the sludge degradation by the single taxa assemblages if no biotic interactions would occur in the two or three taxa assemblages the expected degradation would be the average of the sludge degradation in the corresponding single taxa assemblages therefore the expected sludge degradation in the two or three taxa assemblages was calculated by averaging a random sample from one single taxa assemblage with a random sample from another single taxa assemblage until all samples in those assemblages were assigned fugère et al 2012 this created a new expected assemblage with the same number of replicates as the corresponding single taxa assemblages the same method was used to assess if the sludge degradation in the chironomus physa assemblage was affected differently by increased cu concentrations than what would be expected based on both single species assemblages 2 5 3 statistical analysis differences between locations in sludge dry weight and conductivity at the start of the experiment were assessed with a one way anova 1w aov and a tukeyhsd post hoc test to analyses if conductivity changed over time and was affected by macroinvertebrate assemblage a two way anova 2w aov was performed for each location separately with conductivity as a dependent variable and time start day 3 day 7 and taxa assemblage as independent variables to assess differences in survival between macroinvertebrate taxa and wwtp locations a general linear model glm with a binomial function was used with the number of surviving and deceased individuals as the dependent variable and taxa and wwtp location as independent variables including the interaction term a pairwise analysis of estimated marginal means was performed to calculate p values between groups to determine differences in baseline sludge degradation between wwtp locations a 1w aov was performed with the degradation of the control treatments of the three wwtps as a dependent variable and the wwtp location as an independent variable followed by a tukeyhsd post hoc test subsequently to assess differences in sludge degradation between macroinvertebrate assemblages and locations a 2w aov with taxa assemblage and wwtp location and their interaction term as independent variables was performed also followed by a tukeyhsd post hoc test to assess macroinvertebrate assemblage effect on degradation for each location separately three separate 1w aovs with subsequent tukeyhsd post hoc tests were performed for each location as the interaction term from the previous 2w aov was significant to compare the expected and observed sludge degradation of multi taxa assemblages a separate 1w aov was performed for each expected observed assemblage pair with degradation as the dependent variable although some deviations from the assumption of normality occurred we chose to use anovas as these are robust against these deviations to assess the effect of cu and species assemblage on survival of both c riparius and p acuta the growth of the c riparius larvae and the sludge degradation 2w aov tests were performed with cu concentration species assemblage and the interaction as independent variables and either survival of c riparius p acuta c riparius growth or degraded sludge as dependent variable if applicable these 2w anovas were followed by a tukeyhsd post hoc test to compare the expected and observed sludge degradation of the cp assemblages a separate 1w aov was performed for each expected observed pair per cu concentration to assess the effect of cu concentration and taxa assemblage on the conductivity in the experiments two 2w anovas were performed for the start and end of the experiment with the cu concentration and taxa assemblage as well as their interactions as independent variables and conductivity as a dependent variable statistical tests and the clustering analysis were performed in core r 3 6 1 r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 experimental conditions oxygen levels in

assemblages was only higher than the predicted sludge degradation based on the single taxa assemblages for the tubificidae physa and chironomus tubificidae physa combinations in alkmaar f1 8 3 8 p 0 05 suggesting only limited biotic interactions 3 3 wwtp sludge contaminant profiles of the 133 organic contaminants and 12 heavy metals that were analysed a total of 44 organic contaminants and 11 heavy metals were present and quantified in the sludge samples of the three wwtps the cluster analysis of the chemical data generated an agglomerative coefficient of 0 73 scale 0 00 1 00 indicating a decent clustering structure which confirms that the ward s criterion was suitable for clustering the sludge samples the cluster analysis revealed that the contaminant profiles of the sludge from rhenen and mijdrecht were more similar compared to alkmaar and moreover the sludge from the wwtp of alkmaar contained the highest concentrations of 34 out of the 55 contaminants alkmaar was also characterized by several contaminants occurring only at that wwtp such as the herbicides dimethanamid p metamitron and metobrumoron the insecticide pyriproxyfen and the pharmaceuticals sulfamethazine ibuprofen and carbamazepine fig 2 1st cluster several other contaminants occurred only at mijdrecht such as the pesticides fenuron methiocarb and methyl pirimifos 3rd cluster there were no contaminants however that were solely measured in sludge from rhenen although higher concentrations of the antibiotics clindamycin and trimethoprim were characteristic for rhenen 2nd cluster a large group of contaminants was present in the sludge of all three wwtps occurring in the two lowest clusters which included common metals such as zn cr and ni but also widely used pharmaceuticals such as triclosan and paracetamol 4th and 5th cluster also notable is the presence of the pesticides mcpp 2 6 dichlorobenxamide and fipronil at alkmaar and mijdrecht which were absent at rhenen 3 4 macroinvertebrate survival growth and degradation of cu spiked sludge to evaluate the effects of contaminants on biotic interactions and sludge degradation in more detail sludge from the wwtp in rhenen was spiked with cu and subjected to the invertebrate assemblages the measured cu concentrations in the spiked sludge were close to the nominal concentrations supplementary table s3 at the end of the experiment the oxygen concentrations ranged between 5 5 and 8 0 mg l and the ph ranged between 6 5 and 7 5 in all treatments the conductivity was affected by the cu concentration at the start of the experiment 468 14 610 7 and 665 12 us cm se for cu0 cul and cuh respectively f2 45 82 0 p 0 001 and was higher at the end of the experiment 557 21 719 21 and 773 33 us cm se for cu0 cul and cuh f2 36 54 5 p 0 001 with species assemblage also having an effect f3 36 13 1 p 0 001 fig s3 this was likely due to differences in the degradation of the sludge and the addition of cucl2 in the spiked treatments survival of p acuta f2 18 100 p 0 001 was significantly lower at the highest cu concentration as no snails survived at this concentration both with and without the presence of c riparius the survival of c riparius was only significantly lower at the highest cu concentration in the presence of snails as indicated by the significant interaction term f2 18 100 p 0 001 fig 3 a greek letters growth of the c riparius larvae decreased significantly with increasing cu concentrations in the sludge f2 16 80 7 p 0 001 fig 3b latin letters but was positively affected by the presence of p acuta f1 16 14 1 p 0 01 although only at the low cu concentration p 0 05 fig 3b greek letters hence positive biotic interactions were manifested at the cul concentration and did not occur at cu0 nor at cuh likely due to the overall detrimental effect of cu on physa performance and thus high mortality at this concentration sludge degradation in all species assemblages was significantly lower at the highest cu concentration f2 36 24 5 p 0 001 compared to the cu0 and the low cu concentration both p 0 05 fig 4 latin letters the difference in sludge degradation was also marginally significant p 0 07 between the cu0 and cul concentration species assemblage had also a significant effect on sludge degradation f3 36 4 4 p 0 01 but only at the cul concentration as the c riparius larvae and the c riparius p acuta combination accomplished a higher sludge degradation than the control without invertebrates p 0 05 these effects were not significant though in the non spiked control sludge and the cuh sludge fig 4 greek letters at the highest cu concentration this was again likely due to the high physa mortality and inhibited c riparius larval growth the observed sludge degradation by the multispecies assemblage cp was only significantly higher than the predicted degradation predcp at the cul concentration f1 6 13 6 p 0 01 fig 4 indicated by the asterisk at cuh no effect on sludge degradation in cp was observed compared to the predicted sludge degradation predcp which was likely due to the high physa mortality and low chironomus growth and the very low sludge degradation in general at this cu concentration 4 discussion in line with our hypothesis wwtp contaminant profiles affected sludge degradation by macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates generally enhanced sludge degradation although the intensity of this enhancement was wwtp and taxa assemblage specific sludge degradation by combinations of taxa was however only higher than expected in sludges with a higher contaminant load indicating an effect of biotic interactions 4 1 wwtp specific sludge degradation the sludge degradation in absence of macroinvertebrates differed between the three wwtps this is not surprising as no wwtp is exactly alike due to a difference in incoming volumes and the origins of wastewater with different contaminant loads and profiles microbial communities and treatment steps with a range of settings elevated contaminant concentrations indeed affect the capability of wwtps to reduce sludge maal bared 2020 ren 2004 hence the presently observed differences in contaminant profiles and concentrations between the wwtps may explain the lower sludge degradation in alkmaar as it had the highest contaminant load and was characterized by the presence of multiple pesticides possibly indicating increased pressures from an agricultural origin the same was the case for mijdrecht with multiple pesticides present in the sludge rhenen on the other hand contained a lower concentration and number of contaminants and pesticides allowing for a higher sludge degradation macroinvertebrates were able to enhance the degradation of sludge in each wwtp but the magnitude of this enhancement differed between the wwtps as there was only a certain amount of organic matter to be degraded in our experimental setup a high initial degradation such as in rhenen would limit the contribution of macroinvertebrates to the overall high sludge degradation oppositely when contaminant concentrations in the sludge are high such as in alkmaar the initial sludge degradation of the wwtp as well as the macroinvertebrate performance may be hampered bundschuh et al 2021 leading to the lowest joint sludge degradation macroinvertebrates may have the highest positive impact on sludge degradation at wwtps like mijdrecht where the sludge degradation is relatively low due to an intermediate contaminant profile and load but where macroinvertebrate performance is not yet greatly affected here macroinvertebrates enhanced sludge degradation the most the results from the cu spike sludge experiment are in line with these observations as the c riparius larvae and p acuta snails enhanced the sludge degradation the most at the intermediate cu concentration at the lowest cu concentration sludge degradation was already high and therefore the macroinvertebrates increased the sludge degradation only slightly while at the highest cu concentration sludge degradation was low and the macroinvertebrates were severely hampered hence it was at the intermediate cu concentration that macroinvertebrates enhanced sludge degradation the most 4 2 positive biotic interactions may occur at moderate contaminant loads higher than expected sludge degradation only occurred at the wwtp in alkmaar which had the highest contaminant load as well as in intermediate cu spiked sludge from rhenen this higher than expected sludge degradation could be the result of the altered biotic interactions at these contaminant concentrations although the exact mechanisms underlying the observed increase in degradation remain to be unraveled our results are in line with the predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis bertness and callaway 1994 which states that in a more stressful environment the prevalence of positive biotic interactions increases while the intensity of negative interactions decrease however the high mortality and low growth and the low degradation at the highest cu concentration in the cu spiked sediment does emphasize that possible benefits of biotic interactions only occur below a certain contaminant level as above this level effects of contaminants on macroinvertebrates may be too severe in contrast with studies on the effect of macroinvertebrate interactions or richness on the degradation of natural organic matter and leaves costantini and rossi 2010 jabiol et al 2013 tonin et al 2018 we did observe relatively few biotic interactions this might be due to the homogenous composition of wwtp sludge whereas leave packs may contain multiple leave species which have nerves and more woody parts a more homogenous environment is more prone to competitive interactions whereas an environment with more substrate variation allows for more niche differentiation and resource partitioning townsend 1989 thus being more prone to positive biotic interactions the taxa assemblages degrading more sludge than expected were the tubificidae physa and chironomus tubificidae physa assemblages from alkmaar and the chironomus physa assemblage in cu spiked sludge from rhenen one of the causes of the increased sludge degradation in these treatments might be a decrease in movements of the snails brown et al 2012 gao et al 2017 which may cause photo and thigmotactic stimuli that cause retractions of the tubificidae and the c riparius larvae into the sediment drewes and fourtner 1989 gresens 1995 these frequent retractions may result in less time spend on feeding and therefore a lower sludge degradation hence lower snail activity may result in a higher joint sludge degradation on the other hand snails may benefit from the presence of other taxa as the burrowing and feeding behavior by the tubificidae and chironomus larvae could alter the fungal and bacterial composition of the sludge hunting et al 2012 poulsen et al 2014 samuiloviene et al 2019 making it a more suitable food source for the snails these positive interactions may also explain the increased sludge degradation and growth of the c riparius larvae in the chironomus physa assemblage at the cul concentration hence biotic interactions occurring between these invertebrates partly mitigate the negative impacts of increased contaminant concentrations other positive biotic interactions may have also occurred due to the snail presence as the snail feces might be a more suitable food for the tubificids phipps et al 1993 and the c riparius larvae than the sludge itself additionally pedal mucus produced by the snails might adsorb a part of the labile contaminants possibly reducing the contaminant concentration in the overlying water jugdaohsingh et al 1998 thus limiting exposure of the other macroinvertebrates another possibility for positive effects on the larval growth is the dampening of intraspecific competition in multi taxa assemblages under resource limited conditions intraspecific competition is often more stringent than interspecific competition and thus multi taxa assemblages could dampen the effect of intraspecific competition costantini and rossi 2010 mckie et al 2009 we do acknowledge that further research would be needed to confirm the exact mechanisms underlying the positive effects of multi taxa assemblages on sludge degradation such experiments may try to disentangle the direct behavioural interactions between macroinvertebrates gresens 1995 and indirect interactions such as alterations of the sludge environment by one macroinvertebrate regarding bacterial and fungal mass and composition costantini and rossi 2010 graça et al 1993 and organic contaminant concentrations van der meer et al 2022 ideally this would be accomplished by an experiment in which one species of invertebrate would be allowed to manipulate the sludge for a certain amount of time removed from the sludge and introducing another macroinvertebrate into the altered sludge 4 3 perspectives a role for macroinvertebrates in the reduction of the amount of excess wwtp sludge while previously the use of tubificidae in wwtps has garnered most attention in our setup their sludge degradation was consistently the lowest per unit of dw biomass of the selected taxa which is in line with our previous work van der meer et al 2021 the present study therefore emphasizes the need to widen the scope of research and to investigate the sludge degradation potential of other combinations of macroinvertebrate species which seems promising on the present experimental scale an additional advantage of using multiple macroinvertebrates for the degradation of sludge is the increased combined resilience to contaminants that such a system may have as positive biotic interactions between the different macroinvertebrates could limit the negative impact of elevated contaminant concentrations on sludge degradation to some extent contrary to wastewater treatment steps with tubificidae no attempts to scale up treatment steps with midges or snails have been made yet to achieve a successful treatment of sludge with these macroinvertebrates life cycle traits and population dynamics have to be taken into account as to assure consistent reproduction and to prevent negative intraspecific interactions cope and winterbourn 2004 on the other hand the chironomus density used in this experiment was still five times lower than some natural population densities groenendijk et al 1998 indicating that sludge degradation rates could even be higher due to the high growth rate high fertility and short life cycle of both c riparius and p acuta employing these species in wastewater treatment would result in the production of substantial amounts of invertebrate biomass this biomass could potentially be harvested removing additional organic matter chironomus riparius has the advantage that the terrestrial adult phase allows for a relatively easy collection and harvesting reyes maldonado et al 2021 the exuviae left behind after emergence containing often higher contaminant concentrations might be skimmed and collected from the water surface the solid shells of p acuta would likely allow a separation from sludge and overlying water by sieving if contaminant concentrations in the harvested biomass are below regulatory limits this macroinvertebrate mass might be used as a resource for novel products as is already the case with multiple species of duckweed grown on wastewater liu et al 2021 although bioaccumulation of contaminants may be limited van der meer et al 2022 care should be still taken to perform regular contaminant analysis on novel products produced with this mass the successful application of macroinvertebrates in the treatment of wastewater might offer an alternative to the more high tech energy consuming post treatment steps such as ozone or uv treatment moreover the reduction of operational costs relatively simple techniques possible production of new biomaterials and the global occurrence of macroinvertebrates with the appropriate traits may offer benefits to countries without the infrastructure to build these high tech post treatments 5 conclusions the contaminant profiles of wwtp sludges affected sludge degradation by macroinvertebrates with higher contaminant loads resulting in a lower sludge degradation nonetheless most single and multi taxa macroinvertebrate assemblages employed in this study enhanced sludge degradation moreover the degradation capacity of multi species macroinvertebrate assemblages may be more resilient to moderate contaminant loads of wwtp sludge the present study thus showed that macroinvertebrates are a potential tool for the reduction of excess wwtp sludge and that using multispecies assemblages of detritivorous macroinvertebrates may increase the resilience of this additional treatment step

15621,the degradation of iopamidol ipm was investigated using a uv365 naclo system the reactive species ho clo ozone cl and cl 2 in the system were identified and the changing trends of the percentage contributions of these reactive species to ipm removal under various conditions were systematically evaluated the results showed that clo and ho played the most significant roles in the apparent pseudo first order rate constants of ipm degradation k obs min 1 in the control experiment and their percentage contributions to k obs were 41 31 and 34 45 respectively in addition cl and cl 2 together contributed 22 to the k obs furthermore the contribution of ozone to the ipm removal could be neglected the concentrations of these species increased significantly when the concentration of naclo was increased from 50 µm to 200 µm while the percentage contribution of clo to k obs was greatly increased the concentrations and percentage contributions of ho and clo decreased significantly as the solution ph increased from 5 to 9 with cl 2 playing a greater role in the degradation of ipm under alkaline conditions while cl or hco3 co3 2 significantly promoted the generation of cl 2 or co3 neither had an obvious effect on k obs suggesting that cl 2 and co3 should have a certain reactivity with ipm compared with that of cl 2 the percentage contribution of clo and cl to k obs was more likely to be inhibited by nom in addition the organic and inorganic oxidation products of ipm were detected the oxidation mechanisms of ipm degradation in the uv365 naclo system such as the h extraction reaction deiodination substitution reaction amide hydrolysis and amine oxidation were proposed according to the obtained 15 organic products no effect on acute toxicity towards vibrio

studies have only calculated the effects of various radicals in control experiments with contrasting results for instance li et al 2020 suggested that the percentage contribution of ho to acetaminophen degradation in the uv365 naclo system was only 3 09 however tan et al 2020 found that rcs and ho contributed to 47 9 and 45 7 of the removal of phenacetin in the same system respectively where ozone could be generated and played a role in the removal of phenacetin approximately 2 7 thus the percentage contributions of different active components in this system remains a topic of controversy and requires further research furthermore there have been no studies on the varying trends of the concentration and percentage contributions of reactive species under different water matrices and experimental conditions in the uv365 naclo system the objective of this study was i to investigate the degradation kinetics of ipm under various conditions in the uv365 naclo system ii to assess the steady state concentrations and percentage contributions of reactive species under various conditions i e water matrix and experimental conditions iii to propose a possible degradation mechanism of ipm removal in the uv365 naclo system and iv to evaluate the acute toxicity risk of secondary oxidation products in the system by identifying of organic and inorganic products and acute toxicological tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the specific parameters are shown in text s1 the information on experimental solvent and actual water is also presented here all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and used without further purification 2 2 experimental procedures the uv365 naclo system comprised the experimental device shown in text s2 and figure s1 the uv irradiation wavelength and irradiation intensity were 365 nm and 49 mw cm2 respectively the experiments were conducted in a l00 ml quartz dish reactor the reaction solution contained 5 μm ipm and was stirred continuously using a magnetic stirrer the ph value of the solutions was buffered to ph 5 or 7 by using 5 mm phosphate buffer and to ph 9 using sodium tetraborate buffer adjusted using hclo4 and naoh the presence of hclo4 had no effect on the removal on ipm removal figure s2 according to different experimental designs a concentration of cl hco 3 and natrual organic matter nom was added followed by the addition of 200 μm naclo to determine the effect of oxidants concentration naclo at different concentrations 50 100 200 300 and 400 μm was introduced into the reaction system na2s2o3 solution was added as the terminator in a 2 ml sample bottle in advance the uv lamp was turned on to start the reaction and 1 ml of the sample solution was placed into the sample bottle at the predetermined time point reactive species detection experiments were carried out under anoxic conditions to control for the influence of dissolved oxygen to ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration was less than 0 1 mg l 1 nitrogen was supplemented from 20 min before the reaction to the end of the reaction the ph of the solution was measured before and after each experiment and the change was less than 0 2 for acute toxicity assessment solutions collected at certain intervals during the degradation of ipm were evaluated as the experimental samples using the uv365 naclo system under standard group conditions this was based on the standard test method for assessing the toxicity of drinking water using a water quality determination of the acute toxicity luminescent bacteria test gb t15441 1995 china and water quality determination of the inhibitory effect of water samples on the light emission of vibrio fischeri luminescent bacteria test iso11348 3 2007 photobacterium phosphoreum and vibrio fischeri were used to evaluate the changes in acute toxicity during the degradation of ipm in addition a blank sample was used to compare the degree of inhibition of the experimental sample collected during the degradation process briefly the lyophilised powder of vibrio fischeri and photobacterium phosphoreum was collected and stored at 20 upon further use the samples were thawed at room temperature followed by the addition of a resuscitation diluent then the prepared sample was mixed with an osmotic pressure regulating solution in a 1 5 ml ep tube at a ratio of 9 1 followed by the addition of a certain amount of bacteria the mixture was allowed to stand for 15 min and 30 min respectively before placing in a luminous detector promega glomax 20 20 for

agilent q tof 6500 ms system i and io3 were detected using dionex ics 1600 ion chromatography hoi was indirectly determined by the iodophenol concentration the instrumental parameters and operational methods are described in text s3 the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and nom were determined using a toc analyser toc l shimadzu the ph of the solution was measured using a ph metre phs 3c shanghai leici 2 4 kinetics research methods the degradation of ipm was expressed in the langmuir hinshelwood kinetics mode using eq 8 8 k o b s d l n c 0 c t d t where the k obs min 1 is the apparent pseudo first order rate constant of ipm degradation and c0 and ct are the initial and remaining concentrations of ipm respectively 2 5 calculation of the percentage contribution of reactive species according to the literature uv irradiation ho cl cl2 clo and ozone contribute to the removal of ipm which can be expressed as follows eq 9 9 k o b s k u v d i r e c t k h o k c l k c l 2 k c l o k o z

respectively the percentage contributions of uv irradiation ruv and ozone rozone can be calculated using eqs 10 11 10 r u v k u v d i r e c t k o b s 11 r o z o n e k o b s k n i t r o g e n p u r g i

be calculated using eqs 12 13 12 r h o k h o k o b s k h o i p m ho s s k o b s 13 r clo k clo k obs k c l o i p m clo ss k obs where k h o i p m and k clo ipm are the second order rate constants of ipm reacting with ho and clo respectively table s3 k clo ipm was obtained using competitive dynamics and the detailed calculation method can be found in text s4 and figure s3 ho ss and clo ss are steady state concentrations of ho and clo respectively in this study nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were used as probe organics to calculate ho ss and clo ss hua et al 2019 to avoid the influence of ozone on the probe organics all experiments were purged with nitrogen from 20 min before the reaction to the end of the reaction nb reacts with ho only ba reacts with ho and cl and dmob reacts with ho cl and clo alfassi et al 1988 fang et al 2014 hua et al 2019 mvula et al 2009 figure s4 shows that the degradation of nb and ba by uv365 was negligible and only naclo in the dark could not degrade these three probes accordingly ho ss cl ss and clo ss can be calculated using eqs 14 16 14 ho ss k nb k ho nb 15 cl ss k ba k ho ba ho ss k cl ba 16 clo ss k dmob k ho dmob ho ss k cl dmob cl ss k uv dmob k clo dmob where k nb k ba and k dmob are the pseudo first order rate constants for the degradation of nb ba and dmob in the presence of ipm 5 µm by uv365 naclo system respectively k uv dmob is the pseudo first order rate constant for the degradation of dmob by uv365 direct irradiation k ho nb k ho ba and k ho dmob are the second order rate constants of ho react

with dmob data are shown in table s3 unfortunately the second order rate constants of cl with ipm are unknown and the percentage contribution of cl to k obs and the steady state concentration of cl2 cannot be obtained thus the percentage contributions of cl and cl2 to k obs could not be obtained in this study although they were calculated together i e r cl cl2 using eq 17 17 r c l c l 2 1 r h o r

uv365 and uv365 naclo respectively as shown in fig 1 the removal of ipm by naclo or uv365 alone was negligible within 60 min the degradation of ipm was significantly promoted during the uv365 naclo process approximately 90 91 of ipm could be eliminated in only 30 min by uv365 naclo and the degradation of ipm in this process followed pseudo first order kinetics k obs 0 083min 1 similar to other advanced oxidation processes e g uv h2o2 uv pds visible light ag3po4 nc visible light ag3po4 w2n3 nv and fe n c peroxymonosulfate a variety of radicals play a major role in the degradation of micropollutants zhang et al 2022 lin et al 2020 2022 wu et al 2020 in the uv365 naclo system ho rcs cl clo and cl 2 and ozone were identified as the main reactive species the percentage contributions of these reactive species to the control experiment were investigated figure s5 s6 the results showed that i the k obs under anaerobic conditions was essentially the same as that under aerobic conditions i e 0 0169 s 1 vs 0 0168 s 1 suggesting that the contribution of ozone to the degradation of ipm could be ignored approximately 0 59 this result could be attributed to the fact that the second order rate constant of the reaction of ozone with ipm is low i e k 18 0 1 4 m 1s 1 ning and graham 2008 however if the reaction activity between ozone and target pollutants is considerable it should pay attention to the role of ozone in uv365 naclo system ii although the reaction activity between ho and ipm had a magnitude that was 47 fold that of clo i e 3 42 109 m 1s 1 vs 7 3 107m 1s 1 table s3 the steady state concentration of clo clo ss was nearly 2 orders that of ho ho ss i e 0 951 10 11m vs 1 692 10 13m therefore the percentage contribution of clo to ipm degradation was greater than that of ho i e 41 31 vs 34 45 fig 2 a iii the sum of the percentage contributions of cl and cl 2 to the removal of ipm was only approximately 22 96 which may be due to the low steady state concentration of free radicals or due to their reactivity with ipm being lower than that of ho and clo as shown in fig 2b the steady state concentration of cl cl ss was only 7 863 10 15 m in addition the 2 hydroxypropanamide n 1 3 dihydroxypropan 2 yl acetamide and iodo groups on the benzene ring of ipm are electron poor groups suggesting the inefficiency of electron transfer attack on ipm 3 2 effect of oxidant concentration the degradation of ipm was tested by controlling the oxidant concentration in the uv365 naclo system figure s6 s7 as shown in fig 3 a when the concentration of naclo increased from 50 μm to 400 μm the degradation of ipm increased from 57 46 to 83 18 and k obs increased from 0 0580 min 1 to 0 1200 min 1 as shown in fig 3b this suggestst that ho ss clo ss and cl ss were promoted with an increase in naclo concentration taking clo as an example compared with when 50 μm naclo was used clo ss increased 3 87 times when the concentration of naclo was 200 μm however it is worth noting that when the naclo concentration was higher than 200 μm the increase in k obs showed a downward trend according to the calculation k obs increased by only 2 fold while naclo increased 8 fold i e 0 0580 min 1 at 50 μm naclo vs 0 1200 min 1 at 400 μm naclo furthermore as shown in fig 3c ho and cl cl 2 played a major role in ipm degradation at low oxidiser concentrations whereas clo played a more important role when increasing the oxidiser concentration for instance the percentage contribution of clo increased from 16 87 to 41 37 when the concentration of naclo increased from 50 μm to 200 μm whereas the percentage contributions of ho and cl to ipm degradation were significantly decreased these results were mainly attributed to the excess hclo clo that captured ho and cl eqs 6 7 grebel et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 compared with clo ss the cl ss 10 15 10 16 m was approximately 3 4 orders of magnitude lower although the degradation of ipm was also promoted by the increase in cl ss the percentage contribution of cl decreased due to the much larger increase in the contribution of clo 3 3 effect of ph next the effect of ph value on ipm degradation in the uv365 naclo system was investigated figure s8 s9 as shown in fig 4 a the degradation of ipm at ph 5 7 and 9 was 91 09 77 78 and 66 98 respectively while the k obs values were 0 1622 min 1 0 1019 min 1 and 0 0747 min 1 respectively these results indicate that the uv365 naclo system was conducive to the degradation of ipm at low ph but inhibited it at a high ph since the pka of ipm is 10 7 gao et al 2019 the form of ipm does not change significantly in the experimental contents of this section therefore the change in ph mainly affects the change in the reactive species in the system as shown in fig 4b and c the concentrations and percentage contributions of ho and clo decreased significantly with the increasing solution ph for instance when the ph increased from ph 5 to 9 ho ss clo ss and cl ss decreased from 5 18 10 13 m 8 13 10 12 m and 2 75 10 14 m to 1 13 10 13 m 1 78 10 12 m and 2 42 10 16 m respectively this could be attributed to the following i various radicals are more likely to be captured under alkaline conditions buxton et al 1988 fang et al 2014 kong et al 2016 leading to the production of less reactive radicals e g cloh and o eqs 18 21 ii the nernst equation eq 22 indicates that the redox potential e 0 of ho decreases with increasing ph nikravesh et al 2020 the redox potential of ho was calculated to be 2 51 v and 2 27 v at ph 5 and 9 respectively which can lead to a decrease in the oxidative capacity of ho under alkaline conditions thus affecting the degradation of ipm 18 o h h o o h 2 o k 1 3 10 10 m 1 s 1 k 1 8 10 5 m 1 s 1 19 o h c l c l o h k 1 8 10 10 m 1 s 1 20 o h c l

substantially with an increasing ph fig 4c suggesting that cl 2 played a greater role in the degradation of ipm under alkaline conditions this may be due to the fact that the second order rate constants of oh and cl 2 are 2 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those of cl and clo eqs 18 21 3 4 effect of cl then the effect of cl on the degradation of ipm by the uv365 naclo system was evaluated figure s10 as shown in fig 5 a when cl concentration increased in the range of 0 10 mm the removal rate of ipm changed slightly approximately 4 within 15 min fig 5b suggests that cl ss decreased significantly whereas oh ss and clo ss only decreased slightly for instance when the concentration of cl increased from 0 mm to 10 mm the ho ss clo ss and cl ss decreased from 1 69 10 13 m 9 50 10 12 m and 7 86 10 15 m to 1 41 10 13 m 8 91 10 12 m and 9 97 10 16 m respectively this may be due to the following i after adding cl ho can react with cl as follows kläning and wolff 1985 23 ho c l clo h k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 k 6 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 24 clo h h cl h 2 o k 2 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 k 2 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 according to the ph equilibrium of these two equations the apparent second order rate constant k h o c l of the reaction of ho with cl can be obtained as a function of ph as follows jayson et al 1973 25 k h o c l k 23 k 24 h k 24 k 23 under the conditions of this study ph 7 k h o c l was calculated was 1 8 105m 1s 1 using eq 25 which was much less than k h o i p m 3 42 109 m 1 s 1 ii the majority cl was transformed into cl 2 after the addition of cl eq 5 interestingly fig 5c shows that the percentage contribution of cl cl 2 was basically not affected by a significant reduction in cl ss based on this result it can be inferred again that the cl had a weak degradation effect on ipm in the uv365 naclo system and cl 2 should have a certain reactivity with ipm 3 5 effect of nom the effect of nom on the degradation of the uv365 naclo system for ipm was examined figure s11 as shown in fig 6 a the removal rate of ipm decreased from 77 78 to 66 36 as the concentration of nom increased from 0 to 5 mgc l while the k obs also decreased from 0 1013 min 1 to 0 0745 min 1 the inhibitory effect of nom on ipm degradation was mainly due to the following reasons i the reaction between nom and naclo leads to a useless consumption of oxidants i e 0 7 5 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2004 ii the internal filtering effect of nom reduced the dose of photons absorbed by hocl clo in this study the absorption coefficient of nom at 365 nm was calculated to be 26 52 l g cm 1 according to the standard curve of nom solution at 365 nm wavelength figure s12 and the beer lambert law iii nom scavenges various reactive species in the system this was also proven by the result presented in fig 6b which shows that the steady state concentrations of the three radicals decreased to varying degrees notably fig 6c shows that the percentage contribution of clo to k obs was significantly decreased in the presence of nom this was due to the strong scavenging effect of nom on the clo and its precursor radicals i e oh and cl eqs 6 7 the second order rate constants of the reaction of nom with oh cl and clo are all at the level of 104 mgc l fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 lee et al 2007 however although cl ss decreased greatly from 7 86 10 15m to 3 32 10 17m fig 6c the percentage contribution of cl cl 2 increased to the greatest extent from 24 24 to 60 41 in the presence of nom this result suggests that cl 2 played the most important role in ipm degradation in the presence of nom this may be due to the fact that the reactivity of nom with cl 2 was less than that with other active radicals 3 6 effect of hco3 co3 2 the degradation of ipm by the uv365 naclo system was investigated under different hco3 co3 2 concentration conditions unfortunately owing to the absence of some key rate constants co3 ss in the system cannot be obtained by calculation in this study only the effect of hco3 co3 2 on ipm degradation kinetics was investigated as shown in fig 7 the addition of hco3 co3 2 had no significant effect on ipm degradation with an increase in the concentration of hco3 co3 2 from 0 mm to 10 mm the removal rate of ipm only decreased from 77 78 to 74 52 kobs decreased from 0 1013 min 1 to 0 0924 min 1 and the maximum inhibition effect was only 4 0 these results could be attributed to the following reasons i studies have shown that hco3 co3 2 can capture active components and it generates co3 eqs 26 29 grebel et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 according to the experimental results of 3 1 clo contributed the most to the degradation of ipm and coincidentally the reaction rate constants of hco3 co3 2 and clo is minimal k 6 0 102m 1s 1 grebel et al 2010 which indicates that the addition of hco3 co3 2 did not significantly inhibit the action of the active ingredients significantly ii co3 reacts with ipm with a high activity eq 30 zhao et al 2019 previous studies have shown that in a variety of uv based advanced oxidation systems the addition of hco3 co3 2 mediates co3 ss to gradually increase luo et al 2015 furthermore co3 reacts efficiently with compounds containing electron rich sites such as nitrogen or sulphur atoms mazellier et al 2003 obviously nitrogen containing groups such as amino groups can be found in ipm 26 hco 3 co 3 2 ho co 3 h 2 o k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 27 hco

of ipm in actual water deionised water tap water surface water and groundwater were used to further study the degradation efficiency of the uv365 naclo system in actual water compared with that in deionised water removal rate 77 78 the degradation of ipm in the other three water samples was inhibited the removal rates of ipm in groundwater tap water and surface water were 56 58 51 39 and 37 84 respectively where k obs were 0 0556min 1 0 0485min 1 and 0 0313min 1 respectively fig 8 although the degradation of ipm under different actual water conditions was not as good as that in deionised water ipm was still effectively removed in actual water which indicates that the uv365 naclo system has good application potential this indicates that the existence of toc in actual water had the greatest impact on the degradation of ipm therefore when using the uv365 naclo process attention should be paid to strengthening the removal of organic matter by the pretreatment unit before processing 3 8 oxidation products and potential degradation process 3 8 1 organic products the oxidation products of ipm were determined by hplc ms system based on the nuclear mass ratio m z in the obtained mass spectrum fig s13 the potential product types and structures were speculated and 15 possible organic products were obtained table s4 fig 9 shows a potential degradation pathway of ipm in the uv365 naclo system first ipm undergoes a rearrangement reaction i e the transformation of ipm 1 to ipm 2 that is the nh group on the side chain exchanges with an oxygen atom o wendel et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 subsequently ipm 1 and ipm 2 are gradually degraded mainly through h abstraction reactions deiodination substitution reactions amide hydrolysis and amine oxidation the details are as follows i a m z 647 was produced by deiodination and the h abstraction reaction of the ipm molecular side chain in the literature this has been confirmed to occur primarily due to the oxidation of ho rcs jeong et al 2010 kong et al 2018 ii in addition to the deiodination reaction the substitution of iodine with oh b m z 667 and iodine with by cl c m z 685 and d m z 468 removed iodine moreover oh replaced not only iodine but also many other functional groups e m z 644 was produced because oh replaced the nitrogen containing group nh2 at the end of the side chain wendel et al 2014 also confirmed that this group is easy to substitute subsequently e m z 644 underwent a substitution reaction to form f m z 502 and g m z 228 similarly h m z 362 and i m z 662 were produced because of the head hydroxylation reaction of ipm and the entire side chain was replaced by oh iii amide hydrolysis on the two side chains the cn bond was broken of ipm 1 formed g m z 703 and k m z 705 respectively and k m z 705 underwent further hydrolysis and other reactions to form l m z 269 iv according to the reported amine oxidation pathways hu et al 2017 it can be concluded that the amino group nh2 of the k m z 705 side chain was oxidised to no2 and m m z 351 was ultimately formed likewise amine oxidation occurred during the formation of n m z 369 i m z 662 and o m z 240 figure s14 shows the change in toc concentration in the solution toc gradually decreased as the reaction progressed this indicates that these intermediates continued to be oxidised and decomposed by ho rcs with some being decomposed into small molecular inorganic substances such as h2o and co2 3 8 2 inorganic products i is generated after the deiodination reaction from ipm it can be oxidised to hoi by hclo clo and ozone wherein hoi will is further oxidised to non toxic io3 bichsel and von gunten 1999 lengyel et al 1993 li et al 2017 only approximately 14 13 iodine of ipm was converted into inorganic products after 10 min of reaction fig 10 notably hoi was generated rapidly the conversion rate was as high as 83 27 at 10 min this was mainly due to the high oxidation rate of i by hclo and ozone 108 m 1s 1 bichsel and von gunten 1999 the concentration of io3 in the system gradually increased owing to further oxidation of hoi and the conversion rate was 16 42 at 10 min it is worth noting that the rapid accumulation of hoi poses certain environmental risks that is hoi easily reacts with nom in natural water and produces toxic iodinated products their genotoxicity and cytotoxicity are several to hundreds of times higher than those of chlorinated and brominated products guan et al 2017 hladik et al 2016 li et al 2017 richardson et al 2007 wendel et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2004 3 9 acute toxicology of ipm degradation in this study the intensity of acute toxicity of the sample to bacteria was expressed by the luminescence inhibition rate and the changes in the acute toxicity of the ipm solution in the system were calculated using eq 31 31 f i 1 l l 0 100 where l is the luminescence intensity of the bacteria in contact with the experimental solution l0 is the luminescence intensity of the bacteria in contact with the blank water sample and f i is the luminescence inhibition rate the intensity of the acute toxicity for bacteria is expressed as f i as can be seen in fig 11 during the reaction process of 15 min and 30 min the changes in f i of vibrio fischeri and photobacterium phosphoreum could be ignored the luminescence inhibition rate was 3 this result suggests that both ipm and its oxidation products in the uv365 naclo system exerted no acute toxicity basically to the two bacteria however uv naclo lead to a significant increase in the formation potentials of toxic halogenated organics e g trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetonitrile compared with uv h2o2 or chlorination alone systems guan et al 2017 hansson et al 1987 bull et al 1995 closei et al 2020 fortunately two approaches can be used to effectively reduce the by product generation potential i tuning the operation parameters e g preferred uv lamp model and reduced the chlorine dosing guo et al 2016 2022 and ii coupling the uv365 naclo process with other pre post treatment technologies e g gac adsorption and ro pre treatment guo et al 2022 closei et al 2020 4 conclusions in this paper the degradation of ipm in uv365 naclo system was investigated and changing trends of the percentage contributions of these reactive species to ipm removal under various conditions were systematically evaluated the oxidation products and mechanisms of the removal of ipm in this system were put forward and the acute toxicity for bacteria was detected the conclusions are as follows i in the control experiment clo and ho played the most important roles in k obs but the percentage contribution of ozone to the ipm removal could be neglected ii the percentage contribution of clo to k obs was greatly increased as the increase of naclo concentration iii the percentage contributions of ho and clo decreased significantly with the increase of solution ph and cl 2 played a greater role in the degradation of ipm at ph 9 iv cl 2 or co3 should have certain reactivity with ipm v compared to cl 2 the percentage contributions of clo and cl to k obs were more likely to be inhibited by nom vi ipm was gradually degraded mainly through h extraction reactions deiodination substitution reactions amide hydrolysis and amine oxidation in uv365 naclo system whereas the great potential of hoi formation

15621,the degradation of iopamidol ipm was investigated using a uv365 naclo system the reactive species ho clo ozone cl and cl 2 in the system were identified and the changing trends of the percentage contributions of these reactive species to ipm removal under various conditions were systematically evaluated the results showed that clo and ho played the most significant roles in the apparent pseudo first order rate constants of ipm degradation k obs min 1 in the control experiment and their percentage contributions to k obs were 41 31 and 34 45 respectively in addition cl and cl 2 together contributed 22 to the k obs furthermore the contribution of ozone to the ipm removal could be neglected the concentrations of these species increased significantly when the concentration of naclo was increased from 50 µm to 200 µm while the percentage contribution of clo to k obs was greatly increased the concentrations and percentage contributions of ho and clo decreased significantly as the solution ph increased from 5 to 9 with cl 2 playing a greater role in the degradation of ipm under alkaline conditions while cl or hco3 co3 2 significantly promoted the generation of cl 2 or co3 neither had an obvious effect on k obs suggesting that cl 2 and co3 should have a certain reactivity with ipm compared with that of cl 2 the percentage contribution of clo and cl to k obs was more likely to be inhibited by nom in addition the organic and inorganic oxidation products of ipm were detected the oxidation mechanisms of ipm degradation in the uv365 naclo system such as the h extraction reaction deiodination substitution reaction amide hydrolysis and amine oxidation were proposed according to the obtained 15 organic products no effect on acute toxicity towards vibrio fischeri and photobacterium phosphoreum was detected during the oxidation of ipm by the uv365 naclo system furthermore the engineering feasibility of the oxidation system was demonstrated by the effective degradation of ipm in actual water however hoi rapidly accumulated during the removal of ipm in the uv365 naclo system which poses certain environmental risks and will needs to be investigated graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultraviolet naclo iopamidol radical kinetic toxicity data availability i have shared the link to my data at the attrch file step 1

pérez et al 2006 ipm as a second generation non ionic hypotonic contrast agent has been most widely used because of its good contrast and stable injection karim et al 2010 ipm is the most frequently detected substance in wastewater and groundwater with concentrations ranging from nanograms to micrograms per litre kormos et al 2010 schulz et al 2008 ternes and hirsch 2000 for instance the concentrations of ipm detected in the effluent of a german urban sewage treatment plant corresponding receiving water rivers and streams and groundwater were 15 μg l 0 49 μg l and 2 4 μg l respectively ternes and hirsch 2000 even in some urban water sources the concentration of ipm is 2700 ng l duirk et al 2011 although ipm is not toxic to the human body iodide i is released during the

studies have only calculated the effects of various radicals in control experiments with contrasting results for instance li et al 2020 suggested that the percentage contribution of ho to acetaminophen degradation in the uv365 naclo system was only 3 09 however tan et al 2020 found that rcs and ho contributed to 47 9 and 45 7 of the removal of phenacetin in the same system respectively where ozone could be generated and played a role in the removal of phenacetin approximately 2 7 thus the percentage contributions of different active components in this system remains a topic of controversy and requires further research furthermore there have been no studies on the varying trends of the concentration and percentage contributions of reactive species under different water matrices and experimental conditions in the uv365 naclo system the objective of this study was i to investigate the degradation kinetics of ipm under various conditions in the uv365 naclo system ii to assess the steady state concentrations and percentage contributions of reactive species under various conditions i e water matrix and experimental conditions iii to propose a possible degradation mechanism of ipm removal in the uv365 naclo system and iv to evaluate the acute toxicity risk of secondary oxidation products in the system by identifying of organic and inorganic products and acute toxicological tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the specific parameters are shown in text s1 the information on experimental solvent and actual water is also presented here all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and used without further purification 2 2 experimental procedures the uv365 naclo system comprised the experimental device shown in text s2 and figure s1 the uv irradiation wavelength and irradiation intensity were 365 nm and 49 mw cm2 respectively the experiments were conducted in a l00 ml quartz dish reactor the reaction solution contained 5 μm ipm and was stirred continuously using a magnetic stirrer the ph value of the solutions was buffered to ph 5 or 7 by using 5 mm phosphate buffer and to ph 9 using sodium tetraborate buffer adjusted using hclo4 and naoh the presence of hclo4 had no effect on the removal on ipm removal figure s2 according to different experimental designs a concentration of cl hco 3 and natrual organic matter nom was added followed by the addition of 200 μm naclo to determine the effect of oxidants concentration naclo at different concentrations 50 100 200 300 and 400 μm was introduced into the reaction system na2s2o3 solution was added as the terminator in a 2 ml sample bottle in advance the uv lamp was turned on to start the reaction and 1 ml of the sample solution was placed into the sample bottle at the predetermined time point reactive species detection experiments were carried out under anoxic conditions to control for the influence of dissolved oxygen to ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration was less than 0 1 mg l 1 nitrogen was supplemented from 20 min before the reaction to the end of the reaction the ph of the solution was measured before and after each experiment and the change was less than 0 2 for acute toxicity assessment solutions collected at certain intervals during the degradation of ipm were evaluated as the experimental samples using the uv365 naclo system under standard group conditions this was based on the standard test method for assessing the toxicity of drinking water using a water quality determination of the acute toxicity luminescent bacteria test gb t15441 1995 china and water quality determination of the inhibitory effect of water samples on the light emission of vibrio fischeri luminescent bacteria test iso11348 3 2007 photobacterium phosphoreum and vibrio fischeri were used to evaluate the changes in acute toxicity during the degradation of ipm in addition a blank sample was used to compare the degree of inhibition of the experimental sample collected during the degradation process briefly the lyophilised powder of vibrio fischeri and photobacterium phosphoreum was collected and stored at 20 upon further use the samples were thawed at room temperature followed by the addition of a resuscitation diluent then the prepared sample was mixed with an osmotic pressure regulating solution in a 1 5 ml ep tube at a ratio of 9 1 followed by the addition of a certain amount of bacteria the mixture was allowed to stand for 15 min and 30 min respectively before placing in a luminous detector promega glomax 20 20 for luminescence value detection 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of organic compounds were determined using waters 2695 hplc which was equipped with a waters 2996 uv detector and waters symmetry c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm mobile phase a comprised methanol while mobile phase b comprised 0 1 acetic acid prepared from ultrapure water the column temperature was 30 c the injection volume was 100 μl and the flow rate was 1 0 ml min the methods used for the detection of the organic matter are listed in table s2 the oxidation products of ipm were determined using an agilent 1290 uplc and an agilent q tof 6500 ms system i and io3 were detected using dionex ics 1600 ion chromatography hoi was indirectly determined by the iodophenol concentration the instrumental parameters and operational methods are described in text s3 the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and nom were determined using a toc analyser toc l shimadzu the ph of the solution was measured using a ph metre phs 3c shanghai leici 2 4 kinetics research methods the degradation of ipm was expressed in the langmuir hinshelwood kinetics mode using eq 8 8 k o b s d l n c 0 c t d t where the k obs min 1 is the apparent pseudo first order rate constant of ipm degradation and c0 and ct are the initial and remaining concentrations of ipm respectively 2 5 calculation of the percentage contribution of reactive species according to the literature uv irradiation ho cl cl2 clo and ozone contribute to the removal of ipm which can be expressed as follows eq 9 9 k o b s k u v d i r e c t k h o k c l k c l 2 k c l o k o z o n e where k u v d i r e c t k h o k c l k c l 2 k c l o and k o z o n e are the apparent pseudo first order rate constants for ipm degradation by direct uv irradiation ho cl cl2 clo and ozone respectively the percentage contributions of uv irradiation ruv and ozone rozone can be calculated using eqs 10 11 10 r u v k u v d i r e c t k o b s 11 r o z o n e k o b s k n i t r o g e n p u r g i n g k o b s where k n i t r o g e n p u r g i n g is the apparent pseudo first order rate constant of ipm degradation under anaerobic conditions the percentage contributions of ho rho and clo rclo can be calculated using eqs 12 13 12 r h o k h o k o b s k h o i p m ho s s k o b s 13 r clo k clo k obs k c l o i p m clo ss k obs where k h o i p m and k clo ipm are the second order rate constants of ipm reacting with ho and clo respectively table s3 k clo ipm was obtained using competitive dynamics and the detailed calculation method can be found in text s4 and figure s3 ho ss and clo ss are steady state concentrations of ho and clo respectively in this study nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were used as probe organics to calculate ho ss and clo ss hua et al 2019 to avoid the influence of ozone on the probe organics all experiments were purged with nitrogen from 20 min before the reaction to the end of the reaction nb reacts with ho only ba reacts with ho and cl and dmob reacts with ho cl and clo alfassi et al 1988 fang et al 2014 hua et al 2019 mvula et al 2009 figure s4 shows that the degradation of nb and ba by uv365 was negligible and only naclo in the dark could not degrade these three probes accordingly ho ss cl ss and clo ss can be calculated using eqs 14 16 14 ho ss k nb k ho nb 15 cl ss k ba k ho ba ho ss k cl ba 16 clo ss k dmob k ho dmob ho ss k cl dmob cl ss k uv dmob k clo dmob where k nb k ba and k dmob are the pseudo first order rate constants for the degradation of nb ba and dmob in the presence of ipm 5 µm by uv365 naclo system respectively k uv dmob is the pseudo first order rate constant for the degradation of dmob by uv365 direct irradiation k ho nb k ho ba and k ho dmob are the second order rate constants of ho react with nb ba and dmob respectively k cl ba and k cl dmob are the second order rate constants of cl reaction with ba and dmob respectively k clo dmob is the second order rate constants of clo reaction with dmob data are shown in table s3 unfortunately the second order rate constants of cl with ipm are unknown and the percentage contribution of cl to k obs and the steady state concentration of cl2 cannot be obtained thus the percentage contributions of cl and cl2 to k obs could not be obtained in this study although they were calculated together i e r cl cl2 using eq 17 17 r c l c l 2 1 r h o r c l o r u v r o z o n e 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of ipm and the percentage contribution of reactive species in the uv365 naclo system the degradation of ipm was evaluated using naclo uv365 and uv365 naclo respectively as shown in fig 1 the removal of ipm by naclo or uv365 alone was negligible within 60 min the degradation of ipm was significantly promoted during the uv365 naclo process approximately 90 91 of ipm could be eliminated in only 30 min by uv365 naclo and the degradation of ipm in this process followed pseudo first order kinetics k obs 0 083min 1 similar to other advanced oxidation processes e g uv h2o2 uv pds visible light ag3po4 nc visible light ag3po4 w2n3 nv and fe n c peroxymonosulfate a variety of radicals play a major role in the degradation of micropollutants zhang et al 2022 lin et al 2020 2022 wu et al 2020 in the uv365 naclo system ho rcs cl clo and cl 2 and ozone were identified as the main reactive species the percentage contributions of these reactive species to the control experiment were investigated figure s5 s6 the results showed that i the k obs under anaerobic conditions was essentially the same as that under aerobic conditions i e 0 0169 s 1 vs 0 0168 s 1 suggesting that the contribution of ozone to the degradation of ipm could be ignored approximately 0 59 this result could be attributed to the fact that the second order rate constant of the reaction of ozone with ipm is low i e k 18 0 1 4 m 1s 1 ning and graham 2008 however if the reaction activity between ozone and target pollutants is considerable it should pay attention to the role of ozone in uv365 naclo system ii although the reaction activity between ho and ipm had a magnitude that was 47 fold that of clo i e 3 42 109 m 1s 1 vs 7 3 107m 1s 1 table s3 the steady state concentration of clo clo ss was nearly 2 orders that of ho ho ss i e 0 951 10 11m vs 1 692 10 13m therefore the percentage contribution of clo to ipm degradation was greater than that of ho i e 41 31 vs 34 45 fig 2 a iii the sum of the percentage contributions of cl and cl 2 to the removal of ipm was only approximately 22 96 which may be due to the low steady state concentration of free radicals or due to their reactivity with ipm being lower than that of ho and clo as shown in fig 2b the steady state concentration of cl cl ss was only 7 863 10 15 m in addition the 2 hydroxypropanamide n 1 3 dihydroxypropan 2 yl acetamide and iodo groups on the benzene ring of ipm are electron poor groups suggesting the inefficiency of electron transfer attack on ipm 3 2 effect of oxidant concentration the degradation of ipm was tested by controlling the oxidant concentration in the uv365 naclo system figure s6 s7 as shown in fig 3 a when the concentration of naclo increased from 50 μm to 400 μm the degradation of ipm increased from 57 46 to 83 18 and k obs increased from 0 0580 min 1 to 0 1200 min 1 as shown in fig 3b this suggestst that ho ss clo ss and cl ss were promoted with an increase in naclo concentration taking clo as an example compared with when 50 μm naclo was used clo ss increased 3 87 times when the concentration of naclo was 200 μm however it is worth noting that when the naclo concentration was higher than 200 μm the increase in k obs showed a downward trend according to the calculation k obs increased by only 2 fold while naclo increased 8 fold i e 0 0580 min 1 at 50 μm naclo vs 0 1200 min 1 at 400 μm naclo furthermore as shown in fig 3c ho and cl cl 2 played a major role in ipm degradation at low oxidiser concentrations whereas clo played a more important role when increasing the oxidiser concentration for instance the percentage contribution of clo increased from 16 87 to 41 37 when the concentration of naclo increased from 50 μm to 200 μm whereas the percentage contributions of ho and cl to ipm degradation were significantly decreased these results were mainly attributed to the excess hclo clo that captured ho and cl eqs 6 7 grebel et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 compared with clo ss the cl ss 10 15 10 16 m was approximately 3 4 orders of magnitude lower although the degradation of ipm was also promoted by the increase in cl ss the percentage contribution of cl decreased due to the much larger increase in the contribution of clo 3 3 effect of ph next the effect of ph value on ipm degradation in the uv365 naclo system was investigated figure s8 s9 as shown in fig 4 a the degradation of ipm at ph 5 7 and 9 was 91 09 77 78 and 66 98 respectively while the k obs values were 0 1622 min 1 0 1019 min 1 and 0 0747 min 1 respectively these results indicate that the uv365 naclo system was conducive to the degradation of ipm at low ph but inhibited it at a high ph since the pka of ipm is 10 7 gao et al 2019 the form of ipm does not change significantly in the experimental contents of this section therefore the change in ph mainly affects the change in the reactive species in the system as shown in fig 4b and c the concentrations and percentage contributions of ho and clo decreased significantly with the increasing solution ph for instance when the ph increased from ph 5 to 9 ho ss clo ss and cl ss decreased from 5 18 10 13 m 8 13 10 12 m and 2 75 10 14 m to 1 13 10 13 m 1 78 10 12 m and 2 42 10 16 m respectively this could be attributed to the following i various radicals are more likely to be captured under alkaline conditions buxton et al 1988 fang et al 2014 kong et al 2016 leading to the production of less reactive radicals e g cloh and o eqs 18 21 ii the nernst equation eq 22 indicates that the redox potential e 0 of ho decreases with increasing ph nikravesh et al 2020 the redox potential of ho was calculated to be 2 51 v and 2 27 v at ph 5 and 9 respectively which can lead to a decrease in the oxidative capacity of ho under alkaline conditions thus affecting the degradation of ipm 18 o h h o o h 2 o k 1 3 10 10 m 1 s 1 k 1 8 10 5 m 1 s 1 19 o h c l c l o h k 1 8 10 10 m 1 s 1 20 o h c l 2 c l o h c l k 4 5 10 7 m 1 s 1 21 o h 2 c l o o c l h c l o 2 k 2 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 22 e 0 e h o h 2 o 0 0 059 p h e h o h 2 o 0 2 80 v notably the percentage contribution of cl cl 2 increased substantially with an increasing ph fig 4c suggesting that cl 2 played a greater role in the degradation of ipm under alkaline conditions this may be due to the fact that the second order rate constants of oh and cl 2 are 2 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those of cl and clo eqs 18 21 3 4 effect of cl then the effect of cl on the degradation of ipm by the uv365 naclo system was evaluated figure s10 as shown in fig 5 a when cl concentration increased in the range of 0 10 mm the removal rate of ipm changed slightly approximately 4 within 15 min fig 5b suggests that cl ss decreased significantly whereas oh ss and clo ss only decreased slightly for instance when the concentration of cl increased from 0 mm to 10 mm the ho ss clo ss and cl ss decreased from 1 69 10 13 m 9 50 10 12 m and 7 86 10 15 m to 1 41 10 13 m 8 91 10 12 m and 9 97 10 16 m respectively this may be due to the following i after adding cl ho can react with cl as follows kläning and wolff 1985 23 ho c l clo h k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 k 6 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 24 clo h h cl h 2 o k 2 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 k 2 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 according to the ph equilibrium of these two equations the apparent second order rate constant k h o c l of the reaction of ho with cl can be obtained as a function of ph as follows jayson et al 1973 25 k h o c l k 23 k 24 h k 24 k 23 under the conditions of this study ph 7 k h o c l was calculated was 1 8 105m 1s 1 using eq 25 which was much less than k h o i p m 3 42 109 m 1 s 1 ii the majority cl was transformed into cl 2 after the addition of cl eq 5 interestingly fig 5c shows that the percentage contribution of cl cl 2 was basically not affected by a significant reduction in cl ss based on this result it can be inferred again that the cl had a weak degradation effect on ipm in the uv365 naclo system and cl 2 should have a certain reactivity with ipm 3 5 effect of nom the effect of nom on the degradation of the uv365 naclo system for ipm was examined figure s11 as shown in fig 6 a the removal rate of ipm decreased from 77 78 to 66 36 as the concentration of nom increased from 0 to 5 mgc l while the k obs also decreased from 0 1013 min 1 to 0 0745 min 1 the inhibitory effect of nom on ipm degradation was mainly due to the following reasons i the reaction between nom and naclo leads to a useless consumption of oxidants i e 0 7 5 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2004 ii the internal filtering effect of nom reduced the dose of photons absorbed by hocl clo in this study the absorption coefficient of nom at 365 nm was calculated to be 26 52 l g cm 1 according to the standard curve of nom solution at 365 nm wavelength figure s12 and the beer lambert law iii nom scavenges various reactive species in the system this was also proven by the result presented in fig 6b which shows that the steady state concentrations of the three radicals decreased to varying degrees notably fig 6c shows that the percentage contribution of clo to k obs was significantly decreased in the presence of nom this was due to the strong scavenging effect of nom on the clo and its precursor radicals i e oh and cl eqs 6 7 the second order rate constants of the reaction of nom with oh cl and clo are all at the level of 104 mgc l fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 lee et al 2007 however although cl ss decreased greatly from 7 86 10 15m to 3 32 10 17m fig 6c the percentage contribution of cl cl 2 increased to the greatest extent from 24 24 to 60 41 in the presence of nom this result suggests that cl 2 played the most important role in ipm degradation in the presence of nom this may be due to the fact that the reactivity of nom with cl 2 was less than that with other active radicals 3 6 effect of hco3 co3 2 the degradation of ipm by the uv365 naclo system was investigated under different hco3 co3 2 concentration conditions unfortunately owing to the absence of some key rate constants co3 ss in the system cannot be obtained by calculation in this study only the effect of hco3 co3 2 on ipm degradation kinetics was investigated as shown in fig 7 the addition of hco3 co3 2 had no significant effect on ipm degradation with an increase in the concentration of hco3 co3 2 from 0 mm to 10 mm the removal rate of ipm only decreased from 77 78 to 74 52 kobs decreased from 0 1013 min 1 to 0 0924 min 1 and the maximum inhibition effect was only 4 0 these results could be attributed to the following reasons i studies have shown that hco3 co3 2 can capture active components and it generates co3 eqs 26 29 grebel et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 according to the experimental results of 3 1 clo contributed the most to the degradation of ipm and coincidentally the reaction rate constants of hco3 co3 2 and clo is minimal k 6 0 102m 1s 1 grebel et al 2010 which indicates that the addition of hco3 co3 2 did not significantly inhibit the action of the active ingredients significantly ii co3 reacts with ipm with a high activity eq 30 zhao et al 2019 previous studies have shown that in a variety of uv based advanced oxidation systems the addition of hco3 co3 2 mediates co3 ss to gradually increase luo et al 2015 furthermore co3 reacts efficiently with compounds containing electron rich sites such as nitrogen or sulphur atoms mazellier et al 2003 obviously nitrogen containing groups such as amino groups can be found in ipm 26 hco 3 co 3 2 ho co 3 h 2 o k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 27 hco

of ipm in actual water deionised water tap water surface water and groundwater were used to further study the degradation efficiency of the uv365 naclo system in actual water compared with that in deionised water removal rate 77 78 the degradation of ipm in the other three water samples was inhibited the removal rates of ipm in groundwater tap water and surface water were 56 58 51 39 and 37 84 respectively where k obs were 0 0556min 1 0 0485min 1 and 0 0313min 1 respectively fig 8 although the degradation of ipm under different actual water conditions was not as good as that in deionised water ipm was still effectively removed in actual water which indicates that the uv365 naclo system has good application potential this indicates that the existence of toc in actual water had the greatest impact on the degradation of ipm therefore when using the uv365 naclo process attention should be paid to strengthening the removal of organic matter by the pretreatment unit before processing 3 8 oxidation products and potential degradation process 3 8 1 organic products the oxidation products of ipm were determined by hplc ms system based on the nuclear mass ratio m z in the obtained mass spectrum fig s13 the potential product types and structures were speculated and 15 possible organic products were obtained table s4 fig 9 shows a potential degradation pathway of ipm in the uv365 naclo system first ipm undergoes a rearrangement reaction i e the transformation of ipm 1 to ipm 2 that is the nh group on the side chain exchanges with an oxygen atom o wendel et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 subsequently ipm 1 and ipm 2 are gradually degraded mainly through h abstraction reactions deiodination substitution reactions amide hydrolysis and amine oxidation the details are as follows i a m z 647 was produced by deiodination and the h abstraction reaction of the ipm molecular side chain in the literature this has been confirmed to occur primarily due to the oxidation of ho rcs jeong et al 2010 kong et al 2018 ii in addition to the deiodination reaction the substitution of iodine with oh b m z 667 and iodine with by cl c m z 685 and d m z 468 removed iodine moreover oh replaced not only iodine but also many other functional groups e m z 644 was produced because oh replaced the nitrogen containing group nh2 at the end of the side chain wendel et al 2014 also confirmed that this group is easy to substitute subsequently e m z 644 underwent a substitution reaction to form f m z 502 and g m z 228 similarly h m z 362 and i m z 662 were produced because of the head hydroxylation reaction of ipm and the entire side chain was replaced by oh iii amide hydrolysis on the two side chains the cn bond was broken of ipm 1 formed g m z 703 and k m z 705 respectively and k m z 705 underwent further hydrolysis and other reactions to form l m z 269 iv according to the reported amine oxidation pathways hu et al 2017 it can be concluded that the amino group nh2 of the k m z 705 side chain was oxidised to no2 and m m z 351 was ultimately formed likewise amine oxidation occurred during the formation of n m z 369 i m z 662 and o m z 240 figure s14 shows the change in toc concentration in the solution toc gradually decreased as the reaction progressed this indicates that these intermediates continued to be oxidised and decomposed by ho rcs with some being decomposed into small molecular inorganic substances such as h2o and co2 3 8 2 inorganic products i is generated after the deiodination reaction from ipm it can be oxidised to hoi by hclo clo and ozone wherein hoi will is further oxidised to non toxic io3 bichsel and von gunten 1999 lengyel et al 1993 li et al 2017 only approximately 14 13 iodine of ipm was converted into inorganic products after 10 min of reaction fig 10 notably hoi was generated rapidly the conversion rate was as high as 83 27 at 10 min this was mainly due to the high oxidation rate of i by hclo and ozone 108 m 1s 1 bichsel and von gunten 1999 the concentration of io3 in the system gradually increased owing to further oxidation of hoi and the conversion rate was 16 42 at 10 min it is worth noting that the rapid accumulation of hoi poses certain environmental risks that is hoi easily reacts with nom in natural water and produces toxic iodinated products their genotoxicity and cytotoxicity are several to hundreds of times higher than those of chlorinated and brominated products guan et al 2017 hladik et al 2016 li et al 2017 richardson et al 2007 wendel et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2004 3 9 acute toxicology of ipm degradation in this study the intensity of acute toxicity of the sample to bacteria was expressed by the luminescence inhibition rate and the changes in the acute toxicity of the ipm solution in the system were calculated using eq 31 31 f i 1 l l 0 100 where l is the luminescence intensity of the bacteria in contact with the experimental solution l0 is the luminescence intensity of the bacteria in contact with the blank water sample and f i is the luminescence inhibition rate the intensity of the acute toxicity for bacteria is expressed as f i as can be seen in fig 11 during the reaction process of 15 min and 30 min the changes in f i of vibrio fischeri and photobacterium phosphoreum could be ignored the luminescence inhibition rate was 3 this result suggests that both ipm and its oxidation products in the uv365 naclo system exerted no acute toxicity basically to the two bacteria however uv naclo lead to a significant increase in the formation potentials of toxic halogenated organics e g trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetonitrile compared with uv h2o2 or chlorination alone systems guan et al 2017 hansson et al 1987 bull et al 1995 closei et al 2020 fortunately two approaches can be used to effectively reduce the by product generation potential i tuning the operation parameters e g preferred uv lamp model and reduced the chlorine dosing guo et al 2016 2022 and ii coupling the uv365 naclo process with other pre post treatment technologies e g gac adsorption and ro pre treatment guo et al 2022 closei et al 2020 4 conclusions in this paper the degradation of ipm in uv365 naclo system was investigated and changing trends of the percentage contributions of these reactive species to ipm removal under various conditions were systematically evaluated the oxidation products and mechanisms of the removal of ipm in this system were put forward and the acute toxicity for bacteria was detected the conclusions are as follows i in the control experiment clo and ho played the most important roles in k obs but the percentage contribution of ozone to the ipm removal could be neglected ii the percentage contribution of clo to k obs was greatly increased as the increase of naclo concentration iii the percentage contributions of ho and clo decreased significantly with the increase of solution ph and cl 2 played a greater role in the degradation of ipm at ph 9 iv cl 2 or co3 should have certain reactivity with ipm v compared to cl 2 the percentage contributions of clo and cl to k obs were more likely to be inhibited by nom vi ipm was gradually degraded mainly through h extraction reactions deiodination substitution reactions amide hydrolysis and amine oxidation in uv365 naclo system whereas the great potential of hoi formation

15622,cyanobacterial harmful blooms have been increasing worldwide due in part to excessive phosphorus p losses from agriculture dominated watersheds unfortunately cyanobacteria bloom management is often complicated by uncertainty associated with river p cycling river p cycling mediates p exports during low flow but has been assumed to be unimportant during high flows thus we examined interactions between dissolved reactive phosphorus drp and suspended sediment p during high flows in the maumee river network focusing on march june maumee river drp exports which fuel recurring cyanobacteria blooms in lake erie we estimate that during 2003 2019 march to june high flow events p sorption reduced drp exports by an average of 13 27 depending upon the colloidal p drp ratio decreasing the bioavailability of p exports and potentially constraining cyanobacteria blooms by 13 40 phosphorus sorption was likely lower during 2003 2019 than 1975 2002 due to reductions in suspended sediment loads associated with soil erosion minimizing agricultural practices this unintended outcome of erosion management has likely decreased p sorption increased drp exports to lake erie and subsequent cyanobacteria blooms in other watersheds drp sediment p interactions during high flow could have a positive or negative effect on drp exports therefore p management should consider riverine p cycles particularly during high flow events to avoid undermining expensive p mitigation efforts graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal blooms high flow events

repository https github com hood211 highflowsorption 1 introduction cyanobacteria harmful blooms cyanohabs which have been increasing worldwide negatively affect freshwater ecosystems human livelihoods and human health kouakou and poder 2019 paerl et al 2016 one primary cause of cyanohabs are phosphorus p losses from agricultural production particularly the loss of dissolved reactive p drp which is more bioavailable to cyanobacteria than sediment bound p baker et al 2014a thus it is a global environmental priority to understand and reduce watershed p exports glibert and burford 2017 however p management is complicated by uncertainty associated with p retention and transformation during downstream transport through river networks jarvie et al 2013 sharpley et al 2009 in streams and rivers biogeochemical processes alter the magnitude and bioavailability e g drp versus sediment p of p transported downstream exerting controls on p exports to recipient water bodies during low flow withers and jarvie 2008 yet most p and sediment export occurs during high flows correll et al 1999 gentry et al 2007 sharpley et al 2008 and we know little about p cycling during high flows edwards and withers 2008 withers and jarvie 2008 this knowledge gap limits our ability to successfully manage p pollution and cyanohabs one potentially important aspect of river p cycling during high flows is p sorption desorption by suspended sediment which can increase or decrease drp concentrations and therefore the bioavailability of p exports to cyanohabs phosphorus sorption desorption during high flows which is rarely quantified is perceived to be unimportant at the watershed scale because rapid downstream transport limits the time for sorption desorption to influence drp exports bukaveckas 2007 withers and jarvie 2008 yet in many river systems rainfall driven runoff travels hours to days from catchment headwater streams to recipient water bodies jobson 1997 verhoff et al 1979 allowing sufficient time for p sorption desorption to influence drp exports zhang et al 2012 unfortunately it is unknown how much p sorption desorption affects drp exports during high flows and thus subsequently mediates cyanohabs in recipient ecosystems our poor understanding of p cycling during high flows may mask an important riverine process that could mediate the influence of agricultural practices on bioavailable p exports and subsequent cyanohabs jarvie et al 2013 sharpley et al 2009 during high flows the magnitude of p sorption desorption is likely determined by drp concentrations suspended sediment concentrations and river discharge zhang and huang 2007 zhou et al 2005 while drp is commonly considered 100 bioavailable baker et al 2014a bertani et al 2016 and capable of being sorbed by suspended sediment a portion of drp is colloidal p 1 450 nm gu et al 2020 nagul et al 2015 river and richardson 2019 colloidal p may be less bioavailable baken et al 2014 and does not sorb to suspended sediment these factors control the magnitude of p sorption desorption in a volume of river water and ultimately in conjunction with hydrologic travel time the total net p sorption desorption within a river network thus controls on these factors e g climate or agricultural management practices daryanto et al 2017 osmond et al 2019 effect the magnitude and direction of p sorption desorption and the bioavailability of exports to recipient ecosystems the effect of river p exports on cyanohabs in recipient lakes and reservoirs will depend upon environmental conditions how p is partitioned among fractions differing in bioavailability and how those fractions are shaped by riverine processes when environmental conditions e g temperature light nitrogen are suitable for bloom forming cyanobacteria bioavailable p loads may directly fuel the growth of cyanohabs and other phytoplankton hamilton et al 2016 paerl et al 2016 the contribution of non bioavailable p to cyanohabs will depend upon the nature of p cycling in these systems the majority of non bioavailable p in agriculture dominated watersheds is bound to sediment or colloids baker et al 2014a matisoff et al 2017 sediment p often settles to the bottom of a lake or reservoir where it can be a p sink or an important source of internal p loading orihel et al 2017 depending upon dissolved oxygen concentrations temperature and p concentrations sondergaard et al 2003 here we examined the influence of p sorption desorption during high flows on drp exports and cyanohabs we hypothesized that during high flow suspended sediment concentration shapes the magnitude of p sorption desorption within a river network altering the bioavailability of p exports and potentially cyanohabs severity in recipient ecosystems we evaluated this hypothesis by measuring the magnitude of p sorption desorption by suspended sediment during high flow events in six maumee river tributaries and by estimating p partitioning coefficients lin et al 2016 santschi 1995 then we scaled up p sorption desorption to the tributary and river network level to estimate the downstream effect on drp loads and cyanohabs in lake erie given the limited information about the concentration dynamics and bioavailability of colloidal p within drp river and richardson 2019 we modeled two scenarios assuming that colloidal p did not sorb to suspended sediment and constituted 0 or 50 of drp river and richardson 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 study system we tested our hypothesis in the agricultural dominated maumee river watershed 17 000 km2 which drains into lake erie fig 1 ohio epa 2018 the maumee river watershed is an excellent model system for agricultural watersheds because it is representative in terms of topography generally flat land use 87 agriculture crop rotations primarily soybean and corn and agricultural practices high prevalence of tile drains and mixture of tillage practices the maumee river watershed has also been intensively studied and monitored for decades which provides data to support and inform models the western basin of lake erie experienced cyanobacteria blooms between the 1960 s and early 1980 s and has seen recurring cyanobacteria blooms since 2003 baker et al 2014a a threshold year for increased discharge drp loading and cyanohabs in lake erie jarvie et al 2017 stumpf et al 2016 the severity of recent cyanohabs is associated with march to july bioavailable p exports particularly those from the maumee watershed baker et al 2014a maccoux et al 2016 michalak et al 2013 stumpf et al 2016 bioavailable p exports are typically assumed to be approximately 8 of sediment p and 100 of drp loads to lake erie baker et al 2014a bertani et al 2016 stumpf et al 2016 however half of drp may be colloidal p which is associated with iron and may not be 100 bioavailable baken et al 2014 river and richardson 2019 on average 85 and 93 of maumee river march july drp and sediment bound p exports respectively occur during high flows fig s1 also see baker et al 2014a the majority of suspended sediment 70 stumpf et al 2016 and presumably sediment bound p exported from the maumee watershed is deposited in and near the maumee river mouth baker et al 2014b which has low rates of internal p recycling 7 of cyanobacteria p demand due to the high oxygen concentrations in overlying waters matisoff et al 2016 2 2 stormwater sampling between january and june 2019 we sampled six focal stream sites located within the maumee river watershed fig 1 and table s1 during 13 storm events for suspended sediment drp and aspects of p sorption desorption i e sorption isotherms and p sorption desorption rates each site was located near a usgs stream gaging station and four cooccurred with a heidelberg university national center for water quality research ncwqr water quality monitoring stations fig 1 each focal stream was sampled once per storm event from a bridge by deploying 19 l containers to collect 75 l of stream water from the main channel s center immediately following stream water collection we homogenized the sample and collected triplicate drp and suspended sediment samples dissolved reactive phosphorus samples were immediately 0 7 µm filtered glass fiber filters whatman gf f cytiva marlborough ma usa into 20 ml hdpe scintillation vials fisher scientific pittsburgh pa usa using acid washed syringes and kept cold 4 c until frozen in the laboratory dissolved reactive phosphorus was analyzed within two days on a spectrophotometer using the colorimetric molybdenum blue reaction method strickland and parsons 1972 suspended sediment samples were stored in 250 ml acid washed hdpe plastic bottles kept cold 4 c until filtered onto pre weighed and ashed glass fiber filters whatman gf f and subsequently dried at 60 c and then reweighed the remainder of stream water was used to measure aspects of sediment p sorption desorption this water was transported to the laboratory in 19 l containers and stored in a dark environmental chamber set to the mean water temperature of the six streams to consolidate the suspended sediment for analyses we used a wvo raw power continuous flow centrifuge 6000 rpm wvo designs charleston sc usa which was set to a low flow through rate 2 l h 1 to minimize sediment loss through the centrifuge outflow upon return to the laboratory centrifugation began immediately and was completed within four days 2 3 phosphorus sorption desorption to characterize suspended sediment drp interactions we used an approach which began with measurement of p sorption isotherms and ended with the calculation of mass specific mg p mg dry mass dm 1h 1 and volumetric mg p m 3 h 1 p sorption desorption rates we measured p sorption desorption isotherms and rates using three separate measurement procedures following jarvie et al 2005 detailed methods are described in the supporting information si section 1 1 briefly sorption rate and isotherm measurements were conducted within one week of collection at the mean ambient stream temperature isotherm data were fit with a langmuir adsorption isotherm model following lai and lam 2009 the isotherm fits were used to calculate aspects of p sorption desorption including the zero equilibrium phosphorus concentration epc0 mg p l 1 and the p sorption capacity of suspended sediment particles during downstream transport mg p mg dm 1 epc0 is the drp concentration separating p sorption drp epc0 and desorption drp epc0 phosphorus sorption capacity is the difference between the maximum sorption capacity and the native p content it reflects the total p mass suspended sediment particles can sorb during downstream travel from the sampling site we measured both p sorption and desorption rates by suspended sediment however since suspended sediment desorbed p under ambient conditions in only one of 78 samples based on the difference between epc 0 and stream water drp concentrations we only present p sorption rates 2 4 estimating total p sorption in tributary waters to estimate p sorption by tributary suspended sediment downstream of our sampling sites we combined p sorption parameters with discharge si section 1 2 drp and suspended sediment data from three of the focal tributaries with sufficient drp and suspended sediment monitoring data south turkey foot stf unnamed tributary to lost creek utlc and west creek wc focusing on high flow events during march june 2019 we estimated the magnitude of p sorption by suspended sediment exported from these tributaries in four steps which are described in detail in si section 1 3 1 we calculated potential mass specific p sorption g p sorbed g dm 1 h 1 during transport between the tributaries and the furthest downstream maumee river monitoring station waterville oh 26 km from lake erie fig 1 by combining estimates of p sorption rate and hydrologic travel time si section 1 4 2 we constrained p sorption to not exceed the sediment sorption capacity si section 2 2 3 we calculated total p sorption kg p day 1 as the product of mass specific sorption rates and suspended sediment loads we constrained total p sorption so that it could not decrease drp concentrations below the threshold at which sediment switch from p sorption to desorption i e epc0 4 to estimate the impact of p sorption on drp export from our focal tributaries before the water arrived at waterville oh we integrated total p sorption across high flow events during march june 2019 estimating p sorption by all sediment transported through our sampling sites during this focal period metric tons p we calculated the uncertainty in this estimate using a bootstrapping approach manly 1997 which resampled n 500 paired measurements of mass specific sorption rate sorption capacity and epc0 to make the calculations outlined in steps 1 4 2 5 total p sorption in maumee river network to investigate the effect of p sorption within the maumee river network on lake erie drp loads and cyanohabs we combined our tributary sorption measurements with discharge and water quality monitoring data from the maumee river at waterville oh 1975 1977 and 1982 2019 fig 1 and table s1 we estimated p sorption within the maumee river network by combining data on maumee river suspended sediment loads and total mass specific sorption rates from the tributaries which were calculated as the quotient of total p sorption and suspended sediment concentration si section 1 5 this approach assumes that abiotic p cycling by suspended sediment did not change substantially during 1975 2019 an assumption supported by comparison of recent fig 3 also see williamson et al 2020 and older i e 1978 green et al 1978 mccallister and logan 1978 research demonstrating that suspended sediment is enriched in p relative to agricultural soils sorbs p during high flows and had similar p bioavailability baker et al 2014a bertani et al 2016 we integrated estimates for each year across march june high flow events and calculated the uncertainty in our measurements using a bootstrapping approach manly 1997 which sampled n 500 from all estimates of total mass specific sorption rates to determine the effect of p sorption on cyanohabs in lake erie we used an ensemble of two models bertani et al 2016 stumpf et al 2016 to estimate the magnitude of cyanobacteria blooms from bioavailable p loads calculated with and without p sorption si section 1 6 finally to characterize p partitioning between dissolved and particulate phases as well as sediment p reactivity we calculated partitioning coefficients kd see si section 1 7 for both tributary and maumee river waters during high flow 2 6 evaluating effect of colloidal p on p sorption estimates within the maumee river network some fraction of drp is likely associated with colloidal p unfortunately variation in colloid p drp ratios within the maumee river network have only been characterized for maumee river at waterville oh during median february flows river and richardson 2019 colloid p drp ratios upstream of waterville are unknow but could be lower due to sorption of phosphate onto iron rich colloids baken et al 2016 given this uncertainty we estimated p sorption in tributaries and the maumee river network assuming that all drp colloid p drp 0 and only 50 colloid p drp 0 5 of drp can sorb to suspended sediment this likely bounds conditions in the maumee river network 2 7 statistical analyses to examine patterns and controls of kd epc0 p sorption in tributaries and p sorption in the maumee river network we used a combination of linear models lm standardized major axis regression smar generalized linear models glm and generalized additive models gam we used an information theoretic approach burnham and anderson 2002 to select the most likely model from a group of candidate models models were ranked by aicc and models with a δaicc less than two were considered to have the most support burnham and anderson 2002 details on these models are supplied in si section 1 8 next we asked how declines in suspended sediment loads during 1975 2019 shaped p sorption and ultimately drp exports to lake erie due to the large intra annual changes in discharge we approached this by examining changes in the drp load discharge relationship following a four step process 1 we built a glm using a gamma distribution relating maumee river high flow march june suspended sediment loads to discharge and year 2 we used that glm to predict march june suspended sediment loads during 1975 2019 excluding 1978 1981 with the observed discharge and the year coefficient predicting loads for 1975 3 we used these predicted historic i e discharge set to observed year set to 1975 suspended sediment loads to estimate p sorption and finally drp loads with historic discharge adjusted suspended sediment loads and p sorption 4 we used glms with a gamma distribution to ask whether drp load discharge relationships differed between 1975 2022 observed drp loads and 2003 2019 drp loads predicted with historic suspended sediment loads and p sorption rates to evaluate the models we used qqplots to assess model residuals 3 results 3 1 drp sediment p interactions focal tributaries 3 1 1 zero equilibrium p concentration epc0 eighty six percent of our samples were collected during high flows fig s3 25 exceedance tributary drp concentrations averaged 800 higher than epc0 indicating that under ambient nutrient conditions suspended sediment sorbed p in 98 of our measurements 77 of 78 samples fig s4 if colloidal p drp was 0 5 suspended sediment would still be predicted to sorb p at colloidal p drp ratios of 0 75 and 0 9 sorption would be predicted in 91 and 19 of the samples respectively epc0 increased with drp concentrations with a positive intercept and slope smar r2 0 52 p 0 001 suggesting that declines in drp concentrations might lower epc0 but not alter drp sediment p dynamics the relationship between epc0 and drp did not vary among streams in elevation smar p 0 001 h0 intercept is equal or slope smar p 0 001 h0 slope is equal 3 1 2 phosphorus sorption desorption phosphorus sorption varied widely from 0 001 to 72 5 mg p m 3 h 1 differed among streams and increased with suspended sediment concentrations r2 0 90 fig s5 and table s2 and discharge r2 0 71 which were strongly correlated rpearson 0 70 at the median sediment concentration across all streams 234 g dm m 3 p sorption was 313 higher in the stream with the highest p sorption pr 11 6 mg p m 3 h 1 compared to the stream with the lowest p sorption lfr 2 8 mg p m 3 h 1 3 1 3 influence of p sorption on drp exports in the three tributaries with suspended sediment and discharge records sufficient for upscaling utlc wc and stf p sorption by suspended sediment substantially reduced drp exports assuming a colloidal p drp ratio of 0 or 0 5 suspended sediment sorbed respectively 38 50 0 1 1 4 tons p or 25 48 0 05 0 5 tons p of observed drp exports fig 2 a daily tributary p sorption increased with discharge and drp loads fig 2b as well as suspended sediment loads not shown three tightly linked exports from agricultural watersheds as a result the daily percent of drp exports sorbed increased from 0 to 50 with discharge if colloidal p drp was 0 5 we predict that p sorption kg p day 1 would be greater than zero during march june high flow events on 72 69 and 57 of days in utlc wc and stf respectively assuming a colloidal p drp of 0 p sorption saturated before suspended sediment had traveled an average of 11 7 km 11 to 55 of the distance to the downstream maumee river monitoring station fig 2c if colloidal p drp was 0 5 this distance was considerably shorter particularly in wc and stf thus drp sediment p interactions likely reached a quasi equilibrium well before sediment was exported from the maumee watershed indicating that suspended sediment originating from most of the maumee watershed had ample time during transport to shape drp exports 3 2 drp sediment p interactions maumee river network 3 2 1 influence on drp loads and cyanohabs during march june high flow events between 1975 and 2019 excluding 1979 1981 suspended sediment sorbed depending upon the colloid p drp ratio an average of 34 83 tons p per year 33 83 of observed drp loads likely decreasing the bioavailability of total p loads to lake erie fig 3 if colloidal p drp was 0 suspended sediment sorbed 7 167 tons p per year 20 575 of observed drp loads figs 3 and s6 however if colloidal p drp was 0 5 suspended sediment sorbed 3 69 tons p per year 40 less p or 8 230 of observed drp loads figs 3 and s7 these conservative estimates for all suspended sediment passing through the maumee river at waterville oh does not include p sorption by colloids or sediment retained in the river system or its floodplain averaging two lake erie cyanohabs forecasting models we predicted that the maximum annual cyanobacteria density would be on average 40 colloidal p drp 0 range 4 139 or 13 colloidal p drp 0 5 range 2 40 higher in the absence of p sorption fig 3c 3 2 2 historical patterns in drp sediment p interactions at a colloidal p drp ratio of 0 and 0 5 the percent of drp sorbed was respectively 192 or 197 higher during 1975 2002 than 2002 2019 fig 3b this difference was primarily due to changes in suspended sediment loads which drives interannual variation in p sorption in our model si section 1 5 suspended sediment loads are shaped by discharge and sediment delivery to this river system discharge integrated across march june high flow events for each year exhibited no directional trend during 1975 2019 but increased during 1985 2019 fig s8a r2 0 30 p 0 001 similarly during 1975 2019 suspended sediment loads exhibited no directional trend fig s8b but were positively correlated with discharge fig s8c after accounting for changes in discharge suspended sediment loads generally decreased during 1975 2019 fig s8d see stow et al 2015 for a comprehensive analysis for example at a discharge of 4000 m3 x 106 suspended sediment loads decreased 58 between 1975 and 2019 1 89 103 tons dry mass decade 1 fig s8d declines in p sorption related to lower suspended sediment loads helped explain increased drp loading to lake erie during 2003 2019 for colloidal p drp ratio of 0 and 0 5 the most likely multiple regression model of observed drp loads contained an interaction between discharge and year group i e 1975 2002 versus 2003 2019 indicating that drp loads increased more rapidly with discharge after 2003 then before fig 4 tables 1 and s3 at a discharge of 4000 m3 x 106 observed drp loads were 57 higher after 2003 than before 1975 2002 223 tons p 2003 2019 351 tons p also see stow et al 2015 yet when we estimated 2003 2019 drp loads with historic suspended sediment concentrations and p sorption rates we found that the drp load discharge relationship became more similar before and after 2003 at a discharge of 4000 m3 106 and a colloidal p drp ratio of 0 or 0 5 drp load predicted with historic sediment loads was respectively only 11 1975 2002 225 tons p 2003 2019 250 tons p figs 4 s9 and table 1 or 29 1975 2002 223 tons p 2003 2019 289 tons p figs 4 s10 and table s3 higher after 2003 than before thus increased drp loading to lake erie during 2003 2019 was likely driven in part by an increase in discharge fig s8a and a decrease in p sorption associated with declines in suspended sediment figs 4 and s8d 3 3 phosphorus partitioning kd the p partitioning coefficient kd calculated for tributary waters and the maumee river march june of 1975 2019 excluding 1979 1981 during high flow events indicated that sediment p was highly reactive but varied through time and among streams fig s11 and si section 2 1 in the tributaries kd varied among streams and declined with suspended sediment concentrations pseudo r2 0 79 fig s11a in the maumee river kd indicated that the reactivity of sediment p declined between march and june and was highest during 1985 1995 fig s11b d after accounting for suspended sediment concentration kd increased with log10 watershed area fig s12 r2 0 92 p 0 001 suggesting that during high flow events suspended sediment sorbed p during downstream transport 4 discussion 4 1 overview the expectation that rivers function like pipes during high flow events transporting p downstream with minimal impact on the magnitude or forms of p has greatly simplified watershed scale p modeling and management however our results challenge that prediction we show that within the maumee river system suspended sediment transported during high flow can sorb a substantial quantity of drp likely constraining cyanohabs and the resulting consequences furthermore we show that declines in sediment exports likely linked to on field sediment erosion control measures decreased p sorption and increased drp exports partially explaining the recent proliferation of cyanohabs within lake erie while we make several assumptions that require further examination see section 4 4 our measurements and modeling indicate that in 10 s of river kilometers river p cycling during high flow can influence bioavailable p exports and potentially cyanohabs in recipient ecosystems these processes are strongly influenced by climate and land use practices particularly those affecting p and sediment exports and discharge thus there is a need to better understand how drp sediment p interactions during high flows influences drp exports in other agricultural watersheds to inform management and policy 4 2 river p cycling mediates downstream water quality our results indicate that during 2003 2019 march to june high flow events p sorption by suspended sediment decreased drp exports to western lake erie by 27 or 13 assuming colloidal p drp ratio of 0 5 and increased sediment p exports by a similar percent since drp is more bioavailable to cyanohabs than sediment p baker et al 2014a bertani et al 2016 this process likely decreased bioavailable p loading to the lake in this system immobilization of drp onto suspended sediment currently represents a long term p sink because 70 of sediment exports are buried near the maumee river mouth baker et al 2014b where bottom sediment contributes little to internal p loading matisoff et al 2016 thus we estimate that p cycling in the maumee river system may have constrained cyanohabs by up to 40 13 with a colloidal p drp ratio of 0 5 while nitrogen or light limitation might keep cyanobacteria from reaching these levels chaffin et al 2018 sediment dissolved p interactions likely reduce the bioavailability of p exports to lake erie and serve as a substantial and previously unknown constraint on cyanohabs one important gap in our understanding of river p cycling during high flow events is associated with composition and bioavailability of drp approximately 50 of drp in the maumee river may be associated with colloids at least during median february flows river and richardson 2019 we estimate that if colloidal p drp is 0 5 and colloids do not sorb p that p sorption during high flow events would decline by 4 34 in tributary waters and 40 in maumee river waters relative to estimates assuming that all drp can sorb to suspended sediment unfortunately evaluation of these predictions will require more information on longitudinal and seasonal variation in colloidal p drp ratios while colloidal p could be no more bioavailable than suspended sediment colloids do sorb p baken et al 2016 2014 it is possible that during downstream transport from headwaters to the maumee river at waterville phosphate is sorbed to both colloids and suspended sediment increasing the colloid p drp ratio as well as decreasing both drp and bioavailable p concentrations changes in p sorption rates during high flow due to declining sediment loads can help explain increases in drp loading to western lake erie during 2003 2019 our results indicate that increases in drp loads to lake erie can partially be explained by increases in march to june discharge and after changes in discharge are accounted for declines in p sorption associated with declining suspended sediment loads suspended sediment exports from the maumee watershed have been reduced by agricultural conservation practices e g cover crops and reductions in tillage which have decreased soil erosion on agricultural fields richards et al 2009 unfortunately the relative effect of other proposed mechanisms for increased drp loading to lake erie e g soil stratification macropores legacy p or tile drains have not been estimated at spatiotemporal scales that facilitate a comparison with p sorption e g the maumee river watershed jarvie et al 2017 smith et al 2018 however these processes also shape patterns in discharge and drp loads at edge of field sites and thus have also contributed to increases in drp loads and cyanohabs since 2003 climate change may have unanticipated effects on the role river p cycles play in watershed nutrient budgets in the maumee watershed climate change which is predicted to increase spring precipitation by up to 20 by 2100 hayhoe et al 2010 could increase river discharge bosch et al 2014 culbertson et al 2016 but see kalcic et al 2019 likely leading to more erosion higher suspended sediment loads and more p sorption potentially decreasing the bioavailability of p loads to lake erie however the cumulative impact of river p cycling on cyanohabs will depend upon these processes as well as other climate impacts on internal p loading in western lake erie while rates of p release from benthic sediment in western lake erie are currently low relative to cyanohab demand matisoff et al 2016 changes in water temperature or the prevalence of anoxia could greatly increase internal recycling rates leading to the release of sorbed p from lake sediment gibbons and bridgeman 2020 4 3 relevance to other watersheds we hypothesize that our central message is transferable to other agriculture dominated systems during high flow sediment dissolved p interactions influences bioavailable p exports increasing or decreasing these exports depending upon the balance of epc0 and phosphate but that the influence of these riverine processes on downstream water quality has been decreasing due to declining suspended sediment loads our results indicate that within 10 s of river kilometers there is sufficient time during high flow events for p cycling to influence bioavailable p exports yet depending upon whether suspended sediment sorb or release p riverine p cycles could enhance or mitigate cyanohab severity the magnitude of this effect is dependent upon suspended sediment loads which have declined over the last 50 years in many large and small river systems e g mississippi ohio yangtze and yellow rivers due to changes in climate reservoir impoundment and agricultural practices lu et al 2013 meade and moody 2009 mize et al 2018 while these changes in suspended sediment exports have a positive effect on many aspects of aquatic health and water quality our results indicate that they may be altering instream p cycling through unappreciated mechanisms in other large watersheds there is insufficient information to predict drp sediment p interactions during high flow events measures of p sorption and desorption by suspended sediment during high flow are rare and it is unlikely that p sorption measures for benthic sediment which are common simpson et al 2021 can help predict p cycling during high flows compared to benthic sediment suspended sediment transported during high flow may be newly eroded or resuspended benthic material which may have different p cycling characteristics due to its biogeochemical history and changes in environmental conditions finally our prediction that a decrease in bioavailable p and increase in sediment p constrains cyanohabs over the long term may be limited to lakes similar to our study system western lake erie is a model system for shallow large lakes that are productive found in relatively flat agriculture dominated systems and have low p regeneration rates from lake sediments orihel et al 2017 sondergaard et al 2003 in lakes with low internal p regeneration rates external bioavailable p loads are a dominant driver of cyanohabs in contrast in lakes with high sediment p regeneration rates changes in drp loading due to drp sediment p interactions will alter the bioavailability of p loads and the response of the lake to p management 4 4 potential limitations our study makes several assumptions related to the generalizability of p sorption in tributary waters to the whole maumee river network during 1975 2019 changes in sediment composition may have altered p sorption characteristics however comparison of our results with earlier work green et al 1978 indicates that between 1976 and 2019 suspended sediment sorbed p during high flow and had similar epc0 values green 30 180 µg p l this study 1 55 µg p l and sorption maxima green 510 2063 µg p g this study 103 3167 µg p g it is also possible that we did not adequately characterize the full range of sediment sorption desorption across this large watershed however we sampled p sorption in six tributaries during 13 storm events capturing wide variation in discharge and seasonality in ground cover and agricultural practices our sites are also representative of the major land use and represent the dominant geologic parent material in the watershed the sites we used to scale up p sorption estimates reflect the range of sorption rates and suspended sediment concentrations we observed in our six study sites fig s5 4 5 implications for p and cyanohab management we describe an apparent tradeoff in water quality management suspended sediment which is transported to streams following erosion has a negative effect on many aquatic biota but potentially a positive benefit for cyanohabs control nevertheless the best way to manage cyanohabs is to reduce p losses at the source through limiting p application on fields our results do not indicate that management of sediment erosion should be halted to control cyanohabs erosion control practices provide benefits to agricultural systems osmond et al 2019 and reduces the negative effects of sediment pollution in freshwater ecosystems blann et al 2009 furthermore with changing environmental conditions p bound in lake sediment could fuel internal p loading and cyanohabs gibbons and bridgeman 2020 instead our results provide insight into the processes which shape drp and sediment p exports to recipient ecosystems and illustrate how management of one pollutant sediment can exacerbate the effects of another pollutant phosphorus a lack of understanding of riverine p cycling can lead to a misattribution of p loads to the wrong location contributing uncertainty to p management for instance our results suggest that relative to a model assuming conservative downstream transport of drp and sediment p land in the maumee watershed exported 4 10 less sediment bound p based on colloidal p drp 0 0 5 than river monitoring indicates but 14 36 more drp 81 metric tons p thus to achieve a 40 reduction in drp exports the current target for the maumee watershed p losses from agricultural fields need to be reduced by 14 36 more than previously thought 7 1 8 4 kg km 2 versus 6 2 kg km 2 in addition agricultural best management practices which reduce soil erosion more than drp losses require special consideration because they may inadvertently increase drp losses from the watershed osmond et al 2019 identifying small watersheds with especially high p exports is important for efficiently targeting management actions osmond et al 2019 yet riverine processes may complicate this targeting for example drp losses from agricultural lands in the stf and utlc watersheds might be 24 37 and 48 50 higher respectively than monitoring at the terminal end of the watershed suggests due to p sorption these differences in stf and utlc can largely be attributed to differences in mass specific p sorption rates e g g p g dm 1 h 1 of suspended sediment at the median suspended sediment concentrations across all tributaries utlc suspended sediment exhibited a 2 5 fold higher sorption rate than stf suspended sediment fig s5 thus to improve identification of watersheds with high p exports and evaluate interactions between management of sediment erosion and p losses it is important to understand colloidal p dynamics and incorporate river p cycling into watershed models and management indeed our results contribute to numerous low flow studies demonstrating that river p cycles can alter the magnitude and bioavailability of p exports jarvie et al 2011 withers and jarvie 2008 yet the role of riverine processes in shaping p exports particularly during high flow events when most p export occurs is rarely incorporated into watershed models or p management jarvie et al 2012 2013 white et al 2014 our research emphasizes the need to simultaneously manage sediment and nutrients with a watershed scale approach that considers p sources sinks and transformations kreiling et al 2018 such an approach would help address potential unanticipated consequences that could undermine management waste conservation funds and erode public trust 5 conclusions during high flow events p sorption desorption by suspended sediment can alter bioavailable p exports to recipient ecosystems during 2002 2019 march june high flow events p sorption by suspended sediment in the maumee river network likely reduced drp exports by 13 27 depending upon the colloidal p drp ratio potentially constraining cyanobacteria blooms by 13 40 the magnitude of p sorption was controlled by suspended sediment concentrations which have after accounting for changes in discharge decreased in the maumee river between 1975 and 2019 the decline in suspended sediment concentrations was associated with a decline in p sorption which could partially explain increases in drp loading to lake erie during 2002 2019 our results provide evidence of interactions between sediment and nutrient management emphasizing the need to simultaneously manage both substances with a watershed scale approach funding this research was supported by funds from the ohio state university college of arts and sciences and a robert h

15622,cyanobacterial harmful blooms have been increasing worldwide due in part to excessive phosphorus p losses from agriculture dominated watersheds unfortunately cyanobacteria bloom management is often complicated by uncertainty associated with river p cycling river p cycling mediates p exports during low flow but has been assumed to be unimportant during high flows thus we examined interactions between dissolved reactive phosphorus drp and suspended sediment p during high flows in the maumee river network focusing on march june maumee river drp exports which fuel recurring cyanobacteria blooms in lake erie we estimate that during 2003 2019 march to june high flow events p sorption reduced drp exports by an average of 13 27 depending upon the colloidal p drp ratio decreasing the bioavailability of p exports and potentially constraining cyanobacteria blooms by 13 40 phosphorus sorption was likely lower during 2003 2019 than 1975 2002 due to reductions in suspended sediment loads associated with soil erosion minimizing agricultural practices this unintended outcome of erosion management has likely decreased p sorption increased drp exports to lake erie and subsequent cyanobacteria blooms in other watersheds drp sediment p interactions during high flow could have a positive or negative effect on drp exports therefore p management should consider

repository https github com hood211 highflowsorption 1 introduction cyanobacteria harmful blooms cyanohabs which have been increasing worldwide negatively affect freshwater ecosystems human livelihoods and human health kouakou and poder 2019 paerl et al 2016 one primary cause of cyanohabs are phosphorus p losses from agricultural production particularly the loss of dissolved reactive p drp which is more bioavailable to cyanobacteria than sediment bound p baker et al 2014a thus it is a global environmental priority to understand and reduce watershed p exports glibert and burford 2017 however p management is complicated by uncertainty associated with p retention and transformation during downstream transport through river networks jarvie et al 2013 sharpley et al 2009 in streams and rivers biogeochemical processes alter the magnitude and bioavailability e g drp versus sediment p of p transported downstream exerting controls on p exports to recipient water bodies during low flow withers and jarvie 2008 yet most p and sediment export occurs during high flows correll et al 1999 gentry et al 2007 sharpley et al 2008 and we know little about p cycling during high flows edwards and withers 2008 withers and jarvie 2008 this knowledge gap limits our ability to successfully manage p pollution and cyanohabs one potentially important aspect of river p cycling during high flows is p sorption desorption by suspended sediment which can increase or decrease drp concentrations and therefore the bioavailability of p exports to cyanohabs phosphorus sorption desorption during high flows which is rarely quantified is perceived to be unimportant at the watershed scale because rapid downstream transport limits the time for sorption desorption to influence drp exports bukaveckas 2007 withers and jarvie 2008 yet in many river systems rainfall driven runoff travels hours to days from catchment headwater streams to recipient water bodies jobson 1997 verhoff et al 1979 allowing sufficient time for p sorption desorption to influence drp exports zhang et al 2012 unfortunately it is unknown how much p sorption desorption affects drp exports during high flows and thus subsequently mediates cyanohabs in recipient ecosystems our poor understanding of p cycling during high flows may mask an important riverine process that could mediate the influence of agricultural practices on bioavailable p exports and subsequent cyanohabs jarvie et al 2013 sharpley et al 2009 during high flows the magnitude of p sorption desorption is likely determined by drp concentrations suspended sediment concentrations and river discharge zhang and huang 2007 zhou et al 2005 while drp is commonly considered 100 bioavailable baker et al 2014a bertani et al 2016 and capable of being sorbed by suspended sediment a portion of drp is colloidal p 1 450 nm gu et al 2020 nagul et al 2015 river and richardson 2019 colloidal p may be less bioavailable baken et al 2014 and does not sorb to suspended sediment these factors control the magnitude of p sorption desorption in a volume of river water and ultimately in conjunction with hydrologic travel time the total net p sorption desorption within a river network thus controls on these factors e g climate or agricultural management practices daryanto et al 2017 osmond et al 2019 effect the magnitude and direction of p sorption desorption and the bioavailability of exports to recipient ecosystems the effect of river p exports on cyanohabs in recipient lakes and reservoirs will depend upon environmental conditions how p is partitioned among fractions differing in bioavailability and how those fractions are shaped by riverine processes when environmental conditions e g temperature light nitrogen are suitable for bloom forming cyanobacteria bioavailable p loads may directly fuel the growth of cyanohabs and other phytoplankton hamilton et al 2016 paerl et al 2016 the contribution of non bioavailable p to cyanohabs will depend upon the nature of p cycling in these systems the majority of non bioavailable p in agriculture dominated watersheds is bound to sediment or colloids baker et al 2014a matisoff et al 2017 sediment p often settles to the bottom of a lake or reservoir where it can be a p sink or an important source of internal p loading orihel et al 2017 depending upon dissolved oxygen concentrations temperature and p concentrations sondergaard et al 2003 here we examined the influence of p sorption desorption during high flows on drp exports and cyanohabs we hypothesized that during high flow suspended sediment concentration shapes the magnitude of p sorption desorption within a river network altering the bioavailability of p exports and potentially cyanohabs severity in recipient ecosystems we evaluated this hypothesis by measuring the magnitude of p sorption desorption by suspended sediment during high flow events in six maumee river tributaries and by estimating p partitioning coefficients lin et al 2016 santschi 1995 then we scaled up p sorption desorption to the tributary and river network level to estimate the downstream effect on drp loads and cyanohabs in lake erie given the limited information about the concentration dynamics and bioavailability of colloidal p within drp river and richardson 2019 we modeled two scenarios assuming that colloidal p did not sorb to suspended sediment and constituted 0 or 50 of drp river and richardson 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 study system we tested our hypothesis in the agricultural dominated maumee river watershed 17 000 km2 which drains into lake erie fig 1 ohio epa 2018 the maumee river watershed is an excellent model system for agricultural watersheds because it is representative in terms of topography generally flat land use 87 agriculture crop rotations primarily soybean and corn and agricultural practices high prevalence of tile drains and mixture of tillage practices the maumee river watershed has also been intensively studied and monitored for decades which provides data to support and inform models the western basin of lake erie experienced cyanobacteria blooms between the 1960 s and early 1980 s and has seen recurring cyanobacteria blooms since 2003 baker et al 2014a a threshold year for increased discharge drp loading and cyanohabs in lake erie jarvie et al 2017 stumpf et al 2016 the severity of recent cyanohabs is associated with march to july bioavailable p exports particularly those from the maumee watershed baker et al 2014a maccoux et al 2016 michalak et al 2013 stumpf et al 2016 bioavailable p exports are typically assumed to be approximately 8 of sediment p and 100 of drp loads to lake erie baker et al 2014a bertani et al 2016 stumpf et al 2016 however half of drp may be colloidal p which is associated with iron and may not be 100 bioavailable baken et al 2014 river and richardson 2019 on average 85 and 93 of maumee river march july drp and sediment bound p exports respectively occur during high flows fig s1 also see baker et al 2014a the majority of suspended sediment 70 stumpf et al 2016 and presumably sediment bound p exported from the maumee watershed is deposited in and near the maumee river mouth baker et al 2014b which has low rates of internal p recycling 7 of cyanobacteria p demand due to the high oxygen concentrations in overlying waters matisoff et al 2016 2 2 stormwater sampling between january and june 2019 we sampled six focal stream sites located within the maumee river watershed fig 1 and table s1 during 13 storm events for suspended sediment drp and aspects of p sorption desorption i e sorption isotherms and p sorption desorption rates each site was located near a usgs stream gaging station and four cooccurred with a heidelberg university national center for water quality research ncwqr water quality monitoring stations fig 1 each focal stream was sampled once per storm event from a bridge by deploying 19 l containers to collect 75 l of stream water from the main channel s center immediately following stream water collection we homogenized the sample and collected triplicate drp and suspended sediment samples dissolved reactive phosphorus samples were immediately 0 7 µm filtered glass fiber filters whatman gf f cytiva marlborough ma usa into 20 ml hdpe scintillation vials fisher scientific pittsburgh pa usa using acid washed syringes and kept cold 4 c until frozen in the laboratory dissolved reactive phosphorus was analyzed within two days on a spectrophotometer using the colorimetric molybdenum blue reaction method strickland and parsons 1972 suspended sediment samples were stored in 250 ml acid washed hdpe plastic bottles kept cold 4 c until filtered onto pre weighed and ashed glass fiber filters whatman gf f and subsequently dried at 60 c and then reweighed the remainder of stream water was used to measure aspects of sediment p sorption desorption this water was transported to the laboratory in 19 l containers and stored in a dark environmental chamber set to the mean water temperature of the six streams to consolidate the suspended sediment for analyses we used a wvo raw power continuous flow centrifuge 6000 rpm wvo designs charleston sc usa which was set to a low flow through rate 2 l h 1 to minimize sediment loss through the centrifuge outflow upon return to the laboratory centrifugation began immediately and was completed within four days 2 3 phosphorus sorption desorption to characterize suspended sediment drp interactions we used an approach which began with measurement of p sorption isotherms and ended with the calculation of mass specific mg p mg dry mass dm 1h 1 and volumetric mg p m 3 h 1 p sorption desorption rates we measured p sorption desorption isotherms and rates using three separate measurement procedures following jarvie et al 2005 detailed methods are described in the supporting information si section 1 1 briefly sorption rate and isotherm measurements were conducted within one week of collection at the mean ambient stream temperature isotherm data were fit with a langmuir adsorption isotherm model following lai and lam 2009 the isotherm fits were used to calculate aspects of p sorption desorption including the zero equilibrium phosphorus concentration epc0 mg p l 1 and the p sorption capacity of suspended sediment particles during downstream transport mg p mg dm 1 epc0 is the drp concentration separating p sorption drp epc0 and desorption drp epc0 phosphorus sorption capacity is the difference between the maximum sorption capacity and the native p content it reflects the total p mass suspended sediment particles can sorb during downstream travel from the sampling site we measured both p sorption and desorption rates by suspended sediment however since suspended sediment desorbed p under ambient conditions in only one of 78 samples based on the difference between epc 0 and stream water drp concentrations we only present p sorption rates 2 4 estimating total p sorption in tributary waters to estimate p sorption by tributary suspended sediment downstream of our sampling sites we combined p sorption parameters with discharge si section 1 2 drp and suspended sediment data from three of the focal tributaries with sufficient drp and suspended sediment monitoring data south turkey foot stf unnamed tributary to lost creek utlc and west creek wc focusing on high flow events during march june 2019 we estimated the magnitude of p sorption by suspended sediment exported from these tributaries in four steps which are described in detail in si section 1 3 1 we calculated potential mass specific p sorption g p sorbed g dm 1 h 1 during transport between the tributaries and the furthest downstream maumee river monitoring station waterville oh 26 km from lake erie fig 1 by combining estimates of p sorption rate and hydrologic travel time si section 1 4 2 we constrained p sorption to not exceed the sediment sorption capacity si section 2 2 3 we calculated total p sorption kg p day 1 as the product of mass specific sorption rates and suspended sediment loads we constrained total p sorption so that it could not decrease drp concentrations below the threshold at which sediment switch from p sorption to desorption i e epc0 4 to estimate the impact of p sorption on drp export from our focal tributaries before the water arrived at waterville oh we integrated total p sorption across high flow events during march june 2019 estimating p sorption by all sediment transported through our sampling sites during this focal period metric tons p we calculated the uncertainty in this estimate using a bootstrapping approach manly 1997 which resampled n 500 paired measurements of mass specific sorption rate sorption capacity and epc0 to make the calculations outlined in steps 1 4 2 5 total p sorption in maumee river network to investigate the effect of p sorption within the maumee river network on lake erie drp loads and cyanohabs we combined our tributary sorption measurements with discharge and water quality monitoring data from the maumee river at waterville oh 1975 1977 and 1982 2019 fig 1 and table s1 we estimated p sorption within the maumee river network by combining data on maumee river suspended sediment loads and total mass specific sorption rates from the tributaries which were calculated as the quotient of total p sorption and suspended sediment concentration si section 1 5 this approach assumes that abiotic p cycling by suspended sediment did not change substantially during 1975 2019 an assumption supported by comparison of recent fig 3 also see williamson et al 2020 and older i e 1978 green et al 1978 mccallister and logan 1978 research demonstrating that suspended sediment is enriched in p relative to agricultural soils sorbs p during high flows and had similar p bioavailability baker et al 2014a bertani et al 2016 we integrated estimates for each year across march june high flow events and calculated the uncertainty in our measurements using a bootstrapping approach manly 1997 which sampled n 500 from all estimates of total mass specific sorption rates to determine the effect of p sorption on cyanohabs in lake erie we used an ensemble of two models bertani et al 2016 stumpf et al 2016 to estimate the magnitude of cyanobacteria blooms from bioavailable p loads calculated with and without p sorption si section 1 6 finally to characterize p partitioning between dissolved and particulate phases as well as sediment p reactivity we calculated partitioning coefficients kd see si section 1 7 for both tributary and maumee river waters during high flow 2 6 evaluating effect of colloidal p on p sorption estimates within the maumee river network some fraction of drp is likely associated with colloidal p unfortunately variation in colloid p drp ratios within the maumee river network have only been characterized for maumee river at waterville oh during median february flows river and richardson 2019 colloid p drp ratios upstream of waterville are unknow but could be lower due to sorption of phosphate onto iron rich colloids baken et al 2016 given this uncertainty we estimated p sorption in tributaries and the maumee river network assuming that all drp colloid p drp 0 and only 50 colloid p drp 0 5 of drp can sorb to suspended sediment this likely bounds conditions in the maumee river network 2 7 statistical analyses to examine patterns and controls of kd epc0 p sorption in tributaries and p sorption in the maumee river network we used a combination of linear models lm standardized major axis regression smar generalized linear models glm and generalized additive models gam we used an information theoretic approach burnham and anderson 2002 to select the most likely model from a group of candidate models models were ranked by aicc and models with a δaicc less than two were considered to have the most support burnham and anderson 2002 details on these models are supplied in si section 1 8 next we asked how declines in suspended sediment loads during 1975 2019 shaped p sorption and ultimately drp exports to lake erie due to the large intra annual changes in discharge we approached this by examining changes in the drp load discharge relationship following a four step process 1 we built a glm using a gamma distribution relating maumee river high flow march june suspended sediment loads to discharge and year 2 we used that glm to predict march june suspended sediment loads during 1975 2019 excluding 1978 1981 with the observed discharge and the year coefficient predicting loads for 1975 3 we used these predicted historic i e discharge set to observed year set to 1975 suspended sediment loads to estimate p sorption and finally drp loads with historic discharge adjusted suspended sediment loads and p sorption 4 we used glms with a gamma distribution to ask whether drp load discharge relationships differed between 1975 2022 observed drp loads and 2003 2019 drp loads predicted with historic suspended sediment loads and p sorption rates to evaluate the models we used qqplots to assess model residuals 3 results 3 1 drp sediment p interactions focal tributaries 3 1 1 zero equilibrium p concentration epc0 eighty six percent of our samples were collected during high flows fig s3 25 exceedance tributary drp concentrations averaged 800 higher than epc0 indicating that under ambient nutrient conditions suspended sediment sorbed p in 98 of our measurements 77 of 78 samples fig s4 if colloidal p drp was 0 5 suspended sediment would still be predicted to sorb p at colloidal p drp ratios of 0 75 and 0 9 sorption would be predicted in 91 and 19 of the samples respectively epc0 increased with drp concentrations with a positive intercept and slope smar r2 0 52 p 0 001 suggesting that declines in drp concentrations might lower epc0 but not alter drp sediment p dynamics the relationship between epc0 and drp did not vary among streams in elevation smar p 0 001 h0 intercept is equal or slope smar p 0 001 h0 slope is equal 3 1 2 phosphorus sorption desorption phosphorus sorption varied widely from 0 001 to 72 5 mg p m 3 h 1 differed among streams and increased with suspended sediment concentrations r2 0 90 fig s5 and table s2 and discharge r2 0 71 which were strongly correlated rpearson 0 70 at the median sediment concentration across all streams 234 g dm m 3 p sorption was 313 higher in the stream with the highest p sorption pr 11 6 mg p m 3 h 1 compared to the stream with the lowest p sorption lfr 2 8 mg p m 3 h 1 3 1 3 influence of p sorption on drp exports in the three tributaries with suspended sediment and discharge records sufficient for upscaling utlc wc and stf p sorption by suspended sediment substantially reduced drp exports assuming a colloidal p drp ratio of 0 or 0 5 suspended sediment sorbed respectively 38 50 0 1 1 4 tons p or 25 48 0 05 0 5 tons p of observed drp exports fig 2 a daily tributary p sorption increased with discharge and drp loads fig 2b as well as suspended sediment loads not shown three tightly linked exports from agricultural watersheds as a result the daily percent of drp exports sorbed increased from 0 to 50 with discharge if colloidal p drp was 0 5 we predict that p sorption kg p day 1 would be greater than zero during march june high flow events on 72 69 and 57 of days in utlc wc and stf respectively assuming a colloidal p drp of 0 p sorption saturated before suspended sediment had traveled an average of 11 7 km 11 to 55 of the distance to the downstream maumee river monitoring station fig 2c if colloidal p drp was 0 5 this distance was considerably shorter particularly in wc and stf thus drp sediment p interactions likely reached a quasi equilibrium well before sediment was exported from the maumee watershed indicating that suspended sediment originating from most of the maumee watershed had ample time during transport to shape drp exports 3 2 drp sediment p interactions maumee river network 3 2 1 influence on drp loads and cyanohabs during march june high flow events between 1975 and 2019 excluding 1979 1981 suspended sediment sorbed depending upon the colloid p drp ratio an average of 34 83 tons p per year 33 83 of observed drp loads likely decreasing the bioavailability of total p loads to lake erie fig 3 if colloidal p drp was 0 suspended sediment sorbed 7 167 tons p per year 20 575 of observed drp loads figs 3 and s6 however if colloidal p drp was 0 5 suspended sediment sorbed 3 69 tons p per year 40 less p or 8 230 of observed drp loads figs 3 and s7 these conservative estimates for all suspended sediment passing through the maumee river at waterville oh does not include p sorption by colloids or sediment retained in the river system or its floodplain averaging two lake erie cyanohabs forecasting models we predicted that the maximum annual cyanobacteria density would be on average 40 colloidal p drp 0 range 4 139 or 13 colloidal p drp 0 5 range 2 40 higher in the absence of p sorption fig 3c 3 2 2 historical patterns in drp sediment p interactions at a colloidal p drp ratio of 0 and 0 5 the percent of drp sorbed was respectively 192 or 197 higher during 1975 2002 than 2002 2019 fig 3b this difference was primarily due to changes in suspended sediment loads which drives interannual variation in p sorption in our model si section 1 5 suspended sediment loads are shaped by discharge and sediment delivery to this river system discharge integrated across march june high flow events for each year exhibited no directional trend during 1975 2019 but increased during 1985 2019 fig s8a r2 0 30 p 0 001 similarly during 1975 2019 suspended sediment loads exhibited no directional trend fig s8b but were positively correlated with discharge fig s8c after accounting for changes in discharge suspended sediment loads generally decreased during 1975 2019 fig s8d see stow et al 2015 for a comprehensive analysis for example at a discharge of 4000 m3 x 106 suspended sediment loads decreased 58 between 1975 and 2019 1 89 103 tons dry mass decade 1 fig s8d declines in p sorption related to lower suspended sediment loads helped explain increased drp loading to lake erie during 2003 2019 for colloidal p drp ratio of 0 and 0 5 the most likely multiple regression model of observed drp loads contained an interaction between discharge and year group i e 1975 2002 versus 2003 2019 indicating that drp loads increased more rapidly with discharge after 2003 then before fig 4 tables 1 and s3 at a discharge of 4000 m3 x 106 observed drp loads were 57 higher after 2003 than before 1975 2002 223 tons p 2003 2019 351 tons p also see stow et al 2015 yet when we estimated 2003 2019 drp loads with historic suspended sediment concentrations and p sorption rates we found that the drp load discharge relationship became more similar before and after 2003 at a discharge of 4000 m3 106 and a colloidal p drp ratio of 0 or 0 5 drp load predicted with historic sediment loads was respectively only 11 1975 2002 225 tons p 2003 2019 250 tons p figs 4 s9 and table 1 or 29 1975 2002 223 tons p 2003 2019 289 tons p figs 4 s10 and table s3 higher after 2003 than before thus increased drp loading to lake erie during 2003 2019 was likely driven in part by an increase in discharge fig s8a and a decrease in p sorption associated with declines in suspended sediment figs 4 and s8d 3 3 phosphorus partitioning kd the p partitioning coefficient kd calculated for tributary waters and the maumee river march june of 1975 2019 excluding 1979 1981 during high flow events indicated that sediment p was highly reactive but varied through time and among streams fig s11 and si section 2 1 in the tributaries kd varied among streams and declined with suspended sediment concentrations pseudo r2 0 79 fig s11a in the maumee river kd indicated that the reactivity of sediment p declined between march and june and was highest during 1985 1995 fig s11b d after accounting for suspended sediment concentration kd increased with log10 watershed area fig s12 r2 0 92 p 0 001 suggesting that during high flow events suspended sediment sorbed p during downstream transport 4 discussion 4 1 overview the expectation that rivers function like pipes during high flow events transporting p downstream with minimal impact on the magnitude or forms of p has greatly simplified watershed scale p modeling and management however our results challenge that prediction we show that within the maumee river system suspended sediment transported during high flow can sorb a substantial quantity of drp likely constraining cyanohabs and the resulting consequences furthermore we show that declines in sediment exports likely linked to on field sediment erosion control measures decreased p sorption and increased drp exports partially explaining the recent proliferation of cyanohabs within lake erie while we make several assumptions that require further examination see section 4 4 our measurements and modeling indicate that in 10 s of river kilometers river p cycling during high flow can influence bioavailable p exports and potentially cyanohabs in recipient ecosystems these processes are strongly influenced by climate and land use practices particularly those affecting p and sediment exports and discharge thus there is a need to better understand how drp sediment p interactions during high flows influences drp exports in other agricultural watersheds to inform management and policy 4 2 river p cycling mediates downstream water quality our results indicate that during 2003 2019 march to june high flow events p sorption by suspended sediment decreased drp exports to western lake erie by 27 or 13 assuming colloidal p drp ratio of 0 5 and increased sediment p exports by a similar percent since drp is more bioavailable to cyanohabs than sediment p baker et al 2014a bertani et al 2016 this process likely decreased bioavailable p loading to the lake in this system immobilization of drp onto suspended sediment currently represents a long term p sink because 70 of sediment exports are buried near the maumee river mouth baker et al 2014b where bottom sediment contributes little to internal p loading matisoff et al 2016 thus we estimate that p cycling in the maumee river system may have constrained cyanohabs by up to 40 13 with a colloidal p drp ratio of 0 5 while nitrogen or light limitation might keep cyanobacteria from reaching these levels chaffin et al 2018 sediment dissolved p interactions likely reduce the bioavailability of p exports to lake erie and serve as a substantial and previously unknown constraint on cyanohabs one important gap in our understanding of river p cycling during high flow events is associated with composition and bioavailability of drp approximately 50 of drp in the maumee river may be associated with colloids at least during median february flows river and richardson 2019 we estimate that if colloidal p drp is 0 5 and colloids do not sorb p that p sorption during high flow events would decline by 4 34 in tributary waters and 40 in maumee river waters relative to estimates assuming that all drp can sorb to suspended sediment unfortunately evaluation of these predictions will require more information on longitudinal and seasonal variation in colloidal p drp ratios while colloidal p could be no more bioavailable than suspended sediment colloids do sorb p baken et al 2016 2014 it is possible that during downstream transport from headwaters to the maumee river at waterville phosphate is sorbed to both colloids and suspended sediment increasing the colloid p drp ratio as well as decreasing both drp and bioavailable p concentrations changes in p sorption rates during high flow due to declining sediment loads can help explain increases in drp loading to western lake erie during 2003 2019 our results indicate that increases in drp loads to lake erie can partially be explained by increases in march to june discharge and after changes in discharge are accounted for declines in p sorption associated with declining suspended sediment loads suspended sediment exports from the maumee watershed have been reduced by agricultural conservation practices e g cover crops and reductions in tillage which have decreased soil erosion on agricultural fields richards et al 2009 unfortunately the relative effect of other proposed mechanisms for increased drp loading to lake erie e g soil stratification macropores legacy p or tile drains have not been estimated at spatiotemporal scales that facilitate a comparison with p sorption e g the maumee river watershed jarvie et al 2017 smith et al 2018 however these processes also shape patterns in discharge and drp loads at edge of field sites and thus have also contributed to increases in drp loads and cyanohabs since 2003 climate change may have unanticipated effects on the role river p cycles play in watershed nutrient budgets in the maumee watershed climate change which is predicted to increase spring precipitation by up to 20 by 2100 hayhoe et al 2010 could increase river discharge bosch et al 2014 culbertson et al 2016 but see kalcic et al 2019 likely leading to more erosion higher suspended sediment loads and more p sorption potentially decreasing the bioavailability of p loads to lake erie however the cumulative impact of river p cycling on cyanohabs will depend upon these processes as well as other climate impacts on internal p loading in western lake erie while rates of p release from benthic sediment in western lake erie are currently low relative to cyanohab demand matisoff et al 2016 changes in water temperature or the prevalence of anoxia could greatly increase internal recycling rates leading to the release of sorbed p from lake sediment gibbons and bridgeman 2020 4 3 relevance to other watersheds we hypothesize that our central message is transferable to other agriculture dominated systems during high flow sediment dissolved p interactions influences bioavailable p exports increasing or decreasing these exports depending upon the balance of epc0 and phosphate but that the influence of these riverine processes on downstream water quality has been decreasing due to declining suspended sediment loads our results indicate that within 10 s of river kilometers there is sufficient time during high flow events for p cycling to influence bioavailable p exports yet depending upon whether suspended sediment sorb or release p riverine p cycles could enhance or mitigate cyanohab severity the magnitude of this effect is dependent upon suspended sediment loads which have declined over the last 50 years in many large and small river systems e g mississippi ohio yangtze and yellow rivers due to changes in climate reservoir impoundment and agricultural practices lu et al 2013 meade and moody 2009 mize et al 2018 while these changes in suspended sediment exports have a positive effect on many aspects of aquatic health and water quality our results indicate that they may be altering instream p cycling through unappreciated mechanisms in other large watersheds there is insufficient information to predict drp sediment p interactions during high flow events measures of p sorption and desorption by suspended sediment during high flow are rare and it is unlikely that p sorption measures for benthic sediment which are common simpson et al 2021 can help predict p cycling during high flows compared to benthic sediment suspended sediment transported during high flow may be newly eroded or resuspended benthic material which may have different p cycling characteristics due to its biogeochemical history and changes in environmental conditions finally our prediction that a decrease in bioavailable p and increase in sediment p constrains cyanohabs over the long term may be limited to lakes similar to our study system western lake erie is a model system for shallow large lakes that are productive found in relatively flat agriculture dominated systems and have low p regeneration rates from lake sediments orihel et al 2017 sondergaard et al 2003 in lakes with low internal p regeneration rates external bioavailable p loads are a dominant driver of cyanohabs in contrast in lakes with high sediment p regeneration rates changes in drp loading due to drp sediment p interactions will alter the bioavailability of p loads and the response of the lake to p management 4 4 potential limitations our study makes several assumptions related to the generalizability of p sorption in tributary waters to the whole maumee river network during 1975 2019 changes in sediment composition may have altered p sorption characteristics however comparison of our results with earlier work green et al 1978 indicates that between 1976 and 2019 suspended sediment sorbed p during high flow and had similar epc0 values green 30 180 µg p l this study 1 55 µg p l and sorption maxima green 510 2063 µg p g this study 103 3167 µg p g it is also possible that we did not adequately characterize the full range of sediment sorption desorption across this large watershed however we sampled p sorption in six tributaries during 13 storm events capturing wide variation in discharge and seasonality in ground cover and agricultural practices our sites are also representative of the major land use and represent the dominant geologic parent material in the watershed the sites we used to scale up p sorption estimates reflect the range of sorption rates and suspended sediment concentrations we observed in our six study sites fig s5 4 5 implications for p and cyanohab management we describe an apparent tradeoff in water quality management suspended sediment which is transported to streams following erosion has a negative effect on many aquatic biota but potentially a positive benefit for cyanohabs control nevertheless the best way to manage cyanohabs is to reduce p losses at the source through limiting p application on fields our results do not indicate that management of sediment erosion should be halted to control cyanohabs erosion control practices provide benefits to agricultural systems osmond et al 2019 and reduces the negative effects of sediment pollution in freshwater ecosystems blann et al 2009 furthermore with changing environmental conditions p bound in lake sediment could fuel internal p loading and cyanohabs gibbons and bridgeman 2020 instead our results provide insight into the processes which shape drp and sediment p exports to recipient ecosystems and illustrate how management of one pollutant sediment can exacerbate the effects of another pollutant phosphorus a lack of understanding of riverine p cycling can lead to a misattribution of p loads to the wrong location contributing uncertainty to p management for instance our results suggest that relative to a model assuming conservative downstream transport of drp and sediment p land in the maumee watershed exported 4 10 less sediment bound p based on colloidal p drp 0 0 5 than river monitoring indicates but 14 36 more drp 81 metric tons p thus to achieve a 40 reduction in drp exports the current target for the maumee watershed p losses from agricultural fields need to be reduced by 14 36 more than previously thought 7 1 8 4 kg km 2 versus 6 2 kg km 2 in addition agricultural best management practices which reduce soil erosion more than drp losses require special consideration because they may inadvertently increase drp losses from the watershed osmond et al 2019 identifying small watersheds with especially high p exports is important for efficiently targeting management actions osmond et al 2019 yet riverine processes may complicate this targeting for example drp losses from agricultural lands in the stf and utlc watersheds might be 24 37 and 48 50 higher respectively than monitoring at the terminal end of the watershed suggests due to p sorption these differences in stf and utlc can largely be attributed to differences in mass specific p sorption rates e g g p g dm 1 h 1 of suspended sediment at the median suspended sediment concentrations across all tributaries utlc suspended sediment exhibited a 2 5 fold higher sorption rate than stf suspended sediment fig s5 thus to improve identification of watersheds with high p exports and evaluate interactions between management of sediment erosion and p losses it is important to understand colloidal p dynamics and incorporate river p cycling into watershed models and management indeed our results contribute to numerous low flow studies demonstrating that river p cycles can alter the magnitude and bioavailability of p exports jarvie et al 2011 withers and jarvie 2008 yet the role of riverine processes in shaping p exports particularly during high flow events when most p export occurs is rarely incorporated into watershed models or p management jarvie et al 2012 2013 white et al 2014 our research emphasizes the need to simultaneously manage sediment and nutrients with a watershed scale approach that considers p sources sinks and transformations kreiling et al 2018 such an approach would help address potential unanticipated consequences that could undermine management waste conservation funds and erode public trust 5 conclusions during high flow events p sorption desorption by suspended sediment can alter bioavailable p exports to recipient ecosystems during 2002 2019 march june high flow events p sorption by suspended sediment in the maumee river network likely reduced drp exports by 13 27 depending upon the colloidal p drp ratio potentially constraining cyanobacteria blooms by 13 40 the magnitude of p sorption was controlled by suspended sediment concentrations which have after accounting for changes in discharge decreased in the maumee river between 1975 and 2019 the decline in suspended sediment concentrations was associated with a decline in p sorption which could partially explain increases in drp loading to lake erie during 2002 2019 our results provide evidence of interactions between sediment and nutrient management emphasizing the need to simultaneously manage both substances with a watershed scale approach funding this research was supported by funds from the ohio state university college of arts and sciences and a robert h

15623,reservoirs have been recognized as a source of methane ch4 with the gradual increase in the number of the world s reservoirs predicting the long term variation of reservoir ch4 emissions is important to understand the global change in carbon cycling due to reservoir creation and operation here we first categorized the origins and transport of organic carbon oc by reservoir creation and operation into the following four aspects a the decomposition of flooded organic matter b the sedimentation of oc from upstream sediment inputs c the transition of the aquatic ecosystem from lotic to lentic type stimulating the production of autochthonous oc and d reservoir as the collector of anthropogenic oc inputs from surrounding communities it was assumed that oc from the four aspects jointly determined the production and accumulation of reservoir ch4 concentration supporting life cycle reservoir ch4 emissions a hierarchical bayesian model of reservoir ch4 concentration was established and calibrated by observed monthly datasets in 2018 in the xiangjiaba reservoir xjb a river valley dammed reservoir in the upper yangtze river china the model explained the relative contributions of the four aspects to reservoir ch4 production and accumulation approximately 78 of the ch4 concentration was contributed by the decomposition of flooded organic matter during the first 10 years after impoundment however the contribution of flooding faded away after 10 years of impoundment with the increase in reservoir age sedimentation of oc dominantly determined the reservoir ch4 production and accumulation scenario analysis of the xjb s life cycle demostrated that the ch4 concentration in the xjb would reach its peak approximately 70 80 years after impoundment in the cascade system the upstream reservoir will help to reduce sediment oc input and to mitigate downstream reservoir ch4 production and accumulation our effort provided a new modeling approach for long term management strategies to reduce reservoir ch4 emissions under global change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane organic carbon scenario analysis life cycle cascade reservoirs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methane ch4 is the second most impactful greenhouse gas ghg in terms of radiative forcing after carbon dioxide co2 the newly released ipcc sixth assessment report ar6 recalls that the global warming potential gwp of non fossil ch4 is 27 11 times greater than that of co2 including carbon cycle on a 100 year time scale ipcc 2021 inland waters streams rivers lakes and reservoirs are widely accepted as the significant biogenic ch4 sources to the atmosphere baron et al 2022 the annual outgassing of ch4 from inland waters was estimated to be 117 212 tg ch4 yr 1 which was slightly higher than that of wetlands 102 182 tg ch4 yr 1 and higher than the use of fossil fuels 114 116 tg ch4 yr 1 and livestock 106 115 tg ch4 yr 1 ipcc 2021 inland waters account for only a small proportion approximately 3 of the earth s land surface downing et al 2006 the impact of inland waters on atmospheric ch4 dynamics is quite disproportionate to their relatively limited scale gruca rokosz et al 2020 there is increasing recognition of the importance of inland waters in the global budgets of ch4 borges et al 2015 the global ch4 budget of inland waters is strongly dependent on the fate and transport of organic carbon oc inland waters collect oc either in dissolved forms doc or particulate forms poc from various sources supporting ch4 production and emissions in general oc is microbially degraded and fermented to acetate c2h4o2 h2 and co2 which are subsequently converted to ch4 under anaerobic conditions conrad et al 2009 the proportion of acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was estimated to be 3 1 hershey et al 2014 or even 8 1 gruca rokosz et al 2020 in freshwaters the type and quantity of oc affect ch4 production as well grasset et al 2018 for example allochthonous oc is believed to have a lower reactivity than autochthonous oc but supports long term ch4 production grasset et al 2018 2021 in addition other factors that impact the ch4 emissions from the water surface include temperature nutrient availability and dissolved oxygen concentration duc et al 2010 it is noted that there is no single factor that is solely responsible for ch4 emissions stanley et al 2016 the combination of these factors that causes subsequent ch4 production and emissions from inland waters rosa et al 2016 among these factors ch4 dynamics are identified as the most sensitive to temperature in inland waters knox et al 2021 stanley et al 2016 the prediction of ch4 emissions from inland waters plays a fundamental role in assessing the biogeochemistry of ch4 under global change models of reservoir ch4 dynamics could not only provide estimates of ch4 concentration and emissions but also offer estimations of different driving forces that regulate reservoir ch4 dynamics inspiring the potential of management strategies for stakeholders to reduce ch4 production and emissions from reservoirs liu et al 2018 in general physical and biological process based ch4 models mostly established for lakes provide descriptions of the spatial and temporal distributions of ch4 barbosa et al 2016 tan and zhuang 2015 such models generally require hydrodynamic compartments as the basis i e advection convection and diffusion to support the formulation of a series of biological reactions of ch4 e g production and oxidation bridgham et al 2013 the complexities of the full process based modeling approach limit transferability and applicability to other types of inland waters liu et al 2018 rõõm et al 2014 in contrast built based on available observations empirical or semiempirical models have been gradually welcomed in the modeling practices of ch4 dynamics in inland waters over the past decade prairie et al 2021 grasset et al 2021 tabassum abbasi et al 2020 bayesian statistics have been increasingly applied to address the uncertainty and complexity of modeling in ecology and environmental sciences borsuk et al 2001 li et al 2015 the essence of any bayesian calibration scheme is to update our a priori beliefs about probable parameter values in light of the available data wong et al 2021 bayesian approaches have been applied to explore the complex nonlinear relationship between carbon fluxes and environmental factors clark 2005 kim et al 2014 li et al 2015 li et al 2015 used a hierarchical bayesian hb model to evaluate soil co2 flux under environmental change borsuk et al 2001 also applied the hb model approach to estimate the dynamics of sediment oxygen demand in response to variations in organic matter load hb wasused by hotchkiss et al 2014 to model mechanisms driving aquatic ecosystem processes that are difficult to measure directly similar practices are also conducted to estimate five variables algae growth rate water sediment nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes nitrification rate and denitrification rate in lake eutrophication wu et al 2017 while there are extensive practices of hb modeling in inland waters few cases have been found on ch4 dynamics in inland waters chen et al 2018 reservoirs globally emit approximately 17 7 tg ch4 per year into the atmosphere deemer et al 2016 which is about 8 15 of annual ch4 emissions from inland waters globally ipcc 2021 the production and emissions of ch4 in reservoirs are believed to be driven by reservoir age climatic zone temperature and trophic status primary productivity barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 for the steady empirical reservoir ch4 model the well known g res tool offers excellent examples to evaluate both post impoundment reservoir ch4 estimates throughout the life cycle and net emissions prairie et al 2021 for dynamic models the proposed exponential decay model based on early long term observations in the petit saut reservoir fundamentally provides demonstrations for follow up modeling practices in reservoir ch4 dynamics abril et al 2005 guérin et al 2008 ruiz vásquez et al 2019 grasset et al 2021 such models were based on the premise that the decomposition of flooded organic matter primarily contributes to the production and emissions of ch4 in reservoirs however long term reservoir ch4 dynamics are far more complex sediment transport anthropogenic inputs of oc and nutrients from surrounding communities have also been proven to be important factors that regulate long term ch4 dynamics in reservoirs colas et al 2020 li et al 2020 however there is still a lack of reservoir ch4 modeling practices that can summarize and address the contributions of various factors to the long term ch4 dynamics in reservoirs here we summarized the mechanisms of oc sources and transport due to reservoir creation and operation an hb model was developed based on field observations to explain the mechanisms of oc turnover and ch4 accumulation in a reservoir life cycle predictions of the reservoir ch4 concentration under different scenarios were discussed we believe that our exploration of reservoir ch4 modeling could provide new insights into the best practice of reservoir carbon management 2 materials and methods 2 1 hierarchical bayesian modeling compared with the pre impoundment state reservoir creation and operation will affect or change the biogeochemical cycle of carbon particularly oc in the following four aspects a the decomposition of flooded organic matter b the sedimentation of oc from upstream sediment inputs c the transition of the aquatic ecosystem from lotic to lentic type stimulating the production of autochthonous oc and d the reservoir as the collector of anthropogenic oc inputs from surrounding communities supplementary material s1 provided extended descriptions of the above four aspects the above four aspects jointly determine the sources and transport of oc in reservoirs however the different meteorological hydrological and geographical characteristics including anthropogenic activities structure distinctive limnological features that affect the relative contributions of the above four effects which further regulate the long term ch4 production and emissions of reservoirs here the hb modeling was applied fortwo purposes 1 to predict the long term variation of ch4 concentration in a reservoir and 2 to estimate the relative contribution of the above four aspects the observations of ch4 concentration from our sampling campaign provided a dataset for the hb modeling zhang et al 2022 the model was based on the following assumptions 1 all the variables in the selected reservoir were assumed to be spatially homogenized spatial differences in land use in flooded areas and surrounding communities were not considered as well 2 variables were assumed to vary on a monthly scale variables such as water temperature reservoir inflow and outflow and water level were averaged monthly 3 the population in the surrounding communities was assumed to be stable during the first 10 years after impoundment after that it was assumed to increase at an annual natural growth rate which could be cited or estimated from the demographic census the ch4 concentration c c h 4 in a reservoir was assumed to be normally distributed with the mean μ c h 4 and variance σ 1 c c h 4 normal μ c h 4 σ 2 the scale parameter μ c h 4 is determined by the equation 2 μ c h 4 j n r 1 μ o c 1 j n e α t j n r

sampling campaign the jinsha river is the name of the main stem of the upper yangtze river in china holding massive hydroelectric resources the subtropical alpine valley river has experienced fast cascade development of hydropower projects over the past decades in the lower reach of the jinsha river four large hydropower projects have been constructed xiangjiaba installed capacity of 6400 mw

serves not only for producing enormous renewable energy but also for flood control navigation and water supply here we took xiangjiaba reservoir xjb as our research site fig s2 in supplementary material the xjb is the lowest reservoir in the cascade reservoir system in the lower jinsha river its upstream reservoir is xiluodu reservoir xld the xjb has a length of 156 6 km with a surface area of 95 6 km2 serving mainly for hydropower production the water level in the xjb only varies seasonally between 370 m and 380 m above sea level according to the reservoir operation scheme the maximum depth of the reservoir is 161 m at the dam site from january 2018 to january 2019 a bimonthly sampling campaign was conducted along the longitudinal gradients in the xjb zhang et al 2022 ten sampling sites were located in the main stem of the reservoir fig s2b water samples were collected from both the surface and bottom layers at each sampling site surface water refers to the water sample collected 0 5 m below the water surface and bottom water is the water sample collected approximately 2 m above the sediment layer for the sampling sites immediately downstream of the dams i e b10 and b9 only water samples from the surface layer were collected because the water column was fully mixed with strong turbulence more information related to hydrological data of the xjb in 2018 is shown in fig s2 2 4 chemical analysis of environmental variables the concentration of ch4 at different depths in the water column was measured by using the headspace approach and was determined by using a picarro g2201 i isotopic analyzer california usa the water temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentration were measured by using a calibrated ysi pro 2030 probe ysi inc ohio usa total phosphorus tp was measured by a uv spectrophotometer following the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method apha et al 2005 chlorophyll a chl a was extracted from the surface water sample with a whatman gf c filter and 90 acetone for 24 h before testing by spectrophotometry more information could be referred to by zhang et al 2022 2 5 data collection and scenario analysis project parameters of the xjb were primarily obtained from the environmental impact assessment report of the xiangjiaba hydropower project xue et al 2005 daily hydrological data e g reservoir inflow and outflow and water level variations were obtained by the china three gorges corporation www ctg com cn the demographic census was from the seventh national population census of china kang et al 2022 the annual natural growth rate of the population in surrounding communities of the xjb was set at 1 45 the ratio of residents between the urban area and rural area was estimated as 64 36 in the surrounding communities of the reservoir the posterior distributions of parameters were inferred by the hb model by using the r2jags package in the r program version 4 0 5 this supported the long term prediction of reservoir ch4 concentration graphing and descriptive statistical analysis were performed by originpro 2022 originlab corporation ma usa four different scenarios with changes in population in the surrounding communities and sediment inputs of the reservoir were proposed for the analysis of long term dynamics of reservoir ch4 concentration table 1 in particular long term sediment inputs of the xjb reservoir with and without its upstream reservoir construction were estimated in the environmental impact assessment report xue et al 2005 and shown in fig s3 3 results 3 1 ch4 concentration and environmental variables the annual average ch4 concentration in the xjb is 0 044 0 026 μm the ch4 concentration in the water surface layer was slightly lower than that in the bottom layer table s2 for water temperature and tp concentration the corresponding annual means were 17 79 3 23 c and 0 0026 0 0011 μm respectively the mean chl a concentration in the water surface layer was 2 68 5 79 mg m3 the seasonal variations in ch4 water temperature and tp concentration are shown in fig s4 the summer season from july to september showed the higher value of the above variables diatom blooms occurred at a distance of approximately 63 km upstream of the xjb dam in march causing the maxima of chl a concentration the weak thermal stratification started in march probably supporting the spring algal blooms with the gradual increase in reservoir discharge from the upper xld dams for flood control thermal stratification in the lower xjb gradually disappears in sync after may the do concentration in the water surface layer was significantly higher than that in the bottom layer especially during the bloom forming period increases in water temperature and tp concentration had a positive effect on the elevation of ch4 spearman correlation r t ch4 0 399 and r tp ch4 0 276 sig 0 01 fig s5 there was a significant negative correlation between ch4 and chl a spearman correlation r chla ch4 0 273 sig 0 01 fig s5 3 2 results of the hb model the parameters of our hb model were calibrated and validated using the mean and median ch4 concentrations of our datasets the hb model captured most of the observed ch4 concentrations fig 2 the predicted and observed ch4 concentrations were mostly distributed near the 1 1 line indicating that our hb model can obtain reliable predictions of ch4 concentration in the xjb the r2 between the observed median concentration and the predicted mean concentration is 0 72 fig 2 which is higher than the corresponding r2 of the means r2 0 51 table s3 summarized the posterior distributions of the parameters inferred by the hb model these parameters include the conversion ratio of oc to ch4 r i i 1 2 3 4 degradation coefficients β i i 1 2 4 and σ2 in the decomposition of the flooded organic matter the conversion ratio of oc to ch4 r 1 was estimated to be 5 26 10 8 for the aspect of the sedimentation of oc the conversion ratio r 2 was 3 26 10 10 in the transition of the aquatic ecosystem the conversion ratio r 3 was 2 67 10 4 the conversion ratio of oc to ch4 r 4 from anthropogenic activities in surrounding communities was 1 23 10 8 the relatively higher conversion ratio from autochthonous oc to ch4 seemed to be reasonable as autochthonous oc was believed to be easier to be utilized by microbial communities for producing ch4 grasset et al 2018 in 2018 when our field sampling campaigns were performed the degradation coefficients of oc due to the aforementioned aspects β 1 β 2 and β 4 were 0 00204 0 00171 and 0 00150 respectively our observed datasets of ch4 concentration have the same trend as predicted results by the hb model fig 2 both of them reached their maximum values in july the estimated relative contributions of the above four effects to the monthly ch4 concentration are shown in fig 3 during our sampling campaign the predicted average ch4 concentration in 2018 was 0 0430 μm the average concentrations of ch4 generated by the four effects estimated from the posterior medians of the model were 0 0123 0 0095 0 0112 and 0 0100 μm their annual relative contributions to the total ch4 concentration were 28 6 22 2 25 9 and 23 3 respectively the relative contribution of the four aforementioned aspects is slightly different in each month which may be related to the seasonal variations in primary productivity and occurrence of algal blooms fig 3 3 3 long term variations of ch4 concentration in the reservoir the xjb was officially impounded in october 2012 while reservoir age is an important variable potentially regulating the dynamics of reservoir ch4 concentration we retrieved the post impoundment variations in ch4 concentration since 2012 based on the estimated posterior parameters fig s6 the results indicated that the relative contribution of the decomposition of flooded organic matter decreases with reservoir age the estimated ch4 concentration contributed by the decomposition of flooded organic matter gradually decreased from 88 7 in 2012 to 28 9 in 2018 fig s6 a during the first six years after impoundment the ch4 produced by the sedimentation of oc inputs from upstream gradually decreased fig s6b however the relative contribution of sedimentation of oc inputs showed an evident trend of increase gradually fig 4 the estimated ch4 concentration contributed by the sedimentation of oc inputs from upstream gradually increased from 7 6 in 2012 to 21 9 in 2018 under the current model structure we did not expect an apparent annual variation of primary production during the first years after impoundment the estimated ch4 concentration contributed from anthropogenic oc inputs in surrounding communities also showed a steady increase after the reservoir impoundment due to the gradual increase in the population of surrounding communities from 0 7 in 2012 to 22 9 in 2018 all four effects cumulatively structured the retrieval annual variation trends of ch4 concentration of the xjb since 2012 fig s6e we extrapolated the model for future scenarios over a 100 year lifespan fig 4 the relative contribution of the decomposition of flooded organic matter to the reservoir ch4 concentration dropped sharply to zero approximately 10 years after impoundment the relative contribution of the sedimentation of oc inputs from upstream to reservoir ch4 concentration gradually increased in the reservoir s life cycle this was due to the accumulative effect of sediment deposition for long term reservoir operation it was expected to reach its peak 70 80 years after impoundment because the sedimentation rate in the xjb would reach its maximum at the same time fig s3 the relative contributions of the transition of the aquatic ecosystem and the collection of anthropogenic oc input in surrounding communities varied with similar trends both of their contributions to reservoir ch4 concentration increased significantly within the first 10 years after impoundment and then decreased slowly the ch4 concentration in the xjb after 100 years of impoundment was predicted fig 5 the variations of ch4 concentration in life cycle was in general similar for scenarios 1 to 4 the significant increase in ch4 concentration in the first years after impoundment of the reservoir is mainly contributed by the degradation of flooded organic matter however the relative contribution of the initial decomposition to reservoir ch4 concentration was restricted by the limits of organic matter in flooded area fig 5 after the first 20 years of impoundment the ch4 concentration in the xjb was expected to gradually increase and reach the maximum in 2090 fig 5 for scenario 2 and scenario 3 anthropogenic activities seemed to be directly affected the change in ch4 concentration yet accelerated population growth scenario 3 did not show an evident increase of reservoir ch4 concentration compared to the scenario 2 which removed all the anthropogenic activities in surrounding communities thus the sedimentation of oc inputs from upstream was believed to be taken the largest share in the reservoir ch4 concentration over the life span fig 6 the estimated ch4 concentration in scenario 4 would be 2 3 times higher than the observed data in 2018 from the perceive of the life cycle the estimated mean of reservoir ch4 concentration in scenario 1 was 0 41 0 30 μm in 100 years the corresponding mean in scenario 4 in life cycle was estimated to be 0 81 0 37 μm mean sd by our model fig 6 it was evident that cascade reservoirs would significantly reduce upstream sediment oc input and mitigate downstream reservoir ch4 production and accumulation in the lifespan however because of the sedimentation balance of the reservoir reservoir ch4 concentration in the xjb in scenario 4 would be expected to drop in 70 80 years after impoundment fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 contributions of the four aforementioned aspects the 2019 refinement to the 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories proposed reservoirs as a representative type of flooded land to be included in the national greenhouse gas inventories lovelock et al 2019 long term reservoir ch4 emission was the only one that needs be accounted for in the tier 1 methodology of flood land remaining flooded land such treatment was based on the consensus that non co2 emissions e g ch4 are the extra ghg emissions that need to be accounted for due to land use change for over 20 years lovelock et al 2019 thus the prediction of long term reservoir ch4 emission is meaningful from the life cycle perspective extensive studies outline the long term variations in reservoir ch4 emission including well known long term data from the petit saut reservoir in french guiana abril et al 2005 galylacaux et al 1997 however growing evidence has shown that the decomposition of flooded organic matter in terms of exponential decay is not the only driving force that supports long term ch4 dynamics in reservoirs for instance colas et al 2020 discussed that allochthonous oc was an important contributor to long term ch4 emission in the petit saut reservoir our recent results illustrated that input of oc from the upstream river basin mainly in form of accumulated sediment regulated reservoir ch4 variations in the three gorges reservoir li et al 2020 in the xjb our evidence also indicated that allochthonous oc primarily contributes to ch4 production and emissions in such a newly created river valley reservoir with a reservoir age less than 10 years zhang et al 2022 in light of the above results we felt that a generalized conceptual framework to support long term analysis of ch4 concentration and emissions due to reservoir creation and operation is necessary in our modeling results we showed that initial inundation contributed to the upsurge of ch4 concentration in the xjb approximately 78 of the ch4 concentration was from the decomposition of flooded organic matter during the first 10 years after impoundment however the contribution of initial decomposition decreased to approximately zero after 10 years of reservoir impoundment degradation of flooded vegetation and soil organic matter were the important sources of ch4 in reservoirs abril et al 2005 barros et al 2011 the initial ch4 concentration was partially contributed by the sedimentation during the construction phase of the dam project yet such contribution was little with the increase in reservoir age the reservoir ch4 was gradually produced mainly by the continuous sediment oc inputs from upstream the relative concentrations of the transition of the aquatic ecosystem and the collection of anthropogenic oc inputs to reservoir ch4 concentration steadily increases with reservoir age ch4 production from autochthonous organic matter from aquatic plants and phytoplankton is more sensitive than that from terrestrial organic matter from land plants and soil west et al 2012 terrigenous organic matter would degrade slowly while autochthonous organic matter is relatively easy to be decomposed and transformed into ch4 grasset et al 2018 west et al 2012 the current model limited our long term prediction of contribution of tp to reservoir ch4 concentration however there is highly possibility that anthropogenic activities in surrounding communities and also from upstream may significantly cause the increase of reservoir ch4 concentration 4 2 implications for the net ch4 emission due to damming the ipcc proposed that the concept of net emissions should be applied to account for excessive greenhouse gas ghg emissions due to reservoir creation and operation the reservoir net emissions were defined as the differences between the post impoundment ghg balances excluding ghg emissions from unrelated anthropogenic sources other than damming and the pre impoundment balances of ghg emissions and removal to be compatible with the concept of reservoir net ghg emissions we regarded the two aspects i e the decomposition of flooded organic matter and the sedimentation of upstream oc inputs as the direct contribution of the net emissions the transition of the aquatic ecosystem was partially from the change in hydrodynamic conditions due to reservoir impoundments and partially from the input of nutrients triggering eutrophication due to anthropogenic sources of oc and nutrients in our study from the life cycle perspective we anticipated that over 60 of reservoir ch4 concentration could be considered as the net effects due to reservoir creation and operation however if the contribution from anthropogenic sources in surrounding communities continues to increase the contribution of the net effect will be relatively reduced and that of the unrelated anthropogenic sources other than damming will be evidently increased 4 3 limitations of the study limitations in our study were still evident first in long term estimations we assumed that temperature and nutrient inputs from upstream were kept the same as those in 2018 due to a lack of available data we understand that this might cause uncertainties additionally such treatment limits the scope of the discussion about the net emissions caused by the transition of the aquatic ecosystem as discussed above we limited our discussion to the reservoir ch4 concentration reservoir ch4 emissions were not only from air water diffusion but also from ebbulition and degassing the xjb has a maximum depth of 161 m with an annual water retention time of 15 8 8 6 days mean sd in 2018 in this deep valley reserovir ebbulition on the water surface is strickely limited as gas bubbles dissolve before they arrive at the water surface yet we could not provide further evidence about the magnitude of ch4 emissions due to degassing thus we limited our current research in the reservoir ch4 concentration 5 conclusion the model can be used to simulate and predict reservoir ch4 concentration at the initial stage of reservoir impoundment the reservoir ch4 concentration was mainly contributed by the decomposition of the flooded organic matter with the increase in reservoir age the sedimentation of upstream oc inputs would become the dominant driven force for reservoir ch4 production and accumulation the ch4 concentration in the xjb was expected to reach the maximum within 70 80 years after impoundment anthropogenic activities in surrounding communities affect the production and accumulation of ch4 in the reservoir construction and operation of the upstream reservoir forming a cascade system would significantly reduce sediment input in the reservoir mitigating ch4 production and accumulation our effort provided a new modeling approach for long term management strategies to reduce

15623,reservoirs have been recognized as a source of methane ch4 with the gradual increase in the number of the world s reservoirs predicting the long term variation of reservoir ch4 emissions is important to understand the global change in carbon cycling due to reservoir creation and operation here we first categorized the origins and transport of organic carbon oc by reservoir creation and operation into the following four aspects a the decomposition of flooded organic matter b the sedimentation of oc from upstream sediment inputs c the transition of the aquatic ecosystem from lotic to lentic type stimulating the production of autochthonous oc and d reservoir as the collector of anthropogenic oc inputs from surrounding communities it was assumed that oc from the four aspects jointly determined the production and accumulation of reservoir ch4 concentration supporting life cycle reservoir ch4 emissions a hierarchical bayesian model of reservoir ch4 concentration was established and calibrated by observed monthly datasets in 2018 in the xiangjiaba reservoir xjb a river valley dammed reservoir in the upper yangtze river china the model explained the relative contributions of the four aspects to reservoir ch4 production and accumulation approximately 78 of the ch4 concentration was contributed by the decomposition of flooded organic matter during the first 10 years after impoundment however the contribution of flooding faded away after 10 years of impoundment with the increase in reservoir age sedimentation of oc dominantly determined the reservoir ch4 production and accumulation scenario analysis of the xjb s life cycle demostrated that the ch4 concentration in the xjb would reach its peak approximately 70 80 years after impoundment in the cascade system the upstream reservoir will help to reduce sediment oc input and to mitigate downstream reservoir ch4 production and accumulation our effort provided a new modeling approach for long term management strategies to reduce reservoir ch4 emissions under global change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane organic carbon scenario analysis life cycle cascade reservoirs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methane ch4 is the second most impactful greenhouse gas ghg in terms of radiative forcing after carbon dioxide co2 the newly released ipcc sixth assessment report ar6 recalls that the global warming potential gwp of non fossil ch4 is 27 11 times greater than that of co2 including carbon cycle on a 100 year time scale ipcc 2021 inland waters streams rivers lakes and reservoirs are widely accepted as the significant biogenic ch4 sources to the atmosphere baron et al 2022 the annual outgassing of ch4 from inland waters was estimated to be 117 212 tg ch4 yr 1 which was slightly higher than that of wetlands 102 182 tg ch4 yr 1 and higher than the use of fossil fuels 114 116 tg ch4 yr 1 and livestock 106 115 tg ch4 yr 1 ipcc 2021 inland waters account for only a small proportion approximately 3 of the earth s land surface downing et al 2006 the impact of inland waters on atmospheric ch4 dynamics is quite disproportionate to their relatively limited scale gruca rokosz et al 2020 there is increasing recognition of the importance of inland waters in the global budgets of ch4 borges et al 2015 the global ch4 budget of inland waters is strongly dependent on the fate and transport of organic carbon oc inland waters collect oc either in dissolved forms doc or particulate forms poc from various sources supporting ch4 production and emissions in general oc is microbially degraded and fermented to acetate c2h4o2 h2 and co2 which are subsequently converted to ch4 under anaerobic conditions conrad et al 2009 the proportion of acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was estimated to be 3 1 hershey et al 2014 or even 8 1 gruca rokosz et al 2020 in freshwaters the type and quantity of oc affect ch4 production as well grasset et al 2018 for example allochthonous oc is believed to have a lower reactivity than autochthonous oc but supports long term ch4 production grasset et al 2018 2021 in addition other factors that impact the ch4 emissions from the water surface include temperature nutrient availability and dissolved oxygen concentration duc et al 2010 it is noted that there is no single factor that is solely responsible for ch4 emissions stanley et al 2016 the combination of these factors that causes subsequent ch4 production and emissions from inland waters rosa et al 2016 among these factors ch4 dynamics are identified as the most sensitive to temperature in inland waters knox et al 2021 stanley et al 2016 the prediction of ch4 emissions from inland waters plays a fundamental role in assessing the biogeochemistry of ch4 under global change models of reservoir ch4 dynamics could not only provide estimates of ch4 concentration and emissions but also offer estimations of different driving forces that regulate reservoir ch4 dynamics inspiring the potential of management strategies for stakeholders to reduce ch4 production and emissions from reservoirs liu et al 2018 in general physical and biological process based ch4 models mostly established for lakes provide descriptions of the spatial and temporal distributions of ch4 barbosa et al 2016 tan and zhuang 2015 such models generally require hydrodynamic compartments as the basis i e advection convection and diffusion to support the formulation of a series of biological reactions of ch4 e g production and oxidation bridgham et al 2013 the complexities of the full process based modeling approach limit transferability and applicability to other types of inland waters liu et al 2018 rõõm et al 2014 in contrast built based on available observations empirical or semiempirical models have been gradually welcomed in the modeling practices of ch4 dynamics in inland waters over the past decade prairie et al 2021 grasset et al 2021 tabassum abbasi et al 2020 bayesian statistics have been increasingly applied to address the uncertainty and complexity of modeling in ecology and environmental sciences borsuk et al 2001 li et al 2015 the essence of any bayesian calibration scheme is to update our a priori beliefs about probable parameter values in light of the available data wong et al 2021 bayesian approaches have been applied to explore the complex nonlinear relationship between carbon fluxes and environmental factors clark 2005 kim et al 2014 li et al 2015 li et al 2015 used a hierarchical bayesian hb model to evaluate soil co2 flux under environmental change borsuk et al 2001 also applied the hb model approach to estimate the dynamics of sediment oxygen demand in response to variations in organic matter load hb wasused by hotchkiss et al 2014 to model mechanisms driving aquatic ecosystem processes that are difficult to measure directly similar practices are also conducted to estimate five variables algae growth rate water sediment nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes nitrification rate and denitrification rate in lake eutrophication wu et al 2017 while there are extensive practices of hb modeling in inland waters few cases have been found on ch4 dynamics in inland waters chen et al 2018 reservoirs globally emit approximately 17 7 tg ch4 per year into the atmosphere deemer et al 2016 which is about 8 15 of annual ch4 emissions from inland waters globally ipcc 2021 the production and emissions of ch4 in reservoirs are believed to be driven by reservoir age climatic zone temperature and trophic status primary productivity barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 for the steady empirical reservoir ch4 model the well known g res tool offers excellent examples to evaluate both post impoundment reservoir ch4 estimates throughout the life cycle and net emissions prairie et al 2021 for dynamic models the proposed exponential decay model based on early long term observations in the petit saut reservoir fundamentally provides demonstrations for follow up modeling practices in reservoir ch4 dynamics abril et al 2005 guérin et al 2008 ruiz vásquez et al 2019 grasset et al 2021 such models were based on the premise that the decomposition of flooded organic matter primarily contributes to the production and emissions of ch4 in reservoirs however long term reservoir ch4 dynamics are far more complex sediment transport anthropogenic inputs of oc and nutrients from surrounding communities have also been proven to be important factors that regulate long term ch4 dynamics in reservoirs colas et al 2020 li et al 2020 however there is still a lack of reservoir ch4 modeling practices that can summarize and address the contributions of various factors to the long term ch4 dynamics in reservoirs here we summarized the mechanisms of oc sources and transport due to reservoir creation and operation an hb model was developed based on field observations to explain the mechanisms of oc turnover and ch4 accumulation in a reservoir life cycle predictions of the reservoir ch4 concentration under different scenarios were discussed we believe that our exploration of reservoir ch4 modeling could provide new insights into the best practice of reservoir carbon management 2 materials and methods 2 1 hierarchical bayesian modeling compared with the pre impoundment state reservoir creation and operation will affect or change the biogeochemical cycle of carbon particularly oc in the following four aspects a the decomposition of flooded organic matter b the sedimentation of oc from upstream sediment inputs c the transition of the aquatic ecosystem from lotic to lentic type stimulating the production of autochthonous oc and d the reservoir as the collector of anthropogenic oc inputs from surrounding communities supplementary material s1 provided extended descriptions of the above four aspects the above four aspects jointly determine the sources and transport of oc in reservoirs however the different meteorological hydrological and geographical characteristics including anthropogenic activities structure distinctive limnological features that affect the relative contributions of the above four effects which further regulate the long term ch4 production and emissions of reservoirs here the hb modeling was applied fortwo purposes 1 to predict the long term variation of ch4 concentration in a reservoir and 2 to estimate the relative contribution of the above four aspects the observations of ch4 concentration from our sampling campaign provided a dataset for the hb modeling zhang et al 2022 the model was based on the following assumptions 1 all the variables in the selected reservoir were assumed to be spatially homogenized spatial differences in land use in flooded areas and surrounding communities were not considered as well 2 variables were assumed to vary on a monthly scale variables such as water temperature reservoir inflow and outflow and water level were averaged monthly 3 the population in the surrounding communities was assumed to be stable during the first 10 years after impoundment after that it was assumed to increase at an annual natural growth rate which could be cited or estimated from the demographic census the ch4 concentration c c h 4 in a reservoir was assumed to be normally distributed with the mean μ c h 4 and variance σ 1 c c h 4 normal μ c h 4 σ 2 the scale parameter μ c h 4 is determined by the equation 2 μ c h 4 j n r 1 μ o c 1 j n e α t j n r

sampling campaign the jinsha river is the name of the main stem of the upper yangtze river in china holding massive hydroelectric resources the subtropical alpine valley river has experienced fast cascade development of hydropower projects over the past decades in the lower reach of the jinsha river four large hydropower projects have been constructed xiangjiaba installed capacity of 6400 mw

serves not only for producing enormous renewable energy but also for flood control navigation and water supply here we took xiangjiaba reservoir xjb as our research site fig s2 in supplementary material the xjb is the lowest reservoir in the cascade reservoir system in the lower jinsha river its upstream reservoir is xiluodu reservoir xld the xjb has a length of 156 6 km with a surface area of 95 6 km2 serving mainly for hydropower production the water level in the xjb only varies seasonally between 370 m and 380 m above sea level according to the reservoir operation scheme the maximum depth of the reservoir is 161 m at the dam site from january 2018 to january 2019 a bimonthly sampling campaign was conducted along the longitudinal gradients in the xjb zhang et al 2022 ten sampling sites were located in the main stem of the reservoir fig s2b water samples were collected from both the surface and bottom layers at each sampling site surface water refers to the water sample collected 0 5 m below the water surface and bottom water is the water sample collected approximately 2 m above the sediment layer for the sampling sites immediately downstream of the dams i e b10 and b9 only water samples from the surface layer were collected because the water column was fully mixed with strong turbulence more information related to hydrological data of the xjb in 2018 is shown in fig s2 2 4 chemical analysis of environmental variables the concentration of ch4 at different depths in the water column was measured by using the headspace approach and was determined by using a picarro g2201 i isotopic analyzer california usa the water temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentration were measured by using a calibrated ysi pro 2030 probe ysi inc ohio usa total phosphorus tp was measured by a uv spectrophotometer following the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method apha et al 2005 chlorophyll a chl a was extracted from the surface water sample with a whatman gf c filter and 90 acetone for 24 h before testing by spectrophotometry more information could be referred to by zhang et al 2022 2 5 data collection and scenario analysis project parameters of the xjb were primarily obtained from the environmental impact assessment report of the xiangjiaba hydropower project xue et al 2005 daily hydrological data e g reservoir inflow and outflow and water level variations were obtained by the china three gorges corporation www ctg com cn the demographic census was from the seventh national population census of china kang et al 2022 the annual natural growth rate of the population in surrounding communities of the xjb was set at 1 45 the ratio of residents between the urban area and rural area was estimated as 64 36 in the surrounding communities of the reservoir the posterior distributions of parameters were inferred by the hb model by using the r2jags package in the r program version 4 0 5 this supported the long term prediction of reservoir ch4 concentration graphing and descriptive statistical analysis were performed by originpro 2022 originlab corporation ma usa four different scenarios with changes in population in the surrounding communities and sediment inputs of the reservoir were proposed for the analysis of long term dynamics of reservoir ch4 concentration table 1 in particular long term sediment inputs of the xjb reservoir with and without its upstream reservoir construction were estimated in the environmental impact assessment report xue et al 2005 and shown in fig s3 3 results 3 1 ch4 concentration and environmental variables the annual average ch4 concentration in the xjb is 0 044 0 026 μm the ch4 concentration in the water surface layer was slightly lower than that in the bottom layer table s2 for water temperature and tp concentration the corresponding annual means were 17 79 3 23 c and 0 0026 0 0011 μm respectively the mean chl a concentration in the water surface layer was 2 68 5 79 mg m3 the seasonal variations in ch4 water temperature and tp concentration are shown in fig s4 the summer season from july to september showed the higher value of the above variables diatom blooms occurred at a distance of approximately 63 km upstream of the xjb dam in march causing the maxima of chl a concentration the weak thermal stratification started in march probably supporting the spring algal blooms with the gradual increase in reservoir discharge from the upper xld dams for flood control thermal stratification in the lower xjb gradually disappears in sync after may the do concentration in the water surface layer was significantly higher than that in the bottom layer especially during the bloom forming period increases in water temperature and tp concentration had a positive effect on the elevation of ch4 spearman correlation r t ch4 0 399 and r tp ch4 0 276 sig 0 01 fig s5 there was a significant negative correlation between ch4 and chl a spearman correlation r chla ch4 0 273 sig 0 01 fig s5 3 2 results of the hb model the parameters of our hb model were calibrated and validated using the mean and median ch4 concentrations of our datasets the hb model captured most of the observed ch4 concentrations fig 2 the predicted and observed ch4 concentrations were mostly distributed near the 1 1 line indicating that our hb model can obtain reliable predictions of ch4 concentration in the xjb the r2 between the observed median concentration and the predicted mean concentration is 0 72 fig 2 which is higher than the corresponding r2 of the means r2 0 51 table s3 summarized the posterior distributions of the parameters inferred by the hb model these parameters include the conversion ratio of oc to ch4 r i i 1 2 3 4 degradation coefficients β i i 1 2 4 and σ2 in the decomposition of the flooded organic matter the conversion ratio of oc to ch4 r 1 was estimated to be 5 26 10 8 for the aspect of the sedimentation of oc the conversion ratio r 2 was 3 26 10 10 in the transition of the aquatic ecosystem the conversion ratio r 3 was 2 67 10 4 the conversion ratio of oc to ch4 r 4 from anthropogenic activities in surrounding communities was 1 23 10 8 the relatively higher conversion ratio from autochthonous oc to ch4 seemed to be reasonable as autochthonous oc was believed to be easier to be utilized by microbial communities for producing ch4 grasset et al 2018 in 2018 when our field sampling campaigns were performed the degradation coefficients of oc due to the aforementioned aspects β 1 β 2 and β 4 were 0 00204 0 00171 and 0 00150 respectively our observed datasets of ch4 concentration have the same trend as predicted results by the hb model fig 2 both of them reached their maximum values in july the estimated relative contributions of the above four effects to the monthly ch4 concentration are shown in fig 3 during our sampling campaign the predicted average ch4 concentration in 2018 was 0 0430 μm the average concentrations of ch4 generated by the four effects estimated from the posterior medians of the model were 0 0123 0 0095 0 0112 and 0 0100 μm their annual relative contributions to the total ch4 concentration were 28 6 22 2 25 9 and 23 3 respectively the relative contribution of the four aforementioned aspects is slightly different in each month which may be related to the seasonal variations in primary productivity and occurrence of algal blooms fig 3 3 3 long term variations of ch4 concentration in the reservoir the xjb was officially impounded in october 2012 while reservoir age is an important variable potentially regulating the dynamics of reservoir ch4 concentration we retrieved the post impoundment variations in ch4 concentration since 2012 based on the estimated posterior parameters fig s6 the results indicated that the relative contribution of the decomposition of flooded organic matter decreases with reservoir age the estimated ch4 concentration contributed by the decomposition of flooded organic matter gradually decreased from 88 7 in 2012 to 28 9 in 2018 fig s6 a during the first six years after impoundment the ch4 produced by the sedimentation of oc inputs from upstream gradually decreased fig s6b however the relative contribution of sedimentation of oc inputs showed an evident trend of increase gradually fig 4 the estimated ch4 concentration contributed by the sedimentation of oc inputs from upstream gradually increased from 7 6 in 2012 to 21 9 in 2018 under the current model structure we did not expect an apparent annual variation of primary production during the first years after impoundment the estimated ch4 concentration contributed from anthropogenic oc inputs in surrounding communities also showed a steady increase after the reservoir impoundment due to the gradual increase in the population of surrounding communities from 0 7 in 2012 to 22 9 in 2018 all four effects cumulatively structured the retrieval annual variation trends of ch4 concentration of the xjb since 2012 fig s6e we extrapolated the model for future scenarios over a 100 year lifespan fig 4 the relative contribution of the decomposition of flooded organic matter to the reservoir ch4 concentration dropped sharply to zero approximately 10 years after impoundment the relative contribution of the sedimentation of oc inputs from upstream to reservoir ch4 concentration gradually increased in the reservoir s life cycle this was due to the accumulative effect of sediment deposition for long term reservoir operation it was expected to reach its peak 70 80 years after impoundment because the sedimentation rate in the xjb would reach its maximum at the same time fig s3 the relative contributions of the transition of the aquatic ecosystem and the collection of anthropogenic oc input in surrounding communities varied with similar trends both of their contributions to reservoir ch4 concentration increased significantly within the first 10 years after impoundment and then decreased slowly the ch4 concentration in the xjb after 100 years of impoundment was predicted fig 5 the variations of ch4 concentration in life cycle was in general similar for scenarios 1 to 4 the significant increase in ch4 concentration in the first years after impoundment of the reservoir is mainly contributed by the degradation of flooded organic matter however the relative contribution of the initial decomposition to reservoir ch4 concentration was restricted by the limits of organic matter in flooded area fig 5 after the first 20 years of impoundment the ch4 concentration in the xjb was expected to gradually increase and reach the maximum in 2090 fig 5 for scenario 2 and scenario 3 anthropogenic activities seemed to be directly affected the change in ch4 concentration yet accelerated population growth scenario 3 did not show an evident increase of reservoir ch4 concentration compared to the scenario 2 which removed all the anthropogenic activities in surrounding communities thus the sedimentation of oc inputs from upstream was believed to be taken the largest share in the reservoir ch4 concentration over the life span fig 6 the estimated ch4 concentration in scenario 4 would be 2 3 times higher than the observed data in 2018 from the perceive of the life cycle the estimated mean of reservoir ch4 concentration in scenario 1 was 0 41 0 30 μm in 100 years the corresponding mean in scenario 4 in life cycle was estimated to be 0 81 0 37 μm mean sd by our model fig 6 it was evident that cascade reservoirs would significantly reduce upstream sediment oc input and mitigate downstream reservoir ch4 production and accumulation in the lifespan however because of the sedimentation balance of the reservoir reservoir ch4 concentration in the xjb in scenario 4 would be expected to drop in 70 80 years after impoundment fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 contributions of the four aforementioned aspects the 2019 refinement to the 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories proposed reservoirs as a representative type of flooded land to be included in the national greenhouse gas inventories lovelock et al 2019 long term reservoir ch4 emission was the only one that needs be accounted for in the tier 1 methodology of flood land remaining flooded land such treatment was based on the consensus that non co2 emissions e g ch4 are the extra ghg emissions that need to be accounted for due to land use change for over 20 years lovelock et al 2019 thus the prediction of long term reservoir ch4 emission is meaningful from the life cycle perspective extensive studies outline the long term variations in reservoir ch4 emission including well known long term data from the petit saut reservoir in french guiana abril et al 2005 galylacaux et al 1997 however growing evidence has shown that the decomposition of flooded organic matter in terms of exponential decay is not the only driving force that supports long term ch4 dynamics in reservoirs for instance colas et al 2020 discussed that allochthonous oc was an important contributor to long term ch4 emission in the petit saut reservoir our recent results illustrated that input of oc from the upstream river basin mainly in form of accumulated sediment regulated reservoir ch4 variations in the three gorges reservoir li et al 2020 in the xjb our evidence also indicated that allochthonous oc primarily contributes to ch4 production and emissions in such a newly created river valley reservoir with a reservoir age less than 10 years zhang et al 2022 in light of the above results we felt that a generalized conceptual framework to support long term analysis of ch4 concentration and emissions due to reservoir creation and operation is necessary in our modeling results we showed that initial inundation contributed to the upsurge of ch4 concentration in the xjb approximately 78 of the ch4 concentration was from the decomposition of flooded organic matter during the first 10 years after impoundment however the contribution of initial decomposition decreased to approximately zero after 10 years of reservoir impoundment degradation of flooded vegetation and soil organic matter were the important sources of ch4 in reservoirs abril et al 2005 barros et al 2011 the initial ch4 concentration was partially contributed by the sedimentation during the construction phase of the dam project yet such contribution was little with the increase in reservoir age the reservoir ch4 was gradually produced mainly by the continuous sediment oc inputs from upstream the relative concentrations of the transition of the aquatic ecosystem and the collection of anthropogenic oc inputs to reservoir ch4 concentration steadily increases with reservoir age ch4 production from autochthonous organic matter from aquatic plants and phytoplankton is more sensitive than that from terrestrial organic matter from land plants and soil west et al 2012 terrigenous organic matter would degrade slowly while autochthonous organic matter is relatively easy to be decomposed and transformed into ch4 grasset et al 2018 west et al 2012 the current model limited our long term prediction of contribution of tp to reservoir ch4 concentration however there is highly possibility that anthropogenic activities in surrounding communities and also from upstream may significantly cause the increase of reservoir ch4 concentration 4 2 implications for the net ch4 emission due to damming the ipcc proposed that the concept of net emissions should be applied to account for excessive greenhouse gas ghg emissions due to reservoir creation and operation the reservoir net emissions were defined as the differences between the post impoundment ghg balances excluding ghg emissions from unrelated anthropogenic sources other than damming and the pre impoundment balances of ghg emissions and removal to be compatible with the concept of reservoir net ghg emissions we regarded the two aspects i e the decomposition of flooded organic matter and the sedimentation of upstream oc inputs as the direct contribution of the net emissions the transition of the aquatic ecosystem was partially from the change in hydrodynamic conditions due to reservoir impoundments and partially from the input of nutrients triggering eutrophication due to anthropogenic sources of oc and nutrients in our study from the life cycle perspective we anticipated that over 60 of reservoir ch4 concentration could be considered as the net effects due to reservoir creation and operation however if the contribution from anthropogenic sources in surrounding communities continues to increase the contribution of the net effect will be relatively reduced and that of the unrelated anthropogenic sources other than damming will be evidently increased 4 3 limitations of the study limitations in our study were still evident first in long term estimations we assumed that temperature and nutrient inputs from upstream were kept the same as those in 2018 due to a lack of available data we understand that this might cause uncertainties additionally such treatment limits the scope of the discussion about the net emissions caused by the transition of the aquatic ecosystem as discussed above we limited our discussion to the reservoir ch4 concentration reservoir ch4 emissions were not only from air water diffusion but also from ebbulition and degassing the xjb has a maximum depth of 161 m with an annual water retention time of 15 8 8 6 days mean sd in 2018 in this deep valley reserovir ebbulition on the water surface is strickely limited as gas bubbles dissolve before they arrive at the water surface yet we could not provide further evidence about the magnitude of ch4 emissions due to degassing thus we limited our current research in the reservoir ch4 concentration 5 conclusion the model can be used to simulate and predict reservoir ch4 concentration at the initial stage of reservoir impoundment the reservoir ch4 concentration was mainly contributed by the decomposition of the flooded organic matter with the increase in reservoir age the sedimentation of upstream oc inputs would become the dominant driven force for reservoir ch4 production and accumulation the ch4 concentration in the xjb was expected to reach the maximum within 70 80 years after impoundment anthropogenic activities in surrounding communities affect the production and accumulation of ch4 in the reservoir construction and operation of the upstream reservoir forming a cascade system would significantly reduce sediment input in the reservoir mitigating ch4 production and accumulation our effort provided a new modeling approach for long term management strategies to reduce reservoir ch4 emissions under global change credit authorship contribution statement qi li methodology writing original draft data curation formal analysis zhe li conceptualization writing original

15624,the pervasiveness of microplastics mps in global oceans is raising concerns about their adverse impacts on ecosystems the mechanistic understanding of mp transport is critical for evaluating its fate flux and ecological risks specifically currently bubble bursting is believed to represent an important route for mp transfer from sea surfaces to the atmosphere however the detailed mechanisms of the complex physico chemical interactions between mps water composition and gel particles in the air sea interface remain unknown our results suggested three steps for mp transfer between air sea phases 1 mps incorporating into gel aggregates in the water column 2 further accumulation of plastic gel aggregate in the surface layer phase finally 3 ejection of aggregates from the sea when bubbles of trapped air rise to the surface and burst the water composition e g high salinity gel concentration and viscosity can modulate plastic gel aggregation and subsequent transport from water to the atmosphere the possible mechanism may be closely tied to the formation of plastic gel via cation linking bridges thereby enhancing plastic gel ejection into air collectively this work offers unique insights into the role of marine plastic gels in determining mp fate and transport especially at air sea interfaces the data also provide a better understanding of the corresponding mechanism that may explain the fates of missing plastics in the ocean graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics plastic gels surface layer atmospheric plastics bubble bursting data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the continued increase in microplastic mp pollution is viewed as a serious environmental issue of the anthropocene due to its adverse impacts on ecological systems and human health plasticseurope 2019 has recently reported that the annual production of plastic base materials in 2018 was around 350 million tons worldwide the global plastic production is expected to show continuous growth in the future geyer et al 2017 the low recycling rate and unregulated disposal of plastic wastes now means that approximately 10 of all produced plastics are inevitably released into marine environments each year geyer et al 2017 the release of this plastic litter into natural systems results in substantial accumulation in the ultimate environmental receptors such as oceans auta et al 2017 picó and barceló 2019 while being transported in aquatic environments plastic debris can gradually break down into smaller fragments including micro plastics mps size 5 mm in diameter and even nanoplastics nps size 1 μm due to mechanical fragmentation photo degradation chemical stress and biodegradation enfrin et al 2019 picó and barceló 2019 our previous data also indicated that small sized plastics cause high levels of cellular stress in marine phytoplankton cells and can alter the dynamics of marine organic matter shiu et al 2020a 2020b mps can also act as carrier vehicles for the transboundary and vertical transport of many hazardous materials in the ocean alimi et al 2018 thereby further disturbing ecological systems therefore an in depth understanding of the fate and transport of marine mps will help in estimating their total flux and ecological risks early survey studies have documented that mps occur extensively in human impacted locations including rivers harbors beaches and coastal oceans because water discharges from these areas were recognized as main sources of primary and secondary mps chen and chen 2020 enfrin et al 2019 lebreton et al 2017 shiu et al 2021 during the long term and transboundary transport mps are even present in remote areas such as deep sea sediments ultraoligotrophic seas polar seas and frozen ice cores alimi et al 2018 auta et al 2017 pico and barcelo et al 2019 many processes that can influence mp abundance transport and characterization have been well investigated but the global mass of measured marine mps in surface water is still much smaller than expected based on the loads of mismanaged plastics releasing into the marine systems sparking discussions regarding to missing plastics and final sinks erni cassola et al 2019 weiss et al 2021 however the available data does not seem to be a definitive answer for the missing plastics the development of atmospheric mp monitoring technology is now providing evidence of long distance atmospheric transport of mps to remote locations allen et al 2020 the survey data of mps from the beach air suggests the possibility of ocean to atmosphere transmission revealing a potential route for the disappearance of mps from oceans allen et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2020 the transport of substances such as sea salt organic material marine aerosols and microbial cells from the ocean surface into the atmosphere through convective updrafts has been well studied sharma et al 2012 sofiev et al 2011 orellana et al 2021 in natural phenomena micro sized droplets are spread from the sea when breaking waves cause trapped air bubbles to rise to the sea surface layer and subsequent burst erinin et al 2019 these primary droplets are generated due to bubble film bursting and water jet formed when the cavity of the air bubble collapse wang et al 2017 the void left by the bubble as it is gradually removed in the sea surface is replaced with water and this water collision process can cause the formation of larger micro sized droplets and secondary ejection richer and veron 2016 some of these micro and nano sized aerosol droplets return suddenly into the sea however the others can be expelled and suspended in the atmosphere and can be transported long distances by wind o dowd and de leeuw et al 2007 a concept similar to this global transport and ejection of marine materials may also operate for marine mps thereby forming a potential route for air sea exchange allen et al 2020 the air water transfer of mps by bubble bursting and raindrop ejection has also been evaluated in laboratory experiments lehmann et al 2021 masry et al 2021 recent data also have revealed that the water composition and mp characteristics may affect bubble sizes and bubble bursting thereby further altering transfer mps from the water phase to air masry et al 2021 however the detailed mechanisms of mp transport in the air sea interfaces by bubble bursting remain poorly understood the air sea interface and especially the surface microlayer is enriched in organic matter e g sticky natural organic gels or extracellular polymeric substances eps engel et al 2017 wurl et al 2017 a few previous studies have shown that micro and nano plastics can be incorporated into marine organic aggregates such as gels eps and phytoplankton aggregates chen et al 2011 2018 li et al 2019b michels et al 2018 shiu et al 2020a the aggregation of organic gels may also influence sea spray particle formation and accumulate mps in the air sea interfaces and subsequent transport allen et al 2020 masry et al 2021 orellana et al 2021 therefore in the present study we evaluate the enrichment factor for the transport of 1μm plastic polystyrene particles in sea spray and surface layers for various water compositions by simulating the bubble bursting phenomenon in a laboratory reactor sea salt and different viscosities of natural organic gels were added to investigate the interactions between mps inorganic salts and natural organic matter at the air sea interface the findings will advance our understanding of the fates of missing plastics in the ocean 2 methods 2 1 chemicals and sample preparation artificial seawater asw using the composition obtained from marine biological laboratory

al 2021 all the enrichment experiments were conducted in a glass cylinder height 257 mm inner diameter 32 mm filled with approximately 130 ml of the solution containing approximately 3 104 mp particles bubbles were formed in aqueous solution by the passage of high pressure air 2 kg cm 2 through microporous material particle free air was generated by a compressor dif bn30 united filtration systems inc with 99 9998 filtration efficiency removal of 0 01 micron particles a mass flow controller and meter rma 26 ssv dwyer instruments llc was used to adjust the pressure and flow rate of the air entering the reactor the airflow was approximately 0 85 and 1 0 l min 1 the bubble and droplet size distribution were monitored using a sony nex 5 camera and analyzed using imagej nih bethesda md the porosity of the sintered glass frit was used to produce a size range of bubbles below the hinze scale produced by waves breaking in natural systems sellegri et al 2006 robinson et al 2019 fig s1 images of the bubbles formed above the microporous material in the aqueous solution were recorded using full manual mode aperture f5 6 iso 12800 shutter speed 1 2000 s air transferred droplet images fig s2 at below 15 mm above the water surface were recorded using full manual mode aperture f5 6 iso 200 shutter speed 1 5 s 2 3 experimental design we used the bubble generator as a laboratory reactor to simulate the natural sea spray aerosol enrichment rather than generating bubbles by wave breaking the microbubbles were produced in situ by bubbles generated by the microporous material gas bubbles in the ocean may carry mps to the air sea interface where the bubbles burst and form a sea spray aerosol potentially enriched in mps the initial concentration of mps was 3 104 mp particles the experiment conducted in the present study consisted of adjusting various water compositions including three salinities 0 17 and 34 psu two gel concentrations 1 and 10 ppm and two viscosities low and medium viscosity of alginic acid sodium salts to evaluate the detailed mechanisms underlying the complex physico chemical interactions between the mps water composition and gel particles in the air sea phase the organic carbon concentrations of 1 and 10 ppm of alginic acid sodium salts were 0 18 0 04 and 2 17 0 06 mg c l respectively the addition of alginic acid sodium salts in this experiments is within the organic carbon range expected in the natural environment cao et al 2018 li et al 2019a shiu et al 2017 the range of ph value in the all experiments was 5 72 5 96 the mp transfer and accumulation in the air water phase was measured when the bubbles rose from the microporous material to the water surface and burst air transferred droplets with containing mp particles in the pilot tests we collected droplet samples at 3 mm and 30 mm to compare the enrichment factor ef of mps in air transferred droplets in the two heights the results showed that efs in the two heights are no obvious difference fig s3 the air transferred droplet collection at 3 mm can also avoid wind and air flow inferences and droplets can be collected as much as possible therefore in subsequent experiments we immediately collected the air transferred droplets atmospheric phase for 3 min using a glass slide placed approximately 3 mm above the water surface the mp accumulations in the surface layers were collected at 1 mm of the water depth a total of 10 μl 10 positions and 1 μl for each position was collected into pipettes the fixed volume 10 μl of collected droplets surface layer and water column were transferred to a hemocytometer and then a fluorescence microscopy axio scope a1 carl zeiss germany was used to count green fluorescent mps excitation 480 nm emission 520 nm the mp concentrations in air transferred droplets surface layer and water column were obtained from the counting results mp particle transfer was also verified by fluorescence microscopy in this study we used ef to evaluate mp particle transfer in the surface layer and air transferred droplets the ef expressed the degree of enrichment of the two phases including surface layer and air transferred droplets the enrichment can be explained by considering the affinity of the mps collected at the air water interface expressed as the ratio of the mp concentrations in the different phases such as water to surface layer and surface layer to air transferred droplets the ef is defined as follows 1 e n r i c h m e n t f a c t o r e f c a t m o o r s u r f a c e l a y e r c w a t e r o r s u r f a c e l a y e r where catmo or surface layer is the concentration of mps in the air transferred droplets or surface layer phase and cwater or surface layer is the mp concentration in the water or surface layer phase 2 4 statistical analysis the data are presented as means standard deviation sd statistically significant differences among the means of the number of mps and their enrichment factor were determined using student s t test analysis with p values of 0 05 the analyses were performed using microsoft office excel and graphpad prism 4 0 graphpad software inc san diego ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 mp transfer from water to the atmospheric phase the phenomenon of plastic particle transfer from a water column into an atmospheric phase via bubble bursting was investigated using a bubble generator to simulate the air water environments the image from fig s2 provides the evidence for the generation of the air transferred droplet formation via bubble bursting or jet ejection the aquatic conditions and especially the salinity and characteristics of various organic colloids determine the air water transfer of materials therefore the influence of environmental factors on mp enrichment between the air transferred droplet and water was also considered fig 2 a shows the number of mps in the air transferred droplet with aquatic gels low and median viscosities of alginic acid sodium salts and at three salinity levels 0 17 and 34 psu under the bubble bursting mps were detected in the collected air transferred droplets in all experiments and ranged in number from 2 4 104 to 5 3 106 in air transferred droplets the test conducted in the absence of sea salts 0 psu exhibited the lowest number of mps among all the experiments regardless of the presence or absence of alginic gels in the water interestingly the number of mps in air transferred droplets increased as the viscosity and gel concentrations increased in the water with higher salinity levels 17 and 34 psu we also used the ef value as a further reflection of the mp accumulation between water and the atmosphere the ef values were defined as the ratio of the mp concentrations in the air transferred droplet and its corresponding concentration in the water phase fig 2b shows that the efs in samples at 0 psu were essentially 1 indicating less enrichment phenomenon in the absence of salinity regardless of the water viscosity notably adjustment of the salinity to 17 psu caused a slight increase t test p 0 05 from approximately 1 5 to 5 5 in the efs following the addition of low and median viscosities of alginic gels lva and mva by contrast the ef values showed no significant changes in response to the different concentrations 1 ppm and 10 ppm of alginic gels t test p 0 05 further increases in the salinity to 34 psu increased the ef to 3 7 for samples without alginic gels w o va whereas the ef values obviously increased to 13 20 and 25 35 respectively in the presence of 1 ppm and 10 ppm of alginic gels t test p 0 05 the ef greatly increased with higher salinity for all aqueous suspensions with different gel contains in the order of 10 ppm mva 1 ppm mva 10 ppm lva 1 ppm lva w o va fig 2b this order clearly demonstrated a salinity and gel dependent trend suggesting that both the gel concentration and viscosity can significantly affect the mp mobility from water to air in high salinity environments e g seawater our data clearly indicate that mp transport in the water and ejection into the air beyond the air sea interface via bubble bursting may occur widely in both freshwater and sea water systems the phenomenon reported here is also similar to that reported in a recent controlled laboratory experiment by masry et al 2021 who showed that the addition of smaller plastics 1μm in ultrapure waters increases the size of airborne particles after bubble bursting they also found that a higher particle transfer rate in the presence of proxies of components e g sodium dodecyl sulfate of the sea surface microlayer the results demonstrated that microplastic size and organic matter may induce the probability of plastic transfer these observations confirm the ability of mps to transfer to the atmosphere via spray aerosol and may also explain why mps can be collected in the air sampled at extensive distances offshore allen et al 2020 trainic et al 2020 our data indicated that local water characteristics such as high salinity gel concentration and viscosity may regulate the partitioning and distribution of the mps that are transferred to the atmosphere 3 2 mp transfer stages the mp partitioning and distribution between the air transferred droplets surface layer and water column phases under the bubble bursting condition were further investigated to understand the possible transfer stages the mp distribution in water to surface layer and surface layer to air transferred droplets are presented as fig 3 the values of ef for the subsurface water to the surface layer exceeded 1 in all samples higher ef values were observed in samples with higher level of salts and alginic gels while samples at 0 psu exhibited lower ef values the data may indicate that mps can accumulate in the surface layer especially in water containing salts and organic gels the possible reason is mps from plastic gels could be transported by bubbles from the subsurface waters to the air water interfaces the mps would then be subsequently transported from the surface layers to the atmospheric phases by bubble bursting and ejection as the ef values for the surface layer to air transferred droplet increased with salinity and with increased gel concentration obviously the highest ef values 25 55 7 38 were observed for a salinity of 34 psu and a medium viscosity gel concentration of 10 ppm whereas the lowest ef value less than 1 was obtained in the absence of salts 0 psu this suggests that more cation linking sites from high salinity 34 psu increase gel plastic formation could promote mps transport from the surface layer to the air the ef of all air transferred droplets are smaller than surface layer ef 1 at 0 psu indicating that more mps are accumulated in surface layer and may not enter into the air phase this may illustrate that carrier materials such as marine colloids are highly involved in mp transport from the water to air some studies have noted the important role played by the surface layer in contaminant cycling high microbial activity produces sticky gels that can accumulate organic pollutants including persistent organic contaminants and mps huang et al 2020 song et al 2014 our results not only observed mp accumulation in the surface layer phase but also indicated that mp can be atmospherically entrained from bubble or jet expulsion in a similar manner to sea spray aerosols inorganic salts and transparent exopolymeric particles in our case bubbles may trap alginic acid and mps during bubbles rise through the water column and further accumulate at the surface layer and finally transport them to the atmosphere through the formation of aerosol droplets cunliffe et al 2013 link et al 2018 2019 in addition our data also showed that the transfer of mps occurs in two stages and that the transfer in the freshwater and sea water systems are distinguishable salinity level may act as a critical regulator for the probability of mp transfer from surface water to the atmosphere 3 3 possible mechanisms we investigated the underlying mechanisms of mp transport to the atmospheric phase by collecting spray droplets on glass slides and observing them by fluorescence microscopy as shown in fig 4 the micrographs provide visual evidence that 1 μm polystyrene microparticles green fluorescence tended to aggregate 20 30 μm and accumulate within the alginic gels low and medium viscosity of 10 ppm and with the salinity of 34 psu by contrast less aggregation or single particles 1 3 μm were found in the sample without alginic gels this is because the chain length molecular weight of alginic acid has the strong correlation with viscosity alginic acid with medium viscosity consists long chain of α ʟ guluronic acid and β ᴅ mannuronic acid can form the larger alginic gels relative to that with low viscosity draget et al 1994 the larger alginic gel binding more mps formed plastic gel aggregates and may increase abundance of mps in the spray aerosol cunliffe et al 2013 link et al 2018 2019 this observation supported the possibility of our hypothesis that the ocean atmosphere exchange of mps from wave action and bubble bursting or jet ejection may play an important role in the transport pathway the ejection and transport of mps may also occur similarly sea spray aerosols formed from dust salt and bacterial particles the images presented here are the first to provide credible evidence that marine plastic gels can serve as a route for scavenging and redistribution of mps in the water column and further ejection into the atmospheric phase via bubble bursting or jet ejection in fact our previous studies have shown that aquatic gel particles and colloids can scavenge pollutants including organic materials micro and nano plastics and other metals through aggregation processes chiu et al 2019 santschi et al 2021 shiu and lee 2017 shiu et al 2014 2018 further studies shiu et al 2020a 2020b clearly indicated that colloids and phytoplankton cells can act as tackiness agents to hold mp particles together within larger aggregates to form marine plastic snow our present data indicated that mps can incorporate with aquatic gels and be transported from the surface water to the air via bubble burst marine plastic gel ejection is considered to have an active role in the air water transfer process of mps the detail pathway can be separate three steps 1 plastic gel aggregate formation in the water column 2 accumulation of plastic gel aggregate in the surface layer water to surface layer 3 transportation of plastic gel aggregate from the surface layer to the air surface layer to air according to recent research the two controlling factors for aquatic microgel formation are cation bridging which possibly explain the higher capacity for mp transfer to air under conditions of high salinity and high gel concentration viscosity as our case the highest ef values occurred mainly in the cation rich salt water salinity with 34 psu and in the presence of a high abundance of gels fig 3 the higher concentrations of gels contributed more microgel precursors to facilitate plastic gel aggregate formation high salinity conditions 17 and 34 psu contain multivalent cations such as ca2 that can provide cross linking capacities to coordinate the guluronic acid sites of alginic acid to form a stable microgel structures urbanova et al 2019 by contrast less microgel aggregates form in samples without sea salt 0 psu possibly due to the lack of cross linking bridges through cations in order to examine the formation of plastic gel via cation linking bridges ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta a chelator for metal ions was added to water samples edta can effectively eliminate ca2 crosslinking in the aquatic gel and colloid assembly has been confirmed chin et al 1998 shiu et al 2020b as shown in fig 5 the addition of 10 mm of edta to sample caused the chelation of ca2 and other cationic ions which significantly decreased ef and the ef was close to the sample with 0 psu this is consistent with previous data that the addition of edta to the fresh and sea water caused the chelation of cations which inhibited biopolymer assembly chin et al 1998 shiu et al 2020b indicating the role of cross linking bridges in the aggregation of aquatic gels the results supported our hypothesis that the involvement of ca2 crosslinking domains in the plastic gel formation in addition to cation bridging force involved in plastic gel aggregation other aquatic gels with high viscosity may act as tackiness agents to accelerate adsorption on mp surfaces and aggregate formation santschi et al 2020 2021 shiu et al 2020a leading to higher transport rates and enhanced mp exchange between water and air phases furthermore the effect of bubble bursting intensity on particle transfer was also examined by altering the flow rate of the air entering the reactor to produce two different intensities of bubble bursting and ejection the size range of the bubbles produced by bubble bursting was below the hinze scale under two different flow rates fig s4a corresponding to the particle size of natural sea spray aerosols sellegri et al 2006 robinson et al 2019 the ef significantly increased at the high flow rate 1 0 l min 1 compared to the low flow rate 0 85 l min 1 under all environmental conditions fig 6 notably this increase in ef also occurred in fresh water salinity with 0 psu where the ef value increased from approximately 1 to 20 indicating that strong bubble bursting or waves can be one of the active forces that favors the accumulation and transport of mps from the water to air phases regardless of the presence of salts or gels the stronger force from the higher flow rate could support the ejection of the droplets with some extent weight of particles thereby increasing the probability of particle transfer the higher flow rate also tended to produce a greater number of bubbles fig s4b and multiple jet drops this is probably because that bubbles induced gel aggregate formation by contributing more interfaces for aggregation and this could induce plastic gel particle formation and subsequent ejection jenkinson et al 2021 wada et al 2020 3 4 environmental implications despite a globally acknowledged mp challenges scientists have discovered the expected increases in marine plastics in sea surfaces geyer et al 2017 but current data haven t been able to explain why the mass balance of releasing versus measured marine mps in the surface ocean is lower than model expected sparking discussions regarding to missing plastics and final sinks weiss et al 2021 this study firstly provides a new route for transport of mps in air water systems especially in marine plastic gel particles promoting the probability of plastic transfer the data demonstrated that mp transport may be similar with sea spray aerosol inorganic salts and organic matter briefly mp in water systems can be trapped and further accumulated by bubbles from the water column to surface layer then subsequently transported to atmospheric phases via the bubble bursting and ejection aquatic ca2 crosslinking and other hydrophobic polymers aggregated with plastics forming plastic gels and further jet ejection through bubble bursting can significantly enhance mp exchange efficiency additionally the impact of gel aggregates on the marine ecosystem could be vast for example these gel particles participate in various biogeochemical reactions such as pollutant mobility carbon sequestration and food webs verdugo et al 2012 among these gels provide concentrated hot spots of bioavailable nutrients and substrates for organisms at the bottom of aquatic food web so aggregates containing mps or other pollutant may cause ecological risks nava and leoni 2021 furthermore previous studies have only suggested that plastic gel aggregates enhance the vertical mobility of mps from the ocean surface to the deep floor our present data indicate an opposite action as mps can aggregate with gel particles e g eps or other biological secretions and be transported from the surface water to the air environment plastic gels can be transported into the atmosphere through convective updrafts further increasing long distance atmospheric transport air water interface such as surface microlayer covers almost three quarters of the earth s surface if mps can escape the ocean surface and become entrained through air sea exchange thus this is a transport pathway that warrants future study additionally the transport height of transferred droplets is also one of important factors in the estimation of the effectively air transferred microplastics into the atmosphere the further investigation is needed to explore the complex interactions among the heights and size distributions of the transferred droplets that potentially impact the transfer of mps in the water to air phase 4 conclusion this study highlights the effects of aquatic gels and water composition on mp transfer from water to the atmosphere via bubble bursting the probability of mp transfer was evaluated by simulating the bubble bursting phenomenon in a reactor and collecting the air transferred droplets mp transfer from the water column to the surface microlayer and then to the atmosphere was confirmed as possible through bubble bursting our data also provide the first evidence that plastic gel aggregates can act as a route for redistribution and scavenging of mps in the water column and their further ejection into the atmospheric phase via bubble bursting the transfer capacity of mps may depend on the composition of the water and on the viscosity and abundance of natural organic gels as well as the salinity cation bridging of the water as this facilitates plastic gel aggregation this work offers unique insights into the interaction of gels in determining mp fate and transport especially from the water surface layer air and provides a new route and the possible mechanism for the air water transfer of mps credit authorship

15624,the pervasiveness of microplastics mps in global oceans is raising concerns about their adverse impacts on ecosystems the mechanistic understanding of mp transport is critical for evaluating its fate flux and ecological risks specifically currently bubble bursting is believed to represent an important route for mp transfer from sea surfaces to the atmosphere however the detailed mechanisms of the complex physico chemical interactions between mps water composition and gel particles in the air sea interface remain unknown our results suggested three steps for mp transfer between air sea phases 1 mps incorporating into gel aggregates in the water column 2 further accumulation of plastic gel aggregate in the surface layer phase finally 3 ejection of aggregates from the sea when bubbles of trapped air rise to the surface and burst the water composition e g high salinity gel concentration and viscosity can modulate plastic gel aggregation and subsequent transport from water to the atmosphere the possible mechanism may be closely tied to the formation of plastic gel via cation linking bridges thereby enhancing plastic gel ejection into air collectively this work offers unique insights into the role of marine plastic gels in determining mp fate and transport especially at air sea interfaces the data also provide a better understanding of the corresponding mechanism that may explain the fates of missing plastics in the ocean graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics plastic gels surface layer atmospheric plastics bubble bursting data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the continued increase in microplastic mp pollution is viewed as a serious environmental issue of the anthropocene due to its adverse impacts on ecological systems and human health plasticseurope 2019 has recently reported that the annual production of plastic base materials in 2018 was around 350 million tons worldwide the global plastic production is expected to show continuous growth in the future geyer et al 2017 the low recycling rate and unregulated disposal of plastic wastes now means that approximately 10 of all produced plastics are inevitably released into marine environments each year geyer et al 2017 the release of this plastic litter into natural systems results in substantial accumulation in the ultimate environmental receptors such as oceans auta et al 2017 picó and barceló 2019 while being transported in aquatic environments plastic debris can gradually break down into smaller fragments including micro plastics mps size 5 mm in diameter and even nanoplastics nps size 1 μm due to mechanical fragmentation photo degradation chemical stress and biodegradation enfrin et al 2019 picó and barceló 2019 our previous data also indicated that small sized plastics cause high levels of cellular stress in marine phytoplankton cells and can alter the dynamics of marine organic matter shiu et al 2020a 2020b mps can also act as carrier vehicles for the transboundary and vertical transport of many hazardous materials in the ocean alimi et al 2018 thereby further disturbing ecological systems therefore an in depth understanding of the fate and transport of marine mps will help in estimating their total flux and ecological risks early survey studies have documented that mps occur extensively in human impacted locations including rivers harbors beaches and coastal oceans because water discharges from these areas were recognized as main sources of primary and secondary mps chen and chen 2020 enfrin et al 2019 lebreton et al 2017 shiu et al 2021 during the long term and transboundary transport mps are even present in remote areas such as deep sea sediments ultraoligotrophic seas polar seas and frozen ice cores alimi et al 2018 auta et al 2017 pico and barcelo et al 2019 many processes that can influence mp abundance transport and characterization have been well investigated but the global mass of measured marine mps in surface water is still much smaller than expected based on the loads of mismanaged plastics releasing into the marine systems sparking discussions regarding to missing plastics and final sinks erni cassola et al 2019 weiss et al 2021 however the available data does not seem to be a definitive answer for the missing plastics the development of atmospheric mp monitoring technology is now providing evidence of long distance atmospheric transport of mps to remote locations allen et al 2020 the survey data of mps from the beach air suggests the possibility of ocean to atmosphere transmission revealing a potential route for the disappearance of mps from oceans allen et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2020 the transport of substances such as sea salt organic material marine aerosols and microbial cells from the ocean surface into the atmosphere through convective updrafts has been well studied sharma et al 2012 sofiev et al 2011 orellana et al 2021 in natural phenomena micro sized droplets are spread from the sea when breaking waves cause trapped air bubbles to rise to the sea surface layer and subsequent burst erinin et al 2019 these primary droplets are generated due to bubble film bursting and water jet formed when the cavity of the air bubble collapse wang et al 2017 the void left by the bubble as it is gradually removed in the sea surface is replaced with water and this water collision process can cause the formation of larger micro sized droplets and secondary ejection richer and veron 2016 some of these micro and nano sized aerosol droplets return suddenly into the sea however the others can be expelled and suspended in the atmosphere and can be transported long distances by wind o dowd and de leeuw et al 2007 a concept similar to this global transport and ejection of marine materials may also operate for marine mps thereby forming a potential route for air sea exchange allen et al 2020 the air water transfer of mps by bubble bursting and raindrop ejection has also been evaluated in laboratory experiments lehmann et al 2021 masry et al 2021 recent data also have revealed that the water composition and mp characteristics may affect bubble sizes and bubble bursting thereby further altering transfer mps from the water phase to air masry et al 2021 however the detailed mechanisms of mp transport in the air sea interfaces by bubble bursting remain poorly understood the air sea interface and especially the surface microlayer is enriched in organic matter e g sticky natural organic gels or extracellular polymeric substances eps engel et al 2017 wurl et al 2017 a few previous studies have shown that micro and nano plastics can be incorporated into marine organic aggregates such as gels eps and phytoplankton aggregates chen et al 2011 2018 li et al 2019b michels et al 2018 shiu et al 2020a the aggregation of organic gels may also influence sea spray particle formation and accumulate mps in the air sea interfaces and subsequent transport allen et al 2020 masry et al 2021 orellana et al 2021 therefore in the present study we evaluate the enrichment factor for the transport of 1μm plastic polystyrene particles in sea spray and surface layers for various water compositions by simulating the bubble bursting phenomenon in a laboratory reactor sea salt and different viscosities of natural organic gels were added to investigate the interactions between mps inorganic salts and natural organic matter at the air sea interface the findings will advance our understanding of the fates of missing plastics in the ocean 2 methods 2 1 chemicals and sample preparation artificial seawater asw using the composition obtained from marine biological laboratory

al 2021 all the enrichment experiments were conducted in a glass cylinder height 257 mm inner diameter 32 mm filled with approximately 130 ml of the solution containing approximately 3 104 mp particles bubbles were formed in aqueous solution by the passage of high pressure air 2 kg cm 2 through microporous material particle free air was generated by a compressor dif bn30 united filtration systems inc with 99 9998 filtration efficiency removal of 0 01 micron particles a mass flow controller and meter rma 26 ssv dwyer instruments llc was used to adjust the pressure and flow rate of the air entering the reactor the airflow was approximately 0 85 and 1 0 l min 1 the bubble and droplet size distribution were monitored using a sony nex 5 camera and analyzed using imagej nih bethesda md the porosity of the sintered glass frit was used to produce a size range of bubbles below the hinze scale produced by waves breaking in natural systems sellegri et al 2006 robinson et al 2019 fig s1 images of the bubbles formed above the microporous material in the aqueous solution were recorded using full manual mode aperture f5 6 iso 12800 shutter speed 1 2000 s air transferred droplet images fig s2 at below 15 mm above the water surface were recorded using full manual mode aperture f5 6 iso 200 shutter speed 1 5 s 2 3 experimental design we used the bubble generator as a laboratory reactor to simulate the natural sea spray aerosol enrichment rather than generating bubbles by wave breaking the microbubbles were produced in situ by bubbles generated by the microporous material gas bubbles in the ocean may carry mps to the air sea interface where the bubbles burst and form a sea spray aerosol potentially enriched in mps the initial concentration of mps was 3 104 mp particles the experiment conducted in the present study consisted of adjusting various water compositions including three salinities 0 17 and 34 psu two gel concentrations 1 and 10 ppm and two viscosities low and medium viscosity of alginic acid sodium salts to evaluate the detailed mechanisms underlying the complex physico chemical interactions between the mps water composition and gel particles in the air sea phase the organic carbon concentrations of 1 and 10 ppm of alginic acid sodium salts were 0 18 0 04 and 2 17 0 06 mg c l respectively the addition of alginic acid sodium salts in this experiments is within the organic carbon range expected in the natural environment cao et al 2018 li et al 2019a shiu et al 2017 the range of ph value in the all experiments was 5 72 5 96 the mp transfer and accumulation in the air water phase was measured when the bubbles rose from the microporous material to the water surface and burst air transferred droplets with containing mp particles in the pilot tests we collected droplet samples at 3 mm and 30 mm to compare the enrichment factor ef of mps in air transferred droplets in the two heights the results showed that efs in the two heights are no obvious difference fig s3 the air transferred droplet collection at 3 mm can also avoid wind and air flow inferences and droplets can be collected as much as possible therefore in subsequent experiments we immediately collected the air transferred droplets atmospheric phase for 3 min using a glass slide placed approximately 3 mm above the water surface the mp accumulations in the surface layers were collected at 1 mm of the water depth a total of 10 μl 10 positions and 1 μl for each position was collected into pipettes the fixed volume 10 μl of collected droplets surface layer and water column were transferred to a hemocytometer and then a fluorescence microscopy axio scope a1 carl zeiss germany was used to count green fluorescent mps excitation 480 nm emission 520 nm the mp concentrations in air transferred droplets surface layer and water column were obtained from the counting results mp particle transfer was also verified by fluorescence microscopy in this study we used ef to evaluate mp particle transfer in the surface layer and air transferred droplets the ef expressed the degree of enrichment of the two phases including surface layer and air transferred droplets the enrichment can be explained by considering the affinity of the mps collected at the air water interface expressed as the ratio of the mp concentrations in the different phases such as water to surface layer and surface layer to air transferred droplets the ef is defined as follows 1 e n r i c h m e n t f a c t o r e f c a t m o o r s u r f a c e l a y e r c w a t e r o r s u r f a c e l a y e r where catmo or surface layer is the concentration of mps in the air transferred droplets or surface layer phase and cwater or surface layer is the mp concentration in the water or surface layer phase 2 4 statistical analysis the data are presented as means standard deviation sd statistically significant differences among the means of the number of mps and their enrichment factor were determined using student s t test analysis with p values of 0 05 the analyses were performed using microsoft office excel and graphpad prism 4 0 graphpad software inc san diego ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 mp transfer from water to the atmospheric phase the phenomenon of plastic particle transfer from a water column into an atmospheric phase via bubble bursting was investigated using a bubble generator to simulate the air water environments the image from fig s2 provides the evidence for the generation of the air transferred droplet formation via bubble bursting or jet ejection the aquatic conditions and especially the salinity and characteristics of various organic colloids determine the air water transfer of materials therefore the influence of environmental factors on mp enrichment between the air transferred droplet and water was also considered fig 2 a shows the number of mps in the air transferred droplet with aquatic gels low and median viscosities of alginic acid sodium salts and at three salinity levels 0 17 and 34 psu under the bubble bursting mps were detected in the collected air transferred droplets in all experiments and ranged in number from 2 4 104 to 5 3 106 in air transferred droplets the test conducted in the absence of sea salts 0 psu exhibited the lowest number of mps among all the experiments regardless of the presence or absence of alginic gels in the water interestingly the number of mps in air transferred droplets increased as the viscosity and gel concentrations increased in the water with higher salinity levels 17 and 34 psu we also used the ef value as a further reflection of the mp accumulation between water and the atmosphere the ef values were defined as the ratio of the mp concentrations in the air transferred droplet and its corresponding concentration in the water phase fig 2b shows that the efs in samples at 0 psu were essentially 1 indicating less enrichment phenomenon in the absence of salinity regardless of the water viscosity notably adjustment of the salinity to 17 psu caused a slight increase t test p 0 05 from approximately 1 5 to 5 5 in the efs following the addition of low and median viscosities of alginic gels lva and mva by contrast the ef values showed no significant changes in response to the different concentrations 1 ppm and 10 ppm of alginic gels t test p 0 05 further increases in the salinity to 34 psu increased the ef to 3 7 for samples without alginic gels w o va whereas the ef values obviously increased to 13 20 and 25 35 respectively in the presence of 1 ppm and 10 ppm of alginic gels t test p 0 05 the ef greatly increased with higher salinity for all aqueous suspensions with different gel contains in the order of 10 ppm mva 1 ppm mva 10 ppm lva 1 ppm lva w o va fig 2b this order clearly demonstrated a salinity and gel dependent trend suggesting that both the gel concentration and viscosity can significantly affect the mp mobility from water to air in high salinity environments e g seawater our data clearly indicate that mp transport in the water and ejection into the air beyond the air sea interface via bubble bursting may occur widely in both freshwater and sea water systems the phenomenon reported here is also similar to that reported in a recent controlled laboratory experiment by masry et al 2021 who showed that the addition of smaller plastics 1μm in ultrapure waters increases the size of airborne particles after bubble bursting they also found that a higher particle transfer rate in the presence of proxies of components e g sodium dodecyl sulfate of the sea surface microlayer the results demonstrated that microplastic size and organic matter may induce the probability of plastic transfer these observations confirm the ability of mps to transfer to the atmosphere via spray aerosol and may also explain why mps can be collected in the air sampled at extensive distances offshore allen et al 2020 trainic et al 2020 our data indicated that local water characteristics such as high salinity gel concentration and viscosity may regulate the partitioning and distribution of the mps that are transferred to the atmosphere 3 2 mp transfer stages the mp partitioning and distribution between the air transferred droplets surface layer and water column phases under the bubble bursting condition were further investigated to understand the possible transfer stages the mp distribution in water to surface layer and surface layer to air transferred droplets are presented as fig 3 the values of ef for the subsurface water to the surface layer exceeded 1 in all samples higher ef values were observed in samples with higher level of salts and alginic gels while samples at 0 psu exhibited lower ef values the data may indicate that mps can accumulate in the surface layer especially in water containing salts and organic gels the possible reason is mps from plastic gels could be transported by bubbles from the subsurface waters to the air water interfaces the mps would then be subsequently transported from the surface layers to the atmospheric phases by bubble bursting and ejection as the ef values for the surface layer to air transferred droplet increased with salinity and with increased gel concentration obviously the highest ef values 25 55 7 38 were observed for a salinity of 34 psu and a medium viscosity gel concentration of 10 ppm whereas the lowest ef value less than 1 was obtained in the absence of salts 0 psu this suggests that more cation linking sites from high salinity 34 psu increase gel plastic formation could promote mps transport from the surface layer to the air the ef of all air transferred droplets are smaller than surface layer ef 1 at 0 psu indicating that more mps are accumulated in surface layer and may not enter into the air phase this may illustrate that carrier materials such as marine colloids are highly involved in mp transport from the water to air some studies have noted the important role played by the surface layer in contaminant cycling high microbial activity produces sticky gels that can accumulate organic pollutants including persistent organic contaminants and mps huang et al 2020 song et al 2014 our results not only observed mp accumulation in the surface layer phase but also indicated that mp can be atmospherically entrained from bubble or jet expulsion in a similar manner to sea spray aerosols inorganic salts and transparent exopolymeric particles in our case bubbles may trap alginic acid and mps during bubbles rise through the water column and further accumulate at the surface layer and finally transport them to the atmosphere through the formation of aerosol droplets cunliffe et al 2013 link et al 2018 2019 in addition our data also showed that the transfer of mps occurs in two stages and that the transfer in the freshwater and sea water systems are distinguishable salinity level may act as a critical regulator for the probability of mp transfer from surface water to the atmosphere 3 3 possible mechanisms we investigated the underlying mechanisms of mp transport to the atmospheric phase by collecting spray droplets on glass slides and observing them by fluorescence microscopy as shown in fig 4 the micrographs provide visual evidence that 1 μm polystyrene microparticles green fluorescence tended to aggregate 20 30 μm and accumulate within the alginic gels low and medium viscosity of 10 ppm and with the salinity of 34 psu by contrast less aggregation or single particles 1 3 μm were found in the sample without alginic gels this is because the chain length molecular weight of alginic acid has the strong correlation with viscosity alginic acid with medium viscosity consists long chain of α ʟ guluronic acid and β ᴅ mannuronic acid can form the larger alginic gels relative to that with low viscosity draget et al 1994 the larger alginic gel binding more mps formed plastic gel aggregates and may increase abundance of mps in the spray aerosol cunliffe et al 2013 link et al 2018 2019 this observation supported the possibility of our hypothesis that the ocean atmosphere exchange of mps from wave action and bubble bursting or jet ejection may play an important role in the transport pathway the ejection and transport of mps may also occur similarly sea spray aerosols formed from dust salt and bacterial particles the images presented here are the first to provide credible evidence that marine plastic gels can serve as a route for scavenging and redistribution of mps in the water column and further ejection into the atmospheric phase via bubble bursting or jet ejection in fact our previous studies have shown that aquatic gel particles and colloids can scavenge pollutants including organic materials micro and nano plastics and other metals through aggregation processes chiu et al 2019 santschi et al 2021 shiu and lee 2017 shiu et al 2014 2018 further studies shiu et al 2020a 2020b clearly indicated that colloids and phytoplankton cells can act as tackiness agents to hold mp particles together within larger aggregates to form marine plastic snow our present data indicated that mps can incorporate with aquatic gels and be transported from the surface water to the air via bubble burst marine plastic gel ejection is considered to have an active role in the air water transfer process of mps the detail pathway can be separate three steps 1 plastic gel aggregate formation in the water column 2 accumulation of plastic gel aggregate in the surface layer water to surface layer 3 transportation of plastic gel aggregate from the surface layer to the air surface layer to air according to recent research the two controlling factors for aquatic microgel formation are cation bridging which possibly explain the higher capacity for mp transfer to air under conditions of high salinity and high gel concentration viscosity as our case the highest ef values occurred mainly in the cation rich salt water salinity with 34 psu and in the presence of a high abundance of gels fig 3 the higher concentrations of gels contributed more microgel precursors to facilitate plastic gel aggregate formation high salinity conditions 17 and 34 psu contain multivalent cations such as ca2 that can provide cross linking capacities to coordinate the guluronic acid sites of alginic acid to form a stable microgel structures urbanova et al 2019 by contrast less microgel aggregates form in samples without sea salt 0 psu possibly due to the lack of cross linking bridges through cations in order to examine the formation of plastic gel via cation linking bridges ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta a chelator for metal ions was added to water samples edta can effectively eliminate ca2 crosslinking in the aquatic gel and colloid assembly has been confirmed chin et al 1998 shiu et al 2020b as shown in fig 5 the addition of 10 mm of edta to sample caused the chelation of ca2 and other cationic ions which significantly decreased ef and the ef was close to the sample with 0 psu this is consistent with previous data that the addition of edta to the fresh and sea water caused the chelation of cations which inhibited biopolymer assembly chin et al 1998 shiu et al 2020b indicating the role of cross linking bridges in the aggregation of aquatic gels the results supported our hypothesis that the involvement of ca2 crosslinking domains in the plastic gel formation in addition to cation bridging force involved in plastic gel aggregation other aquatic gels with high viscosity may act as tackiness agents to accelerate adsorption on mp surfaces and aggregate formation santschi et al 2020 2021 shiu et al 2020a leading to higher transport rates and enhanced mp exchange between water and air phases furthermore the effect of bubble bursting intensity on particle transfer was also examined by altering the flow rate of the air entering the reactor to produce two different intensities of bubble bursting and ejection the size range of the bubbles produced by bubble bursting was below the hinze scale under two different flow rates fig s4a corresponding to the particle size of natural sea spray aerosols sellegri et al 2006 robinson et al 2019 the ef significantly increased at the high flow rate 1 0 l min 1 compared to the low flow rate 0 85 l min 1 under all environmental conditions fig 6 notably this increase in ef also occurred in fresh water salinity with 0 psu where the ef value increased from approximately 1 to 20 indicating that strong bubble bursting or waves can be one of the active forces that favors the accumulation and transport of mps from the water to air phases regardless of the presence of salts or gels the stronger force from the higher flow rate could support the ejection of the droplets with some extent weight of particles thereby increasing the probability of particle transfer the higher flow rate also tended to produce a greater number of bubbles fig s4b and multiple jet drops this is probably because that bubbles induced gel aggregate formation by contributing more interfaces for aggregation and this could induce plastic gel particle formation and subsequent ejection jenkinson et al 2021 wada et al 2020 3 4 environmental implications despite a globally acknowledged mp challenges scientists have discovered the expected increases in marine plastics in sea surfaces geyer et al 2017 but current data haven t been able to explain why the mass balance of releasing versus measured marine mps in the surface ocean is lower than model expected sparking discussions regarding to missing plastics and final sinks weiss et al 2021 this study firstly provides a new route for transport of mps in air water systems especially in marine plastic gel particles promoting the probability of plastic transfer the data demonstrated that mp transport may be similar with sea spray aerosol inorganic salts and organic matter briefly mp in water systems can be trapped and further accumulated by bubbles from the water column to surface layer then subsequently transported to atmospheric phases via the bubble bursting and ejection aquatic ca2 crosslinking and other hydrophobic polymers aggregated with plastics forming plastic gels and further jet ejection through bubble bursting can significantly enhance mp exchange efficiency additionally the impact of gel aggregates on the marine ecosystem could be vast for example these gel particles participate in various biogeochemical reactions such as pollutant mobility carbon sequestration and food webs verdugo et al 2012 among these gels provide concentrated hot spots of bioavailable nutrients and substrates for organisms at the bottom of aquatic food web so aggregates containing mps or other pollutant may cause ecological risks nava and leoni 2021 furthermore previous studies have only suggested that plastic gel aggregates enhance the vertical mobility of mps from the ocean surface to the deep floor our present data indicate an opposite action as mps can aggregate with gel particles e g eps or other biological secretions and be transported from the surface water to the air environment plastic gels can be transported into the atmosphere through convective updrafts further increasing long distance atmospheric transport air water interface such as surface microlayer covers almost three quarters of the earth s surface if mps can escape the ocean surface and become entrained through air sea exchange thus this is a transport pathway that warrants future study additionally the transport height of transferred droplets is also one of important factors in the estimation of the effectively air transferred microplastics into the atmosphere the further investigation is needed to explore the complex interactions among the heights and size distributions of the transferred droplets that potentially impact the transfer of mps in the water to air phase 4 conclusion this study highlights the effects of aquatic gels and water composition on mp transfer from water to the atmosphere via bubble bursting the probability of mp transfer was evaluated by simulating the bubble bursting phenomenon in a reactor and collecting the air transferred droplets mp transfer from the water column to the surface microlayer and then to the atmosphere was confirmed as possible through bubble bursting our data also provide the first evidence that plastic gel aggregates can act as a route for redistribution and scavenging of mps in the water column and their further ejection into the atmospheric phase via bubble bursting the transfer capacity of mps may depend on the composition of the water and on the viscosity and abundance of natural organic gels as well as the salinity cation bridging of the water as this facilitates plastic gel aggregation this work offers unique insights into the interaction of gels in determining mp fate and transport especially from the water surface layer air and provides a new route and the possible mechanism for the air water transfer of mps credit authorship
