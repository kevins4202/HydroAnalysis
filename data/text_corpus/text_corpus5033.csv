25165,the prevailing method for estimating the potential impact of future climate change on biological communities is to stack binary predictions from species distribution models binary stacked species distribution models bs sdm however it has been argued that bs sdm may overestimate species richness and hence community composition alternative approaches such as sesam spatially explicit species assemblage modelling explicitly incorporate limits to species richness preventing overestimation we compared richness and taxonomic composition estimates as predicted by sesam and bs sdm for mediterranean bird communities both in the present day and as projected in the future under simulated climate change scenarios we trained single species distribution models s sdm and direct macroecological richness models mem for 81 bird species using climate topographic land use and human pressure indicators as predictors then we compared and evaluated the models predictions species richness as predicted by bs sdm was more accurate than under sesam for present day communities taxonomic composition was well predicted under both methods however we detected significant differences in future projections under bs sdm increased suitable area for a number of species leads to important changes in community composition and predicts higher levels of diversity in the future in stark contrast sesam predicts lower species richness in the future and strong homogenization of bird communities across space this study shows how the choice of the modelling approach drives substantially different expectations about future community composition under climate change we therefore recommend contrasting predictions generated under different modelling approaches to gain better understanding of possible future scenario of biodiversity change in addition trasferability tests i e hindcasting to past or predicting from the past to the present should be used to effectively

history abundance distribution and survival of a wide array of organisms knudsen et al 2011 maiorano et al 2011 parmesan 2006 schaefer et al 2008 species inability to respond to changing environmental conditions may result in declining population numbers and eventually extinction parmesan 2006 alternatively species may track their most favourable habitats maggini et al 2011 raia et al 2012 schaefer et al 2008 or even evolve new ad hoc adaptations bradshaw and holzapfel 2006 at the community level habitat tracking and local extinctions are predicted to increase species turnover schaefer et al 2008 and to alter ecosystem functioning barry et al 1995 until now the prevailing method to assess the potential impact of climate change on community composition has been using binary stacked species distribution models bs sdm under bs sdm binary predictions derived from sdm trained under current conditions and projected to the future ferrier and guisan 2006 guisan and thuiller 2005 can be stacked to predict present and future species richness and assess changes over time a common problem with bs sdm is the overprediction of species richness which may hamper accurate composition estimates in present day communities dubuis et al 2011 guisan and rahbek 2011 hortal et al 2012 calabrese et al 2014 cord et al 2014 d amen et al 2015a but see mateo et al 2012 d amen et al 2015b however recent papers also provided examples where predictions of single species distribution s sdm yielded accurate estimations of species richness and composition suggesting that richness overprediction by bs sdm may not necessarily be expected mateo et al 2012 d amen et al 2015b in particular it has been argued that both the identity and number of species in a local assemblage tend to be more accurately predicted by bs sdm in stressful i e non productive habitats pellissier et al 2012 pottier et al 2013 and where climate is the main determinant of species distribution and richness mateo et al 2012 similarly the inclusion of predictors serving as proxies for resource availability helps reducing the problem of richness overestimation d amen et al 2017a 2015b however little is known about whether richness overprediction might affect future s sdm projections of community composition a number of alternatives or improvements to bs sdm have been proposed in the scientific literature d amen et al 2017b fernandes et al 2013 laughlin et al 2012 mokany et al 2012 among them sesam spatially explicit species assemblage modelling guisan and rahbek 2011 proved especially accurate d amen et al 2017a 2015a sesam couples sdm to macroecological constraints and assembly rules d amen et al 2017a 2015b 2015a this is meant to fix the problem that the simple stacking of individual species predictions ignores the effects of species interactions on local richness ferrier and guisan 2006 gleason 1939 such as competitive exclusion and niche preemption callaway 1997 under sesam independent limits are imposed to local species richness so that more realistic scenarios for community assemblage could theoretically emerge guisan and rahbek 2011 but see mateo et al 2017 herein we explored the performance of bs sdm and sesam in predicting community composition under both current and future climatic conditions for bird communities in southern italy specifically we hypothesized that i sesam would predict present day community properties more accurately than bs sdm ii bs sdm and sesam would provide different predictions of community richness and composition under climate change iii sesam would predict a more ecologically plausible response by communities to climate change than bs sdm 2 material and methods our analytical framework starts by applying bs sdm and sesam to bird communities within a geographically restricted but environmentally highly heterogeneous area representative of the typical mediterranean habitats fig 1 we proceeded by calibrating and stacking s sdm to build bs sdm community richness and composition since the study area covers just a small portion of the analysed species global ranges s sdm were fitted using a hierarchical structure integrating global and regional scales di febbraro et al 2015 smeraldo et al 2017 in order to avoid truncated response curves and associated truncated niche that could bias the predictions especially when models are projected in space and time barbet massin et al 2010 guisan et al 2017 raes 2012 accordingly a first set of models was fitted with data on the global species range global sdm and global bioclimatic variables then regional models were fitted with regional data and predictors and information from the global models were used to refine these predictions gallien et al 2012 the sesam framework was then based on these regional models and included the following steps guisan and rahbek 2011 fig 1 step 1 selecting the pool of species to build the community i e the species source pool step 2 calibrating and stacking s sdm i e selecting the abiotic habitat species pool step 3 using species richness predictions as constraint on the community i e setting macroecological constraints step 4 applying ecological assembly rules i e biotic filtering in particular we calculated macroecological constraints in step 3 both by summing the rough occurrence probabilities considering five decimal places obtained from the single species distribution ps sdm dubuis et al 2011 and by fitting macroecological models mem vincent and haworth 1983 see also dubuis et al 2011 consequently we derived two alternative implementations of sesam considering richness predictions either by mem sesam mem or by ps sdm sesam prob fig 1 subsequently the evaluation scores of sesam mem and sesam prob were compared with those obtained from the application of the bs sdm approach finally after projecting s sdm and mem under two different climate change scenarios a2 and b1 ipcc 2007 fig 1 for 2070 we compared the outcomes of the three implemented modelling approaches i e sesam mem sesam prob and bs sdm 2 1 bs sdm implementation we selected bird communities from southern italy over a surface area extending from the tyrrhenian to the adriatic seas at altitudes varying from the sea level to 1900 m a s l fig s1 the area is largely covered by agricultural mosaics and encompasses a great variety of other habitat types from coastal wetlands to mountain forests the species dataset includes presence observation derived from field surveys within the italian breeding bird monitoring programme mito2000 project fornasari et al 2002 chiatante and meriggi 2016 stephens et al 2016 chiatante 2017 see appendix s1 for details from the initial dataset which includes 134 species we discarded all species with less than 15 occurrences the final dataset includes 81 species table s1 occurring throughout 1010 cells since the study area largely occurs within the historical ranges of all species without any evidence of dispersal limitation we considered these species to form an unique species source pool see also d amen et al 2015b 2015a and guisan and rahbek 2011 the selection of species source pool represented a common step to both bs sdm and sesam approaches fig 1 for global sdm calibration we initially considered the 19 worldclim predictors at a spatial resolution of 2 5 arc minutes ca 5 km hijmans et al 2005 table 1 appendix s1 as for regional sdm the initial set of covariates included the 19 worldclim predictors five topographic variables in combination with a coarse habitat classification 11 classes and a human pressure index see table 1 and appendix s1 for further details all rasterized at a resolution of 1 km for both regional sdm and mem we assessed the effect of model extrapolation on the values of predictor variables lying outside the training range by calculating the multivariate environmental similarity surface mess appendix s3 following elith et al 2010 to avoid model overfitting and allow species with small sample size to be modelled regional sdm were trained by ensembling small sub models esm breiner et al 2015 lomba et al 2010 di febbraro et al 2017 based on reduced subsets of the initial predictors appendix s1 bs sdm obtained in this step were then used to build current and future community predictions see fig 1 and appendix s1 calibration and stacking of s sdm is a common step to both bs sdm and sesam approaches in the latter stacked species distributions were additionally constrained by the macroecological richness predictions and ecologically assembly rules were applied fig 1 all models global and regional were evaluated by randomly splitting occurrence datasets into a 70 sample for models calibration and a remaining 30 to evaluate model predictive performance repeating the procedure 10 times and averaging the results the predictive performance of each model was assessed by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc hanley and mcneil 1982 and the maximized true skill statistic maxtss allouche et al 2006 2 2 sesam implementation both bs sdm and sesam imply selecting a pool of species and fitting stacking single species distributions which were outlined in the previous sections here we will describe the remaining steps i e setting macroecological constraints and applying ecological assembly rules 2 2 1 setting macroecological constraints under sesam macroecological constraints are set to limit species richness in the s sdm as specified above we calculated species richness by ps sdm and mem mem takes the number of species occurring at each cell observed richness as the response variable and relate it statistically to the regional predictors see table 1 we used zero inflated poisson regressions to account for the excess of zeroes in the dataset 26 lambert 1992 and implemented a variable selection procedure to select predictors appendix s2 the accuracy of the models was evaluated with a 10 fold cross validation procedure with two metrics the spearman rank correlation coefficient and the mean absolute error mae steinmann et al 2009 dubuis et al 2011 d amen et al 2017a 2017b the 10 resulting richness predictions were averaged and used to produce local species richness constraints such constraints were estimated under present day conditions and projected to the year 2070 under ipcc s a2 and b1 climate change scenarios ipcc 2007 2 2 2 accounting for ecological assembly rules where species richness is overestimated the excess number of species has to be deleted in order to fit to the macroecological constraint to do so we used alternatively mem or ps sdm richness estimates fig 1 as the constraint at each cell we ranked individual species according to their occurrence probability predicted by s sdm from highest to lowest we then retained those species with highest probabilities until the number of species predicted by mem or ps sdm was reached and discarded the excess specices probability ranking rule d amen et al 2015a d amen et al 2017a b 2 3 evaluating bs sdm and sesam predictive accuracy performances of bs sdm and sesam approaches to predict current distributions were assessed by calculating three different evaluation metrics richness deviation prediction success and sørensen similarity index in composition between predicted and observed communities richness deviation metric indicates the difference between predicted and observed species richness prediction success quantifies the proportion of species correctly predicted as present or absent the sørensen similarity index describes the compositional similarity between observed and predicted communities values closer to zero for the former and closer to one for the latter two indicate high predictive accuracy d amen et al 2015a pottier et al 2013 2 4 effects of climate change on the predicted communities to allow a comprehensive evaluation of prediction differences under climate change we measured changes in species distribution extent and shift and community structure species richness and diversity specifically we considered changes in five community dimensions i total number of species predicted in the study area ii extent and shift of future species distribution iii species richness at the level of individual cells iv differences in species composition and v γ diversity i e within landscape diversity the total number of species predicted in the area was calculated by grouping the species according to their degree of rarity in the area we created four rarity classes according to the percentage of the total area where the species were predicted to occur i e 0 5 5 25 25 50 and 50 for each species the extent of the predicted distribution in 2070 was expressed as the percentage of the present day distribution whereas shift was expressed as the percentage of overlap with the current predicted distribution huntley et al 2008 in addition we compared the differences in extent and shifts of predicted future distributions between resident and migratory species since an altered balance between residents and migrators has been observed as one of the most evident effects of climate change on birds lemoine et al 2007 van turnhout et al 2010 we calculated this phenological metric in order to assess the ecological plausibility of our future predictions in comparison to independent well documented patterns and expert based expectation the sørensen dissimilarity index i e 1 sørensen similarity index see above was used to quantify the differences in species taxonomic composition at cell level between the current and future 2070 communities the values of the index were split into positive and negative components depending on the alterations in the composition of the 2070 communities deriving from an increase or a decrease in the species richness at the cell level finally we calculated the sørensen dissimilarity index between cells pairs taken from current and 2070 predictions separately to quantify the γ diversity for current and future predicted communities see appendix s4 for further details 3 results 3 1 species distribution models both global and regional sdm reached good predictive performances overall sensu landis and koch 1977 swets 1988 auc for the global sdm ranged between 0 913 and 0 998 with a mean value of 0 954 sd 0 024 whereas maxtss ranged between 0 642 and 0 966 with a mean value of 0 793 sd 0 083 auc values for the regional sdm ranged between 0 838 and 0 998 with a mean of 0 940 sd 0 043 whereas maxtss values ranged between 0 557 and 0 993 with a mean of 0 782 sd 0 125 3 2 species richness accuracy species richness predicted by bs sdm was correlated with the observed richness with a spearman ρ 0 731 fig 2 a the regression line through the scatter plot adjusted r2 0 567 showed an intercept of 7 532 p 0 01 and a slope of 0 770 p 0 01 suggesting that observed species richness was sligthly overestimated although this pattern becomes negligible for the species richest sites in addition a positive prediction bias was observed with a mean richness deviation of 5 164 and a mae of 5 372 the species richness predictions calculated with mem achieved a much lower correlation with the observed richness with a mean spearman ρ 0 420 sd 0 050 resulting from the cross validation replicates fig 2b sites with the lowest observed species richness showed moderate levels of overprediction whereas plots with an observed richness 10 appeared to be markedly underestimated the patterns of both overprediction and underprediction of the observed species richness showed by mem were confirmed by the regression line through the scatter plot adjusted r2 0 131 which had an intercept of 9 775 p 0 01 and a slope of 0 055 p 0 05 in addition a negligible prediction bias mean deviation 0 012 mae 4 828 was observed the richness predictions obtained by ps sdm were better correlated with the observed richness with a spearman ρ 0 700 fig 2c however the regression line drawn through the scatter plot had an intercept of 18 584 p 0 01 and a slope of 0 307 p 0 01 thus showing a stronger overprediction of the observed species richness than with bs sdm in addition species richest and species poorest sites were shown to be markedly under and over underestimated respectively although less than for mem a positive prediction bias was observed with a mean richness deviation of 11 406 and a mae of 11 632 spatial predictions of current species richness by bs sdm mem and ps sdm are shown in fig s2 3 3 species composition accuracy the species composition predicted by both bs sdm and sesam implementations showed a fair to good predictive accuracy fig 2e f the application of sesam did not significantly improve wilcoxon test α 0 05 the predictions obtained by the simple bs sdm according to the prediction success index fig 2e the lowest score was obtained by sesam prob which had a prediction success index 0 9 less accurate than bs sdm in predicting species richness fig 2e this pattern was even more evident when considering the sørensen similarity scores which showed that both sesam mem and sesam prob generated predictions of significantly lower accuracy wilcoxon test α 0 05 than bs sdm fig 2f as bs sdm and sesam mem had the highest predictive accuracy we hereafter only show predictions generated with these two approaches for sesam prob see results in fig s3 s4 3 4 effects of climate change on the predicted communities spatial predictions of future species richness by bs sdm mem and ps sdm are shown in fig s2 remarkable differences were observed in the number of species predicted in the study area by bs sdm and sesam mem while this parameter was predicted by bs sdm to remain constant between the current time and 2070 regardless of the climate change scenarios fig 3 a it showed a strong decrease in 2070 according to sesam mem with a loss of more than 20 species fig 3f different outcomes of bs sdm and sesam mem were observed in the predicted extent and shift of the species distributions in 2070 indeed bs sdm predicted a decrease in extent of less than 26 and 23 of the species under a2 and b1 scenarios respectively fig 3b c with a preponderance of resident species fig 3d only few species 15 mainly to be found among the less common and the rarest were predicted to shift their distribution more than 50 under both scenarios fig 3b c with a more pronounced effect on migrators fig 3e on the contrary sesam mem predicted 79 and 75 of the species to reduce their 2070 predicted distribution under a2 and b1 scenarios respectively with a 30 completely losing their suitable areas under both scenarios fig 3g h moreover sesam mem outcomes showed a full range displacement for at least 30 and 35 of the species under a2 and b1 scenarios respectively all represented by the less common and rarest migratory species fig 3g h and i l predictions by bs sdm and sesam mem showed diverging patterns of predicted species richness per cell it would increase in 2070 according to the bs sdm outcomes fig 4 a b whereas such effect was less evident in the communities predicted by sesam mem fig 4c d the predictions of both bs sdm and sesam mem showed relevant alterations in species composition within cell regardless of the scenarios indeed the communities predicted by bs sdm exhibited a change in species composition of approximately 60 due to both increase and decrease of species richness in different cells fig 4a b such trend proved even stronger in the communities predicted by sesam mem which showed a change in their species composition of ca 70 due to increase and 80 due to decrease of species richness under all the scenarios fig 4c d finally climate change is predicted to have negligible effect on γ diversity by bs sdm fig 4a b whereas γ diversity was predicted to decrease in 2070 according to sesam mem regardless of the climate change scenarios fig 4c d 4 discussion 4 1 community level predictions at current time our results showed that both bs sdm and sesam approaches can predict species richness and composition of bird communities with overall fair to good accuracy under current climatic conditions the binarized bs sdm predictions showed better overall correlation with observed richness than ps sdm and mem predictions along the whole richness gradient fig 2 predicting much better the low and high species richness values in particular for mem it confirms previous findings suggesting that mem is not the most appropriate method to predict extreme low or high richness values algar et al 2009 dubuis et al 2011 newbold et al 2009 the not so strong relationship between observed richness and values predicted by mem has been noted elsewhere algar et al 2009 dubuis et al 2011 guisan and theurillat 2000 thuiller et al 2006 and is particularly marked here it can be linked to the fact that mem by modelling the mean is not well designed to capture strong richness variation around this mean furthermore producing an optimal macroecological constraint across a heavily anthropogenized study area like ours might be objectively difficult this should be considered with care when using mem within a sesam framework it is also noteworthy that bs sdm provided more accurate richness predictions than ps sdm prediction errors under bs sdm remarkably decreased in sites with high observed richness resulting in a nearly negligible underestimation of the species richest sites a trend opposite to the findings in algar et al 2009 and calabrese et al 2014 the latter suggested that the systematic richness overestimation reported for bs sdm is due to the binarization thresholding scheme largely adopted so far for stacking sdm outputs as e g used in barbet massin et al 2010 dubuis et al 2011 here however we observed the opposite pattern using a threshold reduced the overprediction compared to ps sdm leading bs sdm to perform better overall in particular the thresholding method used here accounts for differences in prevalence among species liu et al 2005 in our case the vast majority of species were characterized by low prevalences i e 0 110 0 017 leading to overall high threshold values fig s5 such result appeared coherent with the evidence in mateo et al 2012 which highlighted how choosing a thresholding method able to control for overprediction coupled with highly performing single species sdm ensembles may yield accurate richness predictions by bs sdm this interpretation is also in accordance with d amen et al 2015b who tested a number of thresholding methods to binarize the single species sdm ensembles and reported that bs sdm derived from highly accurate sdm are able to correctly predict species richness for insect species but not for plants see d amen et al 2015a irrespectively of most of the thresholding schemes applied therefore the taxonomic group and the number of species being modelled could also matter overall good predictions of community composition were obtained through both bs sdm and sesam implemented with the mem richness prediction in the current conditions in particular the bs sdm prediction was the best according to the sørensen index the implementation of sesam coupled with the ps sdm prediction had the lowest performance likely due to the higher richness overprediction in ps sdm the decrease in compositional accuracy due to richness overprediction has been described to date only for bs sdm predictions d amen et al 2015a dubuis et al 2011 while our results support the idea that the same may apply under alternative approaches 4 2 predicted effects of climate change on the communities overall bs sdm predicted less severe impacts of climate change on the analysed communities in 2070 than sesam mem under bs sdm the bird species and especially migrators showed a tendency to increase and moderately shift their distribution ranges in 2070 while none of the species was predicted to lose suitable range altogether this result agrees with studies suggesting european birds will extend their distribution towards the north following climate change huntley et al 2006 maggini et al 2011 although a predominant increase in the future distribution of migratory species was not consistently supported in the literature angert et al 2011 knudsen et al 2011 lemoine et al 2007 tingley et al 2012 van turnhout et al 2010 if true this widening of future species distributions predicted by bs sdm will lead to increased average species richness per cell in 2070 in addition these range modifications might lead to strong alteration of community composition at local scale and to the formation of assemblages without present day analogues böhning gaese and lemoine 2004 knudsen et al 2011 the change in community composition predicted by sesam offers a very different scenario from bs sdm in 2070 in particular sesam mem predicted that the rarest migratory species will undergo more severe climate driven distributional changes than resident species thus substantially contradicting bs sdm results similar expectations derive by taking into account the nature of interspecific interactions between migrators and residents knudsen et al 2011 predation risk bretagnolle and gillis 2010 niehaus and ydenberg 2006 and parasitism douglas et al 2010 möller et al 2011 in addition the substantial de structuration of current communities and the reduction in within landscape diversity predicted by sesam mem agrees with expert based expectations in particular mild winters are expected to decrease the proportion of migrants and increase the survival of residents resulting in the former experiencing increased competition for resources upon arrival lemoine and böhning gaese 2003 schaefer et al 2008 and ensuing population decline knudsen et al 2011 o connor 1990 such climate change induced dynamics are said to cause severe alterations in species composition ultimately leading to taxonomic homogenization at the local scale böhning gaese and lemoine 2004 cassey et al 2007 diffenbaugh et al 2007 morelli et al 2016 it was shown that modelling approaches taking biotic interactions into account tend to give higher extinction risk estimates than predictions based on models fitted with environmental predictors alone araújo and luoto 2007 hein et al 2012 hof et al 2012 sesam mem seems to be consistent with this general tendency future projections could further be improved by considering potential changes in land use although the relevance of land use change for mediterranean birds has already been documented moreira and russo 2007 seoane et al 2006 sirami et al 2008 its interaction with climate change deserves further investigation sirami et al 2017 and there is a substantial lack of high resolution long term land use change scenarios for southern italy still our approach was not able to consider possible local extinctions since we considered as extinct in the area only those species predicted to entirely lose their suitable habitats the number of local extinctions could have been underestimated allen et al 2001 brito and grelle 2006 lastly we did not consider possible colonizers from adjacent regions or from other continents i e invasive species which could immigrate into the study area tracking the climate change thus further altering the considered bird community barbet massin et al 2010 schaefer et al 2008 5 conclusion if prediction accuracy under current climatic conditions is the goal the traditional simpler widely used bs sdm approach proved at least as accurate as sesam in predicting species richness and composition of bird communities in southern italy however bs sdm and sesam mem delivered significantly distinc predictions under the 2070 scenario by considering environmental factors alone bs sdm the present day range of most species would increase in size and expand northwards keeping local species diversity high on the contrary under sesam the inclusion of macroecological constraints and assembly rules leads to the alteration of the natural balance between migratory and resident species biotic homogeneization and a severe impact of climate change on species diversity considering expert based predictions as true and admitting current observations on bird community change will hold true in the future sesam provided more realistic effects of climate change on the structure of bird communities such as the higher sensitivity of migratory birds compared to residents and the substantial homogenization of community structure böhning gaese and lemoine 2004 cassey et al 2007 diffenbaugh et al 2007 gilman et al 2010 morelli et al 2016 accurate predictions under climate change are challenging because they are sensitive to major uncertainties like the chance that species will track their suitable habitat at the same pace as the climate change or will adapt to new biotic interactions as well as unpredictable effects coming by the interplay of multiple global change drivers i e land use change such uncertainties hamper our understanding of how species will react to non analogous future environmental conditions whereby the drivers of change climate change land use change pollution etc will likely accelerate to levels which species and biological communities have never experienced in the last centuries that said our results further question the ability to predict community evolution under climate change and highlight the need for further investigations on community modelling to more comprehensively describe and quantify the complexity of drivers that interact together in determining the modifications of future communities this study highlights the importance of appropriate selection of the modelling approaches and critical evaluation of the underlying assumptions in predicting future scenarios of community evolution under climate change starting from these outcomes new future perspectives can be opened as e g testing for the validity of macroecological constraints when modelling bird assemblages or accounting for birds interactions to define assembly rules in addition trasferability tests i e hindcasting to past or predicting from the past to the present as similarly done in e g araújo et al 2005 could be used to comprehensively compare s sdm and sesam predictive abilities author contributions mdf ag and mda designed the study

25165,the prevailing method for estimating the potential impact of future climate change on biological communities is to stack binary predictions from species distribution models binary stacked species distribution models bs sdm however it has been argued that bs sdm may overestimate species richness and hence community composition alternative approaches such as sesam spatially explicit species assemblage modelling explicitly incorporate limits to species richness preventing overestimation we compared richness and taxonomic composition estimates as predicted by sesam and bs sdm for mediterranean bird communities both in the present day and as projected in the future under simulated climate change scenarios we trained single species distribution models s sdm and direct macroecological richness models mem for 81 bird species using climate topographic land use and human pressure indicators as predictors then we compared and evaluated the models predictions species richness as predicted by bs sdm was more accurate than under sesam for present day communities taxonomic composition was well predicted under both methods however we detected significant differences in future projections under bs sdm increased suitable area for a number of species leads to important changes in community composition and predicts higher levels of diversity in the future in stark contrast sesam predicts lower species richness in the future and strong homogenization of bird communities across space this study shows how the choice of the modelling approach drives substantially different expectations about future community composition under climate change we therefore recommend contrasting predictions generated under different modelling approaches to gain better understanding of possible future scenario of biodiversity change in addition trasferability tests i e hindcasting to past or predicting from the past to the present should be used to effectively

history abundance distribution and survival of a wide array of organisms knudsen et al 2011 maiorano et al 2011 parmesan 2006 schaefer et al 2008 species inability to respond to changing environmental conditions may result in declining population numbers and eventually extinction parmesan 2006 alternatively species may track their most favourable habitats maggini et al 2011 raia et al 2012 schaefer et al 2008 or even evolve new ad hoc adaptations bradshaw and holzapfel 2006 at the community level habitat tracking and local extinctions are predicted to increase species turnover schaefer et al 2008 and to alter ecosystem functioning barry et al 1995 until now the prevailing method to assess the potential impact of climate change on community composition has been using binary stacked species distribution models bs sdm under bs sdm binary predictions derived from sdm trained under current conditions and projected to the future ferrier and guisan 2006 guisan and thuiller 2005 can be stacked to predict present and future species richness and assess changes over time a common problem with bs sdm is the overprediction of species richness which may hamper accurate composition estimates in present day communities dubuis et al 2011 guisan and rahbek 2011 hortal et al 2012 calabrese et al 2014 cord et al 2014 d amen et al 2015a but see mateo et al 2012 d amen et al 2015b however recent papers also provided examples where predictions of single species distribution s sdm yielded accurate estimations of species richness and composition suggesting that richness overprediction by bs sdm may not necessarily be expected mateo et al 2012 d amen et al 2015b in particular it has been argued that both the identity and number of species in a local assemblage tend to be more accurately predicted by bs sdm in stressful i e non productive habitats pellissier et al 2012 pottier et al 2013 and where climate is the main determinant of species distribution and richness mateo et al 2012 similarly the inclusion of predictors serving as proxies for resource availability helps reducing the problem of richness overestimation d amen et al 2017a 2015b however little is known about whether richness overprediction might affect future s sdm projections of community composition a number of alternatives or improvements to bs sdm have been proposed in the scientific literature d amen et al 2017b fernandes et al 2013 laughlin et al 2012 mokany et al 2012 among them sesam spatially explicit species assemblage modelling guisan and rahbek 2011 proved especially accurate d amen et al 2017a 2015a sesam couples sdm to macroecological constraints and assembly rules d amen et al 2017a 2015b 2015a this is meant to fix the problem that the simple stacking of individual species predictions ignores the effects of species interactions on local richness ferrier and guisan 2006 gleason 1939 such as competitive exclusion and niche preemption callaway 1997 under sesam independent limits are imposed to local species richness so that more realistic scenarios for community assemblage could theoretically emerge guisan and rahbek 2011 but see mateo et al 2017 herein we explored the performance of bs sdm and sesam in predicting community composition under both current and future climatic conditions for bird communities in southern italy specifically we hypothesized that i sesam would predict present day community properties more accurately than bs sdm ii bs sdm and sesam would provide different predictions of community richness and composition under climate change iii sesam would predict a more ecologically plausible response by communities to climate change than bs sdm 2 material and methods our analytical framework starts by applying bs sdm and sesam to bird communities within a geographically restricted but environmentally highly heterogeneous area representative of the typical mediterranean habitats fig 1 we proceeded by calibrating and stacking s sdm to build bs sdm community richness and composition since the study area covers just a small portion of the analysed species global ranges s sdm were fitted using a hierarchical structure integrating global and regional scales di febbraro et al 2015 smeraldo et al 2017 in order to avoid truncated response curves and associated truncated niche that could bias the predictions especially when models are projected in space and time barbet massin et al 2010 guisan et al 2017 raes 2012 accordingly a first set of models was fitted with data on the global species range global sdm and global bioclimatic variables then regional models were fitted with regional data and predictors and information from the global models were used to refine these predictions gallien et al 2012 the sesam framework was then based on these regional models and included the following steps guisan and rahbek 2011 fig 1 step 1 selecting the pool of species to build the community i e the species source pool step 2 calibrating and stacking s sdm i e selecting the abiotic habitat species pool step 3 using species richness predictions as constraint on the community i e setting macroecological constraints step 4 applying ecological assembly rules i e biotic filtering in particular we calculated macroecological constraints in step 3 both by summing the rough occurrence probabilities considering five decimal places obtained from the single species distribution ps sdm dubuis et al 2011 and by fitting macroecological models mem vincent and haworth 1983 see also dubuis et al 2011 consequently we derived two alternative implementations of sesam considering richness predictions either by mem sesam mem or by ps sdm sesam prob fig 1 subsequently the evaluation scores of sesam mem and sesam prob were compared with those obtained from the application of the bs sdm approach finally after projecting s sdm and mem under two different climate change scenarios a2 and b1 ipcc 2007 fig 1 for 2070 we compared the outcomes of the three implemented modelling approaches i e sesam mem sesam prob and bs sdm 2 1 bs sdm implementation we selected bird communities from southern italy over a surface area extending from the tyrrhenian to the adriatic seas at altitudes varying from the sea level to 1900 m a s l fig s1 the area is largely covered by agricultural mosaics and encompasses a great variety of other habitat types from coastal wetlands to mountain forests the species dataset includes presence observation derived from field surveys within the italian breeding bird monitoring programme mito2000 project fornasari et al 2002 chiatante and meriggi 2016 stephens et al 2016 chiatante 2017 see appendix s1 for details from the initial dataset which includes 134 species we discarded all species with less than 15 occurrences the final dataset includes 81 species table s1 occurring throughout 1010 cells since the study area largely occurs within the historical ranges of all species without any evidence of dispersal limitation we considered these species to form an unique species source pool see also d amen et al 2015b 2015a and guisan and rahbek 2011 the selection of species source pool represented a common step to both bs sdm and sesam approaches fig 1 for global sdm calibration we initially considered the 19 worldclim predictors at a spatial resolution of 2 5 arc minutes ca 5 km hijmans et al 2005 table 1 appendix s1 as for regional sdm the initial set of covariates included the 19 worldclim predictors five topographic variables in combination with a coarse habitat classification 11 classes and a human pressure index see table 1 and appendix s1 for further details all rasterized at a resolution of 1 km for both regional sdm and mem we assessed the effect of model extrapolation on the values of predictor variables lying outside the training range by calculating the multivariate environmental similarity surface mess appendix s3 following elith et al 2010 to avoid model overfitting and allow species with small sample size to be modelled regional sdm were trained by ensembling small sub models esm breiner et al 2015 lomba et al 2010 di febbraro et al 2017 based on reduced subsets of the initial predictors appendix s1 bs sdm obtained in this step were then used to build current and future community predictions see fig 1 and appendix s1 calibration and stacking of s sdm is a common step to both bs sdm and sesam approaches in the latter stacked species distributions were additionally constrained by the macroecological richness predictions and ecologically assembly rules were applied fig 1 all models global and regional were evaluated by randomly splitting occurrence datasets into a 70 sample for models calibration and a remaining 30 to evaluate model predictive performance repeating the procedure 10 times and averaging the results the predictive performance of each model was assessed by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc hanley and mcneil 1982 and the maximized true skill statistic maxtss allouche et al 2006 2 2 sesam implementation both bs sdm and sesam imply selecting a pool of species and fitting stacking single species distributions which were outlined in the previous sections here we will describe the remaining steps i e setting macroecological constraints and applying ecological assembly rules 2 2 1 setting macroecological constraints under sesam macroecological constraints are set to limit species richness in the s sdm as specified above we calculated species richness by ps sdm and mem mem takes the number of species occurring at each cell observed richness as the response variable and relate it statistically to the regional predictors see table 1 we used zero inflated poisson regressions to account for the excess of zeroes in the dataset 26 lambert 1992 and implemented a variable selection procedure to select predictors appendix s2 the accuracy of the models was evaluated with a 10 fold cross validation procedure with two metrics the spearman rank correlation coefficient and the mean absolute error mae steinmann et al 2009 dubuis et al 2011 d amen et al 2017a 2017b the 10 resulting richness predictions were averaged and used to produce local species richness constraints such constraints were estimated under present day conditions and projected to the year 2070 under ipcc s a2 and b1 climate change scenarios ipcc 2007 2 2 2 accounting for ecological assembly rules where species richness is overestimated the excess number of species has to be deleted in order to fit to the macroecological constraint to do so we used alternatively mem or ps sdm richness estimates fig 1 as the constraint at each cell we ranked individual species according to their occurrence probability predicted by s sdm from highest to lowest we then retained those species with highest probabilities until the number of species predicted by mem or ps sdm was reached and discarded the excess specices probability ranking rule d amen et al 2015a d amen et al 2017a b 2 3 evaluating bs sdm and sesam predictive accuracy performances of bs sdm and sesam approaches to predict current distributions were assessed by calculating three different evaluation metrics richness deviation prediction success and sørensen similarity index in composition between predicted and observed communities richness deviation metric indicates the difference between predicted and observed species richness prediction success quantifies the proportion of species correctly predicted as present or absent the sørensen similarity index describes the compositional similarity between observed and predicted communities values closer to zero for the former and closer to one for the latter two indicate high predictive accuracy d amen et al 2015a pottier et al 2013 2 4 effects of climate change on the predicted communities to allow a comprehensive evaluation of prediction differences under climate change we measured changes in species distribution extent and shift and community structure species richness and diversity specifically we considered changes in five community dimensions i total number of species predicted in the study area ii extent and shift of future species distribution iii species richness at the level of individual cells iv differences in species composition and v γ diversity i e within landscape diversity the total number of species predicted in the area was calculated by grouping the species according to their degree of rarity in the area we created four rarity classes according to the percentage of the total area where the species were predicted to occur i e 0 5 5 25 25 50 and 50 for each species the extent of the predicted distribution in 2070 was expressed as the percentage of the present day distribution whereas shift was expressed as the percentage of overlap with the current predicted distribution huntley et al 2008 in addition we compared the differences in extent and shifts of predicted future distributions between resident and migratory species since an altered balance between residents and migrators has been observed as one of the most evident effects of climate change on birds lemoine et al 2007 van turnhout et al 2010 we calculated this phenological metric in order to assess the ecological plausibility of our future predictions in comparison to independent well documented patterns and expert based expectation the sørensen dissimilarity index i e 1 sørensen similarity index see above was used to quantify the differences in species taxonomic composition at cell level between the current and future 2070 communities the values of the index were split into positive and negative components depending on the alterations in the composition of the 2070 communities deriving from an increase or a decrease in the species richness at the cell level finally we calculated the sørensen dissimilarity index between cells pairs taken from current and 2070 predictions separately to quantify the γ diversity for current and future predicted communities see appendix s4 for further details 3 results 3 1 species distribution models both global and regional sdm reached good predictive performances overall sensu landis and koch 1977 swets 1988 auc for the global sdm ranged between 0 913 and 0 998 with a mean value of 0 954 sd 0 024 whereas maxtss ranged between 0 642 and 0 966 with a mean value of 0 793 sd 0 083 auc values for the regional sdm ranged between 0 838 and 0 998 with a mean of 0 940 sd 0 043 whereas maxtss values ranged between 0 557 and 0 993 with a mean of 0 782 sd 0 125 3 2 species richness accuracy species richness predicted by bs sdm was correlated with the observed richness with a spearman ρ 0 731 fig 2 a the regression line through the scatter plot adjusted r2 0 567 showed an intercept of 7 532 p 0 01 and a slope of 0 770 p 0 01 suggesting that observed species richness was sligthly overestimated although this pattern becomes negligible for the species richest sites in addition a positive prediction bias was observed with a mean richness deviation of 5 164 and a mae of 5 372 the species richness predictions calculated with mem achieved a much lower correlation with the observed richness with a mean spearman ρ 0 420 sd 0 050 resulting from the cross validation replicates fig 2b sites with the lowest observed species richness showed moderate levels of overprediction whereas plots with an observed richness 10 appeared to be markedly underestimated the patterns of both overprediction and underprediction of the observed species richness showed by mem were confirmed by the regression line through the scatter plot adjusted r2 0 131 which had an intercept of 9 775 p 0 01 and a slope of 0 055 p 0 05 in addition a negligible prediction bias mean deviation 0 012 mae 4 828 was observed the richness predictions obtained by ps sdm were better correlated with the observed richness with a spearman ρ 0 700 fig 2c however the regression line drawn through the scatter plot had an intercept of 18 584 p 0 01 and a slope of 0 307 p 0 01 thus showing a stronger overprediction of the observed species richness than with bs sdm in addition species richest and species poorest sites were shown to be markedly under and over underestimated respectively although less than for mem a positive prediction bias was observed with a mean richness deviation of 11 406 and a mae of 11 632 spatial predictions of current species richness by bs sdm mem and ps sdm are shown in fig s2 3 3 species composition accuracy the species composition predicted by both bs sdm and sesam implementations showed a fair to good predictive accuracy fig 2e f the application of sesam did not significantly improve wilcoxon test α 0 05 the predictions obtained by the simple bs sdm according to the prediction success index fig 2e the lowest score was obtained by sesam prob which had a prediction success index 0 9 less accurate than bs sdm in predicting species richness fig 2e this pattern was even more evident when considering the sørensen similarity scores which showed that both sesam mem and sesam prob generated predictions of significantly lower accuracy wilcoxon test α 0 05 than bs sdm fig 2f as bs sdm and sesam mem had the highest predictive accuracy we hereafter only show predictions generated with these two approaches for sesam prob see results in fig s3 s4 3 4 effects of climate change on the predicted communities spatial predictions of future species richness by bs sdm mem and ps sdm are shown in fig s2 remarkable differences were observed in the number of species predicted in the study area by bs sdm and sesam mem while this parameter was predicted by bs sdm to remain constant between the current time and 2070 regardless of the climate change scenarios fig 3 a it showed a strong decrease in 2070 according to sesam mem with a loss of more than 20 species fig 3f different outcomes of bs sdm and sesam mem were observed in the predicted extent and shift of the species distributions in 2070 indeed bs sdm predicted a decrease in extent of less than 26 and 23 of the species under a2 and b1 scenarios respectively fig 3b c with a preponderance of resident species fig 3d only few species 15 mainly to be found among the less common and the rarest were predicted to shift their distribution more than 50 under both scenarios fig 3b c with a more pronounced effect on migrators fig 3e on the contrary sesam mem predicted 79 and 75 of the species to reduce their 2070 predicted distribution under a2 and b1 scenarios respectively with a 30 completely losing their suitable areas under both scenarios fig 3g h moreover sesam mem outcomes showed a full range displacement for at least 30 and 35 of the species under a2 and b1 scenarios respectively all represented by the less common and rarest migratory species fig 3g h and i l predictions by bs sdm and sesam mem showed diverging patterns of predicted species richness per cell it would increase in 2070 according to the bs sdm outcomes fig 4 a b whereas such effect was less evident in the communities predicted by sesam mem fig 4c d the predictions of both bs sdm and sesam mem showed relevant alterations in species composition within cell regardless of the scenarios indeed the communities predicted by bs sdm exhibited a change in species composition of approximately 60 due to both increase and decrease of species richness in different cells fig 4a b such trend proved even stronger in the communities predicted by sesam mem which showed a change in their species composition of ca 70 due to increase and 80 due to decrease of species richness under all the scenarios fig 4c d finally climate change is predicted to have negligible effect on γ diversity by bs sdm fig 4a b whereas γ diversity was predicted to decrease in 2070 according to sesam mem regardless of the climate change scenarios fig 4c d 4 discussion 4 1 community level predictions at current time our results showed that both bs sdm and sesam approaches can predict species richness and composition of bird communities with overall fair to good accuracy under current climatic conditions the binarized bs sdm predictions showed better overall correlation with observed richness than ps sdm and mem predictions along the whole richness gradient fig 2 predicting much better the low and high species richness values in particular for mem it confirms previous findings suggesting that mem is not the most appropriate method to predict extreme low or high richness values algar et al 2009 dubuis et al 2011 newbold et al 2009 the not so strong relationship between observed richness and values predicted by mem has been noted elsewhere algar et al 2009 dubuis et al 2011 guisan and theurillat 2000 thuiller et al 2006 and is particularly marked here it can be linked to the fact that mem by modelling the mean is not well designed to capture strong richness variation around this mean furthermore producing an optimal macroecological constraint across a heavily anthropogenized study area like ours might be objectively difficult this should be considered with care when using mem within a sesam framework it is also noteworthy that bs sdm provided more accurate richness predictions than ps sdm prediction errors under bs sdm remarkably decreased in sites with high observed richness resulting in a nearly negligible underestimation of the species richest sites a trend opposite to the findings in algar et al 2009 and calabrese et al 2014 the latter suggested that the systematic richness overestimation reported for bs sdm is due to the binarization thresholding scheme largely adopted so far for stacking sdm outputs as e g used in barbet massin et al 2010 dubuis et al 2011 here however we observed the opposite pattern using a threshold reduced the overprediction compared to ps sdm leading bs sdm to perform better overall in particular the thresholding method used here accounts for differences in prevalence among species liu et al 2005 in our case the vast majority of species were characterized by low prevalences i e 0 110 0 017 leading to overall high threshold values fig s5 such result appeared coherent with the evidence in mateo et al 2012 which highlighted how choosing a thresholding method able to control for overprediction coupled with highly performing single species sdm ensembles may yield accurate richness predictions by bs sdm this interpretation is also in accordance with d amen et al 2015b who tested a number of thresholding methods to binarize the single species sdm ensembles and reported that bs sdm derived from highly accurate sdm are able to correctly predict species richness for insect species but not for plants see d amen et al 2015a irrespectively of most of the thresholding schemes applied therefore the taxonomic group and the number of species being modelled could also matter overall good predictions of community composition were obtained through both bs sdm and sesam implemented with the mem richness prediction in the current conditions in particular the bs sdm prediction was the best according to the sørensen index the implementation of sesam coupled with the ps sdm prediction had the lowest performance likely due to the higher richness overprediction in ps sdm the decrease in compositional accuracy due to richness overprediction has been described to date only for bs sdm predictions d amen et al 2015a dubuis et al 2011 while our results support the idea that the same may apply under alternative approaches 4 2 predicted effects of climate change on the communities overall bs sdm predicted less severe impacts of climate change on the analysed communities in 2070 than sesam mem under bs sdm the bird species and especially migrators showed a tendency to increase and moderately shift their distribution ranges in 2070 while none of the species was predicted to lose suitable range altogether this result agrees with studies suggesting european birds will extend their distribution towards the north following climate change huntley et al 2006 maggini et al 2011 although a predominant increase in the future distribution of migratory species was not consistently supported in the literature angert et al 2011 knudsen et al 2011 lemoine et al 2007 tingley et al 2012 van turnhout et al 2010 if true this widening of future species distributions predicted by bs sdm will lead to increased average species richness per cell in 2070 in addition these range modifications might lead to strong alteration of community composition at local scale and to the formation of assemblages without present day analogues böhning gaese and lemoine 2004 knudsen et al 2011 the change in community composition predicted by sesam offers a very different scenario from bs sdm in 2070 in particular sesam mem predicted that the rarest migratory species will undergo more severe climate driven distributional changes than resident species thus substantially contradicting bs sdm results similar expectations derive by taking into account the nature of interspecific interactions between migrators and residents knudsen et al 2011 predation risk bretagnolle and gillis 2010 niehaus and ydenberg 2006 and parasitism douglas et al 2010 möller et al 2011 in addition the substantial de structuration of current communities and the reduction in within landscape diversity predicted by sesam mem agrees with expert based expectations in particular mild winters are expected to decrease the proportion of migrants and increase the survival of residents resulting in the former experiencing increased competition for resources upon arrival lemoine and böhning gaese 2003 schaefer et al 2008 and ensuing population decline knudsen et al 2011 o connor 1990 such climate change induced dynamics are said to cause severe alterations in species composition ultimately leading to taxonomic homogenization at the local scale böhning gaese and lemoine 2004 cassey et al 2007 diffenbaugh et al 2007 morelli et al 2016 it was shown that modelling approaches taking biotic interactions into account tend to give higher extinction risk estimates than predictions based on models fitted with environmental predictors alone araújo and luoto 2007 hein et al 2012 hof et al 2012 sesam mem seems to be consistent with this general tendency future projections could further be improved by considering potential changes in land use although the relevance of land use change for mediterranean birds has already been documented moreira and russo 2007 seoane et al 2006 sirami et al 2008 its interaction with climate change deserves further investigation sirami et al 2017 and there is a substantial lack of high resolution long term land use change scenarios for southern italy still our approach was not able to consider possible local extinctions since we considered as extinct in the area only those species predicted to entirely lose their suitable habitats the number of local extinctions could have been underestimated allen et al 2001 brito and grelle 2006 lastly we did not consider possible colonizers from adjacent regions or from other continents i e invasive species which could immigrate into the study area tracking the climate change thus further altering the considered bird community barbet massin et al 2010 schaefer et al 2008 5 conclusion if prediction accuracy under current climatic conditions is the goal the traditional simpler widely used bs sdm approach proved at least as accurate as sesam in predicting species richness and composition of bird communities in southern italy however bs sdm and sesam mem delivered significantly distinc predictions under the 2070 scenario by considering environmental factors alone bs sdm the present day range of most species would increase in size and expand northwards keeping local species diversity high on the contrary under sesam the inclusion of macroecological constraints and assembly rules leads to the alteration of the natural balance between migratory and resident species biotic homogeneization and a severe impact of climate change on species diversity considering expert based predictions as true and admitting current observations on bird community change will hold true in the future sesam provided more realistic effects of climate change on the structure of bird communities such as the higher sensitivity of migratory birds compared to residents and the substantial homogenization of community structure böhning gaese and lemoine 2004 cassey et al 2007 diffenbaugh et al 2007 gilman et al 2010 morelli et al 2016 accurate predictions under climate change are challenging because they are sensitive to major uncertainties like the chance that species will track their suitable habitat at the same pace as the climate change or will adapt to new biotic interactions as well as unpredictable effects coming by the interplay of multiple global change drivers i e land use change such uncertainties hamper our understanding of how species will react to non analogous future environmental conditions whereby the drivers of change climate change land use change pollution etc will likely accelerate to levels which species and biological communities have never experienced in the last centuries that said our results further question the ability to predict community evolution under climate change and highlight the need for further investigations on community modelling to more comprehensively describe and quantify the complexity of drivers that interact together in determining the modifications of future communities this study highlights the importance of appropriate selection of the modelling approaches and critical evaluation of the underlying assumptions in predicting future scenarios of community evolution under climate change starting from these outcomes new future perspectives can be opened as e g testing for the validity of macroecological constraints when modelling bird assemblages or accounting for birds interactions to define assembly rules in addition trasferability tests i e hindcasting to past or predicting from the past to the present as similarly done in e g araújo et al 2005 could be used to comprehensively compare s sdm and sesam predictive abilities author contributions mdf ag and mda designed the study

25166,we conducted a small soil column penetration test and lysimeter experiment in four soils isohumosol ferrosol primosol and sandy soil to generate a migration model for antimony sb in soil based on the convection diffusion equation variation of the sb concentration was also simulated by the artificial neural networks model ann model the convection dispersion model will provide a reference for the transfer of sb in the environment the results agreed with the laboratory measurements with an r 2 of 0 79 0 98 in the isohumosol ferrosol and primosol it was found that the convection dispersion model could be used to explain the migration of sb in soil the areas of high potential ecological risk for the ferrosol isohumosol and primosol soils were at the soil surface and there was a low to moderate potential ecological risk for the deep soil profile artificial neural network model fitting results showed that sb migration was rapid in sandy soil because these soils have a weak sb adsorption capacity the sb concentration in the surface soil was much higher than at other soil depths little variation was observed in the sandy soil and isohumosol indicating a weak sb adsorption capacity for these soils the sb migration model will help us to describe and predict sb pollution in the soil environment providing the basis for managing sb contaminated soil keywords heavy metals migration and transformation prediction convection dispersion model 1 introduction increasing evidence has suggested that human activities strongly influence the environmental geochemistry of antimony sb herath et al 2017 koch et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 the concentrations of sb in soils around smelting areas may reach 16 389 mg kg 1 which exceeds the maximum permissible concentration limits in soil specified by the world health organization 35 mg kg 1 fei et al 2017 li et al 2014 2017 the high sb concentrations are considered to be hazardous to human health koch et al 2017 antimony and its compounds are also considered to be pollutants of priority interest by the united states environmental protection agency and the european union leuz et al 2006 antimony mining may cause sb release and most released sb will be deposited in the soil environment eventually posing a risk to rivers and underground water systems china contains the world s most abundant sb mineral resources with 75 of world annual sb production originating from china in 2017 seal et al 2017 however there has been insufficient research attention on the prediction and control of sb pollution especially for the soil environment antimony adsorption is a matter of concern and has been widely studied hou et al 2005 2013 shangguan et al 2016 with research indicating the low solubility of sb in the soils metal hydroxides soil organic matter content and the soil ph might be the main factors influencing sb adsorption and its migration in soils huang and ruiz 2006 wang et al 2015 sh et al 2012 klitzke and lang 2009 however little is known about the mobility and migration of the sb under field conditions with unamended soils and no sb migration behavior model has been applied to natural soils a number of numerical models have been developed to describe multicomponent reactive contaminant transport processes since the last decade liu and narasimhan 1989 simoni et al 2005 yeh and tripathi 1991 these models have the capability to model transport mechanisms such as advection dispersion and diffusion as well as chemical and physical reactions such as complexation ion exchange sorption redox precipitation and dissolution the parameters obtained from laboratory experiments need to be adapted to the field conditions by lysimeter experiments artificial neural network models anns have been widely used in soil science for the prediction of soil hydraulic properties minasny et al 2004 and modeling of the behavior of trace metals anagu et al 2009 buszewski and kowalkowski 2006 gandhimathi and meenambal 2012 unlike other heavy metals sb in soil is present in the form of anions furthermore sb has major differences with other heavy metals such as arsenic and chromium because of its higher molecular weight and larger molecular radius shangguan et al 2016 few studies have attempted to explain the sb breakthrough curves in the small size 9 cm soil column zhang et al 2014 protection of human health and ecosystems relies on the ability to predict the transport and distribution of contaminants in soil and groundwater systems a robust and realistic prediction of the transport of contaminants of concern in groundwater or geological environments depends deeply on reliable transport related parameters this study was based on two types of experiments column experiments performed under laboratory conditions and lysimeter experiments conducted under static conditions the column experiments were conducted to investigate the relationships between measured soil physical parameters and transport parameters distribution coefficient and dispersivity that most strongly influence the fate of sb lysimeter experiments were performed to study the chemical equilibrium state of the soil solution system under static conditions finally tracer transport and flow were studied in the columns using a conservative tracer the objectives of this paper were to 1 study the migration of the sb in four typical soils of china isohumosol ferrosol primosol and sandy soil and 2 develop a migration model of the sb in the four soils this research will help us to understand sb migration in the soil environment and the sb migration prediction model will provide a basis for managing sb contaminated soil 2 materials and methods 2 1 soils we carried out experiments using four different soils an

shifting sand in the us soil taxonomy from chaoyang district beijing 116 26 e 40 03 n the isohumosol ferrosol primosol and sandy soils were air dried after sampling and sieved 2 mm mesh size to remove coarse material the chemical and physical properties of these soils are presented in table 1 soil ph was measured in deionized water using a 1 2 5 wt vol soil solution ratio the particle size distribution was determined using a pipette method the soil organic matter content was estimated using the potassium dichromate volumetric method cation exchange capacity was determined using the sodium acetate flame photometry method the barrett joyner halenda analysis was used to analyze the specific surface area and pore size distribution 2 2 tracer and column penetration experiment column experiments were performed in a 25 cm plexiglass column i d 5 cm the top of the column was connected to a peristaltic pump from the fluid supply the bottom was sealed with a small opening for the leachate drainage hose into the vial for sampling the soil column was dry packed with soil sieved through a 2 mm sieve the soil samples were installed according to the dry bulk density of 1 19 g cm 3 for ferrosol 1 17 g cm 3 for primosol 1 20 g cm 3 for isohumosol and 1 43 g cm 3 for sandy soil soil columns were slowly saturated with deionized water to avoid air bubble entrapment and preferential flow the leaching rate was controlled by a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 20 ml h 1 a diagram of the experimental apparatus is presented in fig 1 in the bromine br tracer penetration experiment after the soil column was filled with soil the pump was used to input deionized water from the bottom of the column the air in the column was replaced by water reversing the direction of the water flow when the water flow rate was stable the br tracer was input from the column and leachate was collected every 30 min the tracer experiment ended when the br concentration in the leachate was higher than 95 of the tracer solution the br in the soil leachate was detected by icp ms 7500c agilent technologies santa clara ca usa a 1 pv pulse of 10 mg kg 1 potassium pyroantimonate k2h2sb2o7 4h2o solution was applied at the speed of 20 ml h 1 and each pulse was followed by a deionized water flush effluent samples were collected hourly and analyzed for sb concentrations using icp ms 7500c agilent technologies the column test for the 100 mg kg 1 k2h2sb2o7 4h2o applied the same method an sb concentration of less than 0 1 mg kg 1 was detected in the leachate in the ferrosol therefore this soil received 20 pv 100 mg kg 1 sb to detect the sb penetration in the soil column after completion of the experiments the soil was removed from the column freeze dried and split into samples at 3 cm intervals to determine the final sb concentration in the soil column 2 3 large scale soil column leaching experiment lysimeters were located in the chinese research academy of environmental sciences chaoyang district beijing the lysimeters were backfilled with disturbed soil collected from 0 to 160 cm soil depth from the four different sites a schematic of soil samples in the different soil profiles in the lysimeters is shown in fig 2 and detailed information is provided in the supplementary materials 2 4 convection dispersion model we applied a convection dispersion model to simulate a one dimensional mathematical model of water and solute movement in unsaturated porous media vertical mobility of water water absorption of plants and evaporation in the surface soil and plants are considered in the model however the model does not describe the migration of gas in the soluble state and the influence of the temperature gradient is ignored the hydrodynamic dispersion colloidal sb migration and adsorption of dissolved sb with the sb migration required consideration in the model however the degradation process of the pollutant did not need consideration the following important parameters required measurement for input into the model soil moisture characteristic parameters soil bulk density soil texture infiltration coefficient dispersion coefficient porosity hydraulic conductivity pore water velocity adsorption parameters and soil evaporation for numerical experimentation we considered sb contamination of the soil in the large scale soil column under the above mentioned test conditions simulating local rainfall and rainfall composition leaching observed the migration change of sb in the four studied soils at different times by numerical modeling and predicted the sb migration to shallow groundwater we regarded each large scale soil column as an integral whole the vertical distribution of soil characteristics was taken as the average throughout the profile and the relative soil physical modeling parameters took the same value the initial conditions and boundary conditions were determined according to actual experimental conditions we divided soil layer of the column into two regions on the basis of depth surface soil 0 5 cm and deeper soil below 5 cm according to the experimental conditions initial water level in the soil moisture content in each layer different forms and valence state of sb background contents and boundary conditions were required to determine pollution sources the sb concentration in the surface soil was taken as the initial concentration we chose the sb flux boundary as the upper boundary of sb migration according to the test conditions the depth of the lower boundary in the soil profile was 1 6 m to predict the influence in underground water we considered the buried depth of underground water from the four soil locations as the reference depth water migration and the lower boundary of sb transportation were set as the free infiltration boundary and the sb concentration was zero we did not consider the valence state transformation of sb in soil and other chemical reactions adsorption of plants was considered the following generalizations were made 1 the study object was simplified into a vertical rectangle model this focuses mainly on the migration of the pollutant in the vertical direction vertical depth of 135 cm 2 the soil in the rectangle module was assumed to be homogeneous and when rainfall occurs it was assumed to reach its saturated water content the initial polluted soil was regarded as a pollution source with a depth of 5 cm the migration was modelled within this large scale soil column with sb addition over 4 years in the soil 3 the sb content added to the soil was considered as the initial value the upper boundary of the rectangle module was the convection dispersion sb flux in dissolved form and the movement of sb along the horizontal direction in the rectangle module was not considered 4 the sb migration in soil was considered in two parts comprising the adsorption desorption migration process of dissolved sb in the soil and the sb migration process with the colloid bound state in soil other details of the convection dispersion model are provided in the supplementary materials 2 5 artificial neural network model artificial neural network models include input variables a training process and output variables the input layer contains a number of variables known as neurons and each neuron represents a single input parameter these input layers are transmitted by definite computational methods by models and are counted into implicit variables the training process in an ann involves presenting a set of examples input patterns with known outputs target output the system adjusts the internal connections to minimize the discrepancies between the network outputs and target outputs finally the final results are obtained by output variables we used a network structure containing two hidden layers and six neuron inputs soil moisture saturation retardation coefficient soil depth soil temperature sb content in the soil surface and rainfall with a study rate factor η of 0 1 and an inertia coefficient α of 0 1 these two parameters are user defined in the ann model which influences the calculation process in our ann model training data accounted for 25 80 of the sum total data test data accounted for 15 20 and validation data accounted for 5 15 training data did not include test data to ensure accuracy of the ann model by test data cross validation we tested the accuracy of the sb prediction model by verifying the data the prediction of the sb concentration was based on the sb concentration at the beginning and 4 years after the sb addition the mathematical operation of a neuron is given as eq 1 1 y j f i 1 n x i w i b j where yi is the output of a neuron j here denoting the sb concentration f is an activation function xi is an input of the vector of inputs i 1 2 n here denoting the sb concentration and the leaching time wi is the weight associated with the connection link through which the input xi arrives to current neuron j from a neuron in the preceding layer and bj is a bias associated with neuron j 2 6 statistical analysis the potential ecological risk method developed by hakanson 1980 was applied in this study the potential ecological risk coeﬃcient er of sb equals the multiplication of tf and cf in these equations cf is the accumulating coeﬃcient for the element of sb tf is the toxic response factor for the element of sb reﬂects its toxicity levels and the sensitivity of bio organism to it the toxic response factors for sb was 10 basic data processing and figure generation was conducted in origin 8 0 originlab northampton ma usa model calculations were conducted in matlab 2009a mathworks natick ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 br penetration curve in different soils after the experiment finished br penetration curves with leaching time on the x axis and relative concentration ct c0 on the y axis were produced fig 3 where ct is the br concentration in the leachate and c0 is the br concentration in the penetrating solution the time of first br penetration through the column was similar for all soils at about 9 h after the experiment began subsequently the br concentration in the leachate increased with the most rapid increase occurring in the sandy soil the br concentration in the leachate of the sandy soil peaked about 14 and 15 h for the isohumosol and primosol respectively the slowest increase in br concentration occurred in the ferrosol the dispersion coefficient d parameter was calculated by the following equation through the approximate solution of the soil longitudinal dispersion coefficient 2 d v 2 8 t 0 5 t 0 84 t 0 16 2 where t0 16 t0 5 and t0 84 represent the time h at which the values of ct c0 reach 0 16 0 5 and 0 84 respectively and v represents the real flow rate for the solution in the column the migration parameters for the four studied soils were calculated as presented in table 2 3 2 antimony breakthrough experiment in the soil column the breakthrough curves btcs from column experiments illustrate the extensive retention and low mobility of sb in the ferrosol complete retardation was observed in the soil columns following extended 1 pv 10 mg kg 1 and 100 mg kg 1 sb input pulses figs 4 and 5 no penetration peak was observed in the ferrosol indicating that the retention capacity of the ferrosol was strongest of the studied soils and almost all sb input was adsorbed by soil the sb was thus unable to penetrate the soil column in the sb breakthrough experiment the input of the sb was 0 2 mg in fig 4 and 2 mg in fig 5 the input of the sb for ferrosol in fig 5 was 42 mg the accumulation sb in the soil column was 99 94 for ferrosol 61 60 forprimosol 86 07 for isohumosol and 25 15 for sandy soil respectively in the 10 mg kg 1 sb input pulses the sb accumulation in the soil column was 82 50 for ferrosol 41 69 forprimosol 72 53 for isohumosol and 15 53 for sandy soil in the 100 mg kg 1 sb input pulses respectively the sb btcs exhibited extensive asymmetry as illustrated by the shape of the leaching concentrations fig 5 the breakthrough of sb from the ferrosol column showed an extremely long period of retardation 130 h after applying 100 mg kg 1 sb solution 20 pv the peak of sb concentration in the effluent was only about 70 of the applied concentration antimony btcs in ferrosol and isohumosol soil at 100 mg kg 1 sb were smoother than those for 10 mg kg 1 in contrast sb btcs in primosol and sandy soil at 100 mg kg 1 sb were similar to those in the 10 mg kg 1 influent the sb btcs under the 100 mg kg 1 condition were different to those in the 10 mg kg 1 condition the peak of the btc was much larger and the tailing phenomenon was more apparent the sb migrated fastest in the sandy soil and there was no smearing desorption curve indicating that the adsorption of sb in the penetration was weak the sb penetration rate of the four soils increased in the order ferrosol isohumosol primosol sandy soil in both the 10 mg kg 1 and 100 mg kg 1 conditions the sb btcs in sandy soil and primosol were similar but the peak was lower in the primosol than in the sandy soil and a slight tailing phenomenon was observed indicating greater sb retention in the primosol than in the sandy soil the sb btcs in the isohumosol were substantially different to those of the other three soils the peak of the btc was much smoother and the tailing phenomenon was more apparent the shapes of the btcs from primosol were dramatically different from those of isohumosol reflecting an intrinsic difference in soil properties the transport of sb in isohumosol soil at 100 mg kg 1 sb showed a diffuse btc shape characterized by gradual increase of sb concentration to approximately 40 of the input concentration after 90 h in addition the excessive trailing phenomenon exhibited by column btcs demonstrated a continued slow desorption release of sb from soils zhang et al 2014 the smooth peak strong retardation and extensive tailing or slow release during leaching are features of strong adsorption of sb in the transport process ferrosols with high adsorption capacity exhibit a substantially higher retardation than the other three soils in addition the isohumosol btc had a similar shape to the btcs from the column experiments of zhang et al 2014 for soils with similar soil properties to those of the current study analyses of specific surface area and pore size distribution show that the soil specific surface area of the ferrosol was much greater than that of the other soils a larger specific surface area can cause the sb to be adsorbed by the soil particle leading to a much slower sb migration rate guo et al 2014 the soil specific surface area of the isohumosol was much greater than those of the primosol and the sandy soil causing the sb migration rate to be much slower in the isohumosol than the primosol and the sandy soil the high fe contents in the ferrosol and high organic matter in isohumosol may decrease the mobility of sb in these soils shangguan et al 2016 li et al 2018 indicated that exogenous sb iii was adsorbed onto soils first rapidly and then more slowly after adsorption large proportions of sb in isohumosol remained mobilizable and could be desorbed slowly this may explain the different shape of the btc in the sb at 10 mg kg 1 and 100 mg kg 1 the breakthrough time for the isohumosol was much longer in fig 5 than fig 4 and the long breakthrough time caused the sb to adsorb more strongly after the input sb was adsorbed by the isohumosol the mobilizable sb was washed out slowly in the leachate compared with the sb concentration in the leachate there was more substantial sb desorption in fig 4 producing a smoother btc of isohumosolthan that in fig 5 3 3 migration of sb in soil simulated by convection dispersion model the parameters used in the simulation porosity dry bulk density saturated water content rainfall plant absorption coefficient and evaporation were derived from this study detailed information can be found in our former study shangguan et al 2016 table 3 the simulated sb content in soil showed the highest correlation with the observed data in the ferrosol r 2 0 98 second in the primosol r 2 0 92 followed by the isohumosol and sandy soil with r 2 of 0 79 and 0 38 respectively fig 6 among these the measured sb concentrations of surface soil 0 2 cm soil depth were as follows ferrosol 46 44 mg kg 1 primosol 27 15 mg kg 1 isohumosol 28 45 mg kg 1 and sandy soil 16 51 mg kg 1 the sb concentration calculated by the model was 45 44 23 165 24 8 and 9 0 mg kg 1 for the ferrosol primosol isohumosol and sandy soil respectively it has been previously reported murciego et al 2007 that sb is strongly adsorbed by clays and fe hydroxides the ferrosol contained more clays and fe hydroxides than the other soils shangguan et al 2016 so most of the sb was retained in the surface layer which agreed with the results of other studies hou et al 2013 yang et al 2015 as well as clays and fe hydroxides soil organic matter also adsorbed sb in the isohumosol the potential for sb to migrate through soil at small arms firing ranges has been found to increase as the soil ph increases martin et al 2013 the r 2 of the model simulations of isohumosol primosol and ferrosol were all higher than that of sandy soil in the observations the peak sb concentration in sandy soil occurred in the surface soil and at 20 25 cm soil depth but the predicted peak value was found at 2 4 cm soil depth the sb concentrations of the other layers in sandy soil were apparently higher than the background value and peak values were not detected however the sb concentration distribution in soil lower than 20 cm based on the model calculation included average values and there was a small peak value and little variation the predicted sb concentrations were between 1 5 and 3 6 mg kg 1 but the actual measurement concentration was between 0 3 and 17 8 mg kg 1 therefore the model was less able to predict sb migration in deep layers than in surface layers the sb migration in soil was calculated by the convection diffusion model and the results agreed with the actual measurement based on the convection diffusion equation with r 2 values of 0 38 0 98 the convection dispersion model and adsorption model can be used to predict the sb migration in soil when pollutants in surface soil were only added to the lysimeter surface layer the concentration was 1080 mg kg 1 the concentration of pollutants in the surface 0 5 cm of soil was equal to the added concentration and with the leaching experiment the sb concentration in the surface soil began to decline fig 7 there was little sb in the exchangeable fraction in the surface soil whereas most sb was relatively stable with poor mobility which agrees with previous research fu et al 2016 therefore the decline in sb concentration was not rapid the sb concentration at 0 2 cm soil depth began to decline in the first year of leaching while the sb concentration remained steady at soil depths lower than 2 cm in the following year leaching began to influence soil deeper than 2 cm with the increase of leaching time soil in deeper layers began to be influenced by the leaching treatment and the soil sb concentration also began to decline after leaching for 4 years soil deeper than 4 cm also began to be influenced by leaching and the sb concentration in soil began to decline this prediction suggests that sb added to the surface soil was stable and had lower migration risk towards deeper soil we also calculated the potential ecological risk with the method of hakanson 1980 the results show that on the surface of the ferrosol primosol and isohumosol there was a very high potential ecological risk for sb the potential ecological risk for the three soils mainly occurred at the soil surface whereas for the deep soil profile there was a low to moderate potential ecological risk in contrast for the sandy soil there was only high potential ecological risk for sb at the soil surface and the deep soil also had a high potential ecological risk for sb the potential ecological risk assessment by the measured and the simulated values by the convection diffusion model were similar for the four soils the potential ecological risk assessment results by the model for the sandy soil was much larger for the sb in the soil profile of 20 25 cm than the measured values the convection dispersion model simulated the variation of sb in soil solution fig 8 the sb concentration in soil solution in the surface soil was much higher than at other soil depths in the four soils of the studied soils sandy soil had the highest sb concentration in the soil surface at 0 65 mg l 1 subsequently the concentration declined rapidly with increasing depth however when the depth approached 10 cm the sb concentration in sandy soil maintained a range between 0 5 and 0 65 mg l 1 later with the increasing leaching time the sb concentration in the surface of the sandy soil declined rapidly but the sb concentration in deeper soil began to increase after a decade the sb concentration in sandy soil 50 cm soil depth increased to about 0 2 mg l 1 but the sb concentration declined gradually in deeper soil the variation of sb concentration in the other soil types was consistent with that of the sandy soil but the variation of sb concentration in deeper soil of ferrosol and isohumosol was smaller than that of the sandy soil this could be caused by the strong sb adsorption capacity in ferrosol and isohumosol shangguan et al 2016 in contrast the sb concentration was higher in surface soil and deeper soil in the primosol in the first year of leaching the sb concentration in surface soil was about 0 47 mg l 1 but the sb concentration in soil below 20 cm was about 0 18 mg l 1 the sb concentration in the surface layer was higher in the sandy soil and the primosol than that in the ferrosol and isohumosol but the sb concentration in primosol soil solution was the highest in the deeper layer because the primosol had a weak sb adsorption capacity in the surface layer the sb concentration was higher in the surface layer however sb migration in deeper soil was mainly in the colloid bound state painter et al 2004 thus the sb concentration in primosol was higher than that in sandy soil in deeper soil 3 4 soil sb concentration simulated by the ann model the number of data points for ferrosol isohumosol primosol and sandy soil was 98 87 86 and 91 respectively among these data 80 was training data and 20 was taken as test data the ann model can be used to explain the variation of 86 97 of training data and r 2 of the test data was 0 78 0 90 supplementary materials the ann model can fit the sb concentration in soil solution accurately there was clear variation of the sb concentration in soil after 30 years it could still reach 1 3 mg l 1 in sandy soil at below 1 m soil depth which was much higher than the other soils fig 9 in soil solution of the other soil types the sb concentration was lower than 0 2 mg l 1 in the ferrosol the sb concentration gradually declined between 5 and 40 cm soil depth the sb concentration gradually migrated to deeper layers at below 40 cm soil depth there was no clear variation in the ferrosol in the primosol the sb concentration increased initially and then declined at soil depths below 40 cm below 40 cm there was no clear variation in the primosol in the isohumosol the sb concentration gradually declined at soil depths below 5 cm increased at soil depths below 20 cm and then declined again in deeper soil layers in the sandy soil the sb concentration gradually increased from 5 to 30 years the sb migration in sand was rapid because the sandy soil has a weak sb adsorption capacity the quantity of rainfall in the ferrosol was much higher than the other soils which caused the sb concentration to be higher in surface soil however the sb concentration in the ferrosol was unable to migrate to the soil profile deeper than 40 cm the variation of sb was low in isohumosol because this soil had a strong adsorption capacity for sb little variation was observed in the sandy soil and isohumosol indicating a weak sb adsorption ability for the sandy soil and isohumosol in general long term variation of the sb concentration simulated by the ann model was poor but in the short term the results agreed with the actual measurements overall the sb concentration declined along with the increase of depth however as the leaching time increased fluctuations occurred with a large amplitude compared with the convection dispersion model long term simulation in deeper soil by the ann model was not accurate and it showed substantial fluctuations this was determined by the model structure simulated results were credible only within the scope of the near training variables simulation and values should not be outside a certain level of variation that is not covered by the training variables however in a long term simulation we need to further check the model we need to test data continuously and conduct validations to adapt the model therefore long term leaching experiments and data verification studies are needed to ensure the accuracy of the ann model 4 conclusions the experimentally observed migration of sb in soil can fit to the ann model or the convection dispersion model results with the fitting of the ann model showed that sb migration in sand was rapid because the sandy soil has a weak sb adsorption capacity whereas ferrosol soil had a strong sb adsorption capacity and sb migration in the ferrosol was slow after 4 years of leaching the migration distance was less than 40 cm and the migration of sb increased in the order sandy soil primosol isohumosol ferrosol variation of the sb concentration simulated by the ann model was poor but the results agreed with the observations in the short term overall the sb concentration declined along with increasing soil depth however as the leaching duration increased fluctuations occurred with large amplitude compared with the convection dispersion model the ann model has the advantage of fast fitting speed but the error of the simulated results was large in long term simulation however the convection dispersion model can be used to explain the migration of sb in soil the sb migration could be divided into two parts real solution and colloid bound state the former was mainly controlled by soil adsorption and the latter by migration in the in colloid bound state the sb concentration in soil and soil solution were all simulated by the convection dispersion model comparison between simulated and measured values revealed that in long term simulation errors were small in the convection dispersion model and it was close to the actual measurement results the simulated data in convection dispersion model were strongly correlated with measured values r 2 between 0 38 and 0 98 according to our model sb has different migration behaviors in different soils and attention should be paid to high risk behavior especially in primosol and sandy soil conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements this study was

25166,we conducted a small soil column penetration test and lysimeter experiment in four soils isohumosol ferrosol primosol and sandy soil to generate a migration model for antimony sb in soil based on the convection diffusion equation variation of the sb concentration was also simulated by the artificial neural networks model ann model the convection dispersion model will provide a reference for the transfer of sb in the environment the results agreed with the laboratory measurements with an r 2 of 0 79 0 98 in the isohumosol ferrosol and primosol it was found that the convection dispersion model could be used to explain the migration of sb in soil the areas of high potential ecological risk for the ferrosol isohumosol and primosol soils were at the soil surface and there was a low to moderate potential ecological risk for the deep soil profile artificial neural network model fitting results showed that sb migration was rapid in sandy soil because these soils have a weak sb adsorption capacity the sb concentration in the surface soil was much higher than at other soil depths little variation was observed in the sandy soil and isohumosol indicating a weak sb adsorption capacity for these soils the sb migration model will help us to describe and predict sb pollution in the soil environment providing the basis for managing sb contaminated soil keywords heavy metals migration and transformation prediction convection dispersion model 1 introduction increasing evidence has suggested that human activities strongly influence the environmental geochemistry of antimony sb herath et al 2017 koch et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 the concentrations of sb in soils around smelting areas may reach 16 389 mg kg 1 which exceeds the maximum permissible concentration limits in soil specified by the world health organization 35 mg kg 1 fei et al 2017 li et al 2014 2017 the high sb concentrations are considered to be hazardous to human health koch et al 2017 antimony and its compounds are also considered to be pollutants of priority interest by the united states environmental protection agency and the european union leuz et al 2006 antimony mining may cause sb release and most released sb will be deposited in the soil environment eventually posing a risk to rivers and underground water systems china contains the world s most abundant sb mineral resources with 75 of world annual sb production originating from china in 2017 seal et al 2017 however there has been insufficient research attention on the prediction and control of sb pollution especially for the soil environment antimony adsorption is a matter of concern and has been widely studied hou et al 2005 2013 shangguan et al 2016 with research indicating the low solubility of sb in the soils metal hydroxides soil organic matter content and the soil ph might be the main factors influencing sb adsorption and its migration in soils huang and ruiz 2006 wang et al 2015 sh et al 2012 klitzke and lang 2009 however little is known about the mobility and migration of the sb under field conditions with unamended soils and no sb migration behavior model has been applied to natural soils a number of numerical models have been developed to describe multicomponent reactive contaminant transport processes since the last decade liu and narasimhan 1989 simoni et al 2005 yeh and tripathi 1991 these models have the capability to model transport mechanisms such as advection dispersion and diffusion as well as chemical and physical reactions such as complexation ion exchange sorption redox precipitation and dissolution the parameters obtained from laboratory experiments need to be adapted to the field conditions by lysimeter experiments artificial neural network models anns have been widely used in soil science for the prediction of soil hydraulic properties minasny et al 2004 and modeling of the behavior of trace metals anagu et al 2009 buszewski and kowalkowski 2006 gandhimathi and meenambal 2012 unlike other heavy metals sb in soil is present in the form of anions furthermore sb has major differences with other heavy metals such as arsenic and chromium because of its higher molecular weight and larger molecular radius shangguan et al 2016 few studies have attempted to explain the sb breakthrough curves in the small size 9 cm soil column zhang et al 2014 protection of human health and ecosystems relies on the ability to predict the transport and distribution of contaminants in soil and groundwater systems a robust and realistic prediction of the transport of contaminants of concern in groundwater or geological environments depends deeply on reliable transport related parameters this study was based on two types of experiments column experiments performed under laboratory conditions and lysimeter experiments conducted under static conditions the column experiments were conducted to investigate the relationships between measured soil physical parameters and transport parameters distribution coefficient and dispersivity that most strongly influence the fate of sb lysimeter experiments were performed to study the chemical equilibrium state of the soil solution system under static conditions finally tracer transport and flow were studied in the columns using a conservative tracer the objectives of this paper were to 1 study the migration of the sb in four typical soils of china isohumosol ferrosol primosol and sandy soil and 2 develop a migration model of the sb in the four soils this research will help us to understand sb migration in the soil environment and the sb migration prediction model will provide a basis for managing sb contaminated soil 2 materials and methods 2 1 soils we carried out experiments using four different soils an isohumosol chinese soil classification mollisol in the us soil taxonomy from hailun heilongjiang 126 38 e 47 26 n a ferrosol chinese soil classification ultisol in the us soil taxonomy from qiyang hunan 111 02 e 26 45 n a primosol chinese soil classification inceptisol in the us soil taxonomy from the changping district beijing 115 50 e 40 20 n and a sandy soil chinese soil classification shifting sand in the us soil taxonomy from chaoyang district beijing 116 26 e 40 03 n the isohumosol ferrosol primosol and sandy soils were air dried after sampling and sieved 2 mm mesh size to remove coarse material the chemical and physical properties of these soils are presented in table 1 soil ph was measured in deionized water using a 1 2 5 wt vol soil solution ratio the particle size distribution was determined using a pipette method the soil organic matter content was estimated using the potassium dichromate volumetric method cation exchange capacity was determined using the sodium acetate flame photometry method the barrett joyner halenda analysis was used to analyze the specific surface area and pore size distribution 2 2 tracer and column penetration experiment column experiments were performed in a 25 cm plexiglass column i d 5 cm the top of the column was connected to a peristaltic pump from the fluid supply the bottom was sealed with a small opening for the leachate drainage hose into the vial for sampling the soil column was dry packed with soil sieved through a 2 mm sieve the soil samples were installed according to the dry bulk density of 1 19 g cm 3 for ferrosol 1 17 g cm 3 for primosol 1 20 g cm 3 for isohumosol and 1 43 g cm 3 for sandy soil soil columns were slowly saturated with deionized water to avoid air bubble entrapment and preferential flow the leaching rate was controlled by a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 20 ml h 1 a diagram of the experimental apparatus is presented in fig 1 in the bromine br tracer penetration experiment after the soil column was filled with soil the pump was used to input deionized water from the bottom of the column the air in the column was replaced by water reversing the direction of the water flow when the water flow rate was stable the br tracer was input from the column and leachate was collected every 30 min the tracer experiment ended when the br concentration in the leachate was higher than 95 of the tracer solution the br in the soil leachate was detected by icp ms 7500c agilent technologies santa clara ca usa a 1 pv pulse of 10 mg kg 1 potassium pyroantimonate k2h2sb2o7 4h2o solution was applied at the speed of 20 ml h 1 and each pulse was followed by a deionized water flush effluent samples were collected hourly and analyzed for sb concentrations using icp ms 7500c agilent technologies the column test for the 100 mg kg 1 k2h2sb2o7 4h2o applied the same method an sb concentration of less than 0 1 mg kg 1 was detected in the leachate in the ferrosol therefore this soil received 20 pv 100 mg kg 1 sb to detect the sb penetration in the soil column after completion of the experiments the soil was removed from the column freeze dried and split into samples at 3 cm intervals to determine the final sb concentration in the soil column 2 3 large scale soil column leaching experiment lysimeters were located in the chinese research academy of environmental sciences chaoyang district beijing the lysimeters were backfilled with disturbed soil collected from 0 to 160 cm soil depth from the four different sites a schematic of soil samples in the different soil profiles in the lysimeters is shown in fig 2 and detailed information is provided in the supplementary materials 2 4 convection dispersion model we applied a convection dispersion model to simulate a one dimensional mathematical model of water and solute movement in unsaturated porous media vertical mobility of water water absorption of plants and evaporation in the surface soil and plants are considered in the model however the model does not describe the migration of gas in the soluble state and the influence of the temperature gradient is ignored the hydrodynamic dispersion colloidal sb migration and adsorption of dissolved sb with the sb migration required consideration in the model however the degradation process of the pollutant did not need consideration the following important parameters required measurement for input into the model soil moisture characteristic parameters soil bulk density soil texture infiltration coefficient dispersion coefficient porosity hydraulic conductivity pore water velocity adsorption parameters and soil evaporation for numerical experimentation we considered sb contamination of the soil in the large scale soil column under the above mentioned test conditions simulating local rainfall and rainfall composition leaching observed the migration change of sb in the four studied soils at different times by numerical modeling and predicted the sb migration to shallow groundwater we regarded each large scale soil column as an integral whole the vertical distribution of soil characteristics was taken as the average throughout the profile and the relative soil physical modeling parameters took the same value the initial conditions and boundary conditions were determined according to actual experimental conditions we divided soil layer of the column into two regions on the basis of depth surface soil 0 5 cm and deeper soil below 5 cm according to the experimental conditions initial water level in the soil moisture content in each layer different forms and valence state of sb background contents and boundary conditions were required to determine pollution sources the sb concentration in the surface soil was taken as the initial concentration we chose the sb flux boundary as the upper boundary of sb migration according to the test conditions the depth of the lower boundary in the soil profile was 1 6 m to predict the influence in underground water we considered the buried depth of underground water from the four soil locations as the reference depth water migration and the lower boundary of sb transportation were set as the free infiltration boundary and the sb concentration was zero we did not consider the valence state transformation of sb in soil and other chemical reactions adsorption of plants was considered the following generalizations were made 1 the study object was simplified into a vertical rectangle model this focuses mainly on the migration of the pollutant in the vertical direction vertical depth of 135 cm 2 the soil in the rectangle module was assumed to be homogeneous and when rainfall occurs it was assumed to reach its saturated water content the initial polluted soil was regarded as a pollution source with a depth of 5 cm the migration was modelled within this large scale soil column with sb addition over 4 years in the soil 3 the sb content added to the soil was considered as the initial value the upper boundary of the rectangle module was the convection dispersion sb flux in dissolved form and the movement of sb along the horizontal direction in the rectangle module was not considered 4 the sb migration in soil was considered in two parts comprising the adsorption desorption migration process of dissolved sb in the soil and the sb migration process with the colloid bound state in soil other details of the convection dispersion model are provided in the supplementary materials 2 5 artificial neural network model artificial neural network models include input variables a training process and output variables the input layer contains a number of variables known as neurons and each neuron represents a single input parameter these input layers are transmitted by definite computational methods by models and are counted into implicit variables the training process in an ann involves presenting a set of examples input patterns with known outputs target output the system adjusts the internal connections to minimize the discrepancies between the network outputs and target outputs finally the final results are obtained by output variables we used a network structure containing two hidden layers and six neuron inputs soil moisture saturation retardation coefficient soil depth soil temperature sb content in the soil surface and rainfall with a study rate factor η of 0 1 and an inertia coefficient α of 0 1 these two parameters are user defined in the ann model which influences the calculation process in our ann model training data accounted for 25 80 of the sum total data test data accounted for 15 20 and validation data accounted for 5 15 training data did not include test data to ensure accuracy of the ann model by test data cross validation we tested the accuracy of the sb prediction model by verifying the data the prediction of the sb concentration was based on the sb concentration at the beginning and 4 years after the sb addition the mathematical operation of a neuron is given as eq 1 1 y j f i 1 n x i w i b j where yi is the output of a neuron j here denoting the sb concentration f is an activation function xi is an input of the vector of inputs i 1 2 n here denoting the sb concentration and the leaching time wi is the weight associated with the connection link through which the input xi arrives to current neuron j from a neuron in the preceding layer and bj is a bias associated with neuron j 2 6 statistical analysis the potential ecological risk method developed by hakanson 1980 was applied in this study the potential ecological risk coeﬃcient er of sb equals the multiplication of tf and cf in these equations cf is the accumulating coeﬃcient for the element of sb tf is the toxic response factor for the element of sb reﬂects its toxicity levels and the sensitivity of bio organism to it the toxic response factors for sb was 10 basic data processing and figure generation was conducted in origin 8 0 originlab northampton ma usa model calculations were conducted in matlab 2009a mathworks natick ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 br penetration curve in different soils after the experiment finished br penetration curves with leaching time on the x axis and relative concentration ct c0 on the y axis were produced fig 3 where ct is the br concentration in the leachate and c0 is the br concentration in the penetrating solution the time of first br penetration through the column was similar for all soils at about 9 h after the experiment began subsequently the br concentration in the leachate increased with the most rapid increase occurring in the sandy soil the br concentration in the leachate of the sandy soil peaked about 14 and 15 h for the isohumosol and primosol respectively the slowest increase in br concentration occurred in the ferrosol the dispersion coefficient d parameter was calculated by the following equation through the approximate solution of the soil longitudinal dispersion coefficient 2 d v 2 8 t 0 5 t 0 84 t 0 16 2 where t0 16 t0 5 and t0 84 represent the time h at which the values of ct c0 reach 0 16 0 5 and 0 84 respectively and v represents the real flow rate for the solution in the column the migration parameters for the four studied soils were calculated as presented in table 2 3 2 antimony breakthrough experiment in the soil column the breakthrough curves btcs from column experiments illustrate the extensive retention and low mobility of sb in the ferrosol complete retardation was observed in the soil columns following extended 1 pv 10 mg kg 1 and 100 mg kg 1 sb input pulses figs 4 and 5 no penetration peak was observed in the ferrosol indicating that the retention capacity of the ferrosol was strongest of the studied soils and almost all sb input was adsorbed by soil the sb was thus unable to penetrate the soil column in the sb breakthrough experiment the input of the sb was 0 2 mg in fig 4 and 2 mg in fig 5 the input of the sb for ferrosol in fig 5 was 42 mg the accumulation sb in the soil column was 99 94 for ferrosol 61 60 forprimosol 86 07 for isohumosol and 25 15 for sandy soil respectively in the 10 mg kg 1 sb input pulses the sb accumulation in the soil column was 82 50 for ferrosol 41 69 forprimosol 72 53 for isohumosol and 15 53 for sandy soil in the 100 mg kg 1 sb input pulses respectively the sb btcs exhibited extensive asymmetry as illustrated by the shape of the leaching concentrations fig 5 the breakthrough of sb from the ferrosol column showed an extremely long period of retardation 130 h after applying 100 mg kg 1 sb solution 20 pv the peak of sb concentration in the effluent was only about 70 of the applied concentration antimony btcs in ferrosol and isohumosol soil at 100 mg kg 1 sb were smoother than those for 10 mg kg 1 in contrast sb btcs in primosol and sandy soil at 100 mg kg 1 sb were similar to those in the 10 mg kg 1 influent the sb btcs under the 100 mg kg 1 condition were different to those in the 10 mg kg 1 condition the peak of the btc was much larger and the tailing phenomenon was more apparent the sb migrated fastest in the sandy soil and there was no smearing desorption curve indicating that the adsorption of sb in the penetration was weak the sb penetration rate of the four soils increased in the order ferrosol isohumosol primosol sandy soil in both the 10 mg kg 1 and 100 mg kg 1 conditions the sb btcs in sandy soil and primosol were similar but the peak was lower in the primosol than in the sandy soil and a slight tailing phenomenon was observed indicating greater sb retention in the primosol than in the sandy soil the sb btcs in the isohumosol were substantially different to those of the other three soils the peak of the btc was much smoother and the tailing phenomenon was more apparent the shapes of the btcs from primosol were dramatically different from those of isohumosol reflecting an intrinsic difference in soil properties the transport of sb in isohumosol soil at 100 mg kg 1 sb showed a diffuse btc shape characterized by gradual increase of sb concentration to approximately 40 of the input concentration after 90 h in addition the excessive trailing phenomenon exhibited by column btcs demonstrated a continued slow desorption release of sb from soils zhang et al 2014 the smooth peak strong retardation and extensive tailing or slow release during leaching are features of strong adsorption of sb in the transport process ferrosols with high adsorption capacity exhibit a substantially higher retardation than the other three soils in addition the isohumosol btc had a similar shape to the btcs from the column experiments of zhang et al 2014 for soils with similar soil properties to those of the current study analyses of specific surface area and pore size distribution show that the soil specific surface area of the ferrosol was much greater than that of the other soils a larger specific surface area can cause the sb to be adsorbed by the soil particle leading to a much slower sb migration rate guo et al 2014 the soil specific surface area of the isohumosol was much greater than those of the primosol and the sandy soil causing the sb migration rate to be much slower in the isohumosol than the primosol and the sandy soil the high fe contents in the ferrosol and high organic matter in isohumosol may decrease the mobility of sb in these soils shangguan et al 2016 li et al 2018 indicated that exogenous sb iii was adsorbed onto soils first rapidly and then more slowly after adsorption large proportions of sb in isohumosol remained mobilizable and could be desorbed slowly this may explain the different shape of the btc in the sb at 10 mg kg 1 and 100 mg kg 1 the breakthrough time for the isohumosol was much longer in fig 5 than fig 4 and the long breakthrough time caused the sb to adsorb more strongly after the input sb was adsorbed by the isohumosol the mobilizable sb was washed out slowly in the leachate compared with the sb concentration in the leachate there was more substantial sb desorption in fig 4 producing a smoother btc of isohumosolthan that in fig 5 3 3 migration of sb in soil simulated by convection dispersion model the parameters used in the simulation porosity dry bulk density saturated water content rainfall plant absorption coefficient and evaporation were derived from this study detailed information can be found in our former study shangguan et al 2016 table 3 the simulated sb content in soil showed the highest correlation with the observed data in the ferrosol r 2 0 98 second in the primosol r 2 0 92 followed by the isohumosol and sandy soil with r 2 of 0 79 and 0 38 respectively fig 6 among these the measured sb concentrations of surface soil 0 2 cm soil depth were as follows ferrosol 46 44 mg kg 1 primosol 27 15 mg kg 1 isohumosol 28 45 mg kg 1 and sandy soil 16 51 mg kg 1 the sb concentration calculated by the model was 45 44 23 165 24 8 and 9 0 mg kg 1 for the ferrosol primosol isohumosol and sandy soil respectively it has been previously reported murciego et al 2007 that sb is strongly adsorbed by clays and fe hydroxides the ferrosol contained more clays and fe hydroxides than the other soils shangguan et al 2016 so most of the sb was retained in the surface layer which agreed with the results of other studies hou et al 2013 yang et al 2015 as well as clays and fe hydroxides soil organic matter also adsorbed sb in the isohumosol the potential for sb to migrate through soil at small arms firing ranges has been found to increase as the soil ph increases martin et al 2013 the r 2 of the model simulations of isohumosol primosol and ferrosol were all higher than that of sandy soil in the observations the peak sb concentration in sandy soil occurred in the surface soil and at 20 25 cm soil depth but the predicted peak value was found at 2 4 cm soil depth the sb concentrations of the other layers in sandy soil were apparently higher than the background value and peak values were not detected however the sb concentration distribution in soil lower than 20 cm based on the model calculation included average values and there was a small peak value and little variation the predicted sb concentrations were between 1 5 and 3 6 mg kg 1 but the actual measurement concentration was between 0 3 and 17 8 mg kg 1 therefore the model was less able to predict sb migration in deep layers than in surface layers the sb migration in soil was calculated by the convection diffusion model and the results agreed with the actual measurement based on the convection diffusion equation with r 2 values of 0 38 0 98 the convection dispersion model and adsorption model can be used to predict the sb migration in soil when pollutants in surface soil were only added to the lysimeter surface layer the concentration was 1080 mg kg 1 the concentration of pollutants in the surface 0 5 cm of soil was equal to the added concentration and with the leaching experiment the sb concentration in the surface soil began to decline fig 7 there was little sb in the exchangeable fraction in the surface soil whereas most sb was relatively stable with poor mobility which agrees with previous research fu et al 2016 therefore the decline in sb concentration was not rapid the sb concentration at 0 2 cm soil depth began to decline in the first year of leaching while the sb concentration remained steady at soil depths lower than 2 cm in the following year leaching began to influence soil deeper than 2 cm with the increase of leaching time soil in deeper layers began to be influenced by the leaching treatment and the soil sb concentration also began to decline after leaching for 4 years soil deeper than 4 cm also began to be influenced by leaching and the sb concentration in soil began to decline this prediction suggests that sb added to the surface soil was stable and had lower migration risk towards deeper soil we also calculated the potential ecological risk with the method of hakanson 1980 the results show that on the surface of the ferrosol primosol and isohumosol there was a very high potential ecological risk for sb the potential ecological risk for the three soils mainly occurred at the soil surface whereas for the deep soil profile there was a low to moderate potential ecological risk in contrast for the sandy soil there was only high potential ecological risk for sb at the soil surface and the deep soil also had a high potential ecological risk for sb the potential ecological risk assessment by the measured and the simulated values by the convection diffusion model were similar for the four soils the potential ecological risk assessment results by the model for the sandy soil was much larger for the sb in the soil profile of 20 25 cm than the measured values the convection dispersion model simulated the variation of sb in soil solution fig 8 the sb concentration in soil solution in the surface soil was much higher than at other soil depths in the four soils of the studied soils sandy soil had the highest sb concentration in the soil surface at 0 65 mg l 1 subsequently the concentration declined rapidly with increasing depth however when the depth approached 10 cm the sb concentration in sandy soil maintained a range between 0 5 and 0 65 mg l 1 later with the increasing leaching time the sb concentration in the surface of the sandy soil declined rapidly but the sb concentration in deeper soil began to increase after a decade the sb concentration in sandy soil 50 cm soil depth increased to about 0 2 mg l 1 but the sb concentration declined gradually in deeper soil the variation of sb concentration in the other soil types was consistent with that of the sandy soil but the variation of sb concentration in deeper soil of ferrosol and isohumosol was smaller than that of the sandy soil this could be caused by the strong sb adsorption capacity in ferrosol and isohumosol shangguan et al 2016 in contrast the sb concentration was higher in surface soil and deeper soil in the primosol in the first year of leaching the sb concentration in surface soil was about 0 47 mg l 1 but the sb concentration in soil below 20 cm was about 0 18 mg l 1 the sb concentration in the surface layer was higher in the sandy soil and the primosol than that in the ferrosol and isohumosol but the sb concentration in primosol soil solution was the highest in the deeper layer because the primosol had a weak sb adsorption capacity in the surface layer the sb concentration was higher in the surface layer however sb migration in deeper soil was mainly in the colloid bound state painter et al 2004 thus the sb concentration in primosol was higher than that in sandy soil in deeper soil 3 4 soil sb concentration simulated by the ann model the number of data points for ferrosol isohumosol primosol and sandy soil was 98 87 86 and 91 respectively among these data 80 was training data and 20 was taken as test data the ann model can be used to explain the variation of 86 97 of training data and r 2 of the test data was 0 78 0 90 supplementary materials the ann model can fit the sb concentration in soil solution accurately there was clear variation of the sb concentration in soil after 30 years it could still reach 1 3 mg l 1 in sandy soil at below 1 m soil depth which was much higher than the other soils fig 9 in soil solution of the other soil types the sb concentration was lower than 0 2 mg l 1 in the ferrosol the sb concentration gradually declined between 5 and 40 cm soil depth the sb concentration gradually migrated to deeper layers at below 40 cm soil depth there was no clear variation in the ferrosol in the primosol the sb concentration increased initially and then declined at soil depths below 40 cm below 40 cm there was no clear variation in the primosol in the isohumosol the sb concentration gradually declined at soil depths below 5 cm increased at soil depths below 20 cm and then declined again in deeper soil layers in the sandy soil the sb concentration gradually increased from 5 to 30 years the sb migration in sand was rapid because the sandy soil has a weak sb adsorption capacity the quantity of rainfall in the ferrosol was much higher than the other soils which caused the sb concentration to be higher in surface soil however the sb concentration in the ferrosol was unable to migrate to the soil profile deeper than 40 cm the variation of sb was low in isohumosol because this soil had a strong adsorption capacity for sb little variation was observed in the sandy soil and isohumosol indicating a weak sb adsorption ability for the sandy soil and isohumosol in general long term variation of the sb concentration simulated by the ann model was poor but in the short term the results agreed with the actual measurements overall the sb concentration declined along with the increase of depth however as the leaching time increased fluctuations occurred with a large amplitude compared with the convection dispersion model long term simulation in deeper soil by the ann model was not accurate and it showed substantial fluctuations this was determined by the model structure simulated results were credible only within the scope of the near training variables simulation and values should not be outside a certain level of variation that is not covered by the training variables however in a long term simulation we need to further check the model we need to test data continuously and conduct validations to adapt the model therefore long term leaching experiments and data verification studies are needed to ensure the accuracy of the ann model 4 conclusions the experimentally observed migration of sb in soil can fit to the ann model or the convection dispersion model results with the fitting of the ann model showed that sb migration in sand was rapid because the sandy soil has a weak sb adsorption capacity whereas ferrosol soil had a strong sb adsorption capacity and sb migration in the ferrosol was slow after 4 years of leaching the migration distance was less than 40 cm and the migration of sb increased in the order sandy soil primosol isohumosol ferrosol variation of the sb concentration simulated by the ann model was poor but the results agreed with the observations in the short term overall the sb concentration declined along with increasing soil depth however as the leaching duration increased fluctuations occurred with large amplitude compared with the convection dispersion model the ann model has the advantage of fast fitting speed but the error of the simulated results was large in long term simulation however the convection dispersion model can be used to explain the migration of sb in soil the sb migration could be divided into two parts real solution and colloid bound state the former was mainly controlled by soil adsorption and the latter by migration in the in colloid bound state the sb concentration in soil and soil solution were all simulated by the convection dispersion model comparison between simulated and measured values revealed that in long term simulation errors were small in the convection dispersion model and it was close to the actual measurement results the simulated data in convection dispersion model were strongly correlated with measured values r 2 between 0 38 and 0 98 according to our model sb has different migration behaviors in different soils and attention should be paid to high risk behavior especially in primosol and sandy soil conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements this study was

25167,the intergovernmental panel on climate change anticipates increasing extreme rain events in the 21st century leading to more frequent floods and more phosphorus transported into lakes enhancing the risk of their eutrophication this paper reports research assessing this risk on lake bourget in france by coupling a statistical estimation of annual phosphorus transportation from annual rainfall and a dynamical model estimating the evolution of the phosphorus concentration in the lake in the period 2000 2050 according to yearly phosphorus transportation the study of the model on the past suggests that the relative drought of the 2000s has fostered the effect of management measures to reduce phosphorus loading enabling compliance with the organisation for economic co operation and development guidance target for 2020 simulations on different scenarios for the future show that a 10 increase in the rainfall standard deviation nearly doubles the probability of eutrophication from 2 40 to 4 26 between 2016 and 2050 keywords lake eutrophication phosphorus dynamics rainfall variability regime shift 1 introduction human activities often disrupt the dynamics of ecosystems folke et al 2004 johnson and st laurent 2011 discharges from agricultural spraying and industrial waste which find their way into tributary waters may cause lakes to shift from oligotrophic to eutrophic state where clear water becomes turbid due to algal blooms favored by excessive phosphorus p concentration carpenter 2005 sharpley 1993 pote et al 1996 lake eutrophication has substantial economic costs bennett et al 1999 carpenter et al 1998 for instance losses attributed to lake front property values and recreational use of united states of america freshwaters were put at approximately 2 2 billion a year dodds et al 2009 moreover reducing p intake is not always enough to recover oligotrophic state and some cases require additional interventions on lake internal mechanisms nrc 1992 however these operations are not always effective or feasible and may be difficult in practice as shown by the relapse of the bio manipulated lake zwemlust in the netherlands six years after its cleaning van donk and gulati 1995 climate change directly impacts eutrophication jeppesen et al 2007 scheffer and carpenter 2003 for instance rising temperatures fosters rainfall instead of snowfall during winter causing greater soil leaching which has implications for the magnitude of p transport woodbury and shoemaker 2013 górniak and piekarski 2002 however interactions between climate change and eutrophication are complex and projections are somewhat contradictory as climate influenced processes have interacting and often opposing effects fig 1 a temperature increase would intensify p diffusion from deep sediments but also increase p sedimentation and these two flows may have compensatory effects on p concentration bryhn et al 2010 changes in temperatures and wind may have compensatory effects with a modest overall impact on p concentration according to the ipcc the frequency of heavy rainfall is likely to increase ipcc 2013 some studies have been done on the role played by the rainfall variability in dryland plant ecosystems borgogno et al 2007 african savannas synodinos et al 2018 or australian reservoir linden et al 2004 rainfall variability could affect water quality by increasing pollutant loads flushed into rivers due to soil erosion when there is the potential for floods land use becomes a key driver of p loading to lakes fraterrigo and downing 2008 intensive rainfall could significantly increase the risk of eutrophication due to higher p leaching from manure application xue et al 2013 when external inputs are the main form of loading such as in agricultural watershed rainfall is a key driver of p transport correll et al 1999 since drought periods will be drier and wet periods will be wetter arnell et al 2014 inter annual variability in rainfall is set to increase the main aim of the paper is to evaluate the effect of one proxy of climate change rainfall on lake eutrophication specifically the impact of inter annual rainfall variability on the quality of the lake water is studied in what follows the variability in rainfall is characterized by an increase of rainfall standard deviation with mean rainfall remaining the same for this purpose two relationships are clearly defined rainfall p loading and p loading p concentration in the lake these relationships are modeled and calibrated on the data from lake bourget in the french alps once the models are calibrated two prospective scenarios are analyzed a low rainfall variability equivalent to the rainfall variability in the 20th century and an increase of inter annual rainfall variability as suggested by the ipcc arnell et al 2014 for each scenario the dynamics of p concentration in the lake until 2050 is calculated results show that low rainfall variability has limited effects on the probability of eutrophication in the short and long term however projections show that a 10 increase in rainfall variability increases the probability of eutrophication from 2 40 to 4 26 between 2016 and 2050 2 methods 2 1 lake bourget case study of eutrophication mitigation lake bourget is the biggest lake located entirely within france the lake is located in the french alps at the southernmost end of the jura mountains in the department of savoie latitude 45 44 n longitude 5 52 e its maximum length is 18 km and its surface area is 44 5 km2 the water volume is 3 6 109 m3 the lake s mean depth is 80 m and its maximum depth is 147 m the epilimnion ranges from 0 m to 10 m while the hypolimnion ranges from 80 m to 140 m the water residence time is about 14 years two main tributaries flow into the lake the leysse river and the sierroz river they are responsible for 80 of the water inflow the three smaller inflows are the tillet the belle eau and chautagne canal the primary outflow is the savières canal flowing into the rhône which also minimally contributes to the incoming flow jacquet 2015 lake bourget s catchment is largely composed of forest and semi natural areas 48 furthermore 32 of the catchment area is being used for agriculture activity which is the main source of p loading magni and chinaglia 2008 the watershed area is about 560 km2 including the urban areas of aix les bains and chambéry lake bourget has suffered heavy p discharges since the 1960s leading to its eutrophication vincon leite et al 1995 in 1974 the amount of incoming p in the lake reached 300 tons annually several measures have since been taken to reduce the eutrophication of lake bourget vinçon leite et al 2006 rivera rocabado jacquet et al 2017 the main objective was to reduce p loading to 30 tons per year and keep p concentration in the lake under a threshold of 10 μg l 1 i e 36 tons of p in the lake considering the lake volume as a constant in order to limit eutrophication in particular a 12 km gallery treating effluent station was set up in 1980 in order to prevent the effluents of water treatment plants to be rejected into the lake this measure lightens the mass of p ending up in the lake the last major project to date is the construction of a polluted water retention basin lake bourget is monitored by the comité intersyndical pour l assainissement du lac du bourget cisalb the intersyndical committee to clean up the lake which regularly collects physical chemical data by measurements made in different places of the lake the samples are taken far from the main tributaries at different levels of depth the annual in lake p concentration is estimated by the p concentration during the winter mix when the temperature of the water column is homogeneous in addition the tributary monitoring stations upstream of the lake record p loading concentration fig 2 the sierroz and the leysse account for the majority of p loading to complete incoming balances the cisalb takes into account the p from the tillet about 5 of total volume transited to the lake and direct discharges to the lake including the discharge of mixed water by the aix les bains combined sewer to the storm overflow of biâtres the meteorological data comes from the meteo france station located at the south end of the lake since 2004 annual reports give the data used in this work summed up in table 1 the ecological state of the lake today is healthy progressing towards being oligotrophic measurement surveys give 150 tons of incoming p in 1983 and 94 tons of incoming p in 1994 1995 lake bourget is a successful example of re oligotrophication since p mass has been lower than 60 tons from the early 2000s despite the current good ecological state of the lake some elements undermine the cisalb results frequent blooms of toxic cyanobacteria plantothrix rubescens appear and a microcystis bloom was observed in 2014 this suggests that the current state of the lake is unstable jacquet 2015 indeed adverse weather conditions may load p to the lake and exceed the regulatory threshold in addition the mechanics of lag release of p stored in sediments may also deteriorate the state of the lake 2 2 modelling the relationship between rainfall and p loading in the lake since the beginning of the 2000s and the end of major measures to clean up the lake p loading has stagnated cisalb studies show that over 90 of p loading is as a result of rainfall events with over 50 of p loading brought by the main floods these floods cause soil leaching where p is transported from fertilized agricultural soils to surface water via flowing water which explains the unusually high p concentrations in the water during these periods annual rainfall may be used as an indicator of p loading as changes in rainfall lead to changes in p loading the pearson correlation between annual rainfall and p loading on data from 2004 to 2016 is 0 66 showing a good degree of linear dependence as shown in fig 3 this correlation leads us to suppose that soil leaching in times of rain is the major source of p loading the study of lake champlain which is also subject to microcystis blooms also shows a strong correlation between rainfall and p loading fortin et al 2015 the recent period of low rainfall and decrease in p input confirmed the correlation between p and rainfall the main sources of p are the inflowing streams coming from the leysse and the sierroz rivers this study neglects diffuse soil p which ends up in the lake a linear model is applied as in ockenden et al 2016 who found a strong linear relationship between total rainfall and total p load in catchments suggesting that the non linear effects are small compared to the variability in event rainfall the p loading at year t is denoted l t and can be written as a linear function of rainfall level at year t denoted r t 1 l t α r t β the cisalb annual reports rivera rocabado jacquet et al 2017 give annual p loading and annual rainfall from 2004 to 2016 p data before 2004 is difficult to exploit because of the sparsity of the studies and therefore is not taken into account in this study a linear regression gives the parameters α and β of the relationship between rainfall and p loading rainfall is assumed to follow a normal distribution based on the measures from 2004 to 2016 μ r 1154 and σ r 178 2 the hypothesis of a normal distribution is rejected neither by the lilliefors test p 0 68 nor by the jarque bera test p 0 59 2 3 modelling the eutrophication dynamics with the relationship between rainfall and p loading in the lake established the impact of p loading on in lake p concentration can then be assessed through modeling many models study p dynamics by separating epilimnion from hypolimnion dynamics lung et al 1976 and the different p phases malmaeus and håkanson 2004 some of them were built for a specific lake and are not reusable without the same set of parameters vigiak et al 2012 a monthly dynamical model developed for lake bourget yields concentrations and flows in three water layers bryhn et al 2010 this study presents a model that incorporates an annual p dynamics developed by carpenter et al 1999 and used in rougé et al 2013 two state variables are used the whole mass of p present in the lake noted p and p loading l fig 1 the model is built from the analogous equation for p 2 dp dt l s h p r p q p q m q where s is rate of sedimentation h is rate of out flooding p r is maximal mass of p recycled by sediments q is the exponent of the recycling curve depending on the type of the lake and m is the p mass for which recycling reaches half of the maximal rate there are interactions between these processes so the differential equation has to account for the possibility of several sedimentation and recycling events during a single year the mass of p in the lake at t 1 p t 1 is obtained as a function of p t and l t by using the matlab function ode45 based on an explicit runge kutta 4 5 formula the reports available give annual p in the lake and annual p loading is estimated from rainfall r according to the linear model the outflow rate h is supposed to be fixed at 0 12 yr 1 the parameters s r q and m are calibrated by using an exhaustive training validation method avoiding over fitting the 12 data points p t r t p t 1 between 2004 and 2015 are divided into two sets a training set 7 points and a validation set 5 points the training set is used to calibrate the model by using the matlab function lsqcurvefit the root mean squared error rmse between the validation set and the projections is computed the parameters that minimized the rmse onto the validation set among all couple of training validation sets is selected 3 results 3 1 model calibration for the relationship between r t and l t the calibration gives α 0 0498 and β 23 693 with a global rmse of 10 7 the p value is 0 0151 for the annual p dynamics

agreement with carpenter et al 1999 because q is close to 2 for deep lakes but around 20 in a shallow lake using the full model eqs 1 and 2 p concentrations are simulated from 2004 to 2016 using only the data from 2004 and the rainfall data from 2004 to 2016 see fig 4 measured and projected in lake p level showed good agreement corroborating the use of p loading as a linear function of rainfall level 3 2 tipping points warning p level in the lake has continued to decrease since the early 2000s oecd norms consider the state of the lake as oligotrophic if in lake p level is below 40 tons this p threshold is calculated from the vollenweider model paris 1982 that can be readily used by managers and technical personnel with limited limnological knowledge studying the equilibrium states of our model provides information on the risks of coming close to a tipping point fig 5 the precipitation p representation is interesting in terms of management as the recorded rainfall is generally more accessible indicator than p loading the stability of the low equilibrium declines as rainfall r approaches 1402 mm because the bifurcation point is approached when r 1402 mm the concentration of p jumps to high values once the mass of p in the lake has reached high values of equilibrium rainfall has to be below r 1196 mm to recover low equilibria if rainfall does not decrease the transition can be irreversible the oecd norm on maximum p in the lake fits well with the model which gives a threshold of 42 tons this threshold corresponds to the boundary between oligotrophic states and mesotrophic states in addition a second threshold 89 tons is fixed above which the amount of p in the lake is in the range of the upper equilibria corresponding to the boundary between mesotrophic and eutrophic states 3 3 impact of rainfall variability on p trajectories 3 3 1 a relative drought accelerates the decrease of phosphorus concentration in the lake in 2015 the level of p in the lake reached the oecd threshold this study investigates the role of the 2004 2011 drought on this result for this purpose potential lake trajectories are computed starting from 2004 according to the annual loading hazards the input of the model each year are p present in the lake in the previous year and p loading drawn randomly from rainfall distribution which is normal with μ r 1154 and σ r 178 2 based on the 2004 2016 measures the time series of p t and r t then represent the lake s trajectory results are reported in fig 6 the main result is that current p concentration is lower than the median p concentration in 2016 forecasted by the model which suggests that this recent drought helped improve the water quality consecutive years of low rainfall have allowed the dynamics of the lake to rapidly reach the low equilibria p loading level and p present in the lake are on a trajectory to reach the cisalb recommended values qualifying the state of the lake as oligotrophic 3 3 2 long term projection scenario of change in rainfall variability until 2050 here the correlation between rainfall and p loading is used to study the potential impact of increased rainfall variability on the state of the lake a change in the inter annual rainfall variability results in a change of standard deviation of p loading two scenarios are studied the nominal scenario in which rainfall r follows a normal distribution with the same standard deviation σ r 206 as in the 1974 2016 period the high rainfall variability scenario with a linear increase of 0 294 per year of σ r which means a rise of 10 in 2050 this scenario is built for highlighting the increased risk of extreme events caused by climate change arnell et al 2014 a greater inter annual rainfall variability thus illustrates the succession of years of severe drought and years of high floods for both scenarios annual mean rainfall level is assumed to be the same i e μ r 1248 it corresponds to the average of inter annual precipitation for the 1974 2016 period the higher rainfall intensity on wet days offsets the decrease in number of these days observed in europe which results in a negligible change in expected annual rainfall amount dankers and hiederer 2008 and allows us to focus on the impact of inter annual variability in rainfall the parameters of these scenarios are summarized in table 3 after running the model the probability of the nominal scenario leading to lake eutrophication is about 2 40 in the long term cleaning operations conducted by the cisalb made the lake strong enough to withstand disturbances since median p in the lake is around 25 tons after 2020 according to both scenarios figs 7 and 8 3 3 3 potential instability due to changes in rainfall variability table 3 reports the mean residence time in each of the three domains according to scenario on average the p influx during rainy weather is not sufficient to shift the lake from a mesotrophic or oligotrophic regime to a eutrophic regime the dynamics tends to stabilize the in lake p towards low equilibria however increasing the inter annual rainfall variability increases the risk of seeing the state of the lake being drawn to the high equilibria change in variability affects the probability of reaching the eutrophic domain from 2 40 to 4 26 the probability of eutrophication although low increases significantly between the two scenarios therefore with several consecutive years of high rainfall the dynamics may lead to a eutrophic regime fig 8 likewise this phenomenon can be reversed by years of drought the dynamics leads the state of the lake towards the low equilibria 4 discussion there are mitigation strategies to limit the consequences of soil leaching during consecutive years of wet weather the main option is to create an interface to limit direct p discharges from farms numerous wetlands including sedimentation basins or infiltration basins make potential interfaces schoumans et al 2014 having a buffer zone or riparian buffer acting as a filter and capturing p in runoff may be effective to enhance water quality borin et al 2005 the retention efficiencies vary from 36 70 from forested buffers to 73 79 from combined grass and woody buffers hawes and smith 2005 effective measure would be to avoid fertilizer application when heavy rain is likely hoffmann et al 2009 other changes in land use schoumans et al 2014 such as avoiding high intensity tillage may protect lake tributaries against from receiving p losses from agricultural soils hansen et al 2000 however exploratory models have shown that situations with high natural variability could lead farmers to use p more intensively janssen 2001 as global change sharpens the pressure on farms to be profitable ekholm and lehtoranta 2012 therefore in addition to rainfall variability the mitigation measures and the practices in the farms also need to be taken into account our model does not include these possible evolutions at farm level and its quantitative results should be considered with caution also because it is based on a small dataset however the observed qualitative trend is clear in the long term an increase in rainfall variability is likely to increase the probability of eutrophication the model could be improved by calibrating it on a larger series of data whose availability is a classic challenge in ecosystem management or by adding mechanisms such as the passive diffusion of p from soil other variables may also be included in the model such as chlorophyll a or luminosity it might also be relevant to develop a model that would account for other effects of climate change such as surface water temperature variations which affect the development of algal blooms in summer periods furthermore a time step smaller than the year may give relevant additional information on the system for instance a monthly model could account for the temporal distribution of floods during the year indeed two rainy events close in time do not leach the soil like the same two events separated by a long interval merceron 1999 5 conclusion the effect of increasing the variability of inter annual rainfall on the eutrophication of lake bourget has been investigated a dynamical model of p concentration in the lake is studied where its equilibria help determine trophic thresholds the probability of lake eutrophication is assessed by running a large number of simulations with sequences of rainfall at variability levels drawn at random short term simulations showed a stabilization of lake state below the oecd recommendations and suggest that the recent drought favoured this stabilization process in the long term an increase in rainfall variability is likely to increase the probability of eutrophication finally the approach adopted here can be adapted to other socio ecological systems in order to evaluate how the increasing frequency of extreme events impacts the services that these

25167,the intergovernmental panel on climate change anticipates increasing extreme rain events in the 21st century leading to more frequent floods and more phosphorus transported into lakes enhancing the risk of their eutrophication this paper reports research assessing this risk on lake bourget in france by coupling a statistical estimation of annual phosphorus transportation from annual rainfall and a dynamical model estimating the evolution of the phosphorus concentration in the lake in the period 2000 2050 according to yearly phosphorus transportation the study of the model on the past suggests that the relative drought of the 2000s has fostered the effect of management measures to reduce phosphorus loading enabling compliance with the organisation for economic co operation and development guidance target for 2020 simulations on different scenarios for the future show that a 10 increase in the rainfall standard deviation nearly doubles the probability of eutrophication from 2 40 to 4 26 between 2016 and 2050 keywords lake eutrophication phosphorus dynamics rainfall variability regime shift 1 introduction human activities often disrupt the dynamics of ecosystems folke et al 2004 johnson and st laurent 2011 discharges from agricultural spraying and industrial waste which find their way into tributary waters may cause lakes to shift from oligotrophic to eutrophic state where clear water becomes turbid due to algal blooms favored by excessive phosphorus p concentration carpenter 2005 sharpley 1993 pote et al 1996 lake eutrophication has substantial economic costs bennett et al 1999 carpenter et al 1998 for instance losses attributed to lake front property values and recreational use of united states of america freshwaters were put at approximately 2 2 billion a year dodds et al 2009 moreover reducing p intake is not always enough to recover oligotrophic state and some cases require additional interventions on lake internal mechanisms nrc 1992 however these operations are not always effective or feasible and may be difficult in practice as shown by the relapse of the bio manipulated lake zwemlust in the netherlands six years after its cleaning van donk and gulati 1995 climate change directly impacts eutrophication jeppesen et al 2007 scheffer and carpenter 2003 for instance rising temperatures fosters rainfall instead of snowfall during winter causing greater soil leaching which has implications for the magnitude of p transport woodbury and shoemaker 2013 górniak and piekarski 2002 however interactions between climate change and eutrophication are complex and projections are somewhat contradictory as climate influenced processes have interacting and often opposing effects fig 1 a temperature increase would intensify p diffusion from deep sediments but also increase p sedimentation and these two flows may have compensatory effects on p concentration bryhn et al 2010 changes in temperatures and wind may have compensatory effects with a modest overall impact on p concentration according to the ipcc the frequency of heavy rainfall is likely to increase ipcc 2013 some studies have been done on the role played by the rainfall variability in dryland plant ecosystems borgogno et al 2007 african savannas synodinos et al 2018 or australian reservoir linden et al 2004 rainfall variability could affect water quality by increasing pollutant loads flushed into rivers due to soil erosion when there is the potential for floods land use becomes a key driver of p loading to lakes fraterrigo and downing 2008 intensive rainfall could significantly increase the risk of eutrophication due to higher p leaching from manure application xue et al 2013 when external inputs are the main form of loading such as in agricultural watershed rainfall is a key driver of p transport correll et al 1999 since drought periods will be drier and wet periods will be wetter arnell et al 2014 inter annual variability in rainfall is set to increase the main aim of the paper is to evaluate the effect of one proxy of climate change rainfall on lake eutrophication specifically the impact of inter annual rainfall variability on the quality of the lake water is studied in what follows the variability in rainfall is characterized by an increase of rainfall standard deviation with mean rainfall remaining the same for this purpose two relationships are clearly defined rainfall p loading and p loading p concentration in the lake these relationships are modeled and calibrated on the data from lake bourget in the french alps once the models are calibrated two prospective scenarios are analyzed a low rainfall variability equivalent to the rainfall variability in the 20th century and an increase of inter annual rainfall variability as suggested by the ipcc arnell et al 2014 for each scenario the dynamics of p concentration in the lake until 2050 is calculated results show that low rainfall variability has limited effects on the probability of eutrophication in the short and long term however projections show that a 10 increase in rainfall variability increases the probability of eutrophication from 2 40 to 4 26 between 2016 and 2050 2 methods 2 1 lake bourget case study of eutrophication mitigation lake bourget is the biggest lake located entirely within france the lake is located in the french alps at the southernmost end of the jura mountains in the department of savoie latitude 45 44 n longitude 5 52 e its maximum length is 18 km and its surface area is 44 5 km2 the water volume is 3 6 109 m3 the lake s mean depth is 80 m and its maximum depth is 147 m the epilimnion ranges from 0 m to 10 m while the hypolimnion ranges from 80 m to 140 m the water residence time is about 14 years two main tributaries flow into the lake the leysse river and the sierroz river they are responsible for 80 of the water inflow the three smaller inflows are the tillet the belle eau and chautagne canal the primary outflow is the savières canal flowing into the rhône which also minimally contributes to the incoming flow jacquet 2015 lake bourget s catchment is largely composed of forest and semi natural areas 48 furthermore 32 of the catchment area is being used for agriculture activity which is the main source of p loading magni and chinaglia 2008 the watershed area is about 560 km2 including the urban areas of aix les bains and chambéry lake bourget has suffered heavy p discharges since the 1960s leading to its eutrophication vincon leite et al 1995 in 1974 the amount of incoming p in the lake reached 300 tons annually several measures have since been taken to reduce the eutrophication of lake bourget vinçon leite et al 2006 rivera rocabado jacquet et al 2017 the main objective was to reduce p loading to 30 tons per year and keep p concentration in the lake under a threshold of 10 μg l 1 i e 36 tons of p in the lake considering the lake volume as a constant in order to limit eutrophication in particular a 12 km gallery treating effluent station was set up in 1980 in order to prevent the effluents of water treatment plants to be rejected into the lake this measure lightens the mass of p ending up in the lake the last major project to date is the construction of a polluted water retention basin lake bourget is monitored by the comité intersyndical pour l assainissement du lac du bourget cisalb the intersyndical committee to clean up the lake which regularly collects physical chemical data by measurements made in different places of the lake the samples are taken far from the main tributaries at different levels of depth the annual in lake p concentration is estimated by the p concentration during the winter mix when the temperature of the water column is homogeneous in addition the tributary monitoring stations upstream of the lake record p loading concentration fig 2 the sierroz and the leysse account for the majority of p loading to complete incoming balances the cisalb takes into account the p from the tillet about 5 of total volume transited to the lake and direct discharges to the lake including the discharge of mixed water by the aix les bains combined sewer to the storm overflow of biâtres the meteorological data comes from the meteo france station located at the south end of the lake since 2004 annual reports give the data used in this work summed up in table 1 the ecological state of the lake today is healthy progressing towards being oligotrophic measurement surveys give 150 tons of incoming p in 1983 and 94 tons of incoming p in 1994 1995 lake bourget is a successful example of re oligotrophication since p mass has been lower than 60 tons from the early 2000s despite the current good ecological state of the lake some elements undermine the cisalb results frequent blooms of toxic cyanobacteria plantothrix rubescens appear and a microcystis bloom was observed in 2014 this suggests that the current state of the lake is unstable jacquet 2015 indeed adverse weather conditions may load p to the lake and exceed the regulatory threshold in addition the mechanics of lag release of p stored in sediments may also deteriorate the state of the lake 2 2 modelling the relationship between rainfall and p loading in the lake since the beginning of the 2000s and the end of major measures to clean up the lake p loading has stagnated cisalb studies show that over 90 of p loading is as a result of rainfall events with over 50 of p loading brought by the main floods these floods cause soil leaching where p is transported from fertilized agricultural soils to surface water via flowing water which explains the unusually high p concentrations in the water during these periods annual rainfall may be used as an indicator of p loading as changes in rainfall lead to changes in p loading the pearson correlation between annual rainfall and p loading on data from 2004 to 2016 is 0 66 showing a good degree of linear dependence as shown in fig 3 this correlation leads us to suppose that soil leaching in times of rain is the major source of p loading the study of lake champlain which is also subject to microcystis blooms also shows a strong correlation between rainfall and p loading fortin et al 2015 the recent period of low rainfall and decrease in p input confirmed the correlation between p and rainfall the main sources of p are the inflowing streams coming from the leysse and the sierroz rivers this study neglects diffuse soil p which ends up in the lake a linear model is applied as in ockenden et al 2016 who found a strong linear relationship between total rainfall and total p load in catchments suggesting that the non linear effects are small compared to the variability in event rainfall the p loading at year t is denoted l t and can be written as a linear function of rainfall level at year t denoted r t 1 l t α r t β the cisalb annual reports rivera rocabado jacquet et al 2017 give annual p loading and annual rainfall from 2004 to 2016 p data before 2004 is difficult to exploit because of the sparsity of the studies and therefore is not taken into account in this study a linear regression gives the parameters α and β of the relationship between rainfall and p loading rainfall is assumed to follow a normal distribution based on the measures from 2004 to 2016 μ r 1154 and σ r 178 2 the hypothesis of a normal distribution is rejected neither by the lilliefors test p 0 68 nor by the jarque bera test p 0 59 2 3 modelling the eutrophication dynamics with the relationship between rainfall and p loading in the lake established the impact of p loading on in lake p concentration can then be assessed through modeling many models study p dynamics by separating epilimnion from hypolimnion dynamics lung et al 1976 and the different p phases malmaeus and håkanson 2004 some of them were built for a specific lake and are not reusable without the same set of parameters vigiak et al 2012 a monthly dynamical model developed for lake bourget yields concentrations and flows in three water layers bryhn et al 2010 this study presents a model that incorporates an annual p dynamics developed by carpenter et al 1999 and used in rougé et al 2013 two state variables are used the whole mass of p present in the lake noted p and p loading l fig 1 the model is built from the analogous equation for p 2 dp dt l s h p r p q p q m q where s is rate of sedimentation h is rate of out flooding p r is maximal mass of p recycled by sediments q is the exponent of the recycling curve depending on the type of the lake and m is the p mass for which recycling reaches half of the maximal rate there are interactions between these processes so the differential equation has to account for the possibility of several sedimentation and recycling events during a single year the mass of p in the lake at t 1 p t 1 is obtained as a function of p t and l t by using the matlab function ode45 based on an explicit runge kutta 4 5 formula the reports available give annual p in the lake and annual p loading is estimated from rainfall r according to the linear model the outflow rate h is supposed to be fixed at 0 12 yr 1 the parameters s r q and m are calibrated by using an exhaustive training validation method avoiding over fitting the 12 data points p t r t p t 1 between 2004 and 2015 are divided into two sets a training set 7 points and a validation set 5 points the training set is used to calibrate the model by using the matlab function lsqcurvefit the root mean squared error rmse between the validation set and the projections is computed the parameters that minimized the rmse onto the validation set among all couple of training validation sets is selected 3 results 3 1 model calibration for the relationship between r t and l t the calibration gives α 0 0498 and β 23 693 with a global rmse of 10 7 the p value is 0 0151 for the annual p dynamics the following parameters are obtained and summarized in table 2 s 2 1476 yr 1 r 367 04 tons yr 1 q 2 222 and m 96 85 the training set 2004 2005 2008 2010 2012 2013 2014 and the validation set 2006 2007 2009 2011 2015 minimize the rmse on the validation dataset 6 28 the percent pbias on these training validation sets is 2 3239 indicating a slight overestimation bias the exponent q is in agreement with carpenter et al 1999 because q is close to 2 for deep lakes but around 20 in a shallow lake using the full model eqs 1 and 2 p concentrations are simulated from 2004 to 2016 using only the data from 2004 and the rainfall data from 2004 to 2016 see fig 4 measured and projected in lake p level showed good agreement corroborating the use of p loading as a linear function of rainfall level 3 2 tipping points warning p level in the lake has continued to decrease since the early 2000s oecd norms consider the state of the lake as oligotrophic if in lake p level is below 40 tons this p threshold is calculated from the vollenweider model paris 1982 that can be readily used by managers and technical personnel with limited limnological knowledge studying the equilibrium states of our model provides information on the risks of coming close to a tipping point fig 5 the precipitation p representation is interesting in terms of management as the recorded rainfall is generally more accessible indicator than p loading the stability of the low equilibrium declines as rainfall r approaches 1402 mm because the bifurcation point is approached when r 1402 mm the concentration of p jumps to high values once the mass of p in the lake has reached high values of equilibrium rainfall has to be below r 1196 mm to recover low equilibria if rainfall does not decrease the transition can be irreversible the oecd norm on maximum p in the lake fits well with the model which gives a threshold of 42 tons this threshold corresponds to the boundary between oligotrophic states and mesotrophic states in addition a second threshold 89 tons is fixed above which the amount of p in the lake is in the range of the upper equilibria corresponding to the boundary between mesotrophic and eutrophic states 3 3 impact of rainfall variability on p trajectories 3 3 1 a relative drought accelerates the decrease of phosphorus concentration in the lake in 2015 the level of p in the lake reached the oecd threshold this study investigates the role of the 2004 2011 drought on this result for this purpose potential lake trajectories are computed starting from 2004 according to the annual loading hazards the input of the model each year are p present in the lake in the previous year and p loading drawn randomly from rainfall distribution which is normal with μ r 1154 and σ r 178 2 based on the 2004 2016 measures the time series of p t and r t then represent the lake s trajectory results are reported in fig 6 the main result is that current p concentration is lower than the median p concentration in 2016 forecasted by the model which suggests that this recent drought helped improve the water quality consecutive years of low rainfall have allowed the dynamics of the lake to rapidly reach the low equilibria p loading level and p present in the lake are on a trajectory to reach the cisalb recommended values qualifying the state of the lake as oligotrophic 3 3 2 long term projection scenario of change in rainfall variability until 2050 here the correlation between rainfall and p loading is used to study the potential impact of increased rainfall variability on the state of the lake a change in the inter annual rainfall variability results in a change of standard deviation of p loading two scenarios are studied the nominal scenario in which rainfall r follows a normal distribution with the same standard deviation σ r 206 as in the 1974 2016 period the high rainfall variability scenario with a linear increase of 0 294 per year of σ r which means a rise of 10 in 2050 this scenario is built for highlighting the increased risk of extreme events caused by climate change arnell et al 2014 a greater inter annual rainfall variability thus illustrates the succession of years of severe drought and years of high floods for both scenarios annual mean rainfall level is assumed to be the same i e μ r 1248 it corresponds to the average of inter annual precipitation for the 1974 2016 period the higher rainfall intensity on wet days offsets the decrease in number of these days observed in europe which results in a negligible change in expected annual rainfall amount dankers and hiederer 2008 and allows us to focus on the impact of inter annual variability in rainfall the parameters of these scenarios are summarized in table 3 after running the model the probability of the nominal scenario leading to lake eutrophication is about 2 40 in the long term cleaning operations conducted by the cisalb made the lake strong enough to withstand disturbances since median p in the lake is around 25 tons after 2020 according to both scenarios figs 7 and 8 3 3 3 potential instability due to changes in rainfall variability table 3 reports the mean residence time in each of the three domains according to scenario on average the p influx during rainy weather is not sufficient to shift the lake from a mesotrophic or oligotrophic regime to a eutrophic regime the dynamics tends to stabilize the in lake p towards low equilibria however increasing the inter annual rainfall variability increases the risk of seeing the state of the lake being drawn to the high equilibria change in variability affects the probability of reaching the eutrophic domain from 2 40 to 4 26 the probability of eutrophication although low increases significantly between the two scenarios therefore with several consecutive years of high rainfall the dynamics may lead to a eutrophic regime fig 8 likewise this phenomenon can be reversed by years of drought the dynamics leads the state of the lake towards the low equilibria 4 discussion there are mitigation strategies to limit the consequences of soil leaching during consecutive years of wet weather the main

25168,non spatial ecological networks provide insight into the organization and interaction between biological entities more recently biological dispersal is modelled using spatial networks static sets of georeferenced habitat patches that connect based on a species maximum dispersal distance however dispersal is complex where spatial patterns at the landscape scale emerge from interactions between ecological entities and landscape features at much finer individual scales agent based modelling abm is a computational representation of complex systems capable of capturing this complexity therefore this study develops a network abm n abm that combines network and complex systems theory to simulate complex evolving spatial networks the developed n abm approach is implemented on the case study of the emerald ash borer eab bark beetle using geospatial datasets in ontario canada the n abm generates dynamic spatial network structures that emerge from interactions between the eab and tree agents at the individual scale the resulting networks are analyzed using graph theory measures analysis of the results indicates a relationship between preferential attachment in insect host selection and the emergent scale free network structure the n abm approach can be used to represent dynamic ecological networks and provides insight into how network structure emerges from eab dispersal dynamics useful for forest management keywords network agent based modeling spatial networks ecological complex systems geographic information systems forest insect infestation emerald ash borer 1 introduction ecologists are largely concerned with the scientific analysis of interactions among species and their environment agrawal et al 2007 to study these interactions ecological systems are often presented as networks where the network s nodes represent biological entities and the network s links represent some form of ecological interaction sets of ecological interactions are traditionally represented as non spatial networks and are most commonly grouped into three ecological network types including food webs cohen 1978 hall and raffaelli 1993 host parasitoid webs muller et al 1999 morris et al 2004 and mutualistic webs jordano 1987 stang et al 2006 graph theory a mathematical characterization of networks can then be used as a tool to characterize ecological network topology cross compare between network structures to find common ground and uniqueness and understand how network structures affect network dynamics and vice versa ings et al 2009 because ecological interactions take place in geographic space and time it is argued that the framework of ecological networks must also account for these contexts fortuna and bascompte 2007 landscape connectivity graphs were one of the first efforts to represent ecological phenomena as networks in an explicitly geospatial context urban and keitt 2001 using orthophotos or classified maps habitat patches are abstracted as nodes that are embedded in geographic space the formation of links between nodes signifies the potential dispersal from one habitat patch to another since long dispersal distances come at a greater cost i e energy time the connectivity between two nodes is typically a function of proximity or adjacency meaning nodes that are closer to one another have a higher probability of connecting in these network representations there are minimal data requirements needing only the geographic location of habitat patches and maximum dispersal distance of the species of interest minor and urban 2007 the structure of the landscape connectivity graphs can inform species dispersal patterns identify keystone patches that are critical to landscape connectivity and furthermore assess how dispersal patterns would change in response to disruptions in the network for example fortuna et al 2006 develop a network of ponds to identify the spatial structure of amphibian dispersal and the species persistence in drought in another study bunn et al 2000 compare landscape connectivity between two species that share the same habitat and find that the landscape is connected for one and disconnected for the other presenting implications for conservation biology despite the potential network approaches that leverage graph theory for the study of ecological systems in a geospatial context mostly represent ecological systems at the landscape species scale as a fixed network structure on which dispersal takes place fortuna et al 2006 although useful spatial ecological networks at this scale are limited in their ability to account for the complexity in emergent dispersal patterns which often develop from local spatio temporal dynamics between individuals and their environment with a few exceptions spatial ecological networks are rarely scaled down to the individual species scale and as such it is challenging to make this link between network structure and network dynamics dupont et al 2011 additionally data capturing spatio temporal dynamics at the individual scale between large sets of heterogeneous individuals and across large spatial extents is not typically available for many types of ecological phenomena furthermore field studies to acquire this data is expensive and time consuming minor and urban 2007 as such the development of an experimental setting to better understand the connections between network structure and network dynamics is needed stouffer et al 2010 agent based models abm are computational representations of complex systems that explicitly represent interactions between individual entities or agents from which system level behavior emerges thus simulating ecological phenomena at a resolution that facilitates the construction of fine scale networks grimm and railsback 2013 developed abms are virtual laboratories permitting exploration of the simulated phenomena and its associated network structure as it responds to local dynamics abms have been developed to represent complex ecological systems over space and time for many ecological phenomena such as fish letcher et al 1996 birds travis and dytham 1998 caribou semeniuk et al 2012 and forest insect infestation such as the mountain pine beetle perez and dragićević 2010 pereira et al 2011 bone and altaweel 2014 and the emerald ash borer anderson and dragićević 2015 2016 to name a few networks have been integrated with agent based models berryman and angus 2010 kirer and çirpici 2016 however these studies typically focus on the topological network structure of systems rather than spatial network structures and thus do not incorporate geospatial datasets therefore this study proposes the integration of complex systems theory with network theory and geospatial datasets to represent complex spatio temporal ecological systems using dynamic spatial networks the main objective of this study is to develop and implement an integrated geospatial modelling approach a network abm n abm to represent and analyze the dynamic spatial structure of ecological networks specifically the agents behavior and interactions form and modify the network over space and time graph theory measures are used to measure and characterize the simulated spatial network structures to better understand how network structure evolves over space and time from interactions between biological individuals the developed n abm approach is applied using the case study of a real forest insect infestation the emerald ash borer eab in southern ontario canada 2 networks and their representations through graph theory this section provides important network and graph theory definitions from which dynamic spatial network representations and measurement tools are derived foundations of graph theory are reviewed comprehensively barabási 2016 newman 2003 lewis 2011 and for spatial graphs specifically barthélemy 2011 a graph g is a mathematical representation of an observed network reduced to a set of nodes n that are connected by directed or undirected links l nodes represent entities that make up the observed network and links represent the interactions between them many empirically observed networks have properties corresponding to random small world or scale free graph types each graph type is unique in the way that it is formed and its resulting properties some common properties are defined in table 1 the properties defined in table 1 can be calculated as a local measure for each individual node or averaged across the network as a global measure random graphs are modelled by linking nodes randomly based on probability p erdos and renyi 1959 1960 as a result one property of a random graph is a well defined average node degree k producing a poisson degree distribution p k the random connections that form between the set of nodes generate a low average clustering coefficient c meaning that on average it is unlikely that nodes connected to node i are also connected to each other this lack of clustering produces a short average path length l s boccaletti et al 2006 networks observed in the real world rarely exhibit properties of random graphs however random graphs provide a baseline for which to compare properties observed in real networks some empirically observed networks such as social networks have been found to have a much higher average clustering coefficient and a similar average path length than their random counterparts with the same number of nodes and the same average degree these networks exhibit properties of small world graphs watts and strogatz 1998 small world graphs are modelled as a lattice where each node is connected to the exact same number of adjacent nodes and a few nodes are rewired to a randomly chosen node the establishment of just a few random connections dramatically reduces the average path length between any two nodes in the network making the movement of material such as information individuals and power between nodes highly efficient a degree distribution unlike that of a random or small world graph has been observed in several real networks such as the world wide web albert et al 1999 characterized by a small fraction of nodes that have a very large number of links and a large fraction of nodes that have only a few this degree distribution forms a power law expressed as p k k α where the probability p of observing a node with k connections is the number of connections to some negative exponent called a degree exponent α these observed network structures exhibit the properties of scale free graphs barabási and albert 1999 a scale free graph is modelled through the process of preferential attachment of new node j to node i based on node i s degree k specifically new nodes prefer to link to existing nodes that have a higher degree and thus the rich get richer in addition to a power law degree distribution empirically observed networks exhibiting properties of scale free networks are characterized as having a shorter average path length and a similar average clustering coefficient in comparison to its random network counterpart in many cases real networks can be modelled using a topological or spatial structure the spatial structure of networks provides valuable information explaining network structure and behaviour as geospatial data availability increases geospatial network representations and analysis become more feasible in a geospatial network nodes are embedded in geographic space defined explicitly using geographic coordinates geospatial networks are unique from their non spatial topological counterparts because any node s degree k is limited by physical space and thus distant connections are costly in terms of energy money and time the structure and dynamics of real spatial networks have been characterized for transportation and infrastructure guimera and amaral 2004 jiang 2007 watts and strogatz 1998 and less commonly for social stoneham 1977 andris 2016 and ecological fortuna et al 2006 pereira et al 2011 phenomena graph theory based network approaches have been proposed as useful tools in landscape ecology ferrari et al 2007 minor and urban 2007 urban and keitt 2001 however few studies actually operationalize these approaches on real case studies using geospatial data andersson and bodin 2009 fortuna et al 2006 pascual hortal and saura 2008 zetterberg et al 2010 furthermore graph theoretic approaches in landscape ecology are typically limited to static networks at the landscape scale and thus are unable to explore the spatio temporal complexity inherent to ecological processes therefore this study seeks to develop an integrated modelling approach that can facilitate the exploration of the complex dynamic spatial structure and behavior of real ecological networks such as insect infestation specifically network theory and agent based modelling abm are integrated to develop an n abm 3 methods the developed n abm simulates a dynamic spatial network structure that emerges over space and time from interactions between agents at the individual scale fig 1 graph theory is used to characterize and measure the obtained simulated spatio temporal network patterns the proposed approach is implemented and tested on the case study of the emerald ash borer eab bark beetle in the town of oakville canada fig 2 first discovered in this area in 2008 the n abm approach is developed using the java object oriented programming language and repast simphony 2 4 2017 a free and open source recursive porous agent simulation toolkit repast repast simphony is used for modelling complex adaptive systems through the development of abms and has a large and growing community developing a wide range of applications for social evolutionary industrial and ecological simulations north et al 2013 the following sections first provide an overview of the case study including the eab s biological background followed by a detailed description of the development of the n abm and the graph measures used to characterize and analyze the n abm simulation outputs 3 1 emerald ash borer eab biological background the emerald ash borer eab agrilus planipennis fairmaire coleoptera buprestidae is an invasive phloem feeding beetle native to countries in asia the eab was first introduced into north america in the late 1990s siegert et al 2014 and was discovered in 2002 in detroit michigan us and windsor ontario canada straw et al 2013 the eab is the cause of the decline of the north american ash tree population creating devastating ecological and economic impacts eab larvae feed on ash tree phloem for one to two years before emerging as adults from under the bark of ash trees to reproduce in early june through august cappaert et al 2005 mated female eab locally disperse in search of host trees suitable for offspring local dispersal is constrained by the natural flight ability of the eab where mated female eab travel on average 2 8 km in 24 h taylor et al 2007 dispersal to distances beyond the eabs natural abilities is referred to as long distance dispersal this type of dispersal is facilitated by human transportation of infested wood products and firewood resulting in the establishment of satellite populations beyond the main front of infestation as a result ash trees that are near major roads and campgrounds are at high risk muirhead et al 2006 mated female eab use olfactory tactile and possibly auditory cues to determine the most suitable hosts for oviposition it is believed that eab have specific preferences for ash tree hosts of a certain type size location and level of host tree stress it has been found that ash tree types with a naturally lower resistance to insect infestations such as the green black and white ash versus their blue ash counterparts are targeted more frequently rebek et al 2008 anulewicz et al 2008 it is also suggested that in order to sustain larval galleries mated females prefer ash trees that are larger in size mercader et al 2011 and ash trees that are closer in distance to their point of emergence mercader et al 2009 it is hypothesized that eab host selection is influenced by volatiles emitted by stressed ash trees tree stress is caused by drought woodpecker damage wounding and of course insect feeding caused by larval galleries such as those produced by eab mccullough et al 2009 and tluczek et al 2011 tested this hypothesis by girdling ash trees a process where a 20 cm wide band of outer bark and phloem is removed cutting off the flow of water and nutrients within the tree they found that girdled trees captured significantly more adult eab and had higher larval densities 3 2 n abm the purpose of the n abm is to represent the dynamic spatial network that emerges from simulated infestation dynamics specifically agent interactions between eab and ash tree agents implemented by the abm component of the n abm form the basis of the network structure that dynamically evolves over geographic space and time the n abm is implemented on datasets for the study site the town of oakville canada to represent the eab infestation from june 1st 2008 to august 31st 2009 to account for variation in model outputs as a function of randomness incorporated into abm processes the model was run 50 times the town of oakville study area spanning across 138 5 km² acquired and developed geospatial data that can in turn used for model creation calibration and validation of eab infestation dynamics the geospatial data used in this study include the following 1 gis data layers of the tree inventory for the town of oakville with location and attribute data for all tree species trees 2018 2 gis data layers containing a the location of recreational parks and campgrounds parks recreation and culture guide 2018 and b major streets for the town of oakville road network 2018 3 gis data layers representing the delimitation of actual eab infestation according to levels of severity observed in the town of oakville in 2009 obtained through forestry services parks and open space town of oakville 3 2 1 simulating infestation dynamics using agents the description of the abm component of the n abm here includes some important elements from the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 for a detailed description of the abm component that includes all elements see anderson and dragićević 2016 the purpose of the abm component of the n abm is to simulate interactions between eab agents and ash tree agents these interactions are the basis for which the tightly coupled dynamic spatial network forms and evolves over space and time the abm component of the n abm is based on an existing and validated abm developed by anderson and dragićević 2016 and was previously applied to simulate the biological control of eab in the town of oakville canada the following sections describe how the infestation dynamics are implemented in the n abm as a function of agent interactions fig 2 depicts the detailed processes and scheduling pertaining to the interactions between the eab and the ash tree agents that in turn generate the dynamic spatial networks 3 2 1 1 agents and state variables the n abm simulates adult eab eab larvae and ash tree hosts agents using biological information obtained from the literature table 2 agent individuals are programmed with state variables and agent parameters the state variables table 2a are associated with the state of the agent at a particular model time step the agent parameters table 2b are virtual components that define the agents and shape their behavior 3 2 1 2 agent process overview and scheduling as depicted in fig 2 the developed n abm simulates eab behavior for two seasons of infestation from june 1st 2008 t 1 when the eab was first introduced into the town of oakville to the end of august 2009 t 457 each model time step t i represents one day in the real world the main processes and schedules of each agent are defined and presented in table 3 upon model initialization the first population of female adult eab agents emerge from an ash tree and move through their life cycle as a collection of subroutines to simulate real eab behavior fig 2 life cycle stages include emergence dispersal in search of food maturing and mating host selection and oviposition of eab larvae agents and once they have oviposited all their offspring they die these stages are executed as a function of the agent s age and parameters the eab larvae agents grow over time and if they do not die from external factors a new generation of eab emerge and begin their life cycles host selection is a process integrated into eab adult agent decision making through a host selection algorithm developed by anderson and dragićević 2016 the host selection algorithm allows eab agents to compare between trees within their daily flight radius and optimize their decision of which tree to infest based on their preferences at each time step specifically eab agents compare ash trees based on the tree s location type size and tree stress ash trees are more attractive to the eab agent in the case that they are the following 1 a type of ash that are naturally less resistant to eab infestation 2 are closer to the eab agent s location 3 are larger and 4 are of greater stress levels on average 1 of the eab population is transported by mechanisms of long distance dispersal taylor et al 2007 in the model long distance dispersal is a random process where each year 1 of the eab population has a 30 chance of establishing successfully via long distance dispersal the success rate of 30 was determined through model calibration anderson and dragićević 2015 trees that are near major transportation networks or near recreational parks and campgrounds are susceptible to the mechanism of long distance dispersal once a satellite population is established the adult eab agent disperses locally and the life cycle continues ash tree agents are represented using tree inventory geospatial data of the town of oakville fig 2 containing the location type and size of trees each ash tree agent represents an ash tree ash tree agents record whether it is infested and the number of larvae feeding on it 3 2 1 3 agent initialization the model is initialized for the time t 1 on june 1st 2008 upon initialization a population of eab emerge from the north iroquois ridge community 43 47 decimal degrees north and 79 69 decimal degrees west where the beetle is thought to have first become established in the town of oakville bioforest technologies inc 2011 although the initial number of beetle agents to emerge is random the number falls within a threshold proportional to the carrying capacity of ash trees in the region where a maximum of 44 female adult beetles emerge per m2 of the ash trees surface area mccullough and siegert 2007 the average size of the tree in the initial location of infestation is 13 m2 estimated by using the height and dbh recorded in the geospatial tree inventory dataset as such the model is initialized in 2008 with a maximum of 572 emerging female eab agents and with up to 41 of larval death via host tree defense woodpecker predation and environmental factors and disease duan et al 2010 a minimum of 234 emerging female eab agents there are 6153 ash tree agents in the simulation 3 2 2 infestation dynamics as networks in the developed n abm approach agent interactions drive the structure of a dynamic spatial network the programming logic and pseudocode are presented in fig 3 where nodes and links in the generated spatial network correspond to eab agents and their interactions with the forest environment this code tightly couples the agent interactions to the generation of spatial networks if for example agent a represented by node i interacts with agent b a new node j is added as a proxy for agent b and a link l is created from node i to node j to represent the interaction in addition the link l stores the direction of the link node i is assigned as the start node and node j is assigned as the end node using the case study of the eab infestation as an example the n abm generates a series of graphs g composed of a growing set of nodes n that in this case represent infested trees at x y location directed links l represent the movement of a mated female eab agent and form as it moves from infested tree node i to a new tree node j infesting tree node j connections are made to both trees that are not already infested and to trees that are infested and thus are already included in the infestation network 3 3 n abm testing the spatial networks form as a direct result of the interactions between eab and ash tree agents over geographic space and time and as such testing the validity of the abm component of the n abm is important the n abm uses the same agent reasoning and programming code from the validated abm developed by anderson and dragićević 2016 to account for variation in model outputs as a function of randomness incorporated into abm processes the model is run 50 times the simulated state of each tree was determined as a function of the state of each ash tree infested vs not infested in the majority of model runs the model was validated using a binary confusion matrix that measures the agreement between the simulated state of each ash tree and the state of the corresponding ash tree as observed in the real world for the same time period with an overall accuracy of 72 additionally a confusion matrix was used to measure the agreement between the simulated level of severity of each ash tree low medium high and the level of severity observed in the real world for the corresponding tree with an overall accuracy of 64 the sensitivity of the model outputs to changes in parameters most notably to changes in eab preferences in the host selection process were tested using sensitivity analysis anderson and dragicevic 2018 3 4 analysis of generated spatial networks graph theory newman 2003 provides the theoretical and mathematical foundation for the representation and analysis of network structures a primary objective in network analysis using graph theory is to determine the type of network specifically whether the observed network structure exhibits random scale free or small world properties this can be determined using a few global network measures that characterize the network at the network level average node degree k degree distribution p k average clustering coefficient c and average path length l s as such to determine network type the above measures are calculated for the networks generated by the n abm and the obtained values are compared to the expected values if a network with the same number of nodes was random therefore an equivalent random network model n abmrand is developed where eab agent host selection is programmed as a random process the average node degree k degree distribution p k average clustering coefficient c and average path length l s is calculated for the n abm and the n abmrand and compared a detailed description of the selected graph theory measures programmed for the spatial analysis of the generated network structures are as follows 3 4 1 average node degree the number of nodes j that node i is connected to is referred to as the node degree k of i in an undirected network the average node degree k is defined as k 2 l n where l represents the number of links in the network and n represents the number of nodes in the network however not all graphs are undirected movement for example a common dynamic modelled in spatial abms is directional where eab agents move from a location to a location thus it is important to differentiate between the ingoing links kin with outgoing links kout node total degree k in a directed network is defined as k k i n k o u t the average node degree k in a directed network is defined as k l n 3 4 2 degree distribution the degree distribution p k calculates the fraction of nodes in a network with degree k kin or kout using the example of degree k the fraction of nodes in a network with degree k can be calculated by the number of the nodes with the same degree divided by the total number of nodes in the network n for example if there are four nodes in the network where k 1 and there are a total of 10 nodes p k 0 4 p k can be plotted on a histogram to present the degree distribution of the network the degree distribution is tested for goodness of fit using powerlaw a python package for analysis of heavy tailed distributions alstott et al 2014 3 4 3 average path length a path p i 0 i n that connects the nodes i 0 and i n in a graph g n l is defined as an ordered collection of n 1 nodes n p i 0 i 1 i 2 i n and n edges l p i 0 i 1 i 1 i 2 i n 1 i n the shortest path length between any two nodes in the network model l s is calculated by implementing dijkstra s shortest path algorithm into the n abm dijkstra 1959 an algorithm developed to find the shortest number of links connecting any two pairs of nodes in the network average path length l s is defined as the average value of l i j 3 4 4 average clustering coefficient the clustering coefficient c measures the probability that nodes j connected to node i are also connected to each other watts and strogatz 1998 when c 1 all nodes connected to node i are connected to each other when c 0 nodes connected to node i are not connected to each other generating a star like structure the clustering coefficient is formulated as c i e i 2 k i k i 1 where for node i of degree k i e i is the number of edges among the neighbours of i the average clustering coefficient is formulated as c 1 n where the brackets denote the average clustering coefficient over the network 4 results this section presents the n abm simulation outcomes and the analysis of the generated spatial network structures to account for stochasticity in generated network structures the n abm is executed 50 times thus generating 50 different simulation outcomes the average values and the standard error across all 50 model runs for average node degree k degree distribution p k average clustering coefficient c and average path length ls are calculated and presented in table 4 the obtained standard error for each network measure is very small indicating that the n abm generates very similar network structures across all runs this is supported by visibly similar power law degree distributions p k across all 50 simulated network structures as presented in fig 4 accompanied by minor differences in the calculated alpha exponent table 4 large amounts of variation across several abm outputs typically points to stochastic uncertainty brown et al 2005 however the minor variation observed in network structure across 50 model runs suggests that the emergent network structure is a function of the generative mechanisms that are implemented in the model rather than randomness therefore using one network as example to present the results is a viable option as other 49 networks have similar network structure indicated by the similar obtained network measures for each based on this analysis and for the purpose of clarity and visual presentation of the generated maps with network structures one example network is selected and presented in the following sections 4 1 simulation results fig 5 presents one full model run of the n abm representing the spread of eab infestation across the town of oakville ontario from 2008 to 2009 specifically fig 5 shows both the infestation extent as a function of the eab and tree agents interactions and the generated spatial network structures for time ti particularly simulation outputs for july 2008 at t 61 fig 5 a1 a2 august 2008 at t 92 fig 5b1 b2 july 2009 at t 426 fig 5c1 c2 august 2009 at t 457 fig 5d1 d2 are presented the eab are most active during the month of july and august and therefore the most notable changes in network structure are visible the infestation extent as a function of the agent interactions fig 5 a1 b1 c1 and d1 and the network structures fig 5 a2 b2 c2 and d2 are extracted as separate geospatial layers for better visualization however both are derived from the same model run following model initialization in 2008 eab spreads locally outward from the epicenter in the north eastern half of the city from the epicenter clusters of infestation develop to the south east and the west of the epicenter a satellite population develops in the southern end of the city and in 2009 the second year of eab infestation the satellite population and the main infestation front merge this is referred to as a stratified dispersal pattern commonly observed in real world eab spread muirhead et al 2006 4 2 analysis of the spatial network structure results using the topology of the example simulated eab infestation network in august 2009 derived from the n abm at the final time step t 457 the resulting graph theory measures are summarized in table 4 4 2 1 graph size the eab infestation network in august 2009 is composed of 2540 nodes meaning that there are just over 2500 infested trees in the network the number of links or dispersal pathways connecting these nodes or infested trees is 27 560 4 2 2 average node degree and degree distribution the kout and kin measures mathematically characterize different dynamics in the infestation network a kout value of 4 48 indicates that on average eab agents move from infested tree node i to 4 48 other tree nodes j therefore kout characterizes the local connectivity of each tree node i to other desirable trees j in its proximity a kin value of 4 40 indicates that on average eab agents move from 4 40 other tree nodes j to tree node i therefore kin characterize the desirability of tree node i the max degree k max for kout is 64 and the min degree k min for kout is 1 the max degree k max for kin is 52 and the min degree k min for kin is 1 the values of degree do not indicate the volume of beetles that move across these links but rather that several beetles move along each path from node i to node j the volume of beetles can be represented by node or link weights however node and link weights are not included in this network representation to maintain simplicity the degree distribution p kout and p kin can provide information regarding the type of network that emerges from dynamics at the local scale the p kout and p kin are plotted as histograms in fig 6 a and 6b respectively and as a log log plot in fig 6c and d the histograms in fig 6a and 6b indicate that there are a large fraction of nodes in the network with a very small degree and a small fraction of nodes in the network with a very large degree in the log log plot fig 6c and d this distribution can be described as linear distributions with heavy tails the degree distribution for p kout and p kin can be described as a power law distribution the distributions produce an alpha exponent α of 1 58 and 1 59 for p kout and p kin respectively and a standard error sigma σ of 0 01 for both the kolmogorov smirnov distance d is also small with a value of 0 16 for both the goodness of fit of the degree distribution between a power law and an exponential distribution is first compared producing a log likelihood ratio r between the two candidate distributions that indicates a power law is a better fit than an exponential with a p value of 0 0072 and 0 04 for p kout and p kin respectively the directed degrees are also presented spatially fig 7 a and b for both kout and kin there is a distinguishable core region composed of ash trees that have a high node degree k surrounded by a large perimeter composed of ash trees that have a low node degree k node degree k appears to coincide with real world eab infestation severity fig 7c table 5 this is determined by classifying all tree nodes into high medium low and zero degree classes based on their simulated degree the degree of a tree is classified as high degree if it falls 1 5 standard deviation medium degree if from 0 5 to 1 5 of the standard deviation and as low degree if it falls 0 5 of the standard deviation all trees with a simulated node degree of zero are classified as zero degree using a confusion matrix approach congalton 1991 the simulated degree class of each tree node is compared to high medium low infestation severity in addition to no infestation observed in the real world for 2009 for the same tree the overall spatial similarity is 67 where trees with a simulated high degree and medium degree corresponds moderately well with high 18 omission and 36 commission and with medium 33 omission and 18 commission infestation severity in the real world respectively this is not a model validation metric because since the network is not weighted the tree node degree does not necessarily correlate with tree population density and thus cannot be compared to infestation severity however it does indicate that trees that have a high degree in the infestation network are thus are highly spatially accessible and may influence infestation severity 4 2 3 degree distribution across time using the developed n abm approach all graph theory measures can be calculated at any point in time to better understand the change in network structure as it grows and evolves the degree distribution p kout is used here as an example in each model time step the p kout of the infestation network maintains a power law the power law in the early stages of the infestation has an exponent of 3 34 over time the exponent decreases before settling at 1 58 table 6 the generated power laws indicate that at the beginning of each season of eab infestation there is a burst of new eab dispersal where the network is expanded over geographic space and infested tree nodes with a low degree are added to the network the season of eab infestation continues and links form between trees that already exist in the infestation network as eab dynamics such as attraction to trees of ash species attraction to stressed trees and carrying capacity begin to play a role in the network structure this process is quantified by the changes in the power law degree distributions over time where the power law in early months of infestation has a much higher fraction of tree nodes with a low degree than in the following months 4 2 4 average clustering coefficient the average clustering coefficient is 0 03 meaning that node linkages form a star like pattern most of the core region of infested trees is composed of trees with a very low clustering coefficient meaning that only a few of the nodes that are connected to node i are also connected to each other in total there are only three trees with a clustering coefficient of 1 where all nodes that are connected to node i are also connected to each other we can present this spatially to highlight where clusters exist fig 8 the majority of the nodes with high clustering are near the perimeter this is potentially an edge effect where eab agents can no longer spread due to artificial administrative town boundary and thus continue to infest trees in close proximity resulting in a higher clustering coefficient near the town administrative boundary 4 2 5 average path length the average path length is short with an average of 11 intermediate nodes that make up the path between any two nodes in the network this indicates that as a function of the spatial distribution of ash tree hosts and the flight dynamics of eab eab are capable to spread across long distances in a short period of time using the topology of the simulated eab infestation network in august 2009 derived from the n abmrand at the final time step t 457 the resulting graph theory measures are summarized in table 7 comparing the obtained n abm analysis results for the case study of the eab with the n abmrand indicates that the n abm spatial infestation network structure is scale free with hub and spoke architecture formed by a power law degree distribution for both p kout and p kin with an exponent α of 1 58 and 1 59 respectively specifically the short average path length of the n abm at 11 27 nodes in comparison to the average path length of the n abmrand at 22 86 nodes in addition to a power law degree distribution an average path length in a network that is less than the average path length of its equivalent random network is a defining feature of a scale free network barabási 2016 characterization of emergent spatial network structure can provide insight into network dynamics for example if instead of a scale free network a random network structure was formed this would indicate that the underlying processes driving the emergence of the spatial network structure are random at the most basic level scale free networks form as the result of two simple generative mechanisms growth and preferential attachment also known as the rich get richer phenomenon in preferential attachment the probability that a new node becomes connected to an existing node is a function of the existing node s degree the higher the degree the more likely the node will form a connection to understand why the scale free network structure emerges the generative mechanisms included in the n abm can be examined a correlation between degree and tree stress at r2 0 87 indicates that the eab host selection process specifically the eab attraction to stressed trees is responsible for the generation of dynamics of preferential attachment and thus the emergent scale free network structure in the real world trees that are preferable for oviposition are infested resulting in the release of stress volatiles this creates a positive feedback where as ash trees suitable for host selection become increasingly infested stress volatiles are released and thus the trees are increasingly targeted for attack networks generated by preferential attachment tend to have high degree nodes or hubs near the center of the network with node degrees that gradually declines toward the perimeter and outer edges of the network this emerging pattern is produced in the developed n abm further analysis of the network structure does not indicate a significant relationship between node degree and tree size or node degree and tree type non spatial scale free models are not constrained by space and thus commonly contain long distance linkages to non adjacent nodes however in the spatial n abm long distance links come at a cost and thus are limited to the natural dispersal distance of the eab taylor et al 2007 the lack of relationship between node degree and tree size or tree type may be a result of the heterogeneous nature of host trees in the environment and the limitation of generating long distance links trees of the most attractive type in the study area may not be available within the flight distance radius allotted to the eab agent per day leaving agents to choose the largest or best type available to them at a closer proximity based on the obtained simulation results suggest that the emergent spatial pattern of eab spread are primarily a function of the generative mechanisms of preferential attachment based on tree stress tree distance and growth or continuing spread of infestation over time in this study it is empirically demonstrated that in the same way scale free networks emerge from growth and preferential attachment patterns of eab insect infestation emerge from host selection dynamics over time furthermore the characterization of network structure can provide additional insights useful for pest management for example scale free networks are particularly robust to the removal of nodes at random meaning that an impactful removal of trees would need to be highly strategized 5 discussion and conclusion exploring the influence of the spatial structure of the landscape on ecological processes is critical landscape connectivity graphs are more recently implemented for this purpose but are typically static network representations at a single scale as a result landscape connectivity graphs are unable to capture the complexity in dispersal processes whereby interactions at the local scale generate spatio temporal dispersal patterns at the larger scale for example in the case of insect infestation it is important to explore how interactions between eab and varying spatial distributions of ash tree hosts generate large scale spatio temporal patterns of infestation the inclusion of complexity in spatial ecological network approaches can characterize and quantify spatio temporal patterns in ecological systems that might otherwise be described in a more qualitative manner identify the underlying interactions and generative mechanisms that drive the emergence of these spatio temporal patterns and quantitatively link dynamics at local scales to emergent patterns at larger scales therefore this study proposes the integration of the complex systems modelling approach abm with spatial networks for the development of a network based abm the approach is demonstrated in application to the case study of the forest insect infestation eab the n abm approach facilitates the exploration between network dynamics and network structure and in this case links the eab attraction to stressed trees at the individual scale to dispersal patterns at larger scales this effectively supports findings in the literature that point to tree stress as the primary factor in host selection mccullough et al 2009 tluczek et al 2011 the approach facilitates the shift from the characterization of network structure to explaining and identifying the underlying interactions that drive the emergence of a dynamic and evolving spatial network structure across all 50 model runs stochastic processes within the n abm produce a distribution of unique spatial networks however results show that each of the simulated spatial networks have a highly similar structure this conclusion is supported by the fact that all spatial network measures for all 50 networks deviate only slightly from the mean and thus have a small standard error as such any selected model run would be fairly although not perfectly representative of the complete distribution of networks therefore only one randomly selected network from one model run is presented in detail this serves the purpose of clarity since it would be overwhelming to visually present all 50 network structures in future work it may be useful to develop an approach to summarize a distribution of spatial networks that emerge from the same local processes averaging the degree of each node across all 50 model runs is insufficient because it would result in a smoothing effect that would ultimately negate network degree heterogeneity which is of great interest in network studies in summary as a function of the randomness of the n abm the spatial pattern of eab spread varies from model run to model run but the network structure does not presenting a clear link between network dynamics and network structure detailed analysis of the variation of the spatial patterns of eab spread across model runs resulting from the abm component used in the n abm can be found in anderson and dragićević 2016 2018 spatial ecological networks can be represented and analyzed at a variety of scales nodes can represent ecological entities from the individual level to various aggregations of individuals community level population level landscape level the modifiable aerial unit problem maup is a phenomenon where statistical outputs vary as a function of the level of aggregation in the model this suggests that the emergent network structure may be a function of the scale at which the phenomenon is represented however the aim of the study is to integrate complexity into spatial ecological networks using an agent based modelling approach justifying the use of individual scale representation it would be desirable to validate the spatial networks themselves generated by the n abm unfortunately the nature of the ecological data and current data collection tools and methods cannot provide network datasets and therefore a model of this kind cannot be validated in this context however the validation of the abm agent processes and interactions integrated in the n abm that generate the spatial networks gives confidence that the spatial networks are being represented correctly in conclusion the novel n abm modelling approach presented here is unique and particularly relevant for modelling complex ecological systems as there is a demand for the exploration of dynamic ecological networks in a spatial and temporal context the application of graph theory to the networks generated by the n abm helps to better understand measure and analyze the influence of geographic space and network structure on network dynamics as well as characterize dispersal patterns particularly useful from an ecological management perspective the n abm framework is also highly general and flexible as to facilitate the representation and simulation of many ecological systems as dynamic evolving networks graph theory provides a large toolset of additional measures that can also be applied for further understanding interactions between other ecological species and the landscape useful for ecological management or conservation for example graph theory measures such as betweenness centrality and link weights can help important habitat features and dispersal pathways that are essential to the connectivity of the landscape for an endangered species and thus be targeted for protection by ecological

25168,non spatial ecological networks provide insight into the organization and interaction between biological entities more recently biological dispersal is modelled using spatial networks static sets of georeferenced habitat patches that connect based on a species maximum dispersal distance however dispersal is complex where spatial patterns at the landscape scale emerge from interactions between ecological entities and landscape features at much finer individual scales agent based modelling abm is a computational representation of complex systems capable of capturing this complexity therefore this study develops a network abm n abm that combines network and complex systems theory to simulate complex evolving spatial networks the developed n abm approach is implemented on the case study of the emerald ash borer eab bark beetle using geospatial datasets in ontario canada the n abm generates dynamic spatial network structures that emerge from interactions between the eab and tree agents at the individual scale the resulting networks are analyzed using graph theory measures analysis of the results indicates a relationship between preferential attachment in insect host selection and the emergent scale free network structure the n abm approach can be used to represent dynamic ecological networks and provides insight into how network structure emerges from eab dispersal dynamics useful for forest management keywords network agent based modeling spatial networks ecological complex systems geographic information systems forest insect infestation emerald ash borer 1 introduction ecologists are largely concerned with the scientific analysis of interactions among species and their environment agrawal et al 2007 to study these interactions ecological systems are often presented as networks where the network s nodes represent biological entities and the network s links represent some form of ecological interaction sets of ecological interactions are traditionally represented as non spatial networks and are most commonly grouped into three ecological network types including food webs cohen 1978 hall and raffaelli 1993 host parasitoid webs muller et al 1999 morris et al 2004 and mutualistic webs jordano 1987 stang et al 2006 graph theory a mathematical characterization of networks can then be used as a tool to characterize ecological network topology cross compare between network structures to find common ground and uniqueness and understand how network structures affect network dynamics and vice versa ings et al 2009 because ecological interactions take place in geographic space and time it is argued that the framework of ecological networks must also account for these contexts fortuna and bascompte 2007 landscape connectivity graphs were one of the first efforts to represent ecological phenomena as networks in an explicitly geospatial context urban and keitt 2001 using orthophotos or classified maps habitat patches are abstracted as nodes that are embedded in geographic space the formation of links between nodes signifies the potential dispersal from one habitat patch to another since long dispersal distances come at a greater cost i e energy time the connectivity between two nodes is typically a function of proximity or adjacency meaning nodes that are closer to one another have a higher probability of connecting in these network representations there are minimal data requirements needing only the geographic location of habitat patches and maximum dispersal distance of the species of interest minor and urban 2007 the structure of the landscape connectivity graphs can inform species dispersal patterns identify keystone patches that are critical to landscape connectivity and furthermore assess how dispersal patterns would change in response to disruptions in the network for example fortuna et al 2006 develop a network of ponds to identify the spatial structure of amphibian dispersal and the species persistence in drought in another study bunn et al 2000 compare landscape connectivity between two species that share the same habitat and find that the landscape is connected for one and disconnected for the other presenting implications for conservation biology despite the potential network approaches that leverage graph theory for the study of ecological systems in a geospatial context mostly represent ecological systems at the landscape species scale as a fixed network structure on which dispersal takes place fortuna et al 2006 although useful spatial ecological networks at this scale are limited in their ability to account for the complexity in emergent dispersal patterns which often develop from local spatio temporal dynamics between individuals and their environment with a few exceptions spatial ecological networks are rarely scaled down to the individual species scale and as such it is challenging to make this link between network structure and network dynamics dupont et al 2011 additionally data capturing spatio temporal dynamics at the individual scale between large sets of heterogeneous individuals and across large spatial extents is not typically available for many types of ecological phenomena furthermore field studies to acquire this data is expensive and time consuming minor and urban 2007 as such the development of an experimental setting to better understand the connections between network structure and network dynamics is needed stouffer et al 2010 agent based models abm are computational representations of complex systems that explicitly represent interactions between individual entities or agents from which system level behavior emerges thus simulating ecological phenomena at a resolution that facilitates the construction of fine scale networks grimm and railsback 2013 developed abms are virtual laboratories permitting exploration of the simulated phenomena and its associated network structure as it responds to local dynamics abms have been developed to represent complex ecological systems over space and time for many ecological phenomena such as fish letcher et al 1996 birds travis and dytham 1998 caribou semeniuk et al 2012 and forest insect infestation such as the mountain pine beetle perez and dragićević 2010 pereira et al 2011 bone and altaweel 2014 and the emerald ash borer anderson and dragićević 2015 2016 to name a few networks have been integrated with agent based models berryman and angus 2010 kirer and çirpici 2016 however these studies typically focus on the topological network structure of systems rather than spatial network structures and thus do not incorporate geospatial datasets therefore this study proposes the integration of complex systems theory with network theory and geospatial datasets to represent complex spatio temporal ecological systems using dynamic spatial networks the main objective of this study is to develop and implement an integrated geospatial modelling approach a network abm n abm to represent and analyze the dynamic spatial structure of ecological networks specifically the agents behavior and interactions form and modify the network over space and time graph theory measures are used to measure and characterize the simulated spatial network structures to better understand how network structure evolves over space and time from interactions between biological individuals the developed n abm approach is applied using the case study of a real forest insect infestation the emerald ash borer eab in southern ontario canada 2 networks and their representations through graph theory this section provides important network and graph theory definitions from which dynamic spatial network representations and measurement tools are derived foundations of graph theory are reviewed comprehensively barabási 2016 newman 2003 lewis 2011 and for spatial graphs specifically barthélemy 2011 a graph g is a mathematical representation of an observed network reduced to a set of nodes n that are connected by directed or undirected links l nodes represent entities that make up the observed network and links represent the interactions between them many empirically observed networks have properties corresponding to random small world or scale free graph types each graph type is unique in the way that it is formed and its resulting properties some common properties are defined in table 1 the properties defined in table 1 can be calculated as a local measure for each individual node or averaged across the network as a global measure random graphs are modelled by linking nodes randomly based on probability p erdos and renyi 1959 1960 as a result one property of a random graph is a well defined average node degree k producing a poisson degree distribution p k the random connections that form between the set of nodes generate a low average clustering coefficient c meaning that on average it is unlikely that nodes connected to node i are also connected to each other this lack of clustering produces a short average path length l s boccaletti et al 2006 networks observed in the real world rarely exhibit properties of random graphs however random graphs provide a baseline for which to compare properties observed in real networks some empirically observed networks such as social networks have been found to have a much higher average clustering coefficient and a similar average path length than their random counterparts with the same number of nodes and the same average degree these networks exhibit properties of small world graphs watts and strogatz 1998 small world graphs are modelled as a lattice where each node is connected to the exact same number of adjacent nodes and a few nodes are rewired to a randomly chosen node the establishment of just a few random connections dramatically reduces the average path length between any two nodes in the network making the movement of material such as information individuals and power between nodes highly efficient a degree distribution unlike that of a random or small world graph has been observed in several real networks such as the world wide web albert et al 1999 characterized by a small fraction of nodes that have a very large number of links and a large fraction of nodes that have only a few this degree distribution forms a power law expressed as p k k α where the probability p of observing a node with k connections is the number of connections to some negative exponent called a degree exponent α these observed network structures exhibit the properties of scale free graphs barabási and albert 1999 a scale free graph is modelled through the process of preferential attachment of new node j to node i based on node i s degree k specifically new nodes prefer to link to existing nodes that have a higher degree and thus the rich get richer in addition to a power law degree distribution empirically observed networks exhibiting properties of scale free networks are characterized as having a shorter average path length and a similar average clustering coefficient in comparison to its random network counterpart in many cases real networks can be modelled using a topological or spatial structure the spatial structure of networks provides valuable information explaining network structure and behaviour as geospatial data availability increases geospatial network representations and analysis become more feasible in a geospatial network nodes are embedded in geographic space defined explicitly using geographic coordinates geospatial networks are unique from their non spatial topological counterparts because any node s degree k is limited by physical space and thus distant connections are costly in terms of energy money and time the structure and dynamics of real spatial networks have been characterized for transportation and infrastructure guimera and amaral 2004 jiang 2007 watts and strogatz 1998 and less commonly for social stoneham 1977 andris 2016 and ecological fortuna et al 2006 pereira et al 2011 phenomena graph theory based network approaches have been proposed as useful tools in landscape ecology ferrari et al 2007 minor and urban 2007 urban and keitt 2001 however few studies actually operationalize these approaches on real case studies using geospatial data andersson and bodin 2009 fortuna et al 2006 pascual hortal and saura 2008 zetterberg et al 2010 furthermore graph theoretic approaches in landscape ecology are typically limited to static networks at the landscape scale and thus are unable to explore the spatio temporal complexity inherent to ecological processes therefore this study seeks to develop an integrated modelling approach that can facilitate the exploration of the complex dynamic spatial structure and behavior of real ecological networks such as insect infestation specifically network theory and agent based modelling abm are integrated to develop an n abm 3 methods the developed n abm simulates a dynamic spatial network structure that emerges over space and time from interactions between agents at the individual scale fig 1 graph theory is used to characterize and measure the obtained simulated spatio temporal network patterns the proposed approach is implemented and tested on the case study of the emerald ash borer eab bark beetle in the town of oakville canada fig 2 first discovered in this area in 2008 the n abm approach is developed using the java object oriented programming language and repast simphony 2 4 2017 a free and open source recursive porous agent simulation toolkit repast repast simphony is used for modelling complex adaptive systems through the development of abms and has a large and growing community developing a wide range of applications for social evolutionary industrial and ecological simulations north et al 2013 the following sections first provide an overview of the case study including the eab s biological background followed by a detailed description of the development of the n abm and the graph measures used to characterize and analyze the n abm simulation outputs 3 1 emerald ash borer eab biological background the emerald ash borer eab agrilus planipennis fairmaire coleoptera buprestidae is an invasive phloem feeding beetle native to countries in asia the eab was first introduced into north america in the late 1990s siegert et al 2014 and was discovered in 2002 in detroit michigan us and windsor ontario canada straw et al 2013 the eab is the cause of the decline of the north american ash tree population creating devastating ecological and economic impacts eab larvae feed on ash tree phloem for one to two years before emerging as adults from under the bark of ash trees to reproduce in early june through august cappaert et al 2005 mated female eab locally disperse in search of host trees suitable for offspring local dispersal is constrained by the natural flight ability of the eab where mated female eab travel on average 2 8 km in 24 h taylor et al 2007 dispersal to distances beyond the eabs natural abilities is referred to as long distance dispersal this type of dispersal is facilitated by human transportation of infested wood products and firewood resulting in the establishment of satellite populations beyond the main front of infestation as a result ash trees that are near major roads and campgrounds are at high risk muirhead et al 2006 mated female eab use olfactory tactile and possibly auditory cues to determine the most suitable hosts for oviposition it is believed that eab have specific preferences for ash tree hosts of a certain type size location and level of host tree stress it has been found that ash tree types with a naturally lower resistance to insect infestations such as the green black and white ash versus their blue ash counterparts are targeted more frequently rebek et al 2008 anulewicz et al 2008 it is also suggested that in order to sustain larval galleries mated females prefer ash trees that are larger in size mercader et al 2011 and ash trees that are closer in distance to their point of emergence mercader et al 2009 it is hypothesized that eab host selection is influenced by volatiles emitted by stressed ash trees tree stress is caused by drought woodpecker damage wounding and of course insect feeding caused by larval galleries such as those produced by eab mccullough et al 2009 and tluczek et al 2011 tested this hypothesis by girdling ash trees a process where a 20 cm wide band of outer bark and phloem is removed cutting off the flow of water and nutrients within the tree they found that girdled trees captured significantly more adult eab and had higher larval densities 3 2 n abm the purpose of the n abm is to represent the dynamic spatial network that emerges from simulated infestation dynamics specifically agent interactions between eab and ash tree agents implemented by the abm component of the n abm form the basis of the network structure that dynamically evolves over geographic space and time the n abm is implemented on datasets for the study site the town of oakville canada to represent the eab infestation from june 1st 2008 to august 31st 2009 to account for variation in model outputs as a function of randomness incorporated into abm processes the model was run 50 times the town of oakville study area spanning across 138 5 km² acquired and developed geospatial data that can in turn used for model creation calibration and validation of eab infestation dynamics the geospatial data used in this study include the following 1 gis data layers of the tree inventory for the town of oakville with location and attribute data for all tree species trees 2018 2 gis data layers containing a the location of recreational parks and campgrounds parks recreation and culture guide 2018 and b major streets for the town of oakville road network 2018 3 gis data layers representing the delimitation of actual eab infestation according to levels of severity observed in the town of oakville in 2009 obtained through forestry services parks and open space town of oakville 3 2 1 simulating infestation dynamics using agents the description of the abm component of the n abm here includes some important elements from the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 for a detailed description of the abm component that includes all elements see anderson and dragićević 2016 the purpose of the abm component of the n abm is to simulate interactions between eab agents and ash tree agents these interactions are the basis for which the tightly coupled dynamic spatial network forms and evolves over space and time the abm component of the n abm is based on an existing and validated abm developed by anderson and dragićević 2016 and was previously applied to simulate the biological control of eab in the town of oakville canada the following sections describe how the infestation dynamics are implemented in the n abm as a function of agent interactions fig 2 depicts the detailed processes and scheduling pertaining to the interactions between the eab and the ash tree agents that in turn generate the dynamic spatial networks 3 2 1 1 agents and state variables the n abm simulates adult eab eab larvae and ash tree hosts agents using biological information obtained from the literature table 2 agent individuals are programmed with state variables and agent parameters the state variables table 2a are associated with the state of the agent at a particular model time step the agent parameters table 2b are virtual components that define the agents and shape their behavior 3 2 1 2 agent process overview and scheduling as depicted in fig 2 the developed n abm simulates eab behavior for two seasons of infestation from june 1st 2008 t 1 when the eab was first introduced into the town of oakville to the end of august 2009 t 457 each model time step t i represents one day in the real world the main processes and schedules of each agent are defined and presented in table 3 upon model initialization the first population of female adult eab agents emerge from an ash tree and move through their life cycle as a collection of subroutines to simulate real eab behavior fig 2 life cycle stages include emergence dispersal in search of food maturing and mating host selection and oviposition of eab larvae agents and once they have oviposited all their offspring they die these stages are executed as a function of the agent s age and parameters the eab larvae agents grow over time and if they do not die from external factors a new generation of eab emerge and begin their life cycles host selection is a process integrated into eab adult agent decision making through a host selection algorithm developed by anderson and dragićević 2016 the host selection algorithm allows eab agents to compare between trees within their daily flight radius and optimize their decision of which tree to infest based on their preferences at each time step specifically eab agents compare ash trees based on the tree s location type size and tree stress ash trees are more attractive to the eab agent in the case that they are the following 1 a type of ash that are naturally less resistant to eab infestation 2 are closer to the eab agent s location 3 are larger and 4 are of greater stress levels on average 1 of the eab population is transported by mechanisms of long distance dispersal taylor et al 2007 in the model long distance dispersal is a random process where each year 1 of the eab population has a 30 chance of establishing successfully via long distance dispersal the success rate of 30 was determined through model calibration anderson and dragićević 2015 trees that are near major transportation networks or near recreational parks and campgrounds are susceptible to the mechanism of long distance dispersal once a satellite population is established the adult eab agent disperses locally and the life cycle continues ash tree agents are represented using tree inventory geospatial data of the town of oakville fig 2 containing the location type and size of trees each ash tree agent represents an ash tree ash tree agents record whether it is infested and the number of larvae feeding on it 3 2 1 3 agent initialization the model is initialized for the time t 1 on june 1st 2008 upon initialization a population of eab emerge from the north iroquois ridge community 43 47 decimal degrees north and 79 69 decimal degrees west where the beetle is thought to have first become established in the town of oakville bioforest technologies inc 2011 although the initial number of beetle agents to emerge is random the number falls within a threshold proportional to the carrying capacity of ash trees in the region where a maximum of 44 female adult beetles emerge per m2 of the ash trees surface area mccullough and siegert 2007 the average size of the tree in the initial location of infestation is 13 m2 estimated by using the height and dbh recorded in the geospatial tree inventory dataset as such the model is initialized in 2008 with a maximum of 572 emerging female eab agents and with up to 41 of larval death via host tree defense woodpecker predation and environmental factors and disease duan et al 2010 a minimum of 234 emerging female eab agents there are 6153 ash tree agents in the simulation 3 2 2 infestation dynamics as networks in the developed n abm approach agent interactions drive the structure of a dynamic spatial network the programming logic and pseudocode are presented in fig 3 where nodes and links in the generated spatial network correspond to eab agents and their interactions with the forest environment this code tightly couples the agent interactions to the generation of spatial networks if for example agent a represented by node i interacts with agent b a new node j is added as a proxy for agent b and a link l is created from node i to node j to represent the interaction in addition the link l stores the direction of the link node i is assigned as the start node and node j is assigned as the end node using the case study of the eab infestation as an example the n abm generates a series of graphs g composed of a growing set of nodes n that in this case represent infested trees at x y location directed links l represent the movement of a mated female eab agent and form as it moves from infested tree node i to a new tree node j infesting tree node j connections are made to both trees that are not already infested and to trees that are infested and thus are already included in the infestation network 3 3 n abm testing the spatial networks form as a direct result of the interactions between eab and ash tree agents over geographic space and time and as such testing the validity of the abm component of the n abm is important the n abm uses the same agent reasoning and programming code from the validated abm developed by anderson and dragićević 2016 to account for variation in model outputs as a function of randomness incorporated into abm processes the model is run 50 times the simulated state of each tree was determined as a function of the state of each ash tree infested vs not infested in the majority of model runs the model was validated using a binary confusion matrix that measures the agreement between the simulated state of each ash tree and the state of the corresponding ash tree as observed in the real world for the same time period with an overall accuracy of 72 additionally a confusion matrix was used to measure the agreement between the simulated level of severity of each ash tree low medium high and the level of severity observed in the real world for the corresponding tree with an overall accuracy of 64 the sensitivity of the model outputs to changes in parameters most notably to changes in eab preferences in the host selection process were tested using sensitivity analysis anderson and dragicevic 2018 3 4 analysis of generated spatial networks graph theory newman 2003 provides the theoretical and mathematical foundation for the representation and analysis of network structures a primary objective in network analysis using graph theory is to determine the type of network specifically whether the observed network structure exhibits random scale free or small world properties this can be determined using a few global network measures that characterize the network at the network level average node degree k degree distribution p k average clustering coefficient c and average path length l s as such to determine network type the above measures are calculated for the networks generated by the n abm and the obtained values are compared to the expected values if a network with the same number of nodes was random therefore an equivalent random network model n abmrand is developed where eab agent host selection is programmed as a random process the average node degree k degree distribution p k average clustering coefficient c and average path length l s is calculated for the n abm and the n abmrand and compared a detailed description of the selected graph theory measures programmed for the spatial analysis of the generated network structures are as follows 3 4 1 average node degree the number of nodes j that node i is connected to is referred to as the node degree k of i in an undirected network the average node degree k is defined as k 2 l n where l represents the number of links in the network and n represents the number of nodes in the network however not all graphs are undirected movement for example a common dynamic modelled in spatial abms is directional where eab agents move from a location to a location thus it is important to differentiate between the ingoing links kin with outgoing links kout node total degree k in a directed network is defined as k k i n k o u t the average node degree k in a directed network is defined as k l n 3 4 2 degree distribution the degree distribution p k calculates the fraction of nodes in a network with degree k kin or kout using the example of degree k the fraction of nodes in a network with degree k can be calculated by the number of the nodes with the same degree divided by the total number of nodes in the network n for example if there are four nodes in the network where k 1 and there are a total of 10 nodes p k 0 4 p k can be plotted on a histogram to present the degree distribution of the network the degree distribution is tested for goodness of fit using powerlaw a python package for analysis of heavy tailed distributions alstott et al 2014 3 4 3 average path length a path p i 0 i n that connects the nodes i 0 and i n in a graph g n l is defined as an ordered collection of n 1 nodes n p i 0 i 1 i 2 i n and n edges l p i 0 i 1 i 1 i 2 i n 1 i n the shortest path length between any two nodes in the network model l s is calculated by implementing dijkstra s shortest path algorithm into the n abm dijkstra 1959 an algorithm developed to find the shortest number of links connecting any two pairs of nodes in the network average path length l s is defined as the average value of l i j 3 4 4 average clustering coefficient the clustering coefficient c measures the probability that nodes j connected to node i are also connected to each other watts and strogatz 1998 when c 1 all nodes connected to node i are connected to each other when c 0 nodes connected to node i are not connected to each other generating a star like structure the clustering coefficient is formulated as c i e i 2 k i k i 1 where for node i of degree k i e i is the number of edges among the neighbours of i the average clustering coefficient is formulated as c 1 n where the brackets denote the average clustering coefficient over the network 4 results this section presents the n abm simulation outcomes and the analysis of the generated spatial network structures to account for stochasticity in generated network structures the n abm is executed 50 times thus generating 50 different simulation outcomes the average values and the standard error across all 50 model runs for average node degree k degree distribution p k average clustering coefficient c and average path length ls are calculated and presented in table 4 the obtained standard error for each network measure is very small indicating that the n abm generates very similar network structures across all runs this is supported by visibly similar power law degree distributions p k across all 50 simulated network structures as presented in fig 4 accompanied by minor differences in the calculated alpha exponent table 4 large amounts of variation across several abm outputs typically points to stochastic uncertainty brown et al 2005 however the minor variation observed in network structure across 50 model runs suggests that the emergent network structure is a function of the generative mechanisms that are implemented in the model rather than randomness therefore using one network as example to present the results is a viable option as other 49 networks have similar network structure indicated by the similar obtained network measures for each based on this analysis and for the purpose of clarity and visual presentation of the generated maps with network structures one example network is selected and presented in the following sections 4 1 simulation results fig 5 presents one full model run of the n abm representing the spread of eab infestation across the town of oakville ontario from 2008 to 2009 specifically fig 5 shows both the infestation extent as a function of the eab and tree agents interactions and the generated spatial network structures for time ti particularly simulation outputs for july 2008 at t 61 fig 5 a1 a2 august 2008 at t 92 fig 5b1 b2 july 2009 at t 426 fig 5c1 c2 august 2009 at t 457 fig 5d1 d2 are presented the eab are most active during the month of july and august and therefore the most notable changes in network structure are visible the infestation extent as a function of the agent interactions fig 5 a1 b1 c1 and d1 and the network structures fig 5 a2 b2 c2 and d2 are extracted as separate geospatial layers for better visualization however both are derived from the same model run following model initialization in 2008 eab spreads locally outward from the epicenter in the north eastern half of the city from the epicenter clusters of infestation develop to the south east and the west of the epicenter a satellite population develops in the southern end of the city and in 2009 the second year of eab infestation the satellite population and the main infestation front merge this is referred to as a stratified dispersal pattern commonly observed in real world eab spread muirhead et al 2006 4 2 analysis of the spatial network structure results using the topology of the example simulated eab infestation network in august 2009 derived from the n abm at the final time step t 457 the resulting graph theory measures are summarized in table 4 4 2 1 graph size the eab infestation network in august 2009 is composed of 2540 nodes meaning that there are just over 2500 infested trees in the network the number of links or dispersal pathways connecting these nodes or infested trees is 27 560 4 2 2 average node degree and degree distribution the kout and kin measures mathematically characterize different dynamics in the infestation network a kout value of 4 48 indicates that on average eab agents move from infested tree node i to 4 48 other tree nodes j therefore kout characterizes the local connectivity of each tree node i to other desirable trees j in its proximity a kin value of 4 40 indicates that on average eab agents move from 4 40 other tree nodes j to tree node i therefore kin characterize the desirability of tree node i the max degree k max for kout is 64 and the min degree k min for kout is 1 the max degree k max for kin is 52 and the min degree k min for kin is 1 the values of degree do not indicate the volume of beetles that move across these links but rather that several beetles move along each path from node i to node j the volume of beetles can be represented by node or link weights however node and link weights are not included in this network representation to maintain simplicity the degree distribution p kout and p kin can provide information regarding the type of network that emerges from dynamics at the local scale the p kout and p kin are plotted as histograms in fig 6 a and 6b respectively and as a log log plot in fig 6c and d the histograms in fig 6a and 6b indicate that there are a large fraction of nodes in the network with a very small degree and a small fraction of nodes in the network with a very large degree in the log log plot fig 6c and d this distribution can be described as linear distributions with heavy tails the degree distribution for p kout and p kin can be described as a power law distribution the distributions produce an alpha exponent α of 1 58 and 1 59 for p kout and p kin respectively and a standard error sigma σ of 0 01 for both the kolmogorov smirnov distance d is also small with a value of 0 16 for both the goodness of fit of the degree distribution between a power law and an exponential distribution is first compared producing a log likelihood ratio r between the two candidate distributions that indicates a power law is a better fit than an exponential with a p value of 0 0072 and 0 04 for p kout and p kin respectively the directed degrees are also presented spatially fig 7 a and b for both kout and kin there is a distinguishable core region composed of ash trees that have a high node degree k surrounded by a large perimeter composed of ash trees that have a low node degree k node degree k appears to coincide with real world eab infestation severity fig 7c table 5 this is determined by classifying all tree nodes into high medium low and zero degree classes based on their simulated degree the degree of a tree is classified as high degree if it falls 1 5 standard deviation medium degree if from 0 5 to 1 5 of the standard deviation and as low degree if it falls 0 5 of the standard deviation all trees with a simulated node degree of zero are classified as zero degree using a confusion matrix approach congalton 1991 the simulated degree class of each tree node is compared to high medium low infestation severity in addition to no infestation observed in the real world for 2009 for the same tree the overall spatial similarity is 67 where trees with a simulated high degree and medium degree corresponds moderately well with high 18 omission and 36 commission and with medium 33 omission and 18 commission infestation severity in the real world respectively this is not a model validation metric because since the network is not weighted the tree node degree does not necessarily correlate with tree population density and thus cannot be compared to infestation severity however it does indicate that trees that have a high degree in the infestation network are thus are highly spatially accessible and may influence infestation severity 4 2 3 degree distribution across time using the developed n abm approach all graph theory measures can be calculated at any point in time to better understand the change in network structure as it grows and evolves the degree distribution p kout is used here as an example in each model time step the p kout of the infestation network maintains a power law the power law in the early stages of the infestation has an exponent of 3 34 over time the exponent decreases before settling at 1 58 table 6 the generated power laws indicate that at the beginning of each season of eab infestation there is a burst of new eab dispersal where the network is expanded over geographic space and infested tree nodes with a low degree are added to the network the season of eab infestation continues and links form between trees that already exist in the infestation network as eab dynamics such as attraction to trees of ash species attraction to stressed trees and carrying capacity begin to play a role in the network structure this process is quantified by the changes in the power law degree distributions over time where the power law in early months of infestation has a much higher fraction of tree nodes with a low degree than in the following months 4 2 4 average clustering coefficient the average clustering coefficient is 0 03 meaning that node linkages form a star like pattern most of the core region of infested trees is composed of trees with a very low clustering coefficient meaning that only a few of the nodes that are connected to node i are also connected to each other in total there are only three trees with a clustering coefficient of 1 where all nodes that are connected to node i are also connected to each other we can present this spatially to highlight where clusters exist fig 8 the majority of the nodes with high clustering are near the perimeter this is potentially an edge effect where eab agents can no longer spread due to artificial administrative town boundary and thus continue to infest trees in close proximity resulting in a higher clustering coefficient near the town administrative boundary 4 2 5 average path length the average path length is short with an average of 11 intermediate nodes that make up the path between any two nodes in the network this indicates that as a function of the spatial distribution of ash tree hosts and the flight dynamics of eab eab are capable to spread across long distances in a short period of time using the topology of the simulated eab infestation network in august 2009 derived from the n abmrand at the final time step t 457 the resulting graph theory measures are summarized in table 7 comparing the obtained n abm analysis results for the case study of the eab with the n abmrand indicates that the n abm spatial infestation network structure is scale free with hub and spoke architecture formed by a power law degree distribution for both p kout and p kin with an exponent α of 1 58 and 1 59 respectively specifically the short average path length of the n abm at 11 27 nodes in comparison to the average path length of the n abmrand at 22 86 nodes in addition to a power law degree distribution an average path length in a network that is less than the average path length of its equivalent random network is a defining feature of a scale free network barabási 2016 characterization of emergent spatial network structure can provide insight into network dynamics for example if instead of a scale free network a random network structure was formed this would indicate that the underlying processes driving the emergence of the spatial network structure are random at the most basic level scale free networks form as the result of two simple generative mechanisms growth and preferential attachment also known as the rich get richer phenomenon in preferential attachment the probability that a new node becomes connected to an existing node is a function of the existing node s degree the higher the degree the more likely the node will form a connection to understand why the scale free network structure emerges the generative mechanisms included in the n abm can be examined a correlation between degree and tree stress at r2 0 87 indicates that the eab host selection process specifically the eab attraction to stressed trees is responsible for the generation of dynamics of preferential attachment and thus the emergent scale free network structure in the real world trees that are preferable for oviposition are infested resulting in the release of stress volatiles this creates a positive feedback where as ash trees suitable for host selection become increasingly infested stress volatiles are released and thus the trees are increasingly targeted for attack networks generated by preferential attachment tend to have high degree nodes or hubs near the center of the network with node degrees that gradually declines toward the perimeter and outer edges of the network this emerging pattern is produced in the developed n abm further analysis of the network structure does not indicate a significant relationship between node degree and tree size or node degree and tree type non spatial scale free models are not constrained by space and thus commonly contain long distance linkages to non adjacent nodes however in the spatial n abm long distance links come at a cost and thus are limited to the natural dispersal distance of the eab taylor et al 2007 the lack of relationship between node degree and tree size or tree type may be a result of the heterogeneous nature of host trees in the environment and the limitation of generating long distance links trees of the most attractive type in the study area may not be available within the flight distance radius allotted to the eab agent per day leaving agents to choose the largest or best type available to them at a closer proximity based on the obtained simulation results suggest that the emergent spatial pattern of eab spread are primarily a function of the generative mechanisms of preferential attachment based on tree stress tree distance and growth or continuing spread of infestation over time in this study it is empirically demonstrated that in the same way scale free networks emerge from growth and preferential attachment patterns of eab insect infestation emerge from host selection dynamics over time furthermore the characterization of network structure can provide additional insights useful for pest management for example scale free networks are particularly robust to the removal of nodes at random meaning that an impactful removal of trees would need to be highly strategized 5 discussion and conclusion exploring the influence of the spatial structure of the landscape on ecological processes is critical landscape connectivity graphs are more recently implemented for this purpose but are typically static network representations at a single scale as a result landscape connectivity graphs are unable to capture the complexity in dispersal processes whereby interactions at the local scale generate spatio temporal dispersal patterns at the larger scale for example in the case of insect infestation it is important to explore how interactions between eab and varying spatial distributions of ash tree hosts generate large scale spatio temporal patterns of infestation the inclusion of complexity in spatial ecological network approaches can characterize and quantify spatio temporal patterns in ecological systems that might otherwise be described in a more qualitative manner identify the underlying interactions and generative mechanisms that drive the emergence of these spatio temporal patterns and quantitatively link dynamics at local scales to emergent patterns at larger scales therefore this study proposes the integration of the complex systems modelling approach abm with spatial networks for the development of a network based abm the approach is demonstrated in application to the case study of the forest insect infestation eab the n abm approach facilitates the exploration between network dynamics and network structure and in this case links the eab attraction to stressed trees at the individual scale to dispersal patterns at larger scales this effectively supports findings in the literature that point to tree stress as the primary factor in host selection mccullough et al 2009 tluczek et al 2011 the approach facilitates the shift from the characterization of network structure to explaining and identifying the underlying interactions that drive the emergence of a dynamic and evolving spatial network structure across all 50 model runs stochastic processes within the n abm produce a distribution of unique spatial networks however results show that each of the simulated spatial networks have a highly similar structure this conclusion is supported by the fact that all spatial network measures for all 50 networks deviate only slightly from the mean and thus have a small standard error as such any selected model run would be fairly although not perfectly representative of the complete distribution of networks therefore only one randomly selected network from one model run is presented in detail this serves the purpose of clarity since it would be overwhelming to visually present all 50 network structures in future work it may be useful to develop an approach to summarize a distribution of spatial networks that emerge from the same local processes averaging the degree of each node across all 50 model runs is insufficient because it would result in a smoothing effect that would ultimately negate network degree heterogeneity which is of great interest in network studies in summary as a function of the randomness of the n abm the spatial pattern of eab spread varies from model run to model run but the network structure does not presenting a clear link between network dynamics and network structure detailed analysis of the variation of the spatial patterns of eab spread across model runs resulting from the abm component used in the n abm can be found in anderson and dragićević 2016 2018 spatial ecological networks can be represented and analyzed at a variety of scales nodes can represent ecological entities from the individual level to various aggregations of individuals community level population level landscape level the modifiable aerial unit problem maup is a phenomenon where statistical outputs vary as a function of the level of aggregation in the model this suggests that the emergent network structure may be a function of the scale at which the phenomenon is represented however the aim of the study is to integrate complexity into spatial ecological networks using an agent based modelling approach justifying the use of individual scale representation it would be desirable to validate the spatial networks themselves generated by the n abm unfortunately the nature of the ecological data and current data collection tools and methods cannot provide network datasets and therefore a model of this kind cannot be validated in this context however the validation of the abm agent processes and interactions integrated in the n abm that generate the spatial networks gives confidence that the spatial networks are being represented correctly in conclusion the novel n abm modelling approach presented here is unique and particularly relevant for modelling complex ecological systems as there is a demand for the exploration of dynamic ecological networks in a spatial and temporal context the application of graph theory to the networks generated by the n abm helps to better understand measure and analyze the influence of geographic space and network structure on network dynamics as well as characterize dispersal patterns particularly useful from an ecological management perspective the n abm framework is also highly general and flexible as to facilitate the representation and simulation of many ecological systems as dynamic evolving networks graph theory provides a large toolset of additional measures that can also be applied for further understanding interactions between other ecological species and the landscape useful for ecological management or conservation for example graph theory measures such as betweenness centrality and link weights can help important habitat features and dispersal pathways that are essential to the connectivity of the landscape for an endangered species and thus be targeted for protection by ecological

time climatic conditions in many mte regions are projected to become both drier and hotter and fire intervals shorter the interval squeeze conceptual model integrates the potential effects of a changing climate and fire regimes on perennial plant population persistence and postulates that warmer drier conditions will negatively affect multiple plant demographic processes dependent on species specific traits the required fire intervals that allow for population persistence might become longer while projected future fire intervals are shorter leading to a potential mismatch however conceptual models are per se not able to quantify outcomes of multiple stochastic processes or to simulate temporal dynamics here we develop a simple process based model for a fire sensitive woody plant species to evaluate the response of demographic processes to future climatic conditions and to quantify the potential impact also of future changes in fire interval this allowed us to assess key assumptions of the interval squeeze model particularly in relation to demographic drivers we simulated populations of banksia hookeriana a typical fire killed shrub found in mtes of south west australia which stores its seeds in a canopy serotinous seedbank and shows strong cohort recruitment in the first year after fire we estimated suitable fixed fire intervals for population persistence under historic climatic conditions and evaluated impacts of a higher dry year frequency as projected under future climate by two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 our findings support the interval squeeze model the fire interval allowing plant population persistence is squeezed from currently 10 28 years to 13 28 years for rcp4 5 for rcp8 5 population persistence is not possible under any of the tested fire intervals because of low seed production and low survival probability of both seedlings and adult plants the results show that projected drier conditions alone will cause a higher extinction risk for fire sensitive perennial plant populations in mtes which is further pronounced in combination with shorter fire intervals this will likely lead to a strong shift in community composition and a loss of biodiversity fire management practices may need to be modified to attempt to counteract prospective biodiversity loss and ecosystem structure change keywords interval squeeze climate change mediterranean type ecosystem simulation model fire ecology drought impacts 1 introduction mediterranean type ecosystems mtes cover only slightly more than 2 of global land area but support 20 of the world s plant species hobbs et al 1995 evergreen and sclerophyllous shrubs and trees dominate these areas with most plants being endemic specht and moll 1983 these ecosystems are characterized by a climate regime with mild wet winters and warm dry summers nutrient poor soils and regular disturbance by fire fire partly compensates for nutrient limitation through the episodic input of nutrient rich ash groom and lamont 2015 due to their high level of biodiversity and endemism mtes are highly vulnerable to species losses as a result of climate change thomas et al 2004 climate projections suggest that climate will become both warmer and drier leading to reduced water availability diffenbaugh and field 2013 in addition fire intervals will shorten in many regions because weather conditions conducive to fire may occur more frequently moritz et al 2012a b mte plant populations are adapted to regular fire for example through the ability to resprout from protected tissues or through regeneration from soil or canopy seed banks although the vegetation in mtes is adapted to dry conditions and frequent fires climate change is expected to negatively affect plant populations and to lead to major changes in these plant communities esther et al 2010 mouillot et al 2002 more frequent fire and reduced water availability produce multiple stressors which affect vegetation in mtes simultaneously multiple stressors have gained attention in global change research because their effects can be synergistic i e their joint effect can be larger than the sum of the single effects crain et al 2008 therefore they potentially undermine the limited resilience of ecosystems the synergistic effects of climate change affect various demographic processes of mte vegetation simultaneously higher fire frequencies in combination with a higher likelihood of dry years increase the probability that a fire is followed by unfavorable weather conditions leading to high seedling mortalities of species that use fire cues to germinate enright et al 2015 when demographic rates i e growth and reproduction are slowed down due to unfavorable climate conditions pereira et al 2007 or when the subsequent fire follows too soon the risk increases that plants will lack a sufficient seedbank for self replacement westerling et al 2011 the existence of multiple stressors impedes the assessment of climate change effects on ecosystems because i stressors may affect different processes within the ecosystem ii quantifying synergistic effects such as the examples described above requires understanding their joint impacts to elucidate the effects of climate change on woody plants in fire driven ecosystems enright et al 2015 proposed the conceptual interval squeeze model this model comprises three essential shifts that could potentially mediate the impact of a drying and warming climate on plant populations i demographic shift characterized by a prolonged juvenile stage and reduced seed production ii post fire recruitment shift i e decreased recruitment of seedlings due to a higher likelihood of adverse weather conditions in the first few years after fire and iii fire interval shift which describes shortened fire intervals under drier and warmer conditions they concluded that under future conditions the required fire interval for population survival might become longer while the actual fire interval will become shorter leading to a squeeze of the survival window interval squeeze and thus a potential threat to population persistence the model of enright et al 2015 is like other conceptual models a highly useful tool to generate hypotheses on the relevance of different drivers in complex situations such as climate change effects on ecosystems to some degree the conceptual model can be tested by empirical data on different processes e g determining seed production germination rates or seedling survival dependent on weather conditions however it may be more difficult to disentangle e g different demographic effects on population survival and to make long term assessments of population viability building on the ideas of the interval squeeze model batllori et al 2017 developed a cellular automaton model to study the cumulative effects of altered fire frequencies and droughts on forest and shrubland vegetation in mtes to test for synergistic effects they defined individual and compound drought and fire scenarios but did not find long term synergistic effects of fire and drought on the composition of broad vegetation types at the landscape level however since their cellular automaton model did not account for drought effects on specific demographic processes it could not fully test the interval squeeze model and the contribution of single demographic processes to population viability to our knowledge no systematic assessment of the effects of changing demographic rates exists so far therefore a quantitative testing of the interval squeeze model and its effect on long term population survival is still incomplete in this study we present a process based model describing the fate of individual plants belonging to a local plant population of the species banksia hookeriana to test key aspects of the interval squeeze model we chose b hookeriana as a typical serotinous non sprouting species i e a species that is killed by fire and recruits from a canopy seedbank the model is parameterized based on empirical data from the fire prone south west australian botanical province and assesses the viability of the population by simulating demographic processes dependent on fire and weather conditions we use the simulation model to evaluate the contribution of the three potential shifts demographic post fire recruitment and fire interval shift on population variability and the squeeze of the survival interval in response to drier conditions under two representative future climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 vuuren et al 2011 2 methods 2 1 study site demographic data on b hookeriana and on climate conditions are based on empirical data from the eneabba sandplain south west australia about 270 km north of perth the long term average annual rainfall in this area is 500 mm year with rain predominantly falling in winter between may and august maximum summer temperature between december and march is frequently above 40 c bureau of meteorology 2017 the soil consists of nutrient poor sands overlaying clay or laterite and low sandy dunes to 10 m local relief determine the topography cowling et al 1996 hnatiuk and hopkins 1980 the vegetation mainly consists of dense sclerophyll shrubland the flora is species rich and dominated by proteaceae myrtaceae epacridaceae and restionaceae groom and lamont 2015 2 2 studied species we use demographic data for b hookeriana proteaceae the species range is comparatively small 5000 km2 miller et al 2007 and restricted to the northern sandplains of south west australia b hookeriana is a fire killed and highly serotinous shrub enright et al 1996 thus it represents a plant strategy that is very common in sclerophyllous shrublands in mtes cowling et al 1996 pausas et al 2004 but potentially disadvantageous under climate change enright et al 2015 in addition the demography of b hookeriana has been extensively explored in the field and in modelling studies enright et al 1998 1996 groeneveld et al 2008 2002 keith et al 2014 lamont et al 1989 2 3 model description in the following we briefly describe the simulation model a full model description following the odd protocol overview design concepts and details grimm et al 2006 grimm et al 2010 as well as a link to the model code is given in the supplementary material appendix a the model simulates the fate of a local population of b hookeriana while seeds in each cohort and seedlings are represented by their total number the demography seed production and storage survival of mature plants is simulated for each individual our model runs on an annual temporal resolution and is not spatially explicit but implicitly covers an area of 100 m by 100 m under the assumption that a mature plant needs a minimum area of 2 m by 2 m esther et al 2008 the maximum population size is 2500 plants 2 3 1 process overview the model calculates the fate of individual plants dependent on yearly weather conditions average versus dry and fire occurrence fig 1 for details see section 2 4 and odd protocol in appendix a in each year without fire mature plants produce seeds which are stored in the canopy the annual survival probability of seedlings and mature plants is age and weather dependent after a certain weather dependent number of years seedlings become mature plants in years with fire mature plants disperse their seeds and all plants die triggered by the fire event all seeds germinate in the next winter leading to an even aged plant cohort all parameter values of the modelled processes are given in table 1 all processes were implemented in netlogo version 6 0 2 wilensky 1999 and results were analyzed with r version 3 4 3 r core team 2017 2 3 1 1 initialization the model is initialized with a starting population of 2500 5 year old mature plants for which seed production is just about to start that is we assume the last fire event to have occurred five years ago weather conditions in the first year are average 2 3 1 2 weather conditions following the approach by esther et al 2008 each year is either classified as average annual rainfall between 555 mm and 376 mm or dry annual rainfall below 376 mm i e more than 20 below average the simulated climate scenarios which determine the probability of average and dry years are described below in section 2 4 2 3 1 3 fire event to allow for a systematic assessment of altered fire interval effects we tested fixed non random fire intervals we chose fixed rather than a random return interval to increase the traceability of the results the estimated mean fire interval for shrublands of the eneabba sandplain over the past four decades is 13 years miller et al 2007 2 3 1 4 seed dispersal b hookeriana plants release all seeds after a fire event since the model is spatially implicit these seeds are assumed to be evenly distributed across the modelled landscape 2 3 1 5 fire mortality b hookeriana lacks the ability to re sprout enright and lamont 1989 thus the local plant population dies when fire occurs 2 3 1 6 germination the simulated plants require fire to cue germinate thus germination only occurs in the year after fire all seeds are assumed to germinate esther et al 2008 without any limitation of seedling number 2 3 1 7 seed production the total number of seeds alive i e the canopy seed store under average conditions is assumed to follow a logistic function of age following the approach by groeneveld et al 2002 the derivative of this function leads to the number of seeds gained per year and plant implicitly including newly produced seeds and seed losses via mortality 1 δ seeds l e k age 1 m e k age 2 f dry if last years weather conditions were dry l e k age 1 m e k age 2 else the parameters l and k describe the steepness of the growth of the canopy seedbank and m describes the size of the canopy seedbank in the equilibrium in years following a dry year seed production is assumed to be reduced by fdry to 50 of normal production keith et al 2014 seeds remain in the canopy and are stored until seed longevity age smax 15 years is reached enright et al 1998 2 3 1 8 inter fire mortality of mature plants the mortality of adult plants in years between fires depends on their age and the weather conditions until the age of 25 years the mortality is constant afterwards mortality is higher due to senescence and plants can reach a maximal age of plants of agemax 40 years for dry years mortality increases by 6 relative to average conditions enright et al 2015 2 3 1 9 inter fire mortality of seedlings the mortality of seedlings decreases with age we follow the approach of groeneveld et al 2002 who transformed regression curves of field data to survival probabilities in dry years seedling mortality is higher than in average years 2 3 1 10 establishment seedlings become mature plants and start producing seeds at the age of five years under average weather conditions if weather conditions in the year of establishment are dry maturity for all plants is delayed by one year and by two years if the subsequent year also exhibits dry weather conditions at age seven years surviving plants become reproductive irrespective of weather conditions burrows 2008 enright et al 1998 the number of surviving mature plants is limited to a capacity of 2500 due to spatial constraints if seedling number exceeds this capacity the excess seedlings are deemed to have died mature plants are thereafter followed individually for seed production and survival 2 4 climate scenarios we simplify annual weather conditions as either dry or average for the baseline scenario we calculated the probabilities for dry and average years based on long term rainfall records from the dongara climate station which is the closest climate station to the eneabba field sites with long term 100 years rainfall records bureau of meteorology 2017 for future conditions we used climate projections for two representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 we obtained projections for future conditions climate change in australia 2017 for an intermediate emissions scenario rcp4 5 which reaches a radiative forcing value of 4 5 w m² in 2100 and a high emissions scenario rcp8 5 with radiative forcing of 8 5 w m² in 2100 vuuren et al 2011 from these we extracted projections of the relative reduction in monthly precipitation these were used as input data for a rain generator see appendix d to simulate 200 years of precipitation and to derive probabilities for dry and normal years in our simulations we did not account for a gradual transition between present and projected future climates but rather assessed demographic responses to a given scenario with a constant mean in annual precipitation to better assess the direct impact of given climate conditions instead of memory effects the probability of dry years increases with climate change intensity see table 2 2 5 simulation experiments after evaluating population viability for a time period of 200 years with a fixed fire interval of 13 years under each of the three climate scenarios baseline scenario with current conditions rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario we simulate the interval squeeze model this simulation follows the original concept of enright et al 2015 and consists of four consecutive simulation experiments demographic shift post fire recruitment shift demographic envelope and interval squeeze for each experiment the results for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are compared to the baseline scenario current conditions the first three experiments show demographic processes following a single fire event and thus show the effects of drier conditions for this we run the simulation over 58 years and apply a fire in year 8 in which the age of the population is 13 years afterwards no further fire events are applied demographic processes are then evaluated for years 8 to 58 i e 0 50 years after the fire has occurred the forth experiment evaluates population viability over 200 years for fixed fire intervals ranging from 6 to 32 years all experiments were replicated 30 times for each weather and fire condition to account for stochasticity in mortality and the occurrence of dry years demographic shift describes seed accumulation over time following a single fire event for 50 years after a fire we record the number of stored seeds per plant no further fire event occurs post fire recruitment shift estimates the number of four year old seedlings present after a single fire event relative to the number of available seeds stored on plants at the time of fire differences between climate scenarios are statistically evaluated using the wilcoxon rank sum test for non normally distributed data demographic envelope combines the two previous analyses and shows the resulting relative change in population size the number of mature plants until 50 years after a single fire event is compared to the number of mature plants at the time of fire successful self replacement is indicated when the ratio is equal to or greater than one no further fire event occurs interval squeeze assesses the viability of the plant population under the three climate scenarios for different fixed fire intervals ranging from 6 to 32 years which corresponds to the time frame in which viable seeds may be available in the canopy for short intervals seed production is very low due to the logistic function of seed production while at longer intervals maximum seed longevity has been reached results show the survival time of the population during a total simulation time of 200 years for a specified fire interval we measure the duration of successful survival as the last point in time at which the population shows a successful self replacement as calculated for the demographic envelope with this measure we capture that a population might not have gone extinct yet but will go extinct in the near future 2 5 1 climate change impacts on seeds seedlings and adults to analyze the impacts of climate change on different demographic stages of the population we compared the relative change in the number of seeds seedlings and adult plants between baseline and climate change scenarios for seeds we evaluated the numbers at the time of fire year 8 for seedlings we evaluated the number four years after the fire year 12 i e in the year before seedlings reach maturity and for adults we evaluated the number of mature plants 13 years after a fire year 21 i e at the time when the next fire would occur assuming a regular fire interval of 13 years for each demographic stage seeds seedlings adult plants we transposed the data relative to the median value of the respective stage for the baseline scenario this facilitates assessing the impacts of climate change on each demographic stage 3 results for the current mean fire interval of 13 years estimated populations are viable and stable under the baseline scenario and the moderate rcp4 5 scenario fig 2 for underlying dynamics of seeds seedlings and mature plants see appendix c fig c1 for the rcp8 5 scenario the high probability of dry years leads to rapid extinction of the population in the following we present the results of the four consecutive simulation experiments to evaluate the interval squeeze model 3 1 demographic shift irrespective of climatic conditions current climate rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the number of seeds reaches a peak at around 20 years after fire and declines thereafter fig 3 a by plant age 35 years the stand level seed store has markedly declined as seeds are lost from old cones and senescing plants climate change impacts the absolute number of seeds their numbers are highest for current conditions and decrease with drier conditions additionally the onset of seed production is later for the rcp8 5 scenario 3 1 1 post fire recruitment shift the recruitment probability was calculated as the number of recruited seedlings four years after fire in relation to the total number of seeds released at the time of fire the recruitment probability decreases with increasing probability of dry years leading to a significant decline of the median under severe climate change fig 3b see appendix b for p and w values of the wilcoxon rank sum test at the same time variability in recruitment probability also decreases between rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 3 1 2 demographic envelope for the baseline scenario fig 3c the time interval of successful self replacement ranges from five to thirteen years if the next fire event occurred within this time range the number of mature plants at the time of fire occurrence would be higher than the number at the previous fire however this does not reflect that seed production might not have started yet fig 3a potentially leading to an extinction of the population after the next fire for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the median values indicate that self replacement does not occur after the first fire but since there is a high variability between simulation runs in 25 of the runs self replacement is possible for the same interval as for the baseline scenario simulation runs in which self replacement was tested after a second fire instead after the first showed an increased probability of self replacement for the rcp4 5 scenario 3 1 3 interval squeeze to assess the combined impacts of drier conditions and a change in the mean fire interval on population viability we evaluated how long it took within a total simulation time of 200 years before self replacement was no longer possible for different fixed fire intervals with multiple fires a value of 200 years indicates successful self replacement through to the end of the simulation time i e potentially long term population viability for the baseline scenario long term survival is possible for fire intervals between 10 and 28 years in the rcp4 5 scenario the fire interval that allows for population persistence is squeezed to a fire interval of 13 28 years in the rcp8 5 scenario all populations go extinct in less than 200 years irrespective of the fire interval and the uncertainty in the survival duration of a population is larger than for the other scenarios for this scenario the longest survival durations are reached at intervals between 15 and 23 years 3 2 impact of climate change on seeds seedlings and adults we assessed the number of seeds seedlings and adult plants for different climate conditions to determine the contribution of changes in different demographic processes to overall population performance under drier conditions table 3 shows results from simulations of a single fire event occurring in year 8 we determined the number of seeds in the year before the fire the number of seedlings four years after the fire and the number of adults 13 years after the fire the absolute and relative loss of individuals between demographic stages is largest from the seed to the seedling stage with survival rates lower than 1 losses are higher for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios than for the baseline scenario the overall losses are smaller from the seedling to the adult stage during the demographic process of establishment i e growth from seedling to mature plant up to about half of the individuals can survive and establish all in all the total number of seeds versus adult plants differs by two to three orders of magnitude comparing the climate scenarios shows that the total number of individuals decreases with increasing dry year probability to assess the impact of higher dry year probabilities on the three demographic processes we transformed the results relative to the medians of the respective demographic stage in the baseline scenario fig 4 for all demographic stages the relative reduction is much higher for rcp8 5 than for rcp4 5 for rcp4 5 the highest reduction compared to the baseline scenario occurs during the seedling stage and the rcp8 5 scenario shows high reductions during seedling and adult stages compared to the baseline scenario 4 discussion our results confirm the hypothesis of the interval squeeze model that shorter fire intervals in combination with drying climate are highly likely to cause a decline and possible extinction in serotinous non sprouting mte shrubland plant species our model results also show that future population persistence under drier conditions would require longer fire intervals for the rcp4 5 scenario and that persistence is not possible for the rcp8 5 scenario this is in contrast with a pure correlative study using species distribution modelling to assess range contractions of extractions of banksia species in response to changing climate yates et al 2010 here a general increase in the range of banksia hookeriana was found if land transformations were not accounted for however this estimate did not include any demographic processes or impacts of higher fire frequency 4 1 the role of demographic processes under drier conditions during post fire stand development fire killed plant populations undergo consecutive steps during which the potential population size of the next generation can be drastically decreased in our simulation experiment these steps are clearly separable since the population forms an even aged cohort as a result of fire all plants of the old generation are killed and a new generation establishes from seeds germinating in the first year after a fire in our experiments we assumed plant traits and experienced environmental settings to be the same for each individual since we are simulating cohorts in a spatially implicit landscape accounting for individual differences would not have altered the general outcome but would have increased the variance of results the first demographic process that we evaluated was seed production based on empirical findings keith et al 2014 we assumed a lower number of newly produced seeds per plant in years with below average rainfall conditions and a later onset of reproduction this led to a lower total number of seeds per plant in our two climate change scenario simulations relative to the baseline the peak in seed availability was reached for all climate scenarios when the number of newly produced seeds equaled the number of seeds that had reached their maximum longevity of 15 years afterwards the number of available seeds declined strongly not only for a single plant but also for the whole population since it consists of an even aged senescing cohort the next demographic stage seedlings is adversely affected by drier conditions because seedling mortality is higher under dry than under average conditions enright et al 2014 this higher seedling mortality led to a lower ratio of seedlings per seed under the increasingly dry and very dry conditions of the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios than for the baseline scenario post fire recruitment shift fig 3b while the median survival rate of seedlings after four years was 0 85 for the baseline scenario this decreased to 0 49 for rcp4 5 and to 0 37 for rcp8 5 the largest difference between results for historic climate conditions and results for the rcp8 5 scenario is found for the demographic envelope which describes the population change in terms of adult plants over time compared to pre fire population size the envelope after a single fire event shows a higher variability for the rcp4 5 scenario compared to the baseline scenario and successful self replacement only occurred in less than half of the replicates no successful self replacement is possible for the rcp8 5 scenario therefore the population will not survive under climatic conditions of the rcp8 5 scenario as also apparent for the overall interval squeeze accounting for multiple fires fig 3d but also under the rcp4 5 scenario survival would be threatened if additionally the fire interval was shorter than today our analyses show the results of a fixed non random fire interval which certainly affects the range of the fire interval allowing for population survival for short mean fire intervals which allow for survival under the assumption of a fixed fire interval the probability of extinction would increase this is caused by the high probability of occurrence of occasional very short inter fire periods which would not allow enough time for accumulation of a sufficient seed store due to the non linear response of the population this negative impact cannot be balanced by positive impacts of longer inter fire periods the same applies for long mean fire intervals for which under random occurrence of fire seed longevity could be exceeded for some very long inter fire period again leading to extinction of the population thus accounting for random processes in the fire interval would overall decrease the range of the mean fire interval compatible with population persistence when comparing the absolute numbers of seeds seedlings and adults it becomes evident that generally the germination of seeds and the survival of seedlings is the biggest bottleneck in the survival of this species which is also evident from empirical studies enright et al 2014 even under current climate conditions less than 1 of seeds are still alive as seedlings after four years the bottleneck of maturity is much less pronounced and more than 30 of the seedlings that were alive in year four are still alive as mature plants after nine additional years plants have adapted to these bottlenecks by producing a very high number of seeds up to 1400 per plant enright et al 1996 to compensate for these high losses in the climate change scenarios populations have a slightly reduced total seed number under the rcp4 5 84 of the baseline scenario and a stronger reduced number under the rcp8 5 scenario 72 this is caused by two factors the total plant number directly before the first fire event occurs is lower due to increased plant mortality and each plant produces less seeds as a result of dryer conditions that is while the survival of seedlings is the major survival bottleneck under present climate the number of available seeds will become an additional bottleneck under future conditions especially for conditions as predicted for the rcp8 5 scenario these differences in seed availabilities are then accentuated in the next demographic steps in our study we focused on drier climate conditions in combination with more frequent fires to quantitatively evaluate the interval squeeze model proposed by enright et al 2015 however especially in woodlands increased aridity can lower productivity and thus the availability of fuel therefore in woodlands fire activity may also decrease in response to climate change bradstock 2010 in case of moderate changes in climate as assumed in the rcp4 5 scenario b hookeriana might still persist in the future under less frequent fires as shown in the interval squeeze simulations fig 3d however in case of strong changes in climate rcp8 5 the combination of lower seed production with higher seedling and adult mortality will lead to extinction of this species regardless of the fire interval 4 2 buffer mechanisms under altered conditions our results suggest that more frequent dry years and shorter fire intervals generate synergistic effects which reduce population persistence of b hookeriana as compared to either driver alone this synergistic effect has also been found in a landscape model of mtes which explicitly highlighted the combined impacts of fire and soil moisture on vegetation succession millington et al 2009 in our case the combination of both stressors negatively affects seed availability as a starting point for the next generation in this regard the seedbank can be seen as a buffer mechanism of the population against fires buffer mechanisms often play an important role for the dynamics of ecosystem variables jeltsch et al 2000 in our case the buffer mechanism is reduced as a result of drier conditions and because more frequent fire intervals do not allow sufficient time for seed accumulation therefore the population viability decreases kelly and brotons 2017 suggested using life history traits to estimate upper and lower bounds of fire intervals and to use these to avoid species extinctions and thus to promote biodiversity our simple spatially implicit model allowed us to quantify these bounds for b hookeriana alternatively we could use the model in a follow up approach to systematically assess the impact of life history traits on shifts of these bounds here we could test how the finding might differ for plants with different traits related to dispersal and recruitment e g plants with a lesser degree of serotiny or with a soil seedbank in a field study covering four post fire years at 33 sites with different interfire intervals enright et al 2014 showed that species with a soil seedbank and species with the ability to resprout were less vulnerable to shortened fire intervals a proportion of seeds from species with a soil seedbank do not germinate after a fire auld and denham 2006 which may constitute a buffer mechanism against adverse recruitment conditions in post fire years resprouting species have the advantage that they do not exclusively rely on successful seedling recruitment for population persistence however the capacity of this buffer mechanism is limited as well because very short fire intervals can increase mortality rates in resprouters enright et al 2011 in addition when mature plants cannot be replaced due to low recruitment long term adverse effects due to ageing of the population are likely enright et al 2014 additional buffer mechanisms may work at other ecological levels than at the level of the individual plant or of the population for example batllori et al 2017 suggested in their modelling study that vegetation heterogeneity in the landscape might mediate synergistic effects of changing fire frequencies and drought on mte vegetation also vegetation diversity can constitute a buffer mechanism that has been shown to mitigate the loss of ecosystem functionality through climate change in drylands including mtes maestre et al 2012 thus trait based demographic approaches are needed to increase our understanding of how future plant communities may be structured and whether ecosystems will be able to retain their functioning 5 conclusion using a simple vegetation model which we parameterized for a population of the serotinous fire killed shrub banksia hookeriana we found that a drying climate reduces the range of fire intervals compatible with population persistence while the required fire interval for persistence is longer under future drier climate actual fire intervals are projected to become shorter leading to a strong mismatch this mismatching effect of multiple stressors poses a threat for b hookeriana but might differ for species with different traits such as resprouters and inter fire recruiters this presents a challenge for managers who must find ways to reconcile biodiversity conservation needs and fire hazard

universität berlin biodiversity theoretical ecology altensteinstr 34 berlin 14195 germany mediterranean type ecosystems mtes harbor an exceptionally high biodiversity of vascular plants at the same time climatic conditions in many mte regions are projected to become both drier and hotter and fire intervals shorter the interval squeeze conceptual model integrates the potential effects of a changing climate and fire regimes on perennial plant population persistence and postulates that warmer drier conditions will negatively affect multiple plant demographic processes dependent on species specific traits the required fire intervals that allow for population persistence might become longer while projected future fire intervals are shorter leading to a potential mismatch however conceptual models are per se not able to quantify outcomes of multiple stochastic processes or to simulate temporal dynamics here we develop a simple process based model for a fire sensitive woody plant species to evaluate the response of demographic processes to future climatic conditions and to quantify the potential impact also of future changes in fire interval this allowed us to assess key assumptions of the interval squeeze model particularly in relation to demographic drivers we simulated populations of banksia hookeriana a typical fire killed shrub found in mtes of south west australia which stores its seeds in a canopy serotinous seedbank and shows strong cohort recruitment in the first year after fire we estimated suitable fixed fire intervals for population persistence under historic climatic conditions and evaluated impacts of a higher dry year frequency as projected under future climate by two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 our findings support the interval squeeze model the fire interval allowing plant population persistence is squeezed from currently 10 28 years to 13 28 years for rcp4 5 for rcp8 5 population persistence is not possible under any of the tested fire intervals because of low seed production and low survival probability of both seedlings and adult plants the results show that projected drier conditions alone will cause a higher extinction risk for fire sensitive perennial plant populations in mtes which is further pronounced in combination with shorter fire intervals this will likely lead to a strong shift in community composition and a loss of biodiversity fire management practices may need to be modified to attempt to counteract prospective biodiversity loss and ecosystem structure change keywords interval squeeze climate change mediterranean type ecosystem simulation model fire ecology drought impacts 1 introduction mediterranean type ecosystems mtes cover only slightly more than 2 of global land area but support 20 of the world s plant species hobbs et al 1995 evergreen and sclerophyllous shrubs and trees dominate these areas with most plants being endemic specht and moll 1983 these ecosystems are characterized by a climate regime with mild wet winters and warm dry summers nutrient poor soils and regular disturbance by fire fire partly compensates for nutrient limitation through the episodic input of nutrient rich ash groom and lamont 2015 due to their high level of biodiversity and endemism mtes are highly vulnerable to species losses as a result of climate change thomas et al 2004 climate projections suggest that climate will become both warmer and drier leading to reduced water availability diffenbaugh and field 2013 in addition fire intervals will shorten in many regions because weather conditions conducive to fire may occur more frequently moritz et al 2012a b mte plant populations are adapted to regular fire for example through the ability to resprout from protected tissues or through regeneration from soil or canopy seed banks although the vegetation in mtes is adapted to dry conditions and frequent fires climate change is expected to negatively affect plant populations and to lead to major changes in these plant communities esther et al 2010 mouillot et al 2002 more frequent fire and reduced water availability produce multiple stressors which affect vegetation in mtes simultaneously multiple stressors have gained attention in global change research because their effects can be synergistic i e their joint effect can be larger than the sum of the single effects crain et al 2008 therefore they potentially undermine the limited resilience of ecosystems the synergistic effects of climate change affect various demographic processes of mte vegetation simultaneously higher fire frequencies in combination with a higher likelihood of dry years increase the probability that a fire is followed by unfavorable weather conditions leading to high seedling mortalities of species that use fire cues to germinate enright et al 2015 when demographic rates i e growth and reproduction are slowed down due to unfavorable climate conditions pereira et al 2007 or when the subsequent fire follows too soon the risk increases that plants will lack a sufficient seedbank for self replacement westerling et al 2011 the existence of multiple stressors impedes the assessment of climate change effects on ecosystems because i stressors may affect different processes within the ecosystem ii quantifying synergistic effects such as the examples described above requires understanding their joint impacts to elucidate the effects of climate change on woody plants in fire driven ecosystems enright et al 2015 proposed the conceptual interval squeeze model this model comprises three essential shifts that could potentially mediate the impact of a drying and warming climate on plant populations i demographic shift characterized by a prolonged juvenile stage and reduced seed production ii post fire recruitment shift i e decreased recruitment of seedlings due to a higher likelihood of adverse weather conditions in the first few years after fire and iii fire interval shift which describes shortened fire intervals under drier and warmer conditions they concluded that under future conditions the required fire interval for population survival might become longer while the actual fire interval will become shorter leading to a squeeze of the survival window interval squeeze and thus a potential threat to population persistence the model of enright et al 2015 is like other conceptual models a highly useful tool to generate hypotheses on the relevance of different drivers in complex situations such as climate change effects on ecosystems to some degree the conceptual model can be tested by empirical data on different processes e g determining seed production germination rates or seedling survival dependent on weather conditions however it may be more difficult to disentangle e g different demographic effects on population survival and to make long term assessments of population viability building on the ideas of the interval squeeze model batllori et al 2017 developed a cellular automaton model to study the cumulative effects of altered fire frequencies and droughts on forest and shrubland vegetation in mtes to test for synergistic effects they defined individual and compound drought and fire scenarios but did not find long term synergistic effects of fire and drought on the composition of broad vegetation types at the landscape level however since their cellular automaton model did not account for drought effects on specific demographic processes it could not fully test the interval squeeze model and the contribution of single demographic processes to population viability to our knowledge no systematic assessment of the effects of changing demographic rates exists so far therefore a quantitative testing of the interval squeeze model and its effect on long term population survival is still incomplete in this study we present a process based model describing the fate of individual plants belonging to a local plant population of the species banksia hookeriana to test key aspects of the interval squeeze model we chose b hookeriana as a typical serotinous non sprouting species i e a species that is killed by fire and recruits from a canopy seedbank the model is parameterized based on empirical data from the fire prone south west australian botanical province and assesses the viability of the population by simulating demographic processes dependent on fire and weather conditions we use the simulation model to evaluate the contribution of the three potential shifts demographic post fire recruitment and fire interval shift on population variability and the squeeze of the survival interval in response to drier conditions under two representative future climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 vuuren et al 2011 2 methods 2 1 study site demographic data on b hookeriana and on climate conditions are based on empirical data from the eneabba sandplain south west australia about 270 km north of perth the long term average annual rainfall in this area is 500 mm year with rain predominantly falling in winter between may and august maximum summer temperature between december and march is frequently above 40 c bureau of meteorology 2017 the soil consists of nutrient poor sands overlaying clay or laterite and low sandy dunes to 10 m local relief determine the topography cowling et al 1996 hnatiuk and hopkins 1980 the vegetation mainly consists of dense sclerophyll shrubland the flora is species rich and dominated by proteaceae myrtaceae epacridaceae and restionaceae groom and lamont 2015 2 2 studied species we use demographic data for b hookeriana proteaceae the species range is comparatively small 5000 km2 miller et al 2007 and restricted to the northern sandplains of south west australia b hookeriana is a fire killed and highly serotinous shrub enright et al 1996 thus it represents a plant strategy that is very common in sclerophyllous shrublands in mtes cowling et al 1996 pausas et al 2004 but potentially disadvantageous under climate change enright et al 2015 in addition the demography of b hookeriana has been extensively explored in the field and in modelling studies enright et al 1998 1996 groeneveld et al 2008 2002 keith et al 2014 lamont et al 1989 2 3 model description in the following we briefly describe the simulation model a full model description following the odd protocol overview design concepts and details grimm et al 2006 grimm et al 2010 as well as a link to the model code is given in the supplementary material appendix a the model simulates the fate of a local population of b hookeriana while seeds in each cohort and seedlings are represented by their total number the demography seed production and storage survival of mature plants is simulated for each individual our model runs on an annual temporal resolution and is not spatially explicit but implicitly covers an area of 100 m by 100 m under the assumption that a mature plant needs a minimum area of 2 m by 2 m esther et al 2008 the maximum population size is 2500 plants 2 3 1 process overview the model calculates the fate of individual plants dependent on yearly weather conditions average versus dry and fire occurrence fig 1 for details see section 2 4 and odd protocol in appendix a in each year without fire mature plants produce seeds which are stored in the canopy the annual survival probability of seedlings and mature plants is age and weather dependent after a certain weather dependent number of years seedlings become mature plants in years with fire mature plants disperse their seeds and all plants die triggered by the fire event all seeds germinate in the next winter leading to an even aged plant cohort all parameter values of the modelled processes are given in table 1 all processes were implemented in netlogo version 6 0 2 wilensky 1999 and results were analyzed with r version 3 4 3 r core team 2017 2 3 1 1 initialization the model is initialized with a starting population of 2500 5 year old mature plants for which seed production is just about to start that is we assume the last fire event to have occurred five years ago weather conditions in the first year are average 2 3 1 2 weather conditions following the approach by esther et al 2008 each year is either classified as average annual rainfall between 555 mm and 376 mm or dry annual rainfall below 376 mm i e more than 20 below average the simulated climate scenarios which determine the probability of average and dry years are described below in section 2 4 2 3 1 3 fire event to allow for a systematic assessment of altered fire interval effects we tested fixed non random fire intervals we chose fixed rather than a random return interval to increase the traceability of the results the estimated mean fire interval for shrublands of the eneabba sandplain over the past four decades is 13 years miller et al 2007 2 3 1 4 seed dispersal b hookeriana plants release all seeds after a fire event since the model is spatially implicit these seeds are assumed to be evenly distributed across the modelled landscape 2 3 1 5 fire mortality b hookeriana lacks the ability to re sprout enright and lamont 1989 thus the local plant population dies when fire occurs 2 3 1 6 germination the simulated plants require fire to cue germinate thus germination only occurs in the year after fire all seeds are assumed to germinate esther et al 2008 without any limitation of seedling number 2 3 1 7 seed production the total number of seeds alive i e the canopy seed store under average conditions is assumed to follow a logistic function of age following the approach by groeneveld et al 2002 the derivative of this function leads to the number of seeds gained per year and plant implicitly including newly produced seeds and seed losses via mortality 1 δ seeds l e k age 1 m e k age 2 f dry if last years weather conditions were dry l e k age 1 m e k age 2 else the parameters l and k describe the steepness of the growth of the canopy seedbank and m describes the size of the canopy seedbank in the equilibrium in years following a dry year seed production is assumed to be reduced by fdry to 50 of normal production keith et al 2014 seeds remain in the canopy and are stored until seed longevity age smax 15 years is reached enright et al 1998 2 3 1 8 inter fire mortality of mature plants the mortality of adult plants in years between fires depends on their age and the weather conditions until the age of 25 years the mortality is constant afterwards mortality is higher due to senescence and plants can reach a maximal age of plants of agemax 40 years for dry years mortality increases by 6 relative to average conditions enright et al 2015 2 3 1 9 inter fire mortality of seedlings the mortality of seedlings decreases with age we follow the approach of groeneveld et al 2002 who transformed regression curves of field data to survival probabilities in dry years seedling mortality is higher than in average years 2 3 1 10 establishment seedlings become mature plants and start producing seeds at the age of five years under average weather conditions if weather conditions in the year of establishment are dry maturity for all plants is delayed by one year and by two years if the subsequent year also exhibits dry weather conditions at age seven years surviving plants become reproductive irrespective of weather conditions burrows 2008 enright et al 1998 the number of surviving mature plants is limited to a capacity of 2500 due to spatial constraints if seedling number exceeds this capacity the excess seedlings are deemed to have died mature plants are thereafter followed individually for seed production and survival 2 4 climate scenarios we simplify annual weather conditions as either dry or average for the baseline scenario we calculated the probabilities for dry and average years based on long term rainfall records from the dongara climate station which is the closest climate station to the eneabba field sites with long term 100 years rainfall records bureau of meteorology 2017 for future conditions we used climate projections for two representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 we obtained projections for future conditions climate change in australia 2017 for an intermediate emissions scenario rcp4 5 which reaches a radiative forcing value of 4 5 w m² in 2100 and a high emissions scenario rcp8 5 with radiative forcing of 8 5 w m² in 2100 vuuren et al 2011 from these we extracted projections of the relative reduction in monthly precipitation these were used as input data for a rain generator see appendix d to simulate 200 years of precipitation and to derive probabilities for dry and normal years in our simulations we did not account for a gradual transition between present and projected future climates but rather assessed demographic responses to a given scenario with a constant mean in annual precipitation to better assess the direct impact of given climate conditions instead of memory effects the probability of dry years increases with climate change intensity see table 2 2 5 simulation experiments after evaluating population viability for a time period of 200 years with a fixed fire interval of 13 years under each of the three climate scenarios baseline scenario with current conditions rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario we simulate the interval squeeze model this simulation follows the original concept of enright et al 2015 and consists of four consecutive simulation experiments demographic shift post fire recruitment shift demographic envelope and interval squeeze for each experiment the results for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are compared to the baseline scenario current conditions the first three experiments show demographic processes following a single fire event and thus show the effects of drier conditions for this we run the simulation over 58 years and apply a fire in year 8 in which the age of the population is 13 years afterwards no further fire events are applied demographic processes are then evaluated for years 8 to 58 i e 0 50 years after the fire has occurred the forth experiment evaluates population viability over 200 years for fixed fire intervals ranging from 6 to 32 years all experiments were replicated 30 times for each weather and fire condition to account for stochasticity in mortality and the occurrence of dry years demographic shift describes seed accumulation over time following a single fire event for 50 years after a fire we record the number of stored seeds per plant no further fire event occurs post fire recruitment shift estimates the number of four year old seedlings present after a single fire event relative to the number of available seeds stored on plants at the time of fire differences between climate scenarios are statistically evaluated using the wilcoxon rank sum test for non normally distributed data demographic envelope combines the two previous analyses and shows the resulting relative change in population size the number of mature plants until 50 years after a single fire event is compared to the number of mature plants at the time of fire successful self replacement is indicated when the ratio is equal to or greater than one no further fire event occurs interval squeeze assesses the viability of the plant population under the three climate scenarios for different fixed fire intervals ranging from 6 to 32 years which corresponds to the time frame in which viable seeds may be available in the canopy for short intervals seed production is very low due to the logistic function of seed production while at longer intervals maximum seed longevity has been reached results show the survival time of the population during a total simulation time of 200 years for a specified fire interval we measure the duration of successful survival as the last point in time at which the population shows a successful self replacement as calculated for the demographic envelope with this measure we capture that a population might not have gone extinct yet but will go extinct in the near future 2 5 1 climate change impacts on seeds seedlings and adults to analyze the impacts of climate change on different demographic stages of the population we compared the relative change in the number of seeds seedlings and adult plants between baseline and climate change scenarios for seeds we evaluated the numbers at the time of fire year 8 for seedlings we evaluated the number four years after the fire year 12 i e in the year before seedlings reach maturity and for adults we evaluated the number of mature plants 13 years after a fire year 21 i e at the time when the next fire would occur assuming a regular fire interval of 13 years for each demographic stage seeds seedlings adult plants we transposed the data relative to the median value of the respective stage for the baseline scenario this facilitates assessing the impacts of climate change on each demographic stage 3 results for the current mean fire interval of 13 years estimated populations are viable and stable under the baseline scenario and the moderate rcp4 5 scenario fig 2 for underlying dynamics of seeds seedlings and mature plants see appendix c fig c1 for the rcp8 5 scenario the high probability of dry years leads to rapid extinction of the population in the following we present the results of the four consecutive simulation experiments to evaluate the interval squeeze model 3 1 demographic shift irrespective of climatic conditions current climate rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the number of seeds reaches a peak at around 20 years after fire and declines thereafter fig 3 a by plant age 35 years the stand level seed store has markedly declined as seeds are lost from old cones and senescing plants climate change impacts the absolute number of seeds their numbers are highest for current conditions and decrease with drier conditions additionally the onset of seed production is later for the rcp8 5 scenario 3 1 1 post fire recruitment shift the recruitment probability was calculated as the number of recruited seedlings four years after fire in relation to the total number of seeds released at the time of fire the recruitment probability decreases with increasing probability of dry years leading to a significant decline of the median under severe climate change fig 3b see appendix b for p and w values of the wilcoxon rank sum test at the same time variability in recruitment probability also decreases between rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 3 1 2 demographic envelope for the baseline scenario fig 3c the time interval of successful self replacement ranges from five to thirteen years if the next fire event occurred within this time range the number of mature plants at the time of fire occurrence would be higher than the number at the previous fire however this does not reflect that seed production might not have started yet fig 3a potentially leading to an extinction of the population after the next fire for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the median values indicate that self replacement does not occur after the first fire but since there is a high variability between simulation runs in 25 of the runs self replacement is possible for the same interval as for the baseline scenario simulation runs in which self replacement was tested after a second fire instead after the first showed an increased probability of self replacement for the rcp4 5 scenario 3 1 3 interval squeeze to assess the combined impacts of drier conditions and a change in the mean fire interval on population viability we evaluated how long it took within a total simulation time of 200 years before self replacement was no longer possible for different fixed fire intervals with multiple fires a value of 200 years indicates successful self replacement through to the end of the simulation time i e potentially long term population viability for the baseline scenario long term survival is possible for fire intervals between 10 and 28 years in the rcp4 5 scenario the fire interval that allows for population persistence is squeezed to a fire interval of 13 28 years in the rcp8 5 scenario all populations go extinct in less than 200 years irrespective of the fire interval and the uncertainty in the survival duration of a population is larger than for the other scenarios for this scenario the longest survival durations are reached at intervals between 15 and 23 years 3 2 impact of climate change on seeds seedlings and adults we assessed the number of seeds seedlings and adult plants for different climate conditions to determine the contribution of changes in different demographic processes to overall population performance under drier conditions table 3 shows results from simulations of a single fire event occurring in year 8 we determined the number of seeds in the year before the fire the number of seedlings four years after the fire and the number of adults 13 years after the fire the absolute and relative loss of individuals between demographic stages is largest from the seed to the seedling stage with survival rates lower than 1 losses are higher for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios than for the baseline scenario the overall losses are smaller from the seedling to the adult stage during the demographic process of establishment i e growth from seedling to mature plant up to about half of the individuals can survive and establish all in all the total number of seeds versus adult plants differs by two to three orders of magnitude comparing the climate scenarios shows that the total number of individuals decreases with increasing dry year probability to assess the impact of higher dry year probabilities on the three demographic processes we transformed the results relative to the medians of the respective demographic stage in the baseline scenario fig 4 for all demographic stages the relative reduction is much higher for rcp8 5 than for rcp4 5 for rcp4 5 the highest reduction compared to the baseline scenario occurs during the seedling stage and the rcp8 5 scenario shows high reductions during seedling and adult stages compared to the baseline scenario 4 discussion our results confirm the hypothesis of the interval squeeze model that shorter fire intervals in combination with drying climate are highly likely to cause a decline and possible extinction in serotinous non sprouting mte shrubland plant species our model results also show that future population persistence under drier conditions would require longer fire intervals for the rcp4 5 scenario and that persistence is not possible for the rcp8 5 scenario this is in contrast with a pure correlative study using species distribution modelling to assess range contractions of extractions of banksia species in response to changing climate yates et al 2010 here a general increase in the range of banksia hookeriana was found if land transformations were not accounted for however this estimate did not include any demographic processes or impacts of higher fire frequency 4 1 the role of demographic processes under drier conditions during post fire stand development fire killed plant populations undergo consecutive steps during which the potential population size of the next generation can be drastically decreased in our simulation experiment these steps are clearly separable since the population forms an even aged cohort as a result of fire all plants of the old generation are killed and a new generation establishes from seeds germinating in the first year after a fire in our experiments we assumed plant traits and experienced environmental settings to be the same for each individual since we are simulating cohorts in a spatially implicit landscape accounting for individual differences would not have altered the general outcome but would have increased the variance of results the first demographic process that we evaluated was seed production based on empirical findings keith et al 2014 we assumed a lower number of newly produced seeds per plant in years with below average rainfall conditions and a later onset of reproduction this led to a lower total number of seeds per plant in our two climate change scenario simulations relative to the baseline the peak in seed availability was reached for all climate scenarios when the number of newly produced seeds equaled the number of seeds that had reached their maximum longevity of 15 years afterwards the number of available seeds declined strongly not only for a single plant but also for the whole population since it consists of an even aged senescing cohort the next demographic stage seedlings is adversely affected by drier conditions because seedling mortality is higher under dry than under average conditions enright et al 2014 this higher seedling mortality led to a lower ratio of seedlings per seed under the increasingly dry and very dry conditions of the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios than for the baseline scenario post fire recruitment shift fig 3b while the median survival rate of seedlings after four years was 0 85 for the baseline scenario this decreased to 0 49 for rcp4 5 and to 0 37 for rcp8 5 the largest difference between results for historic climate conditions and results for the rcp8 5 scenario is found for the demographic envelope which describes the population change in terms of adult plants over time compared to pre fire population size the envelope after a single fire event shows a higher variability for the rcp4 5 scenario compared to the baseline scenario and successful self replacement only occurred in less than half of the replicates no successful self replacement is possible for the rcp8 5 scenario therefore the population will not survive under climatic conditions of the rcp8 5 scenario as also apparent for the overall interval squeeze accounting for multiple fires fig 3d but also under the rcp4 5 scenario survival would be threatened if additionally the fire interval was shorter than today our analyses show the results of a fixed non random fire interval which certainly affects the range of the fire interval allowing for population survival for short mean fire intervals which allow for survival under the assumption of a fixed fire interval the probability of extinction would increase this is caused by the high probability of occurrence of occasional very short inter fire periods which would not allow enough time for accumulation of a sufficient seed store due to the non linear response of the population this negative impact cannot be balanced by positive impacts of longer inter fire periods the same applies for long mean fire intervals for which under random occurrence of fire seed longevity could be exceeded for some very long inter fire period again leading to extinction of the population thus accounting for random processes in the fire interval would overall decrease the range of the mean fire interval compatible with population persistence when comparing the absolute numbers of seeds seedlings and adults it becomes evident that generally the germination of seeds and the survival of seedlings is the biggest bottleneck in the survival of this species which is also evident from empirical studies enright et al 2014 even under current climate conditions less than 1 of seeds are still alive as seedlings after four years the bottleneck of maturity is much less pronounced and more than 30 of the seedlings that were alive in year four are still alive as mature plants after nine additional years plants have adapted to these bottlenecks by producing a very high number of seeds up to 1400 per plant enright et al 1996 to compensate for these high losses in the climate change scenarios populations have a slightly reduced total seed number under the rcp4 5 84 of the baseline scenario and a stronger reduced number under the rcp8 5 scenario 72 this is caused by two factors the total plant number directly before the first fire event occurs is lower due to increased plant mortality and each plant produces less seeds as a result of dryer conditions that is while the survival of seedlings is the major survival bottleneck under present climate the number of available seeds will become an additional bottleneck under future conditions especially for conditions as predicted for the rcp8 5 scenario these differences in seed availabilities are then accentuated in the next demographic steps in our study we focused on drier climate conditions in combination with more frequent fires to quantitatively evaluate the interval squeeze model proposed by enright et al 2015 however especially in woodlands increased aridity can lower productivity and thus the availability of fuel therefore in woodlands fire activity may also decrease in response to climate change bradstock 2010 in case of moderate changes in climate as assumed in the rcp4 5 scenario b hookeriana might still persist in the future under less frequent fires as shown in the interval squeeze simulations fig 3d however in case of strong changes in climate rcp8 5 the combination of lower seed production with higher seedling and adult mortality will lead to extinction of this species regardless of the fire interval 4 2 buffer mechanisms under altered conditions our results suggest that more frequent dry years and shorter fire intervals generate synergistic effects which reduce population persistence of b hookeriana as compared to either driver alone this synergistic effect has also been found in a landscape model of mtes which explicitly highlighted the combined impacts of fire and soil moisture on vegetation succession millington et al 2009 in our case the combination of both stressors negatively affects seed availability as a starting point for the next generation in this regard the seedbank can be seen as a buffer mechanism of the population against fires buffer mechanisms often play an important role for the dynamics of ecosystem variables jeltsch et al 2000 in our case the buffer mechanism is reduced as a result of drier conditions and because more frequent fire intervals do not allow sufficient time for seed accumulation therefore the population viability decreases kelly and brotons 2017 suggested using life history traits to estimate upper and lower bounds of fire intervals and to use these to avoid species extinctions and thus to promote biodiversity our simple spatially implicit model allowed us to quantify these bounds for b hookeriana alternatively we could use the model in a follow up approach to systematically assess the impact of life history traits on shifts of these bounds here we could test how the finding might differ for plants with different traits related to dispersal and recruitment e g plants with a lesser degree of serotiny or with a soil seedbank in a field study covering four post fire years at 33 sites with different interfire intervals enright et al 2014 showed that species with a soil seedbank and species with the ability to resprout were less vulnerable to shortened fire intervals a proportion of seeds from species with a soil seedbank do not germinate after a fire auld and denham 2006 which may constitute a buffer mechanism against adverse recruitment conditions in post fire years resprouting species have the advantage that they do not exclusively rely on successful seedling recruitment for population persistence however the capacity of this buffer mechanism is limited as well because very short fire intervals can increase mortality rates in resprouters enright et al 2011 in addition when mature plants cannot be replaced due to low recruitment long term adverse effects due to ageing of the population are likely enright et al 2014 additional buffer mechanisms may work at other ecological levels than at the level of the individual plant or of the population for example batllori et al 2017 suggested in their modelling study that vegetation heterogeneity in the landscape might mediate synergistic effects of changing fire frequencies and drought on mte vegetation also vegetation diversity can constitute a buffer mechanism that has been shown to mitigate the loss of ecosystem functionality through climate change in drylands including mtes maestre et al 2012 thus trait based demographic approaches are needed to increase our understanding of how future plant communities may be structured and whether ecosystems will be able to retain their functioning 5 conclusion using a simple vegetation model which we parameterized for a population of the serotinous fire killed shrub banksia hookeriana we found that a drying climate reduces the range of fire intervals compatible with population persistence while the required fire interval for persistence is longer under future drier climate actual fire intervals are projected to become shorter leading to a strong mismatch this mismatching effect of multiple stressors poses a threat for b hookeriana but might differ for species with different traits such as resprouters and inter fire recruiters this presents a challenge for managers who must find ways to reconcile biodiversity conservation needs and fire hazard
