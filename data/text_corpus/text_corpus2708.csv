13540,the presence of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs in drinking waters might pose a serious threat to human health worldwide therefore this study sought to measure phacs in danube derived tap water from the budapest metropolitan region hungary and to compare the results of those measured in the bank filtrate after which a human health risk assessment based on human risk quotient hrq was conducted for the detected phacs a total of 108 samples were collected from 21 sampling sites throughout 6 sampling campaigns our study screened for 102 phacs of which 19 were detected in the persistently chlorinated tap water samples phac concentrations were much lower than previously assumed based on the contamination of raw water resources the total mean concentration of the analyzed phacs exceeded 30 ng l 1 only at 5 sites moreover the frequency of occurrence fro of the 6 most common compounds carbamazepine lamotrigine lidocaine benzoylecgonine tramadol and cinolazepam reached 50 at 4 sites the most frequent phac was carbamazepine fro 53 7 the risk level of all phacs investigated was negligible hrq 1 with carbamazepine having the highest hrqs hrqmax 0 007 hrqmean 0 001 tap water provided lower phac concentrations farther from the water abstraction wells and treatment stations along the danube the travel time between the drinking water wells and taps with other factors such as the varying microbiological pattern and the deposits in the supply system influence the phac concentrations based on the risk assessment all investigated phacs pose a negligible risk to consumers in the investigated urban area keywords drinking water pharmaceuticals micropollutants spatial variance managed aquifer recharge system 1 introduction due to the increase in human pharmaceutical consumption several pharmaceutically active compounds phacs are released into the environment each day 1 3 the main source of these organic micropollutants is untreated and treated wastewater as common wastewater treatment processes are incapable of removing all pharmaceuticals from contaminated water 4 7 although phacs generally occur at low concentrations in various environmental matrices i e typically at the ng l 1 or μg l 1 level the occurrence and risks of pharmaceuticals with their metabolites or conjugates in the environment is a growing worldwide concern 8 10 this problem is exacerbated by the fact that adverse neurophysiological or genotoxic effects have been linked to certain groups of pharmaceuticals e g antiepileptics opiates which may have mutagenic and or carcinogenic effects 11 14 given that water resources may also be affected by phac contamination 15 18 several studies have associated the occurrence of phacs in raw or treated tap water with serious health risks of 19 21 including genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 22 23 moreover although some phacs e g hormones psychoactive substances anxiolytics antiepileptics antibiotics are known to pose significant risks to aquatic organisms 24 29 the level of human health risk is generally low or negligible in drinking water because they are present only at trace concentrations 30 35 102 103 several regionally varying factors can influence the degree of exposure and risk associated with tap water consumption the absolute amount of phacs released into the environment is the highest in densely populated metropolitan areas 33 but this can be significantly reduced by more advanced wastewater treatment technologies 36 given wastewater treatment plants wwtps are a significant source of emerging environmental contaminants phac concentrations in raw water are fundamentally determined by the efficiency of wastewater treatment procedures 10 generally the fate of the pharmaceuticals depends on their degree of natural attenuation and their physicochemical properties such as their hydrophobicity index log p log kw solubility in water and chemical structure 37 it is important to note that these properties are seriously affected by the local factors or micro environmental parameters e g hydrolysis photolysis microbial degradation or biodegradation 38 39 geological and hydrological characteristics of drinking water sources are very different however polluted rivers lakes or shallow groundwater are the main sources of drinking water in many countries 40 drinking water treatment methods and their efficacy also vary widely which also affects phac concentrations 35 although the most commonly consumed phac and associated substances entering the waterways may vary from country to country many pollutants are ubiquitous and their potential interactions may increase the risks associated with tap water consumption moreover the level of contamination in drinking water and the vulnerability of certain groups of people are not constant in china for example pollution trends are clearly on the rise according to several comparable studies 36 furthermore different age groups and demographics e g children pregnant women elderly people may be more sensitive to even relatively low phac concentrations 16 given that safe drinking water is not only a fundamental determinant of quality of life but also a basic human necessity 41 tap water pollution monitoring and risk assessment should be conducted regularly 17 42 riverbank filtration rbf plays a fundamental role in drinking water supplies along rivers and pounds worldwide although aquifers close to the river are highly exposed to anthropogenic stress many pollutants are efficiently removed by the managed aquifer recharge mar system which reduces the necessity of conventional drinking water treatment 43 45 however lower natural removal is observed for some emerging organic micropollutants such as persistent phacs in hungary the daily water requirements of 40 of the population approximately 4 million people are covered by riverbank filtered water rfw 101 furthermore rfw is also very important in neighboring countries along the river danube e g slovakia serbia 46 due to the high efficiency of rbf drinking water is only routinely chlorinated for disinfection and with a few exceptions no multi stage drinking water treatment systems are in operation therefore persistent micropollutants such as certain phacs can infiltrate into potable water sources and reach the drinking water supply system 43 47 49 in our previous study the efficiency of riverbank filtration was examined and quantified in the budapest metropolitan region 43 50 to explore the connection between surface water and drinking water we scanned the same phacs in the present study however phac concentrations have not yet been determined in the chlorinated tap water therefore this study evaluated phac concentrations in river bank filtrated tap water their potential seasonal changes and their associated human health risk assessment hhra in the budapest metropolitan region specifically we hypothesized that i the same phacs are present at the same concentrations in tap water as they are found in raw drinking water indicating the incomplete effect of chlorination on persistent phac concentrations decrease ii phac concentrations in tap water vary in time and space reflecting the role of raw water characteristics and the supply system iii phacs in tap water pose low health risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area water samples were obtained from the budapest metropolitan region which is a highly urbanized area in hungary with nearly 3 million inhabitants fig 1 rfw accounts for more than 90 of the water supply and the rest of the drinking water is provided by artesian wells and karst water springs in this region more than 1000 drinking water abstraction wells are operated by two large waterworks budapest waterworks and danube regional waterworks in addition to some smaller suppliers budapest waterworks alone operates approximately 750 wells to supply 1 89 million inhabitants and the majority of the drinking abstraction wells operate along the riverbank of the danube 51 due to the predominantly oxidative conditions of the rbf chlorination with chlorine gas and hypochlorite is the most important primary water treatment method 52 as a first step prechlorination occurs along the collecting system to achieve a target free chlorine level for further disinfection chlorine gas and hypochlorite are also applied in drinking water treatment plants which are located close to the danube secondly supplied drinking water quality is continuously monitored along the entire collector and supply system to ensure uninterrupted safe water quality for consumers one important performance indicator is to maintain a constant free chlorine level of 0 3 mg l 1 in the entire supply system chlorination or hypochlorite solution dosing occurs along the supply system based on online measurements to ensure the required water quality standards at the consumer s tap although river regulations and organic matter loads have resulted in riverbed siltation in some locations which might lead to anoxic conditions due to iron and manganese dissolution 51 the removal of iron and manganese is of lesser importance only 20 25 of the total raw water is purified with advanced treatment processes ozonation flocculation and granulated active carbon gac filtration sampling sites nr 1 and 2 fig 1 were two local drinking water supply system taps in these sites the water of the danube and the wells were not affected by the large wwtp effluents of budapest for the majority of the sampling sites the extracted water was mixed by collector wells and large pumping stations after which a complex more than 8000 km long pipe network supplies the water to the consumers therefore neither the exact origin and associated drinking water well of a particular tap water sample nor the travel time of the water in the complex supply system could be appropriately determined the supply system is made of pipes of different materials asbestos cement 43 cast iron ductile iron steel 32 pvc and polyethylene 23 reinforced concrete pipe 2 the older sections of the drinking water supply system are not in good technical condition the water loss rate is significant around 20 in 2015 and 2018 a partial pipe cleaning program has been implemented concerning the iron pipes at the budapest waterworks because the water flow has reportedly decreased due to deposits 50 of the deposits removed were siderite 25 goethite and green rust while the proportion of calcite and magnetite was only a few percent 95 although the water is distributed via complex supply systems and therefore there is no exact data on the water residency time in the pipeline the water distribution models for the waterworks concerned show that the chlorinated drinking water stays in the network for an average of 1 3 days nevertheless the travel time next to the danube i e close to the drinking water wells is shorter than in the eastern and southern sampling points the sampling points next to the danube nr 1 15 are closer to the drinking water abstraction wells and therefore the water flows more rapidly in contrast the tap water in the eastern and southern parts of budapest take longer to flow through the pipeline because it is further away from the water sources and pumping stations to compare the results the tap water from an artesian aquifer sampling site 21 located far from the danube and presumed to be completely free of phacs was also sampled 2 2 experimental design and procedures a total of 108 tap water samples were collected from 21 sampling sites e g public places the ground floor of shops consulting rooms pharmacies schools and nursery schools throughout six sampling periods from november 2017 to

analysis in order to assess the potential risk for human health associated with the presence of phacs in drinking water the human risk quotient hrq methodology was applied the hrqs are defined as the ratio of an exposure concentration and a threshold of adverse effects in tap water the values of hrqs were calculated here for different kinds of phacs in two ways 34 55 1 h r q m a x c m a x d w e l 2 h r q m e a n c m e a n d w e l where hrqmax is the worst case human risk quotient hrqmean is the normal state risk quotient cmax is the maximum phac concentration in tap water cmean is the mean phac concentration in tap water and dwel is the drinking water equivalent level lifetime exposure concentration protective of adverse non cancer health effects that assume all of the exposure to a contaminant is from drinking water according to eq 1 the worst case scenario hrqmax is calculated by dividing the measured maximum concentration cmax ng l 1 of the given phac by a respective dwel ng l 1 however if cmean is used instead of cmax for risk assessment the result of eq 2 would illustrate a normal state this formula was used to determine the hrq for the entire investigated year hrqmean all concentration data used for the calculation of hrqs were above the loq if hrq 1 it indicates no human health risk to determine dwels eq 3 55 was applied 3 d w e a d i b w d w i a b f o e where adi is the acceptable daily intake of individual phacs ng kg day 1 bw indicates the average body weight of hungarians above 15 years of age 76 kg 99 dwi is the daily tap water intake which was accepted as 2 l day 1 over 10 years but less water consumption was recorded for younger age groups table s7 in the hungarian diet and nutritional status survey 100 ab represents the gastrointestinal absorption rate which was assumed to be 100 as the maximal value and foe is the frequency of exposure which is presumably 365 days of the year adi represents a dose limit of an individual phac that should not have any undesirable effects on the health of a potentially exposed population including susceptible sub populations 56 here the most of adis were obtained from the relevant literature 34 57 60 where the point of departure pod was based 1 on dosage lowest oral therapeutic dose lotd 2 on different kind of toxicological data lowest observed effect level loel or the absence of these data 3 on occupational exposure limits oels and to which several uncertainty factors were applied when several adi values were found to certain phac the minimum value was accepted for calculations 58 for benzoylecgonine bze cinolazepam cnl and tiapride tip adis were not available in the literature to determinate their adis the proposed drinking water concentration limit bze 0 02 mg l 1 98 and minimum values of pharmaceutical dosage guidelines cnl 20 mg day 1 97 tip 300 mg day 1 96 were applied however the hhra results of bze cnl and tip need to be carefully interpreted due to the high degree of uncertainty based on ecological risk assessment method the mixture risk of detected phacs in tap water was estimated by applying eq 4 55 61 4 m r q i 1 n h r q i where mrq is the mixture risk quotient for human the threshold of mrq was estimated in the same way as for hrq therefore if mrq 1 human health risk is presumably negligible in general the concentration addition method intends to provide information on the joint risk of different compounds this model expects compounds with similar modes of action moa to affect additively according to the conception of concentration addition when present as a mixture 62 assuming similar moas to assess the worst case scenario the value of mrq can be determined by the summation of hrqs to give a theoretical value of mixture risk of phacs investigated it should be noted that the value of mrq does not give any further information about mixture toxicity it is intended to present a value that can be relative to the limit of 1 2 6 data management and evaluation the frequency of occurrence fro was calculated for each phac as the number of samples with a concentration loq divided by the total number of samples 108 and expressed as a percentage as the shapiro wilk test did not indicate a normal distribution for the variables measured in this study the spearman s rho test was applied to measure the correlation between the variables with a significance level of 95 moreover the independent samples mann whitney u test 63 was applied to calculate phac seasonal differences and the differences of phac concentrations between the tap and drinking water well samples all statistical analyses were conducted with ibm spss statistics for windows version 22 ibm corp armonk ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 measured concentrations in tap water samples a total of 102 phacs were monitored in this study with various physical chemical characteristics table s2 of which 19 phacs were found to exceed the loq in the tap water samples table 1 table s3 presents the measured chemical values and phac concentrations in the tap water samples the most frequently detected phac was the antiepileptic cbz which occurred in more than half of the tap water samples fro 54 this was consistent with other studies that confirmed the presence of persistent cbz in supplied drinking water 64 several studies reported generally lower cbz concentrations in tap water than those observed herein 58 65 66 however much higher values have also been published e g kleywegt et al 35 601 ng l 1 stackelberg et al 18 258 ng l 1 however our measured mean was such an extremely low concentration e g an individual would have to drink two liters of water per day for 80 years to reach a 0 5 mg cbz intake which is far below the therapeutic dose of 800 mg day 1 67 benzoylecgonine bze i e a cocaine metabolite lamotrigine ltg i e an antiepileptic tramadol tra i e an opioid lidocaine lid i e a local anesthetic and cinolazepam cnl i e an anxiolytic occurred in more than 25 of the tap water samples however only ltg exceeded a 10 ng l 1 mean concentration which is higher than reported previously 8 3 9 5 ng l 1 by tröger et al 66 lid and tra were present at very low mean concentrations 0 10 and 0 23 ng l 1 moreover although the occurrence of bze in tap water has been reported in other regions 68 cnl had not been previously identified in drinking water the occurrence of other substances was sporadic only caffeine was detected in more than 10 samples but its mean concentration 2 12 ng l 1 remained below the values reported previously 34 69 this is probably due to the effectiveness of rbf as caffeine is more likely to occur in surface waters and can therefore be an indicator of untreated wastewater 70 although the efficiency of drinking water treatment may be affected by general water chemical parameters e g temperature and ph 71 72 the concentrations of the six most common phacs did not correlate with the measured water chemistry parameters and trace element concentrations the strongest spearman s correlation value was found between bze and ltg r 0 502 table s4 in a previous study kondor et al 43 reported the phac concentrations of drinking water wells related to the same region the well samples were taken just a few days prior to the tap water sampling campaigns and aimed to investigate the same 102 phacs as the present study a total of 32 phacs were quantified in the wells of which only 19 compounds were detected in tap water table 2 summarizes the phac concentrations in the drinking water wells and tap water samples as well as concentration changes the concentrations of the most frequent phacs e g cbz ltg tra and lid generally decreased in the water supply system however the reasons were not clearly identified these persistent phacs in particular cbz ltg and tra are resistant to chlorination alone as it was proven by several studies 17 73 78 only advanced treatment technologies such as the ozonation and new gac filtration 36 66 breakpoint chlorination 72 or chlorination at lower ph ca 5 5 and higher concentrations 3 mgl 1 benotti et al 79 80 are able to effectively remove the most persistent compounds as less than 25 of the total drinking water is treated by advanced technology in the study area the micropollutants concentrations might be influenced by the iron oxide deposits and the microbiom of the pipelines 81 the biofilm in the water supply system is reported an important factor of removal as the microbial communities of drinking water can decompose a wide range of recalcitrant organic contaminants 82 they occurrence and the related efficiency in decomposition vary significantly in the collecting and distributing pipelines from the wells to the consumers in budapest 52 83 similarly the porous deposits of different iron salts oxides and hydroxy salts such as siderite feco3 goethite alpha feooh magnetite fe3o4 and green rust affect the concentration of phacs the various iron ions catalyse phacs oxidation whereas the iron deposits and salts may adsorb them 84 87 in contrast bze cnl and some other sporadic phacs showed substantially higher average concentrations in tap water than in raw drinking water this could also have been due to a wide range of reasons that are confounded by the mixed water flows in the supply local accumulation of pharmaceuticals 88 or simply inconsistent positive detections of phacs in the analyzed samples 34 are also reported 3 2 temporal and spatial variability of phac concentrations according to our observations cbz concentrations and fro were independent of the season consistent with our findings cbz exhibited a similar presence in all seasonal periods in other studies 89 90 in contrast other more persistent phacs such as ltg lid tra bze and cnl 43 were detected more frequently in winter than in summer table s5 even though only bze exhibited significantly higher concentrations p 0 001 in the winter period this is presumably due to the lower winter temperatures which result in lower biodegradation rates 43 91 however seasonality can depend on many other factors such as the seasonal variations in waste and drinking water treatment efficiency 36 and biodegradation during bank filtration 92 furthermore the consumption patterns of some phacs such as antidepressants or antipyretics are also known to change seasonally 89 90 although phacs were detected at each sampling site and the measured data may fluctuate locally over time some spatial differences could still be observed figs 2 and 3 although the six most frequent drugs accounted for the majority of the total phacs with a few exceptions over 90 at each sampling site their fro and cmean markedly changed between sites the less polluted sites were the northernmost taps outside the bmr the summarized average concentration of phacs exceeded 30 ng l 1 at five sampling sites nr 3 4 9 11 14 from which the fro of the 6 most frequent drugs exceeded 50 at four sampling sites nr 3 4 9 14 in terms of concentration and occurrence the tap water samples were more polluted at sampling sites nr 3 4 and 9 the reason for these spatial differences could not be appropriately identified because except sampling points nr 1 nr 2 and nr 21 all other sampling points supplied water that resulted from the mixture of several wells across thousands of km of the water supply network particularly sampling sites nr 1 and nr 2 were two taps of a local drinking water supply system that were tested in the northern corner of the budapest metropolitan region in these sites the water of the danube and the wells were not contaminated at all by the large wwtp effluents of the metropolitan region 43 sampling site nr 21 was based on an artesian aquifer however similar phac profiles and concentrations were observed between this site and tap water samples from riverbank filtrates in the other cases the variations in phac pollution may be related to the distance and travel time from the wells and pump stations which are also the major sites of chlorination although the degradation efficiency of chlorination may be time dependent for several phacs 72 93 it has not been proven for persistent compounds therefore the chlorination contact times within the pipe system alone may not explain the lower values in the southern region of the study area and especially in the eastern sampling points which are farther from water wells 3 3 health risk assessment table 3 summarizes the adis pods dwels hrqmaxs hrqmeans and risk evaluation of the identified phacs as well as the adult mrq values of the phac mixture in tap water from the 19 detected phacs pods for determination of adis were not found for nordiazepam and embutramide and therefore risk assessment could not be performed for these compounds as indicated in table 3 none of the phacs examined during the entire experimental period not even in the worst case scenario were linked to any kind of human health risk hrqmaxs 1 and hrqmeans 1 cbz exhibited the highest hrqs hrqmax 0 007 and hrqmean 0 001 however even this phac was far from posing any risk the mrq based on hrqmeans 0 001 shows that the consumption of tap water with their average phac composition poses negligible risk to human health furthermore based on the determined mrq derived from hrqmax values 0 015 tap water consumption was deemed safe even in the worst case scenario considering the phac concentrations reported above the hrqs and mrqs were also calculated and examined separately for the two studied seasons the seasonality of the risks followed the phac concentrations similarly only seasonal differences related to bze were observed whereas no seasonal differences between led to a homogeneous hrq throughout the year for each phac and the mrq table s5 only 7 drugs had mean risk quotients hrqmean greater than 1 10 5 cbz perindopril per ltg bze citalopram ctl cnl and losartan los although these compounds may have synergistic effects with each other table s6 due to their low concentrations these interactions are unlikely to cause a relevant increase in risks the detected phacs do not pose risks even to children or infants fig 4 for background data see table s7 even though the hrqs were found to be inversely related to age our findings were consistent with those of leung et al 94 who reported at least one order of magnitude higher hrqs for infants than for adults however for example in the case of cbz if the detected maximum was taken into account for infants the risk would still be negligible hrqmax 0 040 the risks parallel with the concentrations are substantially reduced in the water supply system if the riverbank filtrate was fed directly into the taps 43 50 the risks associated with cbz per ltg tra and lid exposure would increase 5 8 times due to higher concentrations even though these values would also be negligible from a health risk assessment perspective table s8 4 conclusions although surface water is efficiently filtered by the rbf and the majority of pollutants are removed some phacs can reach the supply system and reach the consumer s tap nonetheless our hypotheses were only partially confirmed 19 of the 102 screened phacs were detected in tap water meaning that fewer compounds were identified at the consumer s tap than in the river bank filtrate 32 the concentrations were lower than anticipated negligible human health risk was identified for all compounds the highest hrq was determined for cbz but it also presents a negligible risk to the consumers however phac concentrations at a given sampling site may fluctuate in a space and time dependent manner contamination can t be reduced by chlorination alone concentrations are attenuated by other processes such as varying microbial communities of the water supply network local oxidative reductive circumstances which are effective in reducing phac concentrations and health risk of the detected compounds however further adequate research is needed to explore the underlying causes of concentration changes and the potential toxic byproducts to explore the underlying causes of concentration changes further adequate research is needed focusing on the synergic effects of iron deposits and water treatments given that several phacs can occur in drinking water based on shallow riverbank filtered water sources it may be necessary to continue and extend monitoring to other hazardous substances e g toxic byproducts antibiotics hormones and veterinary pharmaceuticals to understand the cause of their concentration changes in the supply network system and to assess their potential health risks in tap water declaration of

13540,the presence of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs in drinking waters might pose a serious threat to human health worldwide therefore this study sought to measure phacs in danube derived tap water from the budapest metropolitan region hungary and to compare the results of those measured in the bank filtrate after which a human health risk assessment based on human risk quotient hrq was conducted for the detected phacs a total of 108 samples were collected from 21 sampling sites throughout 6 sampling campaigns our study screened for 102 phacs of which 19 were detected in the persistently chlorinated tap water samples phac concentrations were much lower than previously assumed based on the contamination of raw water resources the total mean concentration of the analyzed phacs exceeded 30 ng l 1 only at 5 sites moreover the frequency of occurrence fro of the 6 most common compounds carbamazepine lamotrigine lidocaine benzoylecgonine tramadol and cinolazepam reached 50 at 4 sites the most frequent phac was carbamazepine fro 53 7 the risk level of all phacs investigated was negligible hrq 1 with carbamazepine having the highest hrqs hrqmax 0 007 hrqmean 0 001 tap water provided lower phac concentrations farther from the water abstraction wells and treatment stations along the danube the travel time between the drinking water wells and taps with other factors such as the varying microbiological pattern and the deposits in the supply system influence the phac concentrations based on the risk assessment all investigated phacs pose a negligible risk to consumers in the investigated urban area keywords drinking water pharmaceuticals micropollutants spatial variance managed aquifer recharge system 1 introduction due to the increase in human pharmaceutical consumption several pharmaceutically active compounds phacs are released into the environment each day 1 3 the main source of these organic micropollutants is untreated and treated wastewater as common wastewater treatment processes are incapable of removing all pharmaceuticals from contaminated water 4 7 although phacs generally occur at low concentrations in various environmental matrices i e typically at the ng l 1 or μg l 1 level the occurrence and risks of pharmaceuticals with their metabolites or conjugates in the environment is a growing worldwide concern 8 10 this problem is exacerbated by the fact that adverse neurophysiological or genotoxic effects have been linked to certain groups of pharmaceuticals e g antiepileptics opiates which may have mutagenic and or carcinogenic effects 11 14 given that water resources may also be affected by phac contamination 15 18 several studies have associated the occurrence of phacs in raw or treated tap water with serious health risks of 19 21 including genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 22 23 moreover although some phacs e g hormones psychoactive substances anxiolytics antiepileptics antibiotics are known to pose significant risks to aquatic organisms 24 29 the level of human health risk is generally low or negligible in drinking water because they are present only at trace concentrations 30 35 102 103 several regionally varying factors can influence the degree of exposure and risk associated with tap water consumption the absolute amount of phacs released into the environment is the highest in densely populated metropolitan areas 33 but this can be significantly reduced by more advanced wastewater treatment technologies 36 given wastewater treatment plants wwtps are a significant source of emerging environmental contaminants phac concentrations in raw water are fundamentally determined by the efficiency of wastewater treatment procedures 10 generally the fate of the pharmaceuticals depends on their degree of natural attenuation and their physicochemical properties such as their hydrophobicity index log p log kw solubility in water and chemical structure 37 it is important to note that these properties are seriously affected by the local factors or micro environmental parameters e g hydrolysis photolysis microbial degradation or biodegradation 38 39 geological and hydrological characteristics of drinking water sources are very different however polluted rivers lakes or shallow groundwater are the main sources of drinking water in many countries 40 drinking water treatment methods and their efficacy also vary widely which also affects phac concentrations 35 although the most commonly consumed phac and associated substances entering the waterways may vary from country to country many pollutants are ubiquitous and their potential interactions may increase the risks associated with tap water consumption moreover the level of contamination in drinking water and the vulnerability of certain groups of people are not constant in china for example pollution trends are clearly on the rise according to several comparable studies 36 furthermore different age groups and demographics e g children pregnant women elderly people may be more sensitive to even relatively low phac concentrations 16 given that safe drinking water is not only a fundamental determinant of quality of life but also a basic human necessity 41 tap water pollution monitoring and risk assessment should be conducted regularly 17 42 riverbank filtration rbf plays a fundamental role in drinking water supplies along rivers and pounds worldwide although aquifers close to the river are highly exposed to anthropogenic stress many pollutants are efficiently removed by the managed aquifer recharge mar system which reduces the necessity of conventional drinking water treatment 43 45 however lower natural removal is observed for some emerging organic micropollutants such as persistent phacs in hungary the daily water requirements of 40 of the population approximately 4 million people are covered by riverbank filtered water rfw 101 furthermore rfw is also very important in neighboring countries along the river danube e g slovakia serbia 46 due to the high efficiency of rbf drinking water is only routinely chlorinated for disinfection and with a few exceptions no multi stage drinking water treatment systems are in operation therefore persistent micropollutants such as certain phacs can infiltrate into potable water sources and reach the drinking water supply system 43 47 49 in our previous study the efficiency of riverbank filtration was examined and quantified in the budapest metropolitan region 43 50 to explore the connection between surface water and drinking water we scanned the same phacs in the present study however phac concentrations have not yet been determined in the chlorinated tap water therefore this study evaluated phac concentrations in river bank filtrated tap water their potential seasonal changes and their associated human health risk assessment hhra in the budapest metropolitan region specifically we hypothesized that i the same phacs are present at the same concentrations in tap water as they are found in raw drinking water indicating the incomplete effect of chlorination on persistent phac concentrations decrease ii phac concentrations in tap water vary in time and space reflecting the role of raw water characteristics and the supply system iii phacs in tap water pose low health risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area water samples were obtained from the budapest metropolitan region which is a highly urbanized area in hungary with nearly 3 million inhabitants fig 1 rfw accounts for more than 90 of the water supply and the rest of the drinking water is provided by artesian wells and karst water springs in this region more than 1000 drinking water abstraction wells are operated by two large waterworks budapest waterworks and danube regional waterworks in addition to some smaller suppliers budapest waterworks alone operates approximately 750 wells to supply 1 89 million inhabitants and the majority of the drinking abstraction wells operate along the riverbank of the danube 51 due to the predominantly oxidative conditions of the rbf chlorination with chlorine gas and hypochlorite is the most important primary water treatment method 52 as a first step prechlorination occurs along the collecting system to achieve a target free chlorine level for further disinfection chlorine gas and hypochlorite are also applied in drinking water treatment plants which are located close to the danube secondly supplied drinking water quality is continuously monitored along the entire collector and supply system to ensure uninterrupted safe water quality for consumers one important performance indicator is to maintain a constant free chlorine level of 0 3 mg l 1 in the entire supply system chlorination or hypochlorite solution dosing occurs along the supply system based on online measurements to ensure the required water quality standards at the consumer s tap although river regulations and organic matter loads have resulted in riverbed siltation in some locations which might lead to anoxic conditions due to iron and manganese dissolution 51 the removal of iron and manganese is of lesser importance only 20 25 of the total raw water is purified with advanced treatment processes ozonation flocculation and granulated active carbon gac filtration sampling sites nr 1 and 2 fig 1 were two local drinking water supply system taps in these sites the water of the danube and the wells were not affected by the large wwtp effluents of budapest for the majority of the sampling sites the extracted water was mixed by collector wells and large pumping stations after which a complex more than 8000 km long pipe network supplies the water to the consumers therefore neither the exact origin and associated drinking water well of a particular tap water sample nor the travel time of the water in the complex supply system could be appropriately determined the supply system is made of pipes of different materials asbestos cement 43 cast iron ductile iron steel 32 pvc and polyethylene 23 reinforced concrete pipe 2 the older sections of the drinking water supply system are not in good technical condition the water loss rate is significant around 20 in 2015 and 2018 a partial pipe cleaning program has been implemented concerning the iron pipes at the budapest waterworks because the water flow has reportedly decreased due to deposits 50 of the deposits removed were siderite 25 goethite and green rust while the proportion of calcite and magnetite was only a few percent 95 although the water is distributed via complex supply systems and therefore there is no exact data on the water residency time in the pipeline the water distribution models for the waterworks concerned show that the chlorinated drinking water stays in the network for an average of 1 3 days nevertheless the travel time next to the danube i e close to the drinking water wells is shorter than in the eastern and southern sampling points the sampling points next to the danube nr 1 15 are closer to the drinking water abstraction wells and therefore the water flows more rapidly in contrast the tap water in the eastern and southern parts of budapest take longer to flow through the pipeline because it is further away from the water sources and pumping stations to compare the results the tap water from an artesian aquifer sampling site 21 located far from the danube and presumed to be completely free of phacs was also sampled 2 2 experimental design and procedures a total of 108 tap water samples were collected from 21 sampling sites e g public places the ground floor of shops consulting rooms pharmacies schools and nursery schools throughout six sampling periods from november 2017 to november 2018 to elucidate seasonal differences three sampling campaigns were conducted in the winter period 66 samples in october march followed by three more campaigns in the summer period 42

analysis in order to assess the potential risk for human health associated with the presence of phacs in drinking water the human risk quotient hrq methodology was applied the hrqs are defined as the ratio of an exposure concentration and a threshold of adverse effects in tap water the values of hrqs were calculated here for different kinds of phacs in two ways 34 55 1 h r q m a x c m a x d w e l 2 h r q m e a n c m e a n d w e l where hrqmax is the worst case human risk quotient hrqmean is the normal state risk quotient cmax is the maximum phac concentration in tap water cmean is the mean phac concentration in tap water and dwel is the drinking water equivalent level lifetime exposure concentration protective of adverse non cancer health effects that assume all of the exposure to a contaminant is from drinking water according to eq 1 the worst case scenario hrqmax is calculated by dividing the measured maximum concentration cmax ng l 1 of the given phac by a respective dwel ng l 1 however if cmean is used instead of cmax for risk assessment the result of eq 2 would illustrate a normal state this formula was used to determine the hrq for the entire investigated year hrqmean all concentration data used for the calculation of hrqs were above the loq if hrq 1 it indicates no human health risk to determine dwels eq 3 55 was applied 3 d w e a d i b w d w i a b f o e where adi is the acceptable daily intake of individual phacs ng kg day 1 bw indicates the average body weight of hungarians above 15 years of age 76 kg 99 dwi is the daily tap water intake which was accepted as 2 l day 1 over 10 years but less water consumption was recorded for younger age groups table s7 in the hungarian diet and nutritional status survey 100 ab represents the gastrointestinal absorption rate which was assumed to be 100 as the maximal value and foe is the frequency of exposure which is presumably 365 days of the year adi represents a dose limit of an individual phac that should not have any undesirable effects on the health of a potentially exposed population including susceptible sub populations 56 here the most of adis were obtained from the relevant literature 34 57 60 where the point of departure pod was based 1 on dosage lowest oral therapeutic dose lotd 2 on different kind of toxicological data lowest observed effect level loel or the absence of these data 3 on occupational exposure limits oels and to which several uncertainty factors were applied when several adi values were found to certain phac the minimum value was accepted for calculations 58 for benzoylecgonine bze cinolazepam cnl and tiapride tip adis were not available in the literature to determinate their adis the proposed drinking water concentration limit bze 0 02 mg l 1 98 and minimum values of pharmaceutical dosage guidelines cnl 20 mg day 1 97 tip 300 mg day 1 96 were applied however the hhra results of bze cnl and tip need to be carefully interpreted due to the high degree of uncertainty based on ecological risk assessment method the mixture risk of detected phacs in tap water was estimated by applying eq 4 55 61 4 m r q i 1 n h r q i where mrq is the mixture risk quotient for human the threshold of mrq was estimated in the same way as for hrq therefore if mrq 1 human health risk is presumably negligible in general the concentration addition method intends to provide information on the joint risk of different compounds this model expects compounds with similar modes of action moa to affect additively according to the conception of concentration addition when present as a mixture 62 assuming similar moas to assess the worst case scenario the value of mrq can be determined by the summation of hrqs to give a theoretical value of mixture risk of phacs investigated it should be noted that the value of mrq does not give any further information about mixture toxicity it is intended to present a value that can be relative to the limit of 1 2 6 data management and evaluation the frequency of occurrence fro was calculated for each phac as the number of samples with a concentration loq divided by the total number of samples 108 and expressed as a percentage as the shapiro wilk test did not indicate a normal distribution for the variables measured in this study the spearman s rho test was applied to measure the correlation between the variables with a significance level of 95 moreover the independent samples mann whitney u test 63 was applied to calculate phac seasonal differences and the differences of phac concentrations between the tap and drinking water well samples all statistical analyses were conducted with ibm spss statistics for windows version 22 ibm corp armonk ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 measured concentrations in tap water samples a total of 102 phacs were monitored in this study with various physical chemical characteristics table s2 of which 19 phacs were found to exceed the loq in the tap water samples table 1 table s3 presents the measured chemical values and phac concentrations in the tap water samples the most frequently detected phac was the antiepileptic cbz which occurred in more than half of the tap water samples fro 54 this was consistent with other studies that confirmed the presence of persistent cbz in supplied drinking water 64 several studies reported generally lower cbz concentrations in tap water than those observed herein 58 65 66 however much higher values have also been published e g kleywegt et al 35 601 ng l 1 stackelberg et al 18 258 ng l 1 however our measured mean was such an extremely low concentration e g an individual would have to drink two liters of water per day for 80 years to reach a 0 5 mg cbz intake which is far below the therapeutic dose of 800 mg day 1 67 benzoylecgonine bze i e a cocaine metabolite lamotrigine ltg i e an antiepileptic tramadol tra i e an opioid lidocaine lid i e a local anesthetic and cinolazepam cnl i e an anxiolytic occurred in more than 25 of the tap water samples however only ltg exceeded a 10 ng l 1 mean concentration which is higher than reported previously 8 3 9 5 ng l 1 by tröger et al 66 lid and tra were present at very low mean concentrations 0 10 and 0 23 ng l 1 moreover although the occurrence of bze in tap water has been reported in other regions 68 cnl had not been previously identified in drinking water the occurrence of other substances was sporadic only caffeine was detected in more than 10 samples but its mean concentration 2 12 ng l 1 remained below the values reported previously 34 69 this is probably due to the effectiveness of rbf as caffeine is more likely to occur in surface waters and can therefore be an indicator of untreated wastewater 70 although the efficiency of drinking water treatment may be affected by general water chemical parameters e g temperature and ph 71 72 the concentrations of the six most common phacs did not correlate with the measured water chemistry parameters and trace element concentrations the strongest spearman s correlation value was found between bze and ltg r 0 502 table s4 in a previous study kondor et al 43 reported the phac concentrations of drinking water wells related to the same region the well samples were taken just a few days prior to the tap water sampling campaigns and aimed to investigate the same 102 phacs as the present study a total of 32 phacs were quantified in the wells of which only 19 compounds were detected in tap water table 2 summarizes the phac concentrations in the drinking water wells and tap water samples as well as concentration changes the concentrations of the most frequent phacs e g cbz ltg tra and lid generally decreased in the water supply system however the reasons were not clearly identified these persistent phacs in particular cbz ltg and tra are resistant to chlorination alone as it was proven by several studies 17 73 78 only advanced treatment technologies such as the ozonation and new gac filtration 36 66 breakpoint chlorination 72 or chlorination at lower ph ca 5 5 and higher concentrations 3 mgl 1 benotti et al 79 80 are able to effectively remove the most persistent compounds as less than 25 of the total drinking water is treated by advanced technology in the study area the micropollutants concentrations might be influenced by the iron oxide deposits and the microbiom of the pipelines 81 the biofilm in the water supply system is reported an important factor of removal as the microbial communities of drinking water can decompose a wide range of recalcitrant organic contaminants 82 they occurrence and the related efficiency in decomposition vary significantly in the collecting and distributing pipelines from the wells to the consumers in budapest 52 83 similarly the porous deposits of different iron salts oxides and hydroxy salts such as siderite feco3 goethite alpha feooh magnetite fe3o4 and green rust affect the concentration of phacs the various iron ions catalyse phacs oxidation whereas the iron deposits and salts may adsorb them 84 87 in contrast bze cnl and some other sporadic phacs showed substantially higher average concentrations in tap water than in raw drinking water this could also have been due to a wide range of reasons that are confounded by the mixed water flows in the supply local accumulation of pharmaceuticals 88 or simply inconsistent positive detections of phacs in the analyzed samples 34 are also reported 3 2 temporal and spatial variability of phac concentrations according to our observations cbz concentrations and fro were independent of the season consistent with our findings cbz exhibited a similar presence in all seasonal periods in other studies 89 90 in contrast other more persistent phacs such as ltg lid tra bze and cnl 43 were detected more frequently in winter than in summer table s5 even though only bze exhibited significantly higher concentrations p 0 001 in the winter period this is presumably due to the lower winter temperatures which result in lower biodegradation rates 43 91 however seasonality can depend on many other factors such as the seasonal variations in waste and drinking water treatment efficiency 36 and biodegradation during bank filtration 92 furthermore the consumption patterns of some phacs such as antidepressants or antipyretics are also known to change seasonally 89 90 although phacs were detected at each sampling site and the measured data may fluctuate locally over time some spatial differences could still be observed figs 2 and 3 although the six most frequent drugs accounted for the majority of the total phacs with a few exceptions over 90 at each sampling site their fro and cmean markedly changed between sites the less polluted sites were the northernmost taps outside the bmr the summarized average concentration of phacs exceeded 30 ng l 1 at five sampling sites nr 3 4 9 11 14 from which the fro of the 6 most frequent drugs exceeded 50 at four sampling sites nr 3 4 9 14 in terms of concentration and occurrence the tap water samples were more polluted at sampling sites nr 3 4 and 9 the reason for these spatial differences could not be appropriately identified because except sampling points nr 1 nr 2 and nr 21 all other sampling points supplied water that resulted from the mixture of several wells across thousands of km of the water supply network particularly sampling sites nr 1 and nr 2 were two taps of a local drinking water supply system that were tested in the northern corner of the budapest metropolitan region in these sites the water of the danube and the wells were not contaminated at all by the large wwtp effluents of the metropolitan region 43 sampling site nr 21 was based on an artesian aquifer however similar phac profiles and concentrations were observed between this site and tap water samples from riverbank filtrates in the other cases the variations in phac pollution may be related to the distance and travel time from the wells and pump stations which are also the major sites of chlorination although the degradation efficiency of chlorination may be time dependent for several phacs 72 93 it has not been proven for persistent compounds therefore the chlorination contact times within the pipe system alone may not explain the lower values in the southern region of the study area and especially in the eastern sampling points which are farther from water wells 3 3 health risk assessment table 3 summarizes the adis pods dwels hrqmaxs hrqmeans and risk evaluation of the identified phacs as well as the adult mrq values of the phac mixture in tap water from the 19 detected phacs pods for determination of adis were not found for nordiazepam and embutramide and therefore risk assessment could not be performed for these compounds as indicated in table 3 none of the phacs examined during the entire experimental period not even in the worst case scenario were linked to any kind of human health risk hrqmaxs 1 and hrqmeans 1 cbz exhibited the highest hrqs hrqmax 0 007 and hrqmean 0 001 however even this phac was far from posing any risk the mrq based on hrqmeans 0 001 shows that the consumption of tap water with their average phac composition poses negligible risk to human health furthermore based on the determined mrq derived from hrqmax values 0 015 tap water consumption was deemed safe even in the worst case scenario considering the phac concentrations reported above the hrqs and mrqs were also calculated and examined separately for the two studied seasons the seasonality of the risks followed the phac concentrations similarly only seasonal differences related to bze were observed whereas no seasonal differences between led to a homogeneous hrq throughout the year for each phac and the mrq table s5 only 7 drugs had mean risk quotients hrqmean greater than 1 10 5 cbz perindopril per ltg bze citalopram ctl cnl and losartan los although these compounds may have synergistic effects with each other table s6 due to their low concentrations these interactions are unlikely to cause a relevant increase in risks the detected phacs do not pose risks even to children or infants fig 4 for background data see table s7 even though the hrqs were found to be inversely related to age our findings were consistent with those of leung et al 94 who reported at least one order of magnitude higher hrqs for infants than for adults however for example in the case of cbz if the detected maximum was taken into account for infants the risk would still be negligible hrqmax 0 040 the risks parallel with the concentrations are substantially reduced in the water supply system if the riverbank filtrate was fed directly into the taps 43 50 the risks associated with cbz per ltg tra and lid exposure would increase 5 8 times due to higher concentrations even though these values would also be negligible from a health risk assessment perspective table s8 4 conclusions although surface water is efficiently filtered by the rbf and the majority of pollutants are removed some phacs can reach the supply system and reach the consumer s tap nonetheless our hypotheses were only partially confirmed 19 of the 102 screened phacs were detected in tap water meaning that fewer compounds were identified at the consumer s tap than in the river bank filtrate 32 the concentrations were lower than anticipated negligible human health risk was identified for all compounds the highest hrq was determined for cbz but it also presents a negligible risk to the consumers however phac concentrations at a given sampling site may fluctuate in a space and time dependent manner contamination can t be reduced by chlorination alone concentrations are attenuated by other processes such as varying microbial communities of the water supply network local oxidative reductive circumstances which are effective in reducing phac concentrations and health risk of the detected compounds however further adequate research is needed to explore the underlying causes of concentration changes and the potential toxic byproducts to explore the underlying causes of concentration changes further adequate research is needed focusing on the synergic effects of iron deposits and water treatments given that several phacs can occur in drinking water based on shallow riverbank filtered water sources it may be necessary to continue and extend monitoring to other hazardous substances e g toxic byproducts antibiotics hormones and veterinary pharmaceuticals to understand the cause of their concentration changes in the supply network system and to assess their potential health risks in tap water declaration of

13541,globally the challenges with extensive consumption and improper disposal of antibiotics have become a menace to public health this anomaly has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment many of these resistance genes are carried on plasmids transposons or integrons and their origin is linked to anthropogenic sources wastewater treatment plants wwtps harbors a vast diversity of microorganisms and are responsible for disseminating arb args the failure of different treatment methods materials to address the challenges observed with antibiotics resistance in wastewater treatment facilities alters access to quality water in the ecosystem this paper emphasized the health implication of antibiotic resistance in wastewater and its effect and the pathways for their dissemination from wastewater into receiving waters furthermore the lack of quality data and efforts in removing antibiotics resistant bacteria and their genes were mentioned in this paper compared to the abundance of data on the prevalence or incidences of these substances in wastewater potentials of metallic nanoparticles and their unique properties as a treatment option for removing dna conveying args from wastewater treatment plants were critically discussed in this paper also other treatment options and their limitations have been extensively discussed lastly this review also highlights the importance of regulating antibiotics and their indiscriminate use keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes silver nanoparticles silica oxide nanoparticles antimicrobials removal 1 introduction water is a vital component of life that plays an essential role in human and animal lives it is described as a significant component of the blood which carries nutrient and oxygen to all cells thus crucial for body temperature regulations 1 because of these critical roles in life access to quality water and quantity should be a priority however pollution compromises water quality and the quantity discharged into wastewater treatment plants from different sources 2 5 water reclamation has been considered a solution to water shortages and adopting efficient treatment strategies will help achieve high quality water to ensure all living organisms survival improving water quality requires fundamental strategies such as the prevention of pollutants inorganic heavy metals organic dyes pesticides pharmaceuticals and biological antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes treatment of polluted water restoration and protection of the ecosystem 6 water is a significant pathway for disseminating microorganisms in nature among human and animal populations 7 as mentioned earlier wastewater treatment plants wwtps and their effluents harbor and disseminate antibiotics resistant bacteria and antibiotics resistance genes arb args due to inadequate treatment technology materials what are arb and args according to the world health organization who arb is the bacteria that acquire resistance mechanisms to the antibiotics meant to eradicate them at the same time args are the resistance genes acquired through spontaneous mutation or genetic exchange with other bacteria that can resist one or more antibiotics 8 these contaminants are released into the environment due to extensive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics by humans and animals the consequences include rendering the efficacy of antibiotics that are meant to treat an infection ineffective thus increasing the morbidity and mortality rate among the populace in the environment 9 reports from the world health organization who and the center for disease control have shown that the existence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes without proper sanitation facilities pose a severe risk to global health 8 10 11 in particular wastewater treatment plants are the hotspot for activation and the spread of arb args into different water bodies 12 13 thus the release of arb arg contaminated water is dangerous to humans animals and aquatic life therefore wastewater disposal from industries hospitals and agricultural aquaculture sectors should be treated efficiently to prevent the rapid proliferation of arb args and even widespread multidrug resistant bacteria mdrb in diverse environments 14 15 it is necessary to state that antibiotic resistance results from extensive or overconsumption of antibiotics which build up to form resistance mechanisms in organisms the ability of bacteria to outpace antibiotics efficacy is termed antibiotics resistance 16 17 over prescription of antibiotics patients not completing the entire antibiotics course overuse of these antibiotics in livestock and fish farming poor infection control hygiene sanitation in healthcare settings and lack of newly developed medicines antibiotic are the significant causes of antibiotics resistance in the natural environment 18 due to their limited understanding fate and the risk posed to human and animal healths in the ecosystem antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args are referred to as emerging or unregulated pollutants in water matrices numerous reports have outlined the concentration of these emerging pollutants arb args in wastewater 17 19 rivers 13 and soil through swine feedlot and waste 20 the widespread arb args have led to spontaneous gene mutation and gene transfer among bacteria found in various water matrices 21 23 hence the control of args from the influents and effluents of wwtps may reduce contamination of watersheds which will avert health related illnesses among the populace in the environment also controlling the dissemination of arb args and averting their harmful health effects required several treatment strategies to remove these pollutants from the influents and effluent of wastewater such treatment strategies are filtrations bioremediation 24 uv irradiation 25 photocatalysis 26 chlorination 27 fenton and ozone disinfection processes 28 29 these strategies have proven their efficiency in removing organic and inorganic pollutants still they are ineffective for removing arb args as they may not account for the total removal of these pollutants from wastewater most of them are reported to enrich or enhance the proliferation of arb args in the wastewaters recently advances in nanoscience and nanoparticles have been considered the best option for eliminating these harmful pollutants from wastewaters 30 32 the biological origin of nanoparticles plays a vital role in removing environmental contaminants such as organic and inorganic pollutants heavy metals etc their unique properties aid in the adsorption of pollutants from wastewater they are quickly recovered from treated water the use of nanoparticles is cost effective compare to advanced oxidation processes aops they have an active surface that enables surface functionalization with different functional groups attached easily to target specific contaminants the modification process provides a controllable size shape and unique electronic structure improving its adsorption capacity metallic nanoparticles such as silver nanoparticles agnps silica oxide nanoparticles sio2 nps sulfidated nanoscale zero valent and persulfate treatment of nps have demonstrated their potentials in binding dna through electrostatic interactions and mediating dna into the oxide nanoparticles surface with the use of chaotropic salt 33 34 silver nanoparticles have played a vital role in combating emerging pollutants responsible for infectious diseases their wide application in several fields is due to their physical and chemical properties including thermal optical biological and high electrical conductivity these properties enable their use in industrial healthcare related products cosmetics optical sensors pharmaceuticals products biomedical devices households and water purification processes silver is a metal with a history of antimicrobial properties that provides health impact in early life such as treating venereal disease with silver nitrate in 1700ce the treatment of fresh burn in the 18th century to date and as a water treatment material in 1000bce 35 agnps have been applied in various biological and biomedical fields such as antibacterial anti tumor antifungal antiviral antioxidative drug carrier anti inflammatory and biosensor it is used in the water treatment process especially in eliminating bacterial dna conveying args due to its ability to curb bacteria resistance against antibiotics it has low toxicity high thermal stability and volatility agnps are more effective than the bulk due to silver ion ag which can cause cell death 36 similarly silica oxide nanoparticles sio2 nps have been reported to be a promising adsorbent with high potentials for arb args removals from wastewater due to their large surface area affinity to bind dna morphology particle size and porosity 37 38 a suitable surface for sio2 functionalization could improve the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of arb args from wastewater sulfidated nanoscale zero valent iron n zvi has been proven to be effective and a new promising alternative that may provide a solution to arb arg contaminated water it has a large surface area and particle size to inject n zvi to the source zone which attacks pollutants before spreading out into the water 39 the elimination of arb args using s nzvi is achieved through adsorption and reactive oxygen species ros under aerobic situations 40 the ros weakens the regrowth capacity of the bacteria conveying args treatment of nanoparticles with persulfate salt has shown its effectiveness in removing arb args through generating sulfate radicals the oxidation prowess and production of sulfate radicals are achieved by activating persulfate ion and thermochemical methods 41 this review evaluates the occurrence and removal of arb args in wastewater their health implication their transfer mechanism in the water environment limitations of selected treatment materials for args removal and some metallic potentials nanoparticles for the removal of arb args from wastewater 2 arb and args in water wastewater 2 1 sources and occurrence the discovery and proliferation of arb args in different water milieu including wastewater treatment plants are of great concern to the general public 42 the knowledge of these dangerous pollutants calls for lifestyle changes and drastic measures wwtps are regarded as the human source for promoting args in the environment while the application of manure on land is the animal source for spreading args 43 adefisoye and okoh investigated args prevalence in municipal wastewater treatment plants in eastern cape south africa and concluded that wwtps are point sources for arb and args 44 it could be due to sewage and hospital disposal containing args associated with clinical pathogens the incidence of antibiotic resistance in wastewater treatment facilities and the threat posed by this menace cannot be over emphasized this is complemented by the number of studies reported on arb args in wastewater from different world countries a search that we conducted between 4th and 6th june 2020 using two accessible online databases scopus and google scholar with the keywords shown in table 1 on kinds of literature published in english indicated that from 2015 to 2020 and across six continents namely africa asia australia europe north america and south america seven hundred thirty six 736 studies were reported on the incidence of arb args in wastewater while 331 studies were reported on studies for the removal of these substances from wastewater this does not include duplicate studies as the thorough screening was done to eliminate duplication of articles that may arise from using two search engines statistical analysis of this data was carried out using microsoft excel 2016 and the details are presented in fig 1 fig 1 shows that all six continents have significantly reported arb args in wastewater with vast amounts of the study conducted in asia and europe furthermore comparing published articles on the incidence occurrence and removal of arb args we found that most efforts have been concentrated on the fate or presence of these substances in wastewater little has been done on their removal from wastewater consistent report incidence of these contaminants necessitated continuous research to remove these contaminants from water wastewater furthermore the wwtps received a considerable amount of antibiotics residue arb args through pharmaceutical industries due to inadequate treatment materials a detailed process showing the route of these pollutants and their health implications resulting from inadequate treatment methods and indiscriminate discharge of untreated effluents is presented in fig 2 fig 2 shows that the inability to remove arb args can cause health hazards in an ecosystem 3 45 the stable antibiotics discharged into the environment could be washed as runoffs by rainwater into water bodies including groundwater located at dumpsites furthermore antibiotic resistance can be induced by water disinfectant by products dbps including surface water and other water compartments for example lie and co detected two dbps of water chlorite and iodoacetic acid they concluded that they possess antibiotic properties leading to the evolution of resistant e coli strains at low and high exposures to inhibitory concentrations 22 the report showed that some antibiotic resistance genes concentration was quantified in the biosolids and effluents after treatment 43 46 47 2 2 health implications of antibiotic resistance since antibiotic resistance in various water milieu poses a risk to public health globally 8 11 their detection and the subsequent removal of antibiotic resistance determinants require urgent attention 17 48 in 2017 the world health organization who reported that antibiotic resistance had implicated global health and food security 49 also it is predicted as a future infection that can ravage lives according to who methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa responsible for skin infections pneumonia toxic shock syndrome vancomycin resistant enterococcus multidrug resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis and carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae gut bacteria are examples of resistant bacteria that causes severe health damage 49 who scientist in july 2017 reported that antibiotic resistant gonorrhea is another life threatening infection that causes severe ill health and sometimes becomes very difficult to treat 11 furthermore the aquatic environment experiences an ecotoxicological challenge as a result of arb args it also stimulates the algal community structure resulting in a shift in the food web 13 50 the continuous release of these pollutants in water into the soil can contaminate the farm crops thus endangering human and livestock survival 51 all these drive the resistance evolution which requires urgent action across different countries to halt its effects on environmental health blocking the primary route for receiving large scale antibiotics into the wastewater treatment plants 17 52 may avert the health challenges synonymous with antibiotics resistance meanwhile the world health organization who in 2015 also reported that antibiotic resistance occurs naturally via natural selection through random mutations 49 a study showed that removing resistant bacteria without targeting the genetic mutation that deals with the dna sequence had been a threat to treatment strategies 53 these genetic mutations serve as defense mechanisms to the organisms enabling the bacteria to outpace the effects of novel antibiotics designed to destroy them 44 they are the main factor that promotes diversity among organisms the genetic mutation occurs in a cell that produces the next generations and affects the hereditary material of the microorganisms by altering the pre existing genetic makeup of a cell s dna 54 55 thus this genetic makeup in dna can cause changes in all aspects of living organisms many settlements in south africa rely on surface water for their daily use thus exposing the communities to water contaminated with dna conveying args can result in waterborne diseases args cause infection when a bacterium develops the ability to outpace the efficacy of one or more antibiotics designed to eradicate them or halt their growth 9 antibiotic resistance in water is an emerging health challenge that has claimed over 700 000 lives adequate measures should be considered in other to eliminate the proliferation of arb args from water matrices these measures may avert arb args prediction of claiming 10 million lives in the year 2050 56 2 3 transfer of arb args in water wastewater several studies with characterized laboratory strains have explained the nature of arg mechanisms and the knowledge obtained was used to investigate the environmental factor s effects on gene transfer 57 arb args possess environmental threats due to their association with mobile genetic elements which can be transferred easily between microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer for the genes to be effectively disseminated from the environment to pathogenic bacteria the bacteria must be closely related by temporarily sharing the same habitat 58 these bacteria acquire resistance genes in mobile genetic platforms such as plasmids 59 fig 3 shows the args dissemination among bacteria into the receiving environment via horizontal and vertical gene transfers distributed from human and animal sources furthermore the transfer of bacterial genetic materials is influenced by stressors like antibiotics metals and biocides 60 61 subsequently antibiotic resistance occurs either by mutations or acquiring resistance conferring genes via horizontal gene transfer hgt horizontal or lateral gene transfer is a primary mechanism for spreading antibiotic resistance and an evolution maintenance and transmission of virulence genes 21 62 hgt is when bacteria recipients acquire a genetic trait or resistance mechanisms from a donor bacteria through the asexual process 58 it also permits new bacteria variants to arise without the mutation besides antibiotic resistance developed from natural selection can receive genetic material through horizontal gene transfer its consequences in wastewater are the dissemination of args and an increase in drug resistance for example bacteria that acquire resistance transfer their resistance genes to other species it occurs from resistant donor bacteria free dna phages and dead cells to living cells 55 63 hgt includes those mechanisms responsible for infections and propagative activities of mobile genetic elements conjugation transduction and those controlled by the bacterial cell transformation 64 65 the mechanisms also consist of uptake of naked dna and mobile genetic elements such as integrons transposons plasmids gene cassettes and bacteriophages 66 67 some of these are known to transfer multiple args at the same time for example methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus represents a clinical acquisition of gene cassette while the integrons capture and reshuffle gene cassette which encodes antibiotic resistance determinants 68 the four significant mechanisms of transfers are briefly discussed below transformation this transfer mechanism deals with naked double stranded dna taken up by a proficient bacterial cell to attain a transformation state it has the potential to transfer dna to distantly related bacteria its evolutionary benefits are its diversification and mixing within the bacteria population 65 the genetic mixing during transformation can provide selective advantages by allowing bacteria to combine favorably by mutations 65 69 a cell can then absorb and integrate into extracellular dna edna and its chromosome the absorbed edna serves as a source of information and nutrients 22 70 conjugation the conjugation transfer occurs when dna is transferred from the donor cell to the recipient cell through sexual pilus and adhesins and it requires cell to cell contact 71 the donor cells become resistant by freshly acquired resistance genes 72 a conjugative pilus provides the physical link for dna to move from donors to the recipient it transfers plasmids and plays a vital role in the dissemination of plasmids borne args transduction transduction involves dna transfer from one bacterium to another through bacteriophages it is the most critical mechanism for the exchange of genes among bacteria 73 the bacteriophages have a wide ranging host and can infect other bacteria hosts because they are carriers of other bacteria 68 they can as well transfer their genes into the dna of the new bacterial host transduction contains phage particles that mediate dna transfer in the environment they are resistant to environmental degradation and their compact size aids the dissemination quickly 58 transduction s unique properties make it possible to transfer genes from bacterial communities environment to human microbiomes 74 gene transfer agent gta gta virus like particles that carried dna present in the host and transduced to a recipient cell 75 it facilitates random gene transfer between species and the particles can be freed through cell lysis and spread to recipient cells 73 3 metallic nanoparticles and arb args in water wastewater the application of nanotechnology has gained much interest in solving environmental related problems especially for removing biological organic and inorganic substances that pollute the water environment through industrialization population growth global climate change etc 76 79 these pollutants including arb and args are toxic and even carcinogenic and cause a severe health risk to humans livestock and aquatic life nanotechnology however has excellent potential for water purification and treatment nanomaterials have a large surface area high reactivity and degree of modification dependable size properties and affinity to target specific contaminants 80 82 these unique features contribute to their excellent adsorbent sensors and catalyst these materials are considered as alternative therapies in medicine and wastewater reclamation the ability to be utilized solely by itself or modification with other materials to increase the removal efficiency qualifies it as excellent treatment material for wastewater purification another beneficial aspect of this material is being able to recover it after treatment process nanotechnology s actual environmental application includes tio2 nanoscale for photocatalytic degradation of air contaminants e g no s vocs also for removing hardness in water water purification using nanofiltration and nanoscale zero valent iron for reclaiming soil and groundwater 83 zero valent nanoparticles are active in removing genetic components of heterotrophic bacteria from wastewater 84 several synthesis routes of nanoparticles including ionic gelation solvent dispersion fluid extraction solid state reaction polymerization chemical reaction co precipitation techniques sol gel combustion methods green synthesis which is eco friendly and cost effective depending on their application 85 87 the combination of diverse nanoparticles has proven to be effective against arb and args in water arb and args treatment with nanoparticles was formally limited to medical research due to the rapid development of antibiotic multidrug resistant bacteria in the human gut 55 their effectiveness in combating drug resistance motivated interest in the removal of arb args from wastewater the removal efficiency of arb args using nanoparticles during wastewater treatment involves some mechanisms they include nanoparticles functionalization with antibiotics or organic compounds with a positive charge that can attract a reasonable number of toxic ions dna conveying args 37 the addition of chaotropic salt can mediate dna conveying args to the surface of metal oxides nps and the combination of different nanoparticles that combat the arb args by synergistic means 12 34 43 some of these nps exhibit strong antimicrobial properties that fight against a broad spectrum of microorganisms 88 they are environmentally friendly cost effective and easy to synthesize several studies have shown the effectiveness of some nanoparticles against the inactivation of arb and removal of args in water 89 91 the utilization of agnps sio2 nps sulfidated nanoscale zero valent iron and persulfate treatment in nanoparticles due to their unique properties may help eliminate the problems associated with antibiotic resistance in wastewater 14 35 92 3 1 silver nanoparticles agnps the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their genes from wastewater requires highly advanced treatment technology with materials of vast antimicrobial properties which can halt the spread of these resistant bacteria and eliminate args from wastewater before their disposal into the receiving water bodies nanoparticles 1 100 nm may provide solutions to this kind of water related problem agnps has shown great prospect among the metallic nanoparticles due to its essential properties and application to different areas including antimicrobial agents catalytic agent antiseptic spray ink production coating agents and food storage packaging 13 93 94 they effectively reduce or inactivate the growth of microorganisms in different applications such as in the production of emollient creams and wound dressing studies confirmed that the antibacterial property of agnps is effective against gram positive and gram negative bacteria including the multidrug resistant strains methicillin resistant s aureus 55 95 aruguete et al 2013 investigated the potentials of agnps in restricting the proliferation of multidrug resistant pathogens by functionalizing agnps with a water soluble polymer in other to combat the resistant organism they concluded that functionalized agnps performed like antibiotics and are toxic to pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria resistant to multiple drugs previously administered furthermore several authors reported that the antibacterial properties of agnps synthesized from plant extract are high and active against bacterial strains 93 96 97 adegboyega and co investigated the antibacterial activity of agnps synthesized from fe2 ag coated with natural organic matter nom against various gram negative g and gram positive g bacterial species the authors concluded that the coated agnps were toxic to different bacterial species 96 a study also reported the use of silver nanoparticles as a reliable antiseptic and antibacterial agent against gram positive and gram negative bacteria in the past due to its low toxicity to mammalian cells 98 according to maillard and hartemann 2013 colloid silver metallic silver and salt silver inhibit the growth of antibiotic resistance genes in water by inducing a high degree of the structural and morphological trait that kills bacteria cells their inhibitory effects are due to the presence of ag and their sorption with a negatively charged bacterial cell wall which deactivates cellular enzymes disrupting membrane permeability leading to cell lysis and death 100 various silver forms are active with the increase in catalytic properties making them more toxic to the bacteria cell their toxicity depends on size and shapes because the smaller sizes can pass and accumulate in the membrane 101 the intracellular accumulations can lead to cell death 100 this confirmed the effectiveness of silver ion ag than the bulk silver for the inactivation of bacteria species catalytic oxidation of metallic silver and dissolved monovalent silver ions contributes to its bactericidal effects a recent study indicated that silver ion undergoes catalytic oxidation with nascent oxygen and the resulting compound can attack bacteria on the cell membrane thereby leading to cell death 102 therefore incorporating agnps in wastewater treatment can cause an attack on bacterial dna causing the organism to undergo structural changes by forming pores and allowing the cellular components into fluids osmotic pressure and through electrostatic attraction a considerable amount of args may be removed during treatment processes modifying agnps with antibiotics may increase the removal efficiency of args through dna binding from wastewater the combination of agnps with antibiotics has also demonstrated their effectiveness in combating multidrug resistant bacteria and their genes for example the combination of agnps with molecular antibiotics proved that they are active in killing multidrug resistant pathogens and combating the activities of arb and args in the water matrix 12 24 3 1 1 unique properties of nanosilver for arb args removal from wastewater 3 1 1 1 varying size and shape the application of silver nanoparticles for removing arb args from wastewater largely depends on their physical properties including the variation of size and shape which influenced their preparation methods the size and shape of agnps can be controlled by optimizing different parameters such as temperature ph precursors reducing agents and other experimental conditions 103 varying the size and shape of nanoparticles plays a vital role in the inactivation of bacteria such roles are the generation of ros that can influence the cytotoxicity of agnps leading to cell death variation of size and shape has a rejuvenating effect on cell viability lactate dehydrogenase ldh and ros production in a dependable size mode surface area volume ratio and surface reactivity can improve the particle size and shape 99 102 facilitating ros production several studies reported the effect of agnps size and shape on the production of ros carlson et al investigated the effect of different sizes 15 nm and 55 nm and shape cubic and nanorod of hydrocarbon coated agnps they found that 15 nm can generate a high ros amount compared with 55 nm in a macrophage cell line 104 liu et al found that 5 nm agnps were more toxic than 20 and 50 nm agnps 105 production of high ros can be toxic than their bulk counterpart 101 106 and can cause cell damage as shown in fig 4 silver nanoparticles with smaller sizes are very potent for the inactivation of arb they tend to rapidly release silver ions resulting in their penetration in the cell which can stop the further spread of arb and remove args through the binding process 107 similarly a study reported that silver nanoparticles size is an essential factor for their effectiveness against arb 108 they reported that the antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles increases with a decrease in particle size although different shapes of silver nanoparticles are known e g cubic rings rod like platelets spherical nanowire nano triangle etc however the shape of the nanosilver is related to the atom density of surface facets the shape with the highest atom density results in the particle with the highest removal of arb args from wastewater 109 110 the sem and tem images of typical silver nanoparticles with comparably small size and spherically shaped morphology are shown in fig 5 3 1 1 2 antibacterial property silver nanoparticles are known for their excellent bactericidal properties which are applicable in the pharmaceutical and biological sciences such as in the production of medicine disinfectant and biocidal spray wound dressing and heart valve 111 112 it is widely applicable in producing antiseptic creams clothing underwear and textile products even in washing machines antibacterial property can also reduce infection and prevent prostheses colonization dental material and human skin infection 113 a report has shown the effectiveness of agnps against antibiotic resistant bacteria quintero et al 114 monitored the usefulness of biosynthesized agnps as bactericidal agents for three clinical strains namely the methicillin resistant s aureus a baumannii and e coli the authors discovered biosynthesized agnps at picomolar concentration exhibit bactericidal activity against human gram positive and gram negative pathogens including the clinical isolates mentioned a study investigated the antibacterial effects against gram negative aerobic rod shape bacterium called pseudomonas aeruginosa with the combination of agnps gentamicin and ampicillin the authors concluded that the concentration of agnps with gentamicin shows bactericidal effects against pseudomonas aeruginosa while that of ampicillin shows resistance to the bacteria 113 it implies that agnps with some antibiotics can effectively reduce antibiotic resistant bacteria and eradicate args enrichment miller and coworkers 2013 reported that the antibacterial property of agnps prevented an increase in the abundance of sul1 sul2 sulfonamide antibiotics resistance genes and intl1 integrons 115 furthermore a recent study points towards the generation of reactive oxidative species ros in the presence of agnps contributing to cell death by targeting cell wall and intracellular targets via ion release physical interaction and production of ros at the highest concentration might lead to dna damage 116 for example ji lu et al 117 investigated agnps and ag ion s effect on ros generation of e coli k 12le392 and p putida kt2440 using flow cytometry rna sequencing proteomics the authors reported that a higher concentration of agnps and ag ions significantly increases ros production the ros generated as a result of the rise in the intensity of agnps induces oxidative stress amongst bacterial which eventually leads to damage of dna embedded in args embedding of agnps with other antimicrobial nanoparticles tio2 can enhance the antibacterial effects of agnps and may give high removal efficiency of arb args a study investigated the antibacterial effects of embedding nanoparticles of tio2 agnps under uv irradiation to reduce e coli bacteria generation of ros and the removal of tetracycline resistance genes 118 the authors concluded that the embedment of tio2 agnps inhibited the growth of e coli bacteria it generated ros due to tio2 large band gap which could damage the cell wall due to the electrostatic interaction between tio2 and agnps a considerable amount of resistance genes was removed therefore incorporating agnps as a treatment material in the wastewater treatment process may inhibit bacterial dna and facilitate their removal from wastewater the ability to generate excessive ros with other antibacterial nanoparticles can damage plasmid dna leading to a decrease in args abundance in wastewater the antibacterial property of agnps can inhibit the activation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the dissemination of resistance genes detected from wastewater and receiving water 3 1 1 3 catalytic oxidation property silver nanoparticles can undergo catalytic oxidation by visible light releasing silver ions which can gradually accumulate and damage bacteria s dna catalytic oxidative stress is known as one of the mechanisms of dna damage the incorporation of catalytic oxidation of silver ions into the bacteria cells induces a high degree of structural and morphological features that can kill bacteria cells 36 it can attack the dna bases and inactivate their ability to replicate the silver ion s attachment on the cell membrane can modify the cell potentials by disorganizing the permeability and hindering cell respiration 54 leading to reactive oxygen species it is known that oxygen is adsorbed on the silver surface in its atomic state causing the oxygen to diffuse freely within the silver than any other metal indicating the source of nascent oxygen from metallic silver a study has proven the effectiveness of catalytic oxidation of silver ion with nascent oxygen reacting with thiol groups sh forming r s s r r is an organic moiety bond causing respiratory blockage and cell death 76 89 also the silver ion binding with bacteria dna prevents it from unwinding which can inactivate cellular replication 119 the bacteria cell found in wastewater undergoes structural changes with silver ion forming pores and allowing cellular components into the fluid due to osmotic difference the application of agnps for arb args removal would be achieved through catalytic oxidation reduction of silver ion reacting with the negative charge of the toxic dna by oxidizing bacteria dna which would result in complete disintegration 3 1 2 mechanism of nanosilver for the removal of arb args from wastewater the resistance of microbes against antimicrobials has been known to take place through several mechanisms these include efflux of antimicrobials from the cell of microbes transportation of the nano antimicrobial agent to the site of action antimicrobial agent degradation modification of the enzymes of antimicrobials and antimicrobial targets changes in the permeability of the microbial cell walls which prevents antimicrobial access to target points in the cell and over secretion and production of the target enzyme 120 the mechanism of the silver nanoparticle s action against arb is such that firstly the nanoparticles attach themselves to the bacteria dna bases and after that alters the function of the membrane secondly the nanoparticles in the bacterial cell result in cell injury the breakdown of silver nanoparticles can release silver ions that interact with thiol proteins in the cell wall to affect cell functions 121 as a result targeting the infection of pathogens harboring antimicrobial resistance genes using silver nanoparticles is an exciting aspect of eliminating antibiotic resistance it is the major challenge encountered with delivering a therapeutic agent to the site of action controlling the delivery of nanosilver antimicrobial will put an end to these challenges it allows the release of a load of drugs to eliminate microbes the combination of silver nanoparticles and antimicrobials can through endocytosis penetrate its host 122 123 some reports have it that antimicrobials loaded with silver nanoparticles administered intratracheally penetrated directly through the alveolar capillary blockage into the systemic circulation in blood vessel organs including kidney liver bone and spleen 124 125 altering the surface of nanoparticles to bind to mannose receptors expressed in alveolar macrophages adequately was considered an effective way to enhance the delivery of antimicrobial agents to the targeted spots 126 127 studies reported that mannose conjugated liposomes loaded with ciprofloxacin have been active as drugs targeting alveolar macrophages through pulmonary administration 128 129 several different useful carriers for nanosilver antimicrobials delivery include dendrimers polymers liposomes solid lipids etc 130 nanoparticles designed to target the active site can readily penetrate the cell membrane and reside in the cell s cytoplasm by this action phagocytosis and pinocytosis are known as the two mechanisms for internalizing other materials in the cell 131 132 3 2 silica oxide nanoparticles the high concentration of args in wwtps threatens lives and the efficacy of the treatment methods materials globally which links to the unregulated use of antibiotics various treatment methods materials success depends on their effectiveness in removing pollutants especially the dna conveying args args are seen as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the 21st century and the use of nanoparticles as treatment materials significantly increased life expectancy since discovering the effectiveness of silica materials in duplex dna packaging researchers have attempted to use this material for dna adsorption from an aqueous solution 33 37 133 bacterial dna is a threat to water quality and it contains genes that can be resistant to antibiotics it is a bulky molecule that has a high negative charge in its backbone therefore mediating dna molecules into the surface of silica materials becomes a difficult task since the sio2 nps have a negative charge because of this challenge most researchers utilize a means of successfully mediating dna into silica materials surface it possesses a pore volume a high surface area up to 1200 m2 g 1 identical pore size controllable particle size and excellent biocompatibility 134 adsorption of dna molecules on the silica surface was achieved by mediating dna into the silica surface with a multivalent cation such as mg2 and ca2 135 gao et al 33 also mediated dna into silica surface with cationic linkers to adsorbed plasmid dna through electrostatic interaction all these studies successfully induced dna into silica oxide nanoparticles consequently other researchers avoided the use of cationic linkers for dna adsorption they made use of an aqueous solution with high sodium chloride nacl concentration at low ph and chaotropic salt such as guanidine hydrochloride at ph 5 to mediate dna into the surface of the silica oxides nanoparticles 37 133 for example li et al 37 utilized the guanidine hydrochloride salt solution at ph 5 dna adsorption was successfully achieved by varying the salt solutions under different adsorption conditions the study reported that the amount of adsorbed dna into the silica surface changes with salt solution concentration sio2 nps demonstrated excellent stability and reusability for dna binding with effects on time ph temperature and concentration from these studies for the dna to successfully bind on sio2 nps there are essential factors that should be considered and they are the ion present in the dna must support binding when arranged in its backbone since the backbone consists of sugar and phosphate the variation of sio2 nps concentration with ph value controls the surface charge because electrostatic interactions play a vital role in dna binding the success of dna binding in modified sio2 nps could be attributed to hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction and the interaction between dna and sio2 nps impressive success on drug gene delivery and dna binding during the adsorption process are recorded due to their retaining features and their controllable loading in releasing guest molecules during the drug delivery process the sio2 nps with pore sizes ranging from 2 nm to 50 nm are excellent materials for the water wastewater treatment process its beneficial features such as uniform and tunable size secure independence ability to functionalize the surface internal and external pores and opening pores mechanisms make it a distinctive and proficient material for pollutant removal and drug carrier 136 sio2 nps enable the covalent linkage of different compounds involves considerable changes in both physical and chemical properties it was firstly prepared by stober synthesis followed by sol gel with slight modifications 137 138 the synthesis involves combining selected silane compound and nitric acid hno3 as a pore generating template depending on the application 87 the size and morphological shape of the synthesized silica oxide nanoparticles are determined by sem and tem as shown in fig 6 silica oxide nanoparticles are also considered as an ideal disinfectant for dna in wastewater because of their extensive antimicrobial activity at ambient temperature binding ability inability to produce harmful substance during and after use less expensive easy to store highly soluble in water and easy to recover from water wastewater after the treatment process 81 besides silica oxide nanoparticles remove contaminants such as organic dyes methylene blue and antibiotics from wastewater 134 139 140 modification of sio2 nps can lead to high removal efficiency of these pollutants from different water matrices further applications of sio2 nps include catalysis biological and biomedicine due to their unique feature 87 3 2 1 surface modification of silica oxide nanoparticles sio2 nps for the increase in the removal efficiency of sio2 nps there is a need for adequate modification with cationic linkers the surface modification of every treatment material enhances the adsorption capacity during the wastewater treatment process a wide variety of modifying silica surfaces has been developed to improve the adsorption capacity and selectivity of the material for organic and inorganic pollutants also modification of sio2 nps surface provides a better surface ion for electrostatic interaction and binding sites for dna molecules various functional groups such as amine or thiol ligands multivalent cations and organosilane have been employed for sio2 nps surface modification 37 141 142 the standard material for modification can be through organosilane which involves two methods the first method is co condensation which involves organosilane aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes with tetraethylorthosilicate teos the second method is through photosynthesis grafting involving the calcined porous materials modified by heating the organosilane reactant with an aprotic solvent such as toluene 141 with the vast literature available online on the use of sio2 nps for the drug gene delivery process which prompted the trim work on dna binding there is a need for further research or more actual field trial on dna binding conveying args from wastewater also the synthesis of fewer complex particles with a controllable size less than 100 nm and materials free from harmful chemicals such as ammonia n2h4 as catalysts should be considered this condition will ensure that no secondary contaminants would be detected after the treatment process 3 3 sulfidated nanoscale zero valent iron nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has gained more attention as a promising new technology for eliminating contaminant in the last two decades it is relatively inexpensive eco friendly and has strong reducing capacity fe2 2e fe s e0 0 44 v 39 it also can cause physical damage and oxidative stress to bacteria 143 144 the simple mechanism is feo core oxidizing to iron oxides and hydroxides simultaneously 145 as a nanoscale material s nzvi may provide a cost effective way for args removal compared with aops due to its antibacterial properties 40 the particle size allowed the injection of nzvi into the source zone it attacked the pollutant before they spread out in the water which is crucial for in situ water purification process 144 a recent development on the sulfidated nanoscale zero valent iron to eliminate arb args has been demonstrated for example lee et al reported its strong bactericidal effects on e coli under anaerobic conditions than the silver nanoparticles 146 oprckal et al reported the effective inactivation of e coli enterococcus and clostridium from biological wastewater effluents when 0 5 g l of nzvi was introduced during the treatment process 147 however two factors may affect its increase in sterilization efficiency the easy passivation that retard the outward feo core transfer to the oxide s surface resulting in a decreased yield of reactive oxygen species ross 148 secondly the easy aggregation and poor uniform distribution of nzvi prevent adhesion between nzvi particles and the bacteria surface 149 since the removal capacity of nzvi depends on the electron selectivity for the target contaminant and its utilization ratio of feo particles 148 therefore it is necessary to improve the removal and inactivation efficiencies through surface modification of nzvi several reports have proven that surface modification of nzvi with sulfur compounds enhances the decontamination process he et al reported that sulfide modification of nzvi could efficiently fabricate or build the electron transfer stream because in his study approximately 72 of electron transfer stream were due to the fesx instead of iron oxide 39 other studies reported that the electron transfer pathway between sulfur modified nanoscale zero valent iron s nzvi and o2 and its continuous electron transfer dominated and improved ross yield wang et al monitored the inactivation of gram negative sulfonamide arb the removal of its intracellular args and integrase gene intl1 with nzvi with different sulfur iron s fe molar ratio the removal rate of arg sul1 and intl1 were high on s nzvi than removal with ordinary nzvi 144 the further experiment proved that arb cell structure and intracellular dna were severely damaged after applying s nzvi treatment material a study also investigated the mechanism of args mobile genetic element mges removal and the cause of the weakening nature of their bacteria carrier regrowth capacity after the application of s nzvi on secondary effluent 145 the result showed that the dna accepted electron provided by the feo core of s nzvi is responsible for reducing 16 srrna args and the loss of regrowth capacity especially for the mge intl1 based on these successful results mentioned above the s nzvi could be a potential approach that will stop arb and args proliferation from wastewater 3 4 modification of metal nanoparticles with persulfate treatment modification of nanoparticles with persulfate salt has recently played a vital role in minimizing the risk of arb args spreading into other water recipients persulfate can be activated by heat microwave ultrasound ph adjustment the addition of transition metals fenton and fenton like process 150 151 to generate sulfate radicals with redox potential so4 e 2 5 3 1 v which has more aggressive oxidizing agents than the persulfate anions s2on 2 2so4 2 152 it has proven its effectiveness in the water treatment process due to its long lifetime wide ph range and strong oxidizing agent its mechanisms involved persulfate ion as a precursor in producing free sulfate radicals that could degrade various pollutants especially the antibiotics residue 153 according to olmez et al so4 can react with water of different ph to produce ho during the wastewater treatment process 150 the reaction is described in the equation below 1 all phs so4 h2o so4 2 ho h k h2o 2 10 3s 1 this process eliminates toxic pollutants by converting them into fewer toxic products such as mineral products 151 persulfate treatment has been considered a promising method for arb args removal due to its high solubility low cost and production of high radical stability at different conditions and being independent of organic products during the removal of pollutants 41 recent studies have demonstrated the removal of antibiotic residues leading to the proliferation of arb args with persulfate treatment in conjunction with nanoparticles malakotian et al investigated the removal of antibiotics residue with persulfate fe3o4 nanoparticle and the result shows that a high concentration of antibiotics residues was removed at ph 10 151 duan et al investigated the removal of selected args sul1 intl1 and 16 s rrna genes with persulfate modified nanoscale zero valent iron ps nzvi persulfate modified ginkgo biloba l ps g nzvi and ordinary nzvi from sewage the result proved that args removal efficiency was high with ps nzvi than the ordinary nzvi and ps nzvi 154 these successful results proved that persulfate modified nanoparticles could reduce the abundance of arb args in the receiving water and minimize the risk of consuming the args contaminated water 4 other treatment materials previously employed for the removal of arb args from water wastewater and their drawbacks many countries are experiencing shortages of quality water as a result of emerging pollutants from several sources an emerging contaminant like args is reported as one of the essential factors affecting water quality in developed countries 155 157 however the most significant source remains the discharge of a large scale of antibiotics from the hospital pharmaceutical and agricultural sectors which increases the resistance mechanisms these sources generate waste in the form of water discharged into wastewater treatment plants the wastewater treatment aims are to ensure that wastewater is safe without traces of pollutants at toxic levels another aim is to recover nutrients energy reclaim water and other valuable resources which are the most vital resource to humans 158 many treatment technologies have been employed to avoid being infected by arg contaminated water the environmentalist has widely used the advanced oxidation process to eliminate arb args from the wwtps advanced oxidation process aops is the new technology that oxidized and degraded various forms of pollutants using highly generated hydroxyl radicals ho as the main oxidative species and other reactive oxidation species 159 it is an alternative material that can transform decontaminate antibiotic residues from wastewater oxidative decontamination includes ultraviolet uv fenton ozone photocatalyst ultrasound based sonolysis and electrochemical process have been employed for arb args removal these treatment processes have some challenges and restrictions some of the oxidation processes have valuable properties that can kill bacteria dna and reduce arb proliferation in the wastewater treatment plant s final effluent as shown in table 2 still they may not remove a considerable amount of args after the treatment process 160 the extent of removal depends on the efficacy of the treatment method materials adopted the adsorbent s surface charge the type of wastewater involved time and the amount of chemical used 7 studies have shown different removal strategies 24 169 171 with their shortcomings such as high maintenance cost enrichment reactivation of args and low removal capacity some of these treatment materials are as follows 4 1 photocatalyst photocatalysts are the artificial green sustainable materials used to solve energy and environmental issues including wastewater treatment 26 160 it is an advanced oxidation process aops and an improved technology suitable for removing contaminants from wastewater these treatment materials aim at the natural self purification of water using solar light initiated by the transition complex metal 172 it can also conveniently be applied in water wastewater for the degradation of pollutants 173 numerous studies have shown the effects of photocatalysts on removing arb args from the effluents of wwtps and drinking water 160 169 the photocatalytic materials with uv light inactivate a wide range of pathogens viruses and protozoa from water wastewater it has a potential valence band hole and conduction band electron for dissimilar semiconductors ranging from 4 0 to 1 5 v 174 175 the photocatalytic disinfection materials can be classified into two depending on the nature of the occurrence of targeted pollutants and they are 1 homogenous and 2 heterogeneous catalysts 176 the homogenous photocatalyst depends on the chemical interaction between the reagents and the targeted contaminants in contrast the heterogonous photocatalyst depends on the chemical oxidation process by metal oxidation semiconductors such as tio2 zno and cds immersed in water and irradiated near the uv light λ 385 nm which forms free hydroxyl radicals 175 177 the presence of tio2 photocatalytic irradiation generates a reactive oxygen species ros 160 while cds acts as a visible sensitizer and zno is responsible for charge separation conquering recombination progression furthermore the illumination of tio2 near uv radiation generates an electron hole pair e h charge carrier that can migrate to the surface of semiconductor particles 174 175 it reacts with the hydroxyl group and dissolves oxygen to form a reactive oxygen species ros the ros damages cell membranes dna and rna via oxidative stress 90 the treatment of wastewater with the photocatalyst materials offers some attractive advantages such as tio2 being stable under uv irradiation deficiency of chemical additives in the water low ion inhibition present in water and low cost of tio2 178 tio2 photocatalyst material is biologically and chemically inert insoluble under most conditions photostable and non toxic 179 also it requires low energy ultraviolet light to function well furthermore the simplicity efficiency possibility of using solar light radiation for removal of arb args and using fossil fuel for energy production due to ongoing ozone depletion is a distinct advantage that contributes to the development of water treatment technology the inability to work with a low concentration of these pollutants is the major challenge also cell death depends on the illumination time and concentration of tio2 174 studies have tried to explain the interaction between generated ros and the cell which inactivate arb args from wastewater the early work of dunlop and co on the use of photocatalyst materials on three strains of antibiotic resistant e coli under different reference strains cause a reduction of the viable number of arb from 3log10 to 0 5log10 after 180 min after post treatment incubation for 180 min for both arb 37 c and 24 h a bacteria recovery of 3log10 was observed and at 150 min no e coli survived this suggests that photocatalyst disinfection materials should take a long time to avoid post treatment recovery enhancing the unwanted transfer of args among bacteria 175 the major constraint disadvantage of these materials includes the inability to guarantee their application on a large scale inability to generate a uniform distribution of light to a large surface area difficulty in recovering the adsorbent from treated water it is time consuming it takes a longer time than usual and there will still be an insufficient overall conversion of energy required for treatment even after a prolonged time 4 2 fenton and ozone disinfectants fenton oxidation is the effective process of disinfecting wastewater containing arb args and the degradation of antibiotics this treatment material requires accessible ph and hydroxide ions to function effectively in the treatment processes it involves the manufacturing of hydroxyl radical ho from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 reacting with ferrous ions in an acidic medium 180 fenton oxidation material can be a solar driven fenton photo fenton and a conventional fenton process 171 in fenton reaction the oxidative species ho is produced through the reacting fe2 with h2o2 while in solar driven fenton reaction the fe3 produced from fenton reaction is photo reduced and regenerates fe2 as indicated in eqs 2 4 2 h2o2 fe2 fe3 oh oh 3 fe3 oh ho fe h2o 3 4 fe h2o 3 hv fe2 h oh the free hydroxyl radical ho produced during the reaction has a strong oxidation potential for the full range of micropollutants bacteria cells and dna damage 181 the ho radical produced by the decomposition of h2o2 is catalyzed by fe2 k 76 m 1 s 1 and fe2 catalyst regenerates in solar driven fenton at a low rate k 0 01 0 02 m 1 s 1 15 it records high efficiency in the degradation of various types of organic pollutants and the use of solar irradiation to stimulate the hydroxyl formation which results in low cost of application are some of the advantages of the fenton oxidation treatment material 63 182 also fenton disinfection aims to improve secondary effluents quality before reuse or disposal 22 it can regenerate highly reactive radicals and other species which can cause the oxidation of a broad range of organic pollutants 183 the fenton process s efficiency is affected by the concentration of h2o2 fe2 dose catalyst and ph solution 182 183 a recent study investigated arb args fate the conditions affecting the removal efficiency and the oxidative damage pathway involved during the fenton oxidation process fe2 h2o2 181 the authors reported that besides these conditions there is viable behavior observed by the genetic constituent of the microbial community which may result from the treatment materials and oxidative damage mechanisms during the application the fenton solar driven and fenton conventional processes are grouped among the advanced oxidation processes aops which remove recalcitrant organic and bio pollutants however the reduction of arb args with this application is still limited the main limitation of this treatment material is the formation of the oxidative products derived from the dissolved effluent of organic matter which can induce toxic effects during the biological treatment method 180 183 furthermore this treatment method s cost is high due to the massive consumption of reagents which can also introduce the reagents as secondary pollutants into wwtps 157 ozone materials are also among the advanced oxidation process aops of the water treatment process an interest in the application of an ozone based system is a great deal this is because it has demonstrated the effectiveness of numerous micropollutants significant abatement and provides suitable disinfectants to wastewater at different ozone doses and contact times 169 moreover they help induce gram positive and gram negative bacteria such as e coli and e faecalis 184 ozone materials are very active in water treatment because of their stable oxidizing agents the oxidizing agents can react with commonly used antibiotics such as b lactams sulfonamides macrolides quinolones trimethoprim and tetracyclines it can be distorted through direct oxidation during the ozonation of wastewater and can help remove these antibiotic residues from wastewater 185 deactivation of antibiotic bacterial characteristics by breaking their functional group is the primary function of ozone material during the wastewater treatment process 63 the knowledge of the efficiency of ozone materials for removing arb args is limited because most studies focused on the effects of ozone on bacteria population reduction 181 thus the results of the removal efficiency towards args are still unclear however the removal of antibiotics with ozone is effective in wastewater and depends on ozone concentration and contact time during the water treatment process 185 186 ozone is a powerful oxidant used during the wastewater treatment process over the last decades it can react with organic compounds under alkaline ph conditions ozone is not widely used for wastewater disinfection due to the cost of operation maintenance issues of the first step and a high ozone concentration during the treatment process 187 ozone materials have a high potential for the oxidation of various pharmaceutical compounds including antibiotics and inactivation of total pathogens in drinking water and wastewater 188 a study on the treatment methods including ozone for the inactivation of gene copies of sul 1 tet g inti 1 and 16s rdna stated that ozonation reduced 16s rdna still args were not notably inactivated 15 the significant drawbacks of ozone materials are the possibility of generating dangerous by products during partial oxidation of dissolved organic compounds also for adequate disinfection a high concentration of ozone materials is needed ozone gas preparation is not always direct and smooth and there is a need to prepare it on site these reports show that ozone materials are not the best option for targeting bacteria harboring args 4 3 uv disinfectants the uv disinfection process has been applied to wastewater treatment technology over the past few decades the reason that uv irradiation can effectively inactivate bacteria within a short period and does not release toxic disinfection by products 189 190 similarly uv disinfection is popular and promising disinfection material compared to chlorine in the wastewater treatment process it recently demonstrated its effectiveness for removing arb args in wwtps and drinking water 191 uv irradiation has some potentials that distinguish it from other materials used for wastewater treatment such possibilities are being non toxic environmentally friendly also it uses short wavelength uv c light to kill microorganisms by destroying and disrupting nucleic acid and their dna which performs vital cellular functions among organisms uv irradiation promotes oxidative species formation at a wavelength between 315 400 nm uv a leading to oxidative damage on arb args 166 the significant advantage of this treatment material is the ability to accomplish disinfection without using chemicals that may produce hazardous by products in north america uv is commonly used as an alternative to chlorine in wastewater treatment 187 it does not require a contact tank and steps for the neutralization process like in chlorination it produces few by products compared to the use of chlorine as a water disinfection material it involves photoreactivation or dark repair 178 in uv disinfection the reactor is an open channel involving water in contact with the uv light mercury arc discharge lamps with quartz sleeves produce uv light iron and humic matter are used as uv absorbing constituents in wastewater the removal efficiency of arb args in the effluent of sewage has some limitations because of the performance of both chemical and uv disinfection process and shielding target pathogens from the disinfecting agent several studies have investigated the influence of disinfection on arb args and concluded that uv disinfection could remove many arb args from the effluent 15 166 however a report from numerous studies has shown that there are still some traces of arb args in wastewater effluents after the uv disinfection procedure 155 the photoreactivation or dark repair can fix the damaged dna by uv irradiation thus reducing the efficiency and increasing microbial risk i e reactivation promotes the survival of arb after uv disinfection 176 the arb also can gain its conjugative ability after photoreactivation 192 the major drawback of uv irradiation points to the sustainability of uv technology on energy consumption the flimsiness of uv lamp short life span and the use of mercury which is difficult to separate from the effluent before disposal 166 the uv irradiation s inability to generate a specific wavelength could affect the removal efficiency since the inactivation mechanisms of arb args depend on the wavelength 4 4 ultrasound radiation based sonolysis ultrasound irradiation based sonolysis is a new advanced oxidation process for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants it is the process of using ultrasonic waves to disintegrate or decompose pollutants through the acoustic cavitation process acoustic cavitation is the interaction of ultrasound waves at high intensity with dissolved gases in an aqueous solution this interaction involves forming and collapsing the bubbles in an aqueous solution irradiated by intense ultrasound 193 the bubble collapse makes the ultrasound generate hydroxyl radicals that have been proven to be effective in removing pollutants from water 167 194 the liquid s temperature and pressure reach thousands of kelvins and hundreds of atmospheres during the bubble collapse 193 195 the energy from ultrasound induced acoustic cavitation split the oxygen and hydrogen molecules chemical bonds in water forming hydroxyl ho and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 increasing the ultrasonic amplitude results in sonochemical activities during water treatment 193 sonolysis undergoes two irradiation methods during the treatment process they are the pulse and continuous irradiation each method is effective based on the nature of pollutants the major drawbacks of this method are the removal of some selected antibiotic which are hydrophobic in nature incomplete elimination of antibiotics residues increases the risk of arb args proliferation in water also the cost of maintaining a constant temperature with chiller and ethylene glycol is another challenge because ethylene glycol may form dangerous by products and can be difficult to separate from treated water production of high amount of hydroxyl radicals required for effective degradation of arb args may be costly most of the conventional treatment technologies such as filtration biological treatment aerobic membrane bioreactor etc were able to inactivate arb but very ineffective in removing arb args they either enrich or promote the development of resistance mechanisms among bacteria in wwtps for example bergeron et al investigated the presence and removal of arb args with filtration in the raw water source and drinking water the study concluded that filtration could inactivate the detected arb but ineffective in filtering out args from treated drinking water 196 cheng et al reported the 5 5 log removal of arb and 2 67 log removal of args with aerobic membrane bioreactor the high log removal was achieved by high energy consumption rates which produces waste sludge that enrich or enhances the replication of arb args 197 lan et al monitored the removal of arb args in swine wastewater with biological treatment method nanofiltration and reverse osmosis he concluded that the biological treatment method did not reduce the detected args compared to other treatment methods employed in the study 78 all these reports confirmed that aops and conventional treatment methods could not eradicate various kinds of arb args efficiently therefore this review suggested a matured alternative for the complete removal of arb args in wwtps 5 restriction to indiscriminate use of antibiotics antibiotics gained popularity because of their effective action against microbial pathogens and attracted massive attention in the 1950s bbosa et al 198 gave a detailed review of antibiotics as such we will not dwell too much on it in this paper however the use of antibiotics at a large scale in human and animal medicine accelerates the proliferation of resistant bacteria and their genes it even develops multidrug resistant bacteria being the most dangerous 199 the estimated report states that animals and humans global consumption of antibiotics in foods lies between 100 000 200 000 tons per annum in comparison china s use alone is more than 25 000 tons 200 the wrong usage of these antibiotics leads to arb args emergence and weakens therapeutic properties against human and animal pathogens it causes resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics 13 resulting in a prolonged stay in the hospital increased mortality and morbidity rate as well as the drug resistant bacteria developing in the gut of humans and animals 16 201 the consumption of undercooked meats that contain antibiotic residue can facilitate the development of drug resistant bacteria in the human gut at the same time animals developed it from the consumption of feeds that contain antibiotics or antibiotics residue 202 the continuous discharge of both high and low concentrations of antibiotics into wastewater treatment plants from these sources promotes the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment causing severe public health risk 13 203 because of the harmful effect of antibiotics in the environment specifically wastewater access to these drugs in many advanced countries of the world is heavily restricted and restrictions are strongly enforced 9 204 for instance belgium s government established and implemented policies geared towards changing physicians prescription practices family doctors get feedback on the prescription methods the belgium government resorted to public awareness of antibiotic consumption and generated patient education materials using leaflets booklets advertisements on television and radio and websites 205 this effort was reported to have significantly reduced the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in belgium 206 in addition to reducing consumption and indiscriminate use of antibiotics data from hungary finland japan the usa and iceland suggest that national policies on the restriction of access to antibiotics resulted in the drastic reduction of drug resistant bacteria infections 207 208 this scenario cannot be said to be obtainable in africa as in countries where these drugs are restricted enforcement is not active while in others access is unrestricted therefore calls for the adoption of regulations policies and public campaigns among african nations on the appropriate use of antibiotics limit the level of drug resistance bacterial infections in the environment 6 conclusion antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in the wastewater treatment plant is an additional strain on the effluent s quality for reuse because of args increasing presence in the wwtps some of the args commonly detected include sulfonamides tetracycline beta lactam and fluoroquinolones resistance genes they are the leading cause of disease outbreaks in the environment several treatment methods materials used for the removal of these args from wastewater were ineffective this calls for more research in other to improve the removal of args in different water matrices this review highlights the importance and potentials of silver and silica oxide nanoparticles for removing these substances from wastewater going by the unique properties they boast of incorporating metallic nanoparticles is a promising way of eliminating these pollutants from wastewater finally setting up policies to prevent the indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a sure way to avoid these pollutants proliferation in wastewater with this the challenge with the selection of appropriate material will not be a concern declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment we are grateful to the south africa medical research council project ufh p790 for financial support 
13541,globally the challenges with extensive consumption and improper disposal of antibiotics have become a menace to public health this anomaly has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment many of these resistance genes are carried on plasmids transposons or integrons and their origin is linked to anthropogenic sources wastewater treatment plants wwtps harbors a vast diversity of microorganisms and are responsible for disseminating arb args the failure of different treatment methods materials to address the challenges observed with antibiotics resistance in wastewater treatment facilities alters access to quality water in the ecosystem this paper emphasized the health implication of antibiotic resistance in wastewater and its effect and the pathways for their dissemination from wastewater into receiving waters furthermore the lack of quality data and efforts in removing antibiotics resistant bacteria and their genes were mentioned in this paper compared to the abundance of data on the prevalence or incidences of these substances in wastewater potentials of metallic nanoparticles and their unique properties as a treatment option for removing dna conveying args from wastewater treatment plants were critically discussed in this paper also other treatment options and their limitations have been extensively discussed lastly this review also highlights the importance of regulating antibiotics and their indiscriminate use keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes silver nanoparticles silica oxide nanoparticles antimicrobials removal 1 introduction water is a vital component of life that plays an essential role in human and animal lives it is described as a significant component of the blood which carries nutrient and oxygen to all cells thus crucial for body temperature regulations 1 because of these critical roles in life access to quality water and quantity should be a priority however pollution compromises water quality and the quantity discharged into wastewater treatment plants from different sources 2 5 water reclamation has been considered a solution to water shortages and adopting efficient treatment strategies will help achieve high quality water to ensure all living organisms survival improving water quality requires fundamental strategies such as the prevention of pollutants inorganic heavy metals organic dyes pesticides pharmaceuticals and biological antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes treatment of polluted water restoration and protection of the ecosystem 6 water is a significant pathway for disseminating microorganisms in nature among human and animal populations 7 as mentioned earlier wastewater treatment plants wwtps and their effluents harbor and disseminate antibiotics resistant bacteria and antibiotics resistance genes arb args due to inadequate treatment technology materials what are arb and args according to the world health organization who arb is the bacteria that acquire resistance mechanisms to the antibiotics meant to eradicate them at the same time args are the resistance genes acquired through spontaneous mutation or genetic exchange with other bacteria that can resist one or more antibiotics 8 these contaminants are released into the environment due to extensive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics by humans and animals the consequences include rendering the efficacy of antibiotics that are meant to treat an infection ineffective thus increasing the morbidity and mortality rate among the populace in the environment 9 reports from the world health organization who and the center for disease control have shown that the existence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes without proper sanitation facilities pose a severe risk to global health 8 10 11 in particular wastewater treatment plants are the hotspot for activation and the spread of arb args into different water bodies 12 13 thus the release of arb arg contaminated water is dangerous to humans animals and aquatic life therefore wastewater disposal from industries hospitals and agricultural aquaculture sectors should be treated efficiently to prevent the rapid proliferation of arb args and even widespread multidrug resistant bacteria mdrb in diverse environments 14 15 it is necessary to state that antibiotic resistance results from extensive or overconsumption of antibiotics which build up to form resistance mechanisms in organisms the ability of bacteria to outpace antibiotics efficacy is termed antibiotics resistance 16 17 over prescription of antibiotics patients not completing the entire antibiotics course overuse of these antibiotics in livestock and fish farming poor infection control hygiene sanitation in healthcare settings and lack of newly developed medicines antibiotic are the significant causes of antibiotics resistance in the natural environment 18 due to their limited understanding fate and the risk posed to human and animal healths in the ecosystem antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args are referred to as emerging or unregulated pollutants in water matrices numerous reports have outlined the concentration of these emerging pollutants arb args in wastewater 17 19 rivers 13 and soil through swine feedlot and waste 20 the widespread arb args have led to spontaneous gene mutation and gene transfer among bacteria found in various water matrices 21 23 hence the control of args from the influents and effluents of wwtps may reduce contamination of watersheds which will avert health related illnesses among the populace in the environment also controlling the dissemination of arb args and averting their harmful health effects required several treatment strategies to remove these pollutants from the influents and effluent of wastewater such treatment strategies are filtrations bioremediation 24 uv irradiation 25 photocatalysis 26 chlorination 27 fenton and ozone disinfection processes 28 29 these strategies have proven their efficiency in removing organic and inorganic pollutants still they are ineffective for removing arb args as they may not account for the total removal of these pollutants from wastewater most of them are reported to enrich or enhance the proliferation of arb args in the wastewaters recently advances in nanoscience and nanoparticles have been considered the best option for eliminating these harmful pollutants from wastewaters 30 32 the biological origin of nanoparticles plays a vital role in removing environmental contaminants such as organic and inorganic pollutants heavy metals etc their unique properties aid in the adsorption of pollutants from wastewater they are quickly recovered from treated water the use of nanoparticles is cost effective compare to advanced oxidation processes aops they have an active surface that enables surface functionalization with different functional groups attached easily to target specific contaminants the modification process provides a controllable size shape and unique electronic structure improving its adsorption capacity metallic nanoparticles such as silver nanoparticles agnps silica oxide nanoparticles sio2 nps sulfidated nanoscale zero valent and persulfate treatment of nps have demonstrated their potentials in binding dna through electrostatic interactions and mediating dna into the oxide nanoparticles surface with the use of chaotropic salt 33 34 silver nanoparticles have played a vital role in combating emerging pollutants responsible for infectious diseases their wide application in several fields is due to their physical and chemical properties including thermal optical biological and high electrical conductivity these properties enable their use in industrial healthcare related products cosmetics optical sensors pharmaceuticals products biomedical devices households and water purification processes silver is a metal with a history of antimicrobial properties that provides health impact in early life such as treating venereal disease with silver nitrate in 1700ce the treatment of fresh burn in the 18th century to date and as a water treatment material in 1000bce 35 agnps have been applied in various biological and biomedical fields such as antibacterial anti tumor antifungal antiviral antioxidative drug carrier anti inflammatory and biosensor it is used in the water treatment process especially in eliminating bacterial dna conveying args due to its ability to curb bacteria resistance against antibiotics it has low toxicity high thermal stability and volatility agnps are more effective than the bulk due to silver ion ag which can cause cell death 36 similarly silica oxide nanoparticles sio2 nps have been reported to be a promising adsorbent with high potentials for arb args removals from wastewater due to their large surface area affinity to bind dna morphology particle size and porosity 37 38 a suitable surface for sio2 functionalization could improve the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of arb args from wastewater sulfidated nanoscale zero valent iron n zvi has been proven to be effective and a new promising alternative that may provide a solution to arb arg contaminated water it has a large surface area and particle size to inject n zvi to the source zone which attacks pollutants before spreading out into the water 39 the elimination of arb args using s nzvi is achieved through adsorption and reactive oxygen species ros under aerobic situations 40 the ros weakens the regrowth capacity of the bacteria conveying args treatment of nanoparticles with persulfate salt has shown its effectiveness in removing arb args through generating sulfate radicals the oxidation prowess and production of sulfate radicals are achieved by activating persulfate ion and thermochemical methods 41 this review evaluates the occurrence and removal of arb args in wastewater their health implication their transfer mechanism in the water environment limitations of selected treatment materials for args removal and some metallic potentials nanoparticles for the removal of arb args from wastewater 2 arb and args in water wastewater 2 1 sources and occurrence the discovery and proliferation of arb args in different water milieu including wastewater treatment plants are of great concern to the general public 42 the knowledge of these dangerous pollutants calls for lifestyle changes and drastic measures wwtps are regarded as the human source for promoting args in the environment while the application of manure on land is the animal source for spreading args 43 adefisoye and okoh investigated args prevalence in municipal wastewater treatment plants in eastern cape south africa and concluded that wwtps are point sources for arb and args 44 it could be due to sewage and hospital disposal containing args associated with clinical pathogens the incidence of antibiotic resistance in wastewater treatment facilities and the threat posed by this menace cannot be over emphasized this is complemented by the number of studies reported on arb args in wastewater from different world countries a search that we conducted between 4th and 6th june 2020 using two accessible online databases scopus and google scholar with the keywords shown in table 1 on kinds of literature published in english indicated that from 2015 to 2020 and across six continents namely africa asia australia europe north america and south america seven hundred thirty six 736 studies were reported on the incidence of arb args in wastewater while 331 studies were reported on studies for the removal of these substances from wastewater this does not include duplicate studies as the thorough screening was done to eliminate duplication of articles that may arise from using two search engines statistical analysis of this data was carried out using microsoft excel 2016 and the details are presented in fig 1 fig 1 shows that all six continents have significantly reported arb args in wastewater with vast amounts of the study conducted in asia and europe furthermore comparing published articles on the incidence occurrence and removal of arb args we found that most efforts have been concentrated on the fate or presence of these substances in wastewater little has been done on their removal from wastewater consistent report incidence of these contaminants necessitated continuous research to remove these contaminants from water wastewater furthermore the wwtps received a considerable amount of antibiotics residue arb args through pharmaceutical industries due to inadequate treatment materials a detailed process showing the route of these pollutants and their health implications resulting from inadequate treatment methods and indiscriminate discharge of untreated effluents is presented in fig 2 fig 2 shows that the inability to remove arb args can cause health hazards in an ecosystem 3 45 the stable antibiotics discharged into the environment could be washed as runoffs by rainwater into water bodies including groundwater located at dumpsites furthermore antibiotic resistance can be induced by water disinfectant by products dbps including surface water and other water compartments for example lie and co detected two dbps of water chlorite and iodoacetic acid they concluded that they possess antibiotic properties leading to the evolution of resistant e coli strains at low and high exposures to inhibitory concentrations 22 the report showed that some antibiotic resistance genes concentration was quantified in the biosolids and effluents after treatment 43 46 47 2 2 health implications of antibiotic resistance since antibiotic resistance in various water milieu poses a risk to public health globally 8 11 their detection and the subsequent removal of antibiotic resistance determinants require urgent attention 17 48 in 2017 the world health organization who reported that antibiotic resistance had implicated global health and food security 49 also it is predicted as a future infection that can ravage lives according to who methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa responsible for skin infections pneumonia toxic shock syndrome vancomycin resistant enterococcus multidrug resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis and carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae gut bacteria are examples of resistant bacteria that causes severe health damage 49 who scientist in july 2017 reported that antibiotic resistant gonorrhea is another life threatening infection that causes severe ill health and sometimes becomes very difficult to treat 11 furthermore the aquatic environment experiences an ecotoxicological challenge as a result of arb args it also stimulates the algal community structure resulting in a shift in the food web 13 50 the continuous release of these pollutants in water into the soil can contaminate the farm crops thus endangering human and livestock survival 51 all these drive the resistance evolution which requires urgent action across different countries to halt its effects on environmental health blocking the primary route for receiving large scale antibiotics into the wastewater treatment plants 17 52 may avert the health challenges synonymous with antibiotics resistance meanwhile the world health organization who in 2015 also reported that antibiotic resistance occurs naturally via natural selection through random mutations 49 a study showed that removing resistant bacteria without targeting the genetic mutation that deals with the dna sequence had been a threat to treatment strategies 53 these genetic mutations serve as defense mechanisms to the organisms enabling the bacteria to outpace the effects of novel antibiotics designed to destroy them 44 they are the main factor that promotes diversity among organisms the genetic mutation occurs in a cell that produces the next generations and affects the hereditary material of the microorganisms by altering the pre existing genetic makeup of a cell s dna 54 55 thus this genetic makeup in dna can cause changes in all aspects of living organisms many settlements in south africa rely on surface water for their daily use thus exposing the communities to water contaminated with dna conveying args can result in waterborne diseases args cause infection when a bacterium develops the ability to outpace the efficacy of one or more antibiotics designed to eradicate them or halt their growth 9 antibiotic resistance in water is an emerging health challenge that has claimed over 700 000 lives adequate measures should be considered in other to eliminate the proliferation of arb args from water matrices these measures may avert arb args prediction of claiming 10 million lives in the year 2050 56 2 3 transfer of arb args in water wastewater several studies with characterized laboratory strains have explained the nature of arg mechanisms and the knowledge obtained was used to investigate the environmental factor s effects on gene transfer 57 arb args possess environmental threats due to their association with mobile genetic elements which can be transferred easily between microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer for the genes to be effectively disseminated from the environment to pathogenic bacteria the bacteria must be closely related by temporarily sharing the same habitat 58 these bacteria acquire resistance genes in mobile genetic platforms such as plasmids 59 fig 3 shows the args dissemination among bacteria into the receiving environment via horizontal and vertical gene transfers distributed from human and animal sources furthermore the transfer of bacterial genetic materials is influenced by stressors like antibiotics metals and biocides 60 61 subsequently antibiotic resistance occurs either by mutations or acquiring resistance conferring genes via horizontal gene transfer hgt horizontal or lateral gene transfer is a primary mechanism for spreading antibiotic resistance and an evolution maintenance and transmission of virulence genes 21 62 hgt is when bacteria recipients acquire a genetic trait or resistance mechanisms from a donor bacteria through the asexual process 58 it also permits new bacteria variants to arise without the mutation besides antibiotic resistance developed from natural selection can receive genetic material through horizontal gene transfer its consequences in wastewater are the dissemination of args and an increase in drug resistance for example bacteria that acquire resistance transfer their resistance genes to other species it occurs from resistant donor bacteria free dna phages and dead cells to living cells 55 63 hgt includes those mechanisms responsible for infections and propagative activities of mobile genetic elements conjugation transduction and those controlled by the bacterial cell transformation 64 65 the mechanisms also consist of uptake of naked dna and mobile genetic elements such as integrons transposons plasmids gene cassettes and bacteriophages 66 67 some of these are known to transfer multiple args at the same time for example methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus represents a clinical acquisition of gene cassette while the integrons capture and reshuffle gene cassette which encodes antibiotic resistance determinants 68 the four significant mechanisms of transfers are briefly discussed below transformation this transfer mechanism deals with naked double stranded dna taken up by a proficient bacterial cell to attain a transformation state it has the potential to transfer dna to distantly related bacteria its evolutionary benefits are its diversification and mixing within the bacteria population 65 the genetic mixing during transformation can provide selective advantages by allowing bacteria to combine favorably by mutations 65 69 a cell can then absorb and integrate into extracellular dna edna and its chromosome the absorbed edna serves as a source of information and nutrients 22 70 conjugation the conjugation transfer occurs when dna is transferred from the donor cell to the recipient cell through sexual pilus and adhesins and it requires cell to cell contact 71 the donor cells become resistant by freshly acquired resistance genes 72 a conjugative pilus provides the physical link for dna to move from donors to the recipient it transfers plasmids and plays a vital role in the dissemination of plasmids borne args transduction transduction involves dna transfer from one bacterium to another through bacteriophages it is the most critical mechanism for the exchange of genes among bacteria 73 the bacteriophages have a wide ranging host and can infect other bacteria hosts because they are carriers of other bacteria 68 they can as well transfer their genes into the dna of the new bacterial host transduction contains phage particles that mediate dna transfer in the environment they are resistant to environmental degradation and their compact size aids the dissemination quickly 58 transduction s unique properties make it possible to transfer genes from bacterial communities environment to human microbiomes 74 gene transfer agent gta gta virus like particles that carried dna present in the host and transduced to a recipient cell 75 it facilitates random gene transfer between species and the particles can be freed through cell lysis and spread to recipient cells 73 3 metallic nanoparticles and arb args in water wastewater the application of nanotechnology has gained much interest in solving environmental related problems especially for removing biological organic and inorganic substances that pollute the water environment through industrialization population growth global climate change etc 76 79 these pollutants including arb and args are toxic and even carcinogenic and cause a severe health risk to humans livestock and aquatic life nanotechnology however has excellent potential for water purification and treatment nanomaterials have a large surface area high reactivity and degree of modification dependable size properties and affinity to target specific contaminants 80 82 these unique features contribute to their excellent adsorbent sensors and catalyst these materials are considered as alternative therapies in medicine and wastewater reclamation the ability to be utilized solely by itself or modification with other materials to increase the removal efficiency qualifies it as excellent treatment material for wastewater purification another beneficial aspect of this material is being able to recover it after treatment process nanotechnology s actual environmental application includes tio2 nanoscale for photocatalytic degradation of air contaminants e g no s vocs also for removing hardness in water water purification using nanofiltration and nanoscale zero valent iron for reclaiming soil and groundwater 83 zero valent nanoparticles are active in removing genetic components of heterotrophic bacteria from wastewater 84 several synthesis routes of nanoparticles including ionic gelation solvent dispersion fluid extraction solid state reaction polymerization chemical reaction co precipitation techniques sol gel combustion methods green synthesis which is eco friendly and cost effective depending on their application 85 87 the combination of diverse nanoparticles has proven to be effective against arb and args in water arb and args treatment with nanoparticles was formally limited to medical research due to the rapid development of antibiotic multidrug resistant bacteria in the human gut 55 their effectiveness in combating drug resistance motivated interest in the removal of arb args from wastewater the removal efficiency of arb args using nanoparticles during wastewater treatment involves some mechanisms they include nanoparticles functionalization with antibiotics or organic compounds with a positive charge that can attract a reasonable number of toxic ions dna conveying args 37 the addition of chaotropic salt can mediate dna conveying args to the surface of metal oxides nps and the combination of different nanoparticles that combat the arb args by synergistic means 12 34 43 some of these nps exhibit strong antimicrobial properties that fight against a broad spectrum of microorganisms 88 they are environmentally friendly cost effective and easy to synthesize several studies have shown the effectiveness of some nanoparticles against the inactivation of arb and removal of args in water 89 91 the utilization of agnps sio2 nps sulfidated nanoscale zero valent iron and persulfate treatment in nanoparticles due to their unique properties may help eliminate the problems associated with antibiotic resistance in wastewater 14 35 92 3 1 silver nanoparticles agnps the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their genes from wastewater requires highly advanced treatment technology with materials of vast antimicrobial properties which can halt the spread of these resistant bacteria and eliminate args from wastewater before their disposal into the receiving water bodies nanoparticles 1 100 nm may provide solutions to this kind of water related problem agnps has shown great prospect among the metallic nanoparticles due to its essential properties and application to different areas including antimicrobial agents catalytic agent antiseptic spray ink production coating agents and food storage packaging 13 93 94 they effectively reduce or inactivate the growth of microorganisms in different applications such as in the production of emollient creams and wound dressing studies confirmed that the antibacterial property of agnps is effective against gram positive and gram negative bacteria including the multidrug resistant strains methicillin resistant s aureus 55 95 aruguete et al 2013 investigated the potentials of agnps in restricting the proliferation of multidrug resistant pathogens by functionalizing agnps with a water soluble polymer in other to combat the resistant organism they concluded that functionalized agnps performed like antibiotics and are toxic to pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria resistant to multiple drugs previously administered furthermore several authors reported that the antibacterial properties of agnps synthesized from plant extract are high and active against bacterial strains 93 96 97 adegboyega and co investigated the antibacterial activity of agnps synthesized from fe2 ag coated with natural organic matter nom against various gram negative g and gram positive g bacterial species the authors concluded that the coated agnps were toxic to different bacterial species 96 a study also reported the use of silver nanoparticles as a reliable antiseptic and antibacterial agent against gram positive and gram negative bacteria in the past due to its low toxicity to mammalian cells 98 according to maillard and hartemann 2013 colloid silver metallic silver and salt silver inhibit the growth of antibiotic resistance genes in water by inducing a high degree of the structural and morphological trait that kills bacteria cells their inhibitory effects are due to the presence of ag and their sorption with a negatively charged bacterial cell wall which deactivates cellular enzymes disrupting membrane permeability leading to cell lysis and death 100 various silver forms are active with the increase in catalytic properties making them more toxic to the bacteria cell their toxicity depends on size and shapes because the smaller sizes can pass and accumulate in the membrane 101 the intracellular accumulations can lead to cell death 100 this confirmed the effectiveness of silver ion ag than the bulk silver for the inactivation of bacteria species catalytic oxidation of metallic silver and dissolved monovalent silver ions contributes to its bactericidal effects a recent study indicated that silver ion undergoes catalytic oxidation with nascent oxygen and the resulting compound can attack bacteria on the cell membrane thereby leading to cell death 102 therefore incorporating agnps in wastewater treatment can cause an attack on bacterial dna causing the organism to undergo structural changes by forming pores and allowing the cellular components into fluids osmotic pressure and through electrostatic attraction a considerable amount of args may be removed during treatment processes modifying agnps with antibiotics may increase the removal efficiency of args through dna binding from wastewater the combination of agnps with antibiotics has also demonstrated their effectiveness in combating multidrug resistant bacteria and their genes for example the combination of agnps with molecular antibiotics proved that they are active in killing multidrug resistant pathogens and combating the activities of arb and args in the water matrix 12 24 3 1 1 unique properties of nanosilver for arb args removal from wastewater 3 1 1 1 varying size and shape the application of silver nanoparticles for removing arb args from wastewater largely depends on their physical properties including the variation of size and shape which influenced their preparation methods the size and shape of agnps can be controlled by optimizing different parameters such as temperature ph precursors reducing agents and other experimental conditions 103 varying the size and shape of nanoparticles plays a vital role in the inactivation of bacteria such roles are the generation of ros that can influence the cytotoxicity of agnps leading to cell death variation of size and shape has a rejuvenating effect on cell viability lactate dehydrogenase ldh and ros production in a dependable size mode surface area volume ratio and surface reactivity can improve the particle size and shape 99 102 facilitating ros production several studies reported the effect of agnps size and shape on the production of ros carlson et al investigated the effect of different sizes 15 nm and 55 nm and shape cubic and nanorod of hydrocarbon coated agnps they found that 15 nm can generate a high ros amount compared with 55 nm in a macrophage cell line 104 liu et al found that 5 nm agnps were more toxic than 20 and 50 nm agnps 105 production of high ros can be toxic than their bulk counterpart 101 106 and can cause cell damage as shown in fig 4 silver nanoparticles with smaller sizes are very potent for the inactivation of arb they tend to rapidly release silver ions resulting in their penetration in the cell which can stop the further spread of arb and remove args through the binding process 107 similarly a study reported that silver nanoparticles size is an essential factor for their effectiveness against arb 108 they reported that the antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles increases with a decrease in particle size although different shapes of silver nanoparticles are known e g cubic rings rod like platelets spherical nanowire nano triangle etc however the shape of the nanosilver is related to the atom density of surface facets the shape with the highest atom density results in the particle with the highest removal of arb args from wastewater 109 110 the sem and tem images of typical silver nanoparticles with comparably small size and spherically shaped morphology are shown in fig 5 3 1 1 2 antibacterial property silver nanoparticles are known for their excellent bactericidal properties which are applicable in the pharmaceutical and biological sciences such as in the production of medicine disinfectant and biocidal spray wound dressing and heart valve 111 112 it is widely applicable in producing antiseptic creams clothing underwear and textile products even in washing machines antibacterial property can also reduce infection and prevent prostheses colonization dental material and human skin infection 113 a report has shown the effectiveness of agnps against antibiotic resistant bacteria quintero et al 114 monitored the usefulness of biosynthesized agnps as bactericidal agents for three clinical strains namely the methicillin resistant s aureus a baumannii and e coli the authors discovered biosynthesized agnps at picomolar concentration exhibit bactericidal activity against human gram positive and gram negative pathogens including the clinical isolates mentioned a study investigated the antibacterial effects against gram negative aerobic rod shape bacterium called pseudomonas aeruginosa with the combination of agnps gentamicin and ampicillin the authors concluded that the concentration of agnps with gentamicin shows bactericidal effects against pseudomonas aeruginosa while that of ampicillin shows resistance to the bacteria 113 it implies that agnps with some antibiotics can effectively reduce antibiotic resistant bacteria and eradicate args enrichment miller and coworkers 2013 reported that the antibacterial property of agnps prevented an increase in the abundance of sul1 sul2 sulfonamide antibiotics resistance genes and intl1 integrons 115 furthermore a recent study points towards the generation of reactive oxidative species ros in the presence of agnps contributing to cell death by targeting cell wall and intracellular targets via ion release physical interaction and production of ros at the highest concentration might lead to dna damage 116 for example ji lu et al 117 investigated agnps and ag ion s effect on ros generation of e coli k 12le392 and p putida kt2440 using flow cytometry rna sequencing proteomics the authors reported that a higher concentration of agnps and ag ions significantly increases ros production the ros generated as a result of the rise in the intensity of agnps induces oxidative stress amongst bacterial which eventually leads to damage of dna embedded in args embedding of agnps with other antimicrobial nanoparticles tio2 can enhance the antibacterial effects of agnps and may give high removal efficiency of arb args a study investigated the antibacterial effects of embedding nanoparticles of tio2 agnps under uv irradiation to reduce e coli bacteria generation of ros and the removal of tetracycline resistance genes 118 the authors concluded that the embedment of tio2 agnps inhibited the growth of e coli bacteria it generated ros due to tio2 large band gap which could damage the cell wall due to the electrostatic interaction between tio2 and agnps a considerable amount of resistance genes was removed therefore incorporating agnps as a treatment material in the wastewater treatment process may inhibit bacterial dna and facilitate their removal from wastewater the ability to generate excessive ros with other antibacterial nanoparticles can damage plasmid dna leading to a decrease in args abundance in wastewater the antibacterial property of agnps can inhibit the activation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the dissemination of resistance genes detected from wastewater and receiving water 3 1 1 3 catalytic oxidation property silver nanoparticles can undergo catalytic oxidation by visible light releasing silver ions which can gradually accumulate and damage bacteria s dna catalytic oxidative stress is known as one of the mechanisms of dna damage the incorporation of catalytic oxidation of silver ions into the bacteria cells induces a high degree of structural and morphological features that can kill bacteria cells 36 it can attack the dna bases and inactivate their ability to replicate the silver ion s attachment on the cell membrane can modify the cell potentials by disorganizing the permeability and hindering cell respiration 54 leading to reactive oxygen species it is known that oxygen is adsorbed on the silver surface in its atomic state causing the oxygen to diffuse freely within the silver than any other metal indicating the source of nascent oxygen from metallic silver a study has proven the effectiveness of catalytic oxidation of silver ion with nascent oxygen reacting with thiol groups sh forming r s s r r is an organic moiety bond causing respiratory blockage and cell death 76 89 also the silver ion binding with bacteria dna prevents it from unwinding which can inactivate cellular replication 119 the bacteria cell found in wastewater undergoes structural changes with silver ion forming pores and allowing cellular components into the fluid due to osmotic difference the application of agnps for arb args removal would be achieved through catalytic oxidation reduction of silver ion reacting with the negative charge of the toxic dna by oxidizing bacteria dna which would result in complete disintegration 3 1 2 mechanism of nanosilver for the removal of arb args from wastewater the resistance of microbes against antimicrobials has been known to take place through several mechanisms these include efflux of antimicrobials from the cell of microbes transportation of the nano antimicrobial agent to the site of action antimicrobial agent degradation modification of the enzymes of antimicrobials and antimicrobial targets changes in the permeability of the microbial cell walls which prevents antimicrobial access to target points in the cell and over secretion and production of the target enzyme 120 the mechanism of the silver nanoparticle s action against arb is such that firstly the nanoparticles attach themselves to the bacteria dna bases and after that alters the function of the membrane secondly the nanoparticles in the bacterial cell result in cell injury the breakdown of silver nanoparticles can release silver ions that interact with thiol proteins in the cell wall to affect cell functions 121 as a result targeting the infection of pathogens harboring antimicrobial resistance genes using silver nanoparticles is an exciting aspect of eliminating antibiotic resistance it is the major challenge encountered with delivering a therapeutic agent to the site of action controlling the delivery of nanosilver antimicrobial will put an end to these challenges it allows the release of a load of drugs to eliminate microbes the combination of silver nanoparticles and antimicrobials can through endocytosis penetrate its host 122 123 some reports have it that antimicrobials loaded with silver nanoparticles administered intratracheally penetrated directly through the alveolar capillary blockage into the systemic circulation in blood vessel organs including kidney liver bone and spleen 124 125 altering the surface of nanoparticles to bind to mannose receptors expressed in alveolar macrophages adequately was considered an effective way to enhance the delivery of antimicrobial agents to the targeted spots 126 127 studies reported that mannose conjugated liposomes loaded with ciprofloxacin have been active as drugs targeting alveolar macrophages through pulmonary administration 128 129 several different useful carriers for nanosilver antimicrobials delivery include dendrimers polymers liposomes solid lipids etc 130 nanoparticles designed to target the active site can readily penetrate the cell membrane and reside in the cell s cytoplasm by this action phagocytosis and pinocytosis are known as the two mechanisms for internalizing other materials in the cell 131 132 3 2 silica oxide nanoparticles the high concentration of args in wwtps threatens lives and the efficacy of the treatment methods materials globally which links to the unregulated use of antibiotics various treatment methods materials success depends on their effectiveness in removing pollutants especially the dna conveying args args are seen as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the 21st century and the use of nanoparticles as treatment materials significantly increased life expectancy since discovering the effectiveness of silica materials in duplex dna packaging researchers have attempted to use this material for dna adsorption from an aqueous solution 33 37 133 bacterial dna is a threat to water quality and it contains genes that can be resistant to antibiotics it is a bulky molecule that has a high negative charge in its backbone therefore mediating dna molecules into the surface of silica materials becomes a difficult task since the sio2 nps have a negative charge because of this challenge most researchers utilize a means of successfully mediating dna into silica materials surface it possesses a pore volume a high surface area up to 1200 m2 g 1 identical pore size controllable particle size and excellent biocompatibility 134 adsorption of dna molecules on the silica surface was achieved by mediating dna into the silica surface with a multivalent cation such as mg2 and ca2 135 gao et al 33 also mediated dna into silica surface with cationic linkers to adsorbed plasmid dna through electrostatic interaction all these studies successfully induced dna into silica oxide nanoparticles consequently other researchers avoided the use of cationic linkers for dna adsorption they made use of an aqueous solution with high sodium chloride nacl concentration at low ph and chaotropic salt such as guanidine hydrochloride at ph 5 to mediate dna into the surface of the silica oxides nanoparticles 37 133 for example li et al 37 utilized the guanidine hydrochloride salt solution at ph 5 dna adsorption was successfully achieved by varying the salt solutions under different adsorption conditions the study reported that the amount of adsorbed dna into the silica surface changes with salt solution concentration sio2 nps demonstrated excellent stability and reusability for dna binding with effects on time ph temperature and concentration from these studies for the dna to successfully bind on sio2 nps there are essential factors that should be considered and they are the ion present in the dna must support binding when arranged in its backbone since the backbone consists of sugar and phosphate the variation of sio2 nps concentration with ph value controls the surface charge because electrostatic interactions play a vital role in dna binding the success of dna binding in modified sio2 nps could be attributed to hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction and the interaction between dna and sio2 nps impressive success on drug gene delivery and dna binding during the adsorption process are recorded due to their retaining features and their controllable loading in releasing guest molecules during the drug delivery process the sio2 nps with pore sizes ranging from 2 nm to 50 nm are excellent materials for the water wastewater treatment process its beneficial features such as uniform and tunable size secure independence ability to functionalize the surface internal and external pores and opening pores mechanisms make it a distinctive and proficient material for pollutant removal and drug carrier 136 sio2 nps enable the covalent linkage of different compounds involves considerable changes in both physical and chemical properties it was firstly prepared by stober synthesis followed by sol gel with slight modifications 137 138 the synthesis involves combining selected silane compound and nitric acid hno3 as a pore generating template depending on the application 87 the size and morphological shape of the synthesized silica oxide nanoparticles are determined by sem and tem as shown in fig 6 silica oxide nanoparticles are also considered as an ideal disinfectant for dna in wastewater because of their extensive antimicrobial activity at ambient temperature binding ability inability to produce harmful substance during and after use less expensive easy to store highly soluble in water and easy to recover from water wastewater after the treatment process 81 besides silica oxide nanoparticles remove contaminants such as organic dyes methylene blue and antibiotics from wastewater 134 139 140 modification of sio2 nps can lead to high removal efficiency of these pollutants from different water matrices further applications of sio2 nps include catalysis biological and biomedicine due to their unique feature 87 3 2 1 surface modification of silica oxide nanoparticles sio2 nps for the increase in the removal efficiency of sio2 nps there is a need for adequate modification with cationic linkers the surface modification of every treatment material enhances the adsorption capacity during the wastewater treatment process a wide variety of modifying silica surfaces has been developed to improve the adsorption capacity and selectivity of the material for organic and inorganic pollutants also modification of sio2 nps surface provides a better surface ion for electrostatic interaction and binding sites for dna molecules various functional groups such as amine or thiol ligands multivalent cations and organosilane have been employed for sio2 nps surface modification 37 141 142 the standard material for modification can be through organosilane which involves two methods the first method is co condensation which involves organosilane aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes with tetraethylorthosilicate teos the second method is through photosynthesis grafting involving the calcined porous materials modified by heating the organosilane reactant with an aprotic solvent such as toluene 141 with the vast literature available online on the use of sio2 nps for the drug gene delivery process which prompted the trim work on dna binding there is a need for further research or more actual field trial on dna binding conveying args from wastewater also the synthesis of fewer complex particles with a controllable size less than 100 nm and materials free from harmful chemicals such as ammonia n2h4 as catalysts should be considered this condition will ensure that no secondary contaminants would be detected after the treatment process 3 3 sulfidated nanoscale zero valent iron nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has gained more attention as a promising new technology for eliminating contaminant in the last two decades it is relatively inexpensive eco friendly and has strong reducing capacity fe2 2e fe s e0 0 44 v 39 it also can cause physical damage and oxidative stress to bacteria 143 144 the simple mechanism is feo core oxidizing to iron oxides and hydroxides simultaneously 145 as a nanoscale material s nzvi may provide a cost effective way for args removal compared with aops due to its antibacterial properties 40 the particle size allowed the injection of nzvi into the source zone it attacked the pollutant before they spread out in the water which is crucial for in situ water purification process 144 a recent development on the sulfidated nanoscale zero valent iron to eliminate arb args has been demonstrated for example lee et al reported its strong bactericidal effects on e coli under anaerobic conditions than the silver nanoparticles 146 oprckal et al reported the effective inactivation of e coli enterococcus and clostridium from biological wastewater effluents when 0 5 g l of nzvi was introduced during the treatment process 147 however two factors may affect its increase in sterilization efficiency the easy passivation that retard the outward feo core transfer to the oxide s surface resulting in a decreased yield of reactive oxygen species ross 148 secondly the easy aggregation and poor uniform distribution of nzvi prevent adhesion between nzvi particles and the bacteria surface 149 since the removal capacity of nzvi depends on the electron selectivity for the target contaminant and its utilization ratio of feo particles 148 therefore it is necessary to improve the removal and inactivation efficiencies through surface modification of nzvi several reports have proven that surface modification of nzvi with sulfur compounds enhances the decontamination process he et al reported that sulfide modification of nzvi could efficiently fabricate or build the electron transfer stream because in his study approximately 72 of electron transfer stream were due to the fesx instead of iron oxide 39 other studies reported that the electron transfer pathway between sulfur modified nanoscale zero valent iron s nzvi and o2 and its continuous electron transfer dominated and improved ross yield wang et al monitored the inactivation of gram negative sulfonamide arb the removal of its intracellular args and integrase gene intl1 with nzvi with different sulfur iron s fe molar ratio the removal rate of arg sul1 and intl1 were high on s nzvi than removal with ordinary nzvi 144 the further experiment proved that arb cell structure and intracellular dna were severely damaged after applying s nzvi treatment material a study also investigated the mechanism of args mobile genetic element mges removal and the cause of the weakening nature of their bacteria carrier regrowth capacity after the application of s nzvi on secondary effluent 145 the result showed that the dna accepted electron provided by the feo core of s nzvi is responsible for reducing 16 srrna args and the loss of regrowth capacity especially for the mge intl1 based on these successful results mentioned above the s nzvi could be a potential approach that will stop arb and args proliferation from wastewater 3 4 modification of metal nanoparticles with persulfate treatment modification of nanoparticles with persulfate salt has recently played a vital role in minimizing the risk of arb args spreading into other water recipients persulfate can be activated by heat microwave ultrasound ph adjustment the addition of transition metals fenton and fenton like process 150 151 to generate sulfate radicals with redox potential so4 e 2 5 3 1 v which has more aggressive oxidizing agents than the persulfate anions s2on 2 2so4 2 152 it has proven its effectiveness in the water treatment process due to its long lifetime wide ph range and strong oxidizing agent its mechanisms involved persulfate ion as a precursor in producing free sulfate radicals that could degrade various pollutants especially the antibiotics residue 153 according to olmez et al so4 can react with water of different ph to produce ho during the wastewater treatment process 150 the reaction is described in the equation below 1 all phs so4 h2o so4 2 ho h k h2o 2 10 3s 1 this process eliminates toxic pollutants by converting them into fewer toxic products such as mineral products 151 persulfate treatment has been considered a promising method for arb args removal due to its high solubility low cost and production of high radical stability at different conditions and being independent of organic products during the removal of pollutants 41 recent studies have demonstrated the removal of antibiotic residues leading to the proliferation of arb args with persulfate treatment in conjunction with nanoparticles malakotian et al investigated the removal of antibiotics residue with persulfate fe3o4 nanoparticle and the result shows that a high concentration of antibiotics residues was removed at ph 10 151 duan et al investigated the removal of selected args sul1 intl1 and 16 s rrna genes with persulfate modified nanoscale zero valent iron ps nzvi persulfate modified ginkgo biloba l ps g nzvi and ordinary nzvi from sewage the result proved that args removal efficiency was high with ps nzvi than the ordinary nzvi and ps nzvi 154 these successful results proved that persulfate modified nanoparticles could reduce the abundance of arb args in the receiving water and minimize the risk of consuming the args contaminated water 4 other treatment materials previously employed for the removal of arb args from water wastewater and their drawbacks many countries are experiencing shortages of quality water as a result of emerging pollutants from several sources an emerging contaminant like args is reported as one of the essential factors affecting water quality in developed countries 155 157 however the most significant source remains the discharge of a large scale of antibiotics from the hospital pharmaceutical and agricultural sectors which increases the resistance mechanisms these sources generate waste in the form of water discharged into wastewater treatment plants the wastewater treatment aims are to ensure that wastewater is safe without traces of pollutants at toxic levels another aim is to recover nutrients energy reclaim water and other valuable resources which are the most vital resource to humans 158 many treatment technologies have been employed to avoid being infected by arg contaminated water the environmentalist has widely used the advanced oxidation process to eliminate arb args from the wwtps advanced oxidation process aops is the new technology that oxidized and degraded various forms of pollutants using highly generated hydroxyl radicals ho as the main oxidative species and other reactive oxidation species 159 it is an alternative material that can transform decontaminate antibiotic residues from wastewater oxidative decontamination includes ultraviolet uv fenton ozone photocatalyst ultrasound based sonolysis and electrochemical process have been employed for arb args removal these treatment processes have some challenges and restrictions some of the oxidation processes have valuable properties that can kill bacteria dna and reduce arb proliferation in the wastewater treatment plant s final effluent as shown in table 2 still they may not remove a considerable amount of args after the treatment process 160 the extent of removal depends on the efficacy of the treatment method materials adopted the adsorbent s surface charge the type of wastewater involved time and the amount of chemical used 7 studies have shown different removal strategies 24 169 171 with their shortcomings such as high maintenance cost enrichment reactivation of args and low removal capacity some of these treatment materials are as follows 4 1 photocatalyst photocatalysts are the artificial green sustainable materials used to solve energy and environmental issues including wastewater treatment 26 160 it is an advanced oxidation process aops and an improved technology suitable for removing contaminants from wastewater these treatment materials aim at the natural self purification of water using solar light initiated by the transition complex metal 172 it can also conveniently be applied in water wastewater for the degradation of pollutants 173 numerous studies have shown the effects of photocatalysts on removing arb args from the effluents of wwtps and drinking water 160 169 the photocatalytic materials with uv light inactivate a wide range of pathogens viruses and protozoa from water wastewater it has a potential valence band hole and conduction band electron for dissimilar semiconductors ranging from 4 0 to 1 5 v 174 175 the photocatalytic disinfection materials can be classified into two depending on the nature of the occurrence of targeted pollutants and they are 1 homogenous and 2 heterogeneous catalysts 176 the homogenous photocatalyst depends on the chemical interaction between the reagents and the targeted contaminants in contrast the heterogonous photocatalyst depends on the chemical oxidation process by metal oxidation semiconductors such as tio2 zno and cds immersed in water and irradiated near the uv light λ 385 nm which forms free hydroxyl radicals 175 177 the presence of tio2 photocatalytic irradiation generates a reactive oxygen species ros 160 while cds acts as a visible sensitizer and zno is responsible for charge separation conquering recombination progression furthermore the illumination of tio2 near uv radiation generates an electron hole pair e h charge carrier that can migrate to the surface of semiconductor particles 174 175 it reacts with the hydroxyl group and dissolves oxygen to form a reactive oxygen species ros the ros damages cell membranes dna and rna via oxidative stress 90 the treatment of wastewater with the photocatalyst materials offers some attractive advantages such as tio2 being stable under uv irradiation deficiency of chemical additives in the water low ion inhibition present in water and low cost of tio2 178 tio2 photocatalyst material is biologically and chemically inert insoluble under most conditions photostable and non toxic 179 also it requires low energy ultraviolet light to function well furthermore the simplicity efficiency possibility of using solar light radiation for removal of arb args and using fossil fuel for energy production due to ongoing ozone depletion is a distinct advantage that contributes to the development of water treatment technology the inability to work with a low concentration of these pollutants is the major challenge also cell death depends on the illumination time and concentration of tio2 174 studies have tried to explain the interaction between generated ros and the cell which inactivate arb args from wastewater the early work of dunlop and co on the use of photocatalyst materials on three strains of antibiotic resistant e coli under different reference strains cause a reduction of the viable number of arb from 3log10 to 0 5log10 after 180 min after post treatment incubation for 180 min for both arb 37 c and 24 h a bacteria recovery of 3log10 was observed and at 150 min no e coli survived this suggests that photocatalyst disinfection materials should take a long time to avoid post treatment recovery enhancing the unwanted transfer of args among bacteria 175 the major constraint disadvantage of these materials includes the inability to guarantee their application on a large scale inability to generate a uniform distribution of light to a large surface area difficulty in recovering the adsorbent from treated water it is time consuming it takes a longer time than usual and there will still be an insufficient overall conversion of energy required for treatment even after a prolonged time 4 2 fenton and ozone disinfectants fenton oxidation is the effective process of disinfecting wastewater containing arb args and the degradation of antibiotics this treatment material requires accessible ph and hydroxide ions to function effectively in the treatment processes it involves the manufacturing of hydroxyl radical ho from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 reacting with ferrous ions in an acidic medium 180 fenton oxidation material can be a solar driven fenton photo fenton and a conventional fenton process 171 in fenton reaction the oxidative species ho is produced through the reacting fe2 with h2o2 while in solar driven fenton reaction the fe3 produced from fenton reaction is photo reduced and regenerates fe2 as indicated in eqs 2 4 2 h2o2 fe2 fe3 oh oh 3 fe3 oh ho fe h2o 3 4 fe h2o 3 hv fe2 h oh the free hydroxyl radical ho produced during the reaction has a strong oxidation potential for the full range of micropollutants bacteria cells and dna damage 181 the ho radical produced by the decomposition of h2o2 is catalyzed by fe2 k 76 m 1 s 1 and fe2 catalyst regenerates in solar driven fenton at a low rate k 0 01 0 02 m 1 s 1 15 it records high efficiency in the degradation of various types of organic pollutants and the use of solar irradiation to stimulate the hydroxyl formation which results in low cost of application are some of the advantages of the fenton oxidation treatment material 63 182 also fenton disinfection aims to improve secondary effluents quality before reuse or disposal 22 it can regenerate highly reactive radicals and other species which can cause the oxidation of a broad range of organic pollutants 183 the fenton process s efficiency is affected by the concentration of h2o2 fe2 dose catalyst and ph solution 182 183 a recent study investigated arb args fate the conditions affecting the removal efficiency and the oxidative damage pathway involved during the fenton oxidation process fe2 h2o2 181 the authors reported that besides these conditions there is viable behavior observed by the genetic constituent of the microbial community which may result from the treatment materials and oxidative damage mechanisms during the application the fenton solar driven and fenton conventional processes are grouped among the advanced oxidation processes aops which remove recalcitrant organic and bio pollutants however the reduction of arb args with this application is still limited the main limitation of this treatment material is the formation of the oxidative products derived from the dissolved effluent of organic matter which can induce toxic effects during the biological treatment method 180 183 furthermore this treatment method s cost is high due to the massive consumption of reagents which can also introduce the reagents as secondary pollutants into wwtps 157 ozone materials are also among the advanced oxidation process aops of the water treatment process an interest in the application of an ozone based system is a great deal this is because it has demonstrated the effectiveness of numerous micropollutants significant abatement and provides suitable disinfectants to wastewater at different ozone doses and contact times 169 moreover they help induce gram positive and gram negative bacteria such as e coli and e faecalis 184 ozone materials are very active in water treatment because of their stable oxidizing agents the oxidizing agents can react with commonly used antibiotics such as b lactams sulfonamides macrolides quinolones trimethoprim and tetracyclines it can be distorted through direct oxidation during the ozonation of wastewater and can help remove these antibiotic residues from wastewater 185 deactivation of antibiotic bacterial characteristics by breaking their functional group is the primary function of ozone material during the wastewater treatment process 63 the knowledge of the efficiency of ozone materials for removing arb args is limited because most studies focused on the effects of ozone on bacteria population reduction 181 thus the results of the removal efficiency towards args are still unclear however the removal of antibiotics with ozone is effective in wastewater and depends on ozone concentration and contact time during the water treatment process 185 186 ozone is a powerful oxidant used during the wastewater treatment process over the last decades it can react with organic compounds under alkaline ph conditions ozone is not widely used for wastewater disinfection due to the cost of operation maintenance issues of the first step and a high ozone concentration during the treatment process 187 ozone materials have a high potential for the oxidation of various pharmaceutical compounds including antibiotics and inactivation of total pathogens in drinking water and wastewater 188 a study on the treatment methods including ozone for the inactivation of gene copies of sul 1 tet g inti 1 and 16s rdna stated that ozonation reduced 16s rdna still args were not notably inactivated 15 the significant drawbacks of ozone materials are the possibility of generating dangerous by products during partial oxidation of dissolved organic compounds also for adequate disinfection a high concentration of ozone materials is needed ozone gas preparation is not always direct and smooth and there is a need to prepare it on site these reports show that ozone materials are not the best option for targeting bacteria harboring args 4 3 uv disinfectants the uv disinfection process has been applied to wastewater treatment technology over the past few decades the reason that uv irradiation can effectively inactivate bacteria within a short period and does not release toxic disinfection by products 189 190 similarly uv disinfection is popular and promising disinfection material compared to chlorine in the wastewater treatment process it recently demonstrated its effectiveness for removing arb args in wwtps and drinking water 191 uv irradiation has some potentials that distinguish it from other materials used for wastewater treatment such possibilities are being non toxic environmentally friendly also it uses short wavelength uv c light to kill microorganisms by destroying and disrupting nucleic acid and their dna which performs vital cellular functions among organisms uv irradiation promotes oxidative species formation at a wavelength between 315 400 nm uv a leading to oxidative damage on arb args 166 the significant advantage of this treatment material is the ability to accomplish disinfection without using chemicals that may produce hazardous by products in north america uv is commonly used as an alternative to chlorine in wastewater treatment 187 it does not require a contact tank and steps for the neutralization process like in chlorination it produces few by products compared to the use of chlorine as a water disinfection material it involves photoreactivation or dark repair 178 in uv disinfection the reactor is an open channel involving water in contact with the uv light mercury arc discharge lamps with quartz sleeves produce uv light iron and humic matter are used as uv absorbing constituents in wastewater the removal efficiency of arb args in the effluent of sewage has some limitations because of the performance of both chemical and uv disinfection process and shielding target pathogens from the disinfecting agent several studies have investigated the influence of disinfection on arb args and concluded that uv disinfection could remove many arb args from the effluent 15 166 however a report from numerous studies has shown that there are still some traces of arb args in wastewater effluents after the uv disinfection procedure 155 the photoreactivation or dark repair can fix the damaged dna by uv irradiation thus reducing the efficiency and increasing microbial risk i e reactivation promotes the survival of arb after uv disinfection 176 the arb also can gain its conjugative ability after photoreactivation 192 the major drawback of uv irradiation points to the sustainability of uv technology on energy consumption the flimsiness of uv lamp short life span and the use of mercury which is difficult to separate from the effluent before disposal 166 the uv irradiation s inability to generate a specific wavelength could affect the removal efficiency since the inactivation mechanisms of arb args depend on the wavelength 4 4 ultrasound radiation based sonolysis ultrasound irradiation based sonolysis is a new advanced oxidation process for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants it is the process of using ultrasonic waves to disintegrate or decompose pollutants through the acoustic cavitation process acoustic cavitation is the interaction of ultrasound waves at high intensity with dissolved gases in an aqueous solution this interaction involves forming and collapsing the bubbles in an aqueous solution irradiated by intense ultrasound 193 the bubble collapse makes the ultrasound generate hydroxyl radicals that have been proven to be effective in removing pollutants from water 167 194 the liquid s temperature and pressure reach thousands of kelvins and hundreds of atmospheres during the bubble collapse 193 195 the energy from ultrasound induced acoustic cavitation split the oxygen and hydrogen molecules chemical bonds in water forming hydroxyl ho and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 increasing the ultrasonic amplitude results in sonochemical activities during water treatment 193 sonolysis undergoes two irradiation methods during the treatment process they are the pulse and continuous irradiation each method is effective based on the nature of pollutants the major drawbacks of this method are the removal of some selected antibiotic which are hydrophobic in nature incomplete elimination of antibiotics residues increases the risk of arb args proliferation in water also the cost of maintaining a constant temperature with chiller and ethylene glycol is another challenge because ethylene glycol may form dangerous by products and can be difficult to separate from treated water production of high amount of hydroxyl radicals required for effective degradation of arb args may be costly most of the conventional treatment technologies such as filtration biological treatment aerobic membrane bioreactor etc were able to inactivate arb but very ineffective in removing arb args they either enrich or promote the development of resistance mechanisms among bacteria in wwtps for example bergeron et al investigated the presence and removal of arb args with filtration in the raw water source and drinking water the study concluded that filtration could inactivate the detected arb but ineffective in filtering out args from treated drinking water 196 cheng et al reported the 5 5 log removal of arb and 2 67 log removal of args with aerobic membrane bioreactor the high log removal was achieved by high energy consumption rates which produces waste sludge that enrich or enhances the replication of arb args 197 lan et al monitored the removal of arb args in swine wastewater with biological treatment method nanofiltration and reverse osmosis he concluded that the biological treatment method did not reduce the detected args compared to other treatment methods employed in the study 78 all these reports confirmed that aops and conventional treatment methods could not eradicate various kinds of arb args efficiently therefore this review suggested a matured alternative for the complete removal of arb args in wwtps 5 restriction to indiscriminate use of antibiotics antibiotics gained popularity because of their effective action against microbial pathogens and attracted massive attention in the 1950s bbosa et al 198 gave a detailed review of antibiotics as such we will not dwell too much on it in this paper however the use of antibiotics at a large scale in human and animal medicine accelerates the proliferation of resistant bacteria and their genes it even develops multidrug resistant bacteria being the most dangerous 199 the estimated report states that animals and humans global consumption of antibiotics in foods lies between 100 000 200 000 tons per annum in comparison china s use alone is more than 25 000 tons 200 the wrong usage of these antibiotics leads to arb args emergence and weakens therapeutic properties against human and animal pathogens it causes resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics 13 resulting in a prolonged stay in the hospital increased mortality and morbidity rate as well as the drug resistant bacteria developing in the gut of humans and animals 16 201 the consumption of undercooked meats that contain antibiotic residue can facilitate the development of drug resistant bacteria in the human gut at the same time animals developed it from the consumption of feeds that contain antibiotics or antibiotics residue 202 the continuous discharge of both high and low concentrations of antibiotics into wastewater treatment plants from these sources promotes the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment causing severe public health risk 13 203 because of the harmful effect of antibiotics in the environment specifically wastewater access to these drugs in many advanced countries of the world is heavily restricted and restrictions are strongly enforced 9 204 for instance belgium s government established and implemented policies geared towards changing physicians prescription practices family doctors get feedback on the prescription methods the belgium government resorted to public awareness of antibiotic consumption and generated patient education materials using leaflets booklets advertisements on television and radio and websites 205 this effort was reported to have significantly reduced the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in belgium 206 in addition to reducing consumption and indiscriminate use of antibiotics data from hungary finland japan the usa and iceland suggest that national policies on the restriction of access to antibiotics resulted in the drastic reduction of drug resistant bacteria infections 207 208 this scenario cannot be said to be obtainable in africa as in countries where these drugs are restricted enforcement is not active while in others access is unrestricted therefore calls for the adoption of regulations policies and public campaigns among african nations on the appropriate use of antibiotics limit the level of drug resistance bacterial infections in the environment 6 conclusion antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in the wastewater treatment plant is an additional strain on the effluent s quality for reuse because of args increasing presence in the wwtps some of the args commonly detected include sulfonamides tetracycline beta lactam and fluoroquinolones resistance genes they are the leading cause of disease outbreaks in the environment several treatment methods materials used for the removal of these args from wastewater were ineffective this calls for more research in other to improve the removal of args in different water matrices this review highlights the importance and potentials of silver and silica oxide nanoparticles for removing these substances from wastewater going by the unique properties they boast of incorporating metallic nanoparticles is a promising way of eliminating these pollutants from wastewater finally setting up policies to prevent the indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a sure way to avoid these pollutants proliferation in wastewater with

13542,removing micro pollutants is an important global challenge for the development of good adsorbents and environmental engineering issues in this work the structure of hierarchically and interconnected porous polymer has been fabricated by a high internal phase emulsion hipe with water in oil and used for removing boron from water this porous polymer was synthesized via monomer radical polymerization and utilized the active sites of monomer cl in this way the vicinal hydroxyl group of n methyl d glucamine nmg was successfully introduced and grafted into hipe by nucleophilic substitution reaction under the catalysis of triethylamine the maximum boron uptake capacity was 2 54 mmol g at a boron concentration of 100 mg l and reached adsorption equilibrium after about 2 h compared to traditional adsorption membrane materials the hipe porous polymer had better mechanical strength and able to resist acid and alkaline in the long term meanwhile the regeneration efficiency of the hipe30 g pnmg porous polymer remained at 100 after being used for 10 cycles keywords hipe porous polymer polymerization grafting boron removal adsorption 1 introduction boron as a micro nutrient is essential for humans animals and plants it is formed from boric acid and borate salts that are commonly found in the hydrosphere and lithosphere 1 when living organisms take up a small amount of boron it benefits health and improves carbohydrate metabolism sugar transport cell growth and grain formation 2 4 however excessive intake of boron is harmful to an organism for people ingesting high concentrations of boron can cause damage to the central nervous and reproductive systems for plants excess boron intake will lead to a decline in fruit yield leaf damage and adverse effects on root growth for this reason the world health organization who stipulated boron concentration in drinking water must be limited to 2 4 mg l while irrigation water is recommended to be in the 0 3 and 1 mg l range 5 however in some water sources the boron concentration is detected to be well above the who regulation such as seawater at around 5 mg l groundwater in certain areas as high as 100 mg l and even some manufacturing industrial wastewater can be more than 1000 mg l for this reason seeking an efficient boron removal treatment technology is very important there are many technologies for boron removal currently operating including reverse osmosis ro 6 ion exchange chemical sedimentation extraction electrodialysis flocculation adsorption etc 7 13 however these methods of removing boron still need to be refined due to boron having strict ph reaction conditions and high diffusion rate for removing boron via ro technology it is usually difficult to completely removal this substance in a single pass ro due to the boron nonionic boric acid existing in the form of natural ph and hydrogen bonding diffusion 6 14 the adsorption process is highly efficient in its removal simple operation remarkable regeneration performance etc so it is deemed to be one of the most effective technologies to removal boron selecting the appropriate adsorbents may help this process be very succesful chelation reaction is a more effective method for removing boron as it has been employed for the construction of complexing ligand of adjacent hydroxyl groups these function to chelate with boric acid and thereby achieve the objective of adsorption traditional adsorption resin has a granular porous structure the diffusion adsorption process can be divided into two stages internal diffusion and external diffusion generally the main influential factor of the adsorption rate is the internal diffusion process which is due to the mass transfer thus how to improve specific surface area increase adsorption sites and enhance the adsorption rate is a challenge in industrial applications membrane technology is widely used in water treatment and desalination the boric acid molecule is an uncharged protonic acid retaining a strong affinity so it can form hydrogen bonds with the membrane it can diffuse easily through the membrane because boric acid has a small molecular size and nonionic nature meanwhile the ph of boron solution influences the membrane treatment process to removal boron efficiently this being due to the boric acid dissociation and existence in the form of a solution at different ph ranges in our previous analyses 15 17 we synthesized a series of adsorption membranes such as complexing membrane and mixed matrix membrane for boron removal the outcome was excellent boron adsorption capacity however in the process of regeneration repeated adsorption and desorption in acid alkali solution for a long period of time leads to firstly a decline in the mechanical properties secondly destruction of the microstructure of the membrane and thirdly membrane properties not able to remove boron hipe is an effective way to obtain the hierarchical porous polymer foam through radical polymerization with water in oil 18 20 the internal phase of hipe has a total volume fraction amounting to more than 74 and the external phase is formed through the polymerization of monomers the spherical voids structures are able to increase transport efficiency as well the interconnecting holes of hipe facilitate the solute of internal phase movement adsorption and removal the hipe porous polymer has a high specific surface area and obtains to structure with various porous characteristics by controlling polymerization conditions for example these include locus of initiation polymerization process mechanism and the cross linking level of polymerization hipe has been applied in various fields including adsorption filtration ion capture controlled release etc 21 25 in this work we focused on boron adsorption by employing a matrix of styrene divinylbenzebe hipe porous polymer to obtain a vicinal hydroxyl group hipe porous polymer using the complex ligand to chelate boric acid we introduced the p ethylene benzyl chloride as reaction group of hipe it can utilize the many active sites of benzyl chloride to react the nucleophilic substitution with n methyl d glucamine nmg a massive hierarchical porous structure in hipe is expected to improve the boron convective transport rate the hipe porous polymer was also investigated and discussed in detail with reference to adsorption isotherm and kinetics 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials styrene st was purchased from tianjin fuchen chemical reagent factory china divinyl benzene dvb was obtained from beijing j k scientific ltd china the boric acid was purchased from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd the other key experimental materials included p vinylbenzyl chloride vbc triethylamine span80 26 k2s2o8 cacl2 nmg azobisisobutyronitrile aibn curcumine oxalic acid while 95 ethyl alcohol was purchased from tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd china di water was produced by millipore milli q advantage a10 billeerica ma usa all chemical reagents chosen were of analytical grade 2 2 hipe porous polymer preparation firstly the hipe was prepared through the process of radical polymerization the continuous phase volume ratios of st dvb vbc were respectively 8 1 1 7 1 2 and 6 1 3 the 20 vol span 80 as the emulgator and 0 192 g aibn as the initiator were added into the three flasks and stirred vigorously until they were completely dissolved meanwhile we continued to inject n2 in order to remove the dissolved oxygen for 15 min then 0 0005 g k2s2o8 and 0 0024 g cacl2 were dissolved in 24 ml dispersion phase di water subsequently the solution was added into a three necked flask drop by drop and stirred gently following this the hipe porous foam was prepared by mixing the water and oil then stirred rapidly via magnetic stirring at 1200 rpm min at room temperature with nitrogen protection subsequently the emulsion was transferred to beginning the polymerization reaction under 70 c for 16 h this polymerization reaction was carried out under conditions of sealing with a balloon after being filled with nitrogen for 15 min the soxhlet extractor served to purge the hipe porous polymer in order to remove the residual monomer 2 3 one pot synthesis of the glycopolymer hipe g pnmg in our previous work 4 the adsorbent material was synthesized via atrp reaction in an effort to introduce vicinal hydroxyl groups to the process of boron removal the atrp needs to be rigidly controlled and it has multiple reaction steps in this research we introduced the glycopolymer using the simple one step method which employed the triethylamine as a catalyst to obtain the adsorbent the major phase of the experiment was adding in sequence the water 15 ml acetone 15 ml triethylamine 10 ml and nmg 0 5 g into the three necked flask the mixture was then stirred continuously for 60 c over 16 h the specimen used a soxhlet extractor for purging for 2 h with di water and dried in a freeze dryer the obtained hipe was respectively represented as hipe10 g pnmg hipe20 g pnmg and hipe30 g pnmg according to the vbc content the synthesis reaction route of the hipe porous polymer and complexation mechanism are illustrated in fig 1 below the nmg of hipe grafting yield value was calculated using the initial and final masses according to the following eq 1 1 gr w 1 w 0 w 0 where w1 mg and w0 mg were respectively the hipe g pnmg and hipe weight 2 4 hipe porous polymer surface characterization the fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir verified the hipe porous polymer surface chemical composition bruker vector 22 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps performed the hipe kratos axis ultra surface morphology of the hipe porous polymer was obtained via scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 japan the hipe porous polymer tensile properties according to iso 1184 1983 standard were recorded by a snas electronic universal testing machine mts china n2 adsorption desorption measurements were performed at 77 k quantachrome asiq usa 2 5 hipe porous polymer boron removal experiments for the static boron adsorption experiment the hipe porous polymer specimen was weighed after pre drying and transferred into a conical flask with high density polyethylene hdpe in this paper the adsorbent of porous polymer weight was controlled at 0 01 g this flask contained 50 ml of various concentrations of boric acid solution and controlled ph in the cell then the conical flask was sealed and constantly shaken at 30 c for 2 h the curcumine method with spectrophotometer served to analyze the boron concentration at the wavelength λ 540 nm 27 research into the kinetic adsorption was done by predetermined time intervals to withdraw the boron solution at various boron concentrations the boron uptake capacity q was calculated according to eq 2 below 2 q c 0 c e v m m where c0 mg l is the initial boron concentration ce mg l is the equilibrium boron concentration v l is the volume solution m g is the weight of dry hipe or hipe g nmg porous polymer and m is the boron acid mole weight g mol 2 6 regeneration of the porous polymer the acid leaching method helped to research the regenerability of the hipe porous polymer the saturated hipe was soaked and stirred into the hcl solution with 0 1 mol l for 0 5 h then the porous polymer was flushed by di water and immediately transferred into the naoh solution with 0 1 mol l for 0 5 h the porous polymer used a large amount of di water that was subjected to rinsing until neutralized and obtained the regenerated porous polymer hipe the hipe regeneration efficiency re was calculated according to eq 3 3 re q 2 q 1 100 where the q1 mmol g is the boron uptake capacity of the first adsorption capacity and q2 mmol g is the boron uptake capacity of the cycle used 3 results and discussion 3 1 hipe surface compositions fig 2 depicts the ftir results for the hipe porous polymer surface composition with various amounts of vbc evident are the characteristic features of the ccl stretching vibration peak at 710 cm 1 it was clearly seen that the peak intensity of ccl increased significantly when an increase in vbc content in the hipe also occurred meanwhile it indicated there were more active sites on the cl compared with unmodified hipe the hipe g pnmg spectra at 3400 cm 1 is pristine with reference to the oh groups emission peak stretching vibration which is attributed to the vicinal hydroxyl groups of the nmg terminal chain the intensity of the oh peak rose when the vbc content also increased in addition the benzene ring skeletal cc stretching vibration was revealed at 1460 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 the hipe polymer cc stretching vibration s moderate intensity peak was evident at 1640 cm 1 the nmg secondary amine of cn stretching vibration appeared at 1310 cm 1 the hipe micro construction was further investigated using xps the hipe unmodified and modified surfaces wide scans and c1s core level spectra are illustrated in fig 3 before hipe was modified it revealed the cl2p emission peaks at 199 8 ev and 285 1 ev emission peaks assigned to c1s fig 3a and b it was observed that the cl2p peak intensity clearly increased with vbc content the c1s core level spectra confirmed that the cl content further increased at 286 7 ev fig 3a and b the modified hipe porous polymer emission peaks appeared at 197 2 ev 400 9 ev and 532 1 ev at the wide spectra which was attributed to cl2p n1s and o1s respectively fig 3c and d the new spectra indicated that the nmg group was successfully grafted into the hipe in addition the pristine hipe g pnmg c1s emission peaks at 285 4 ev and 287 2 ev were attributed to co and cn spectra when comparing fig 3a and b the spectrum intensity of ccl obviously decreased and the spectra of cn and co then emerged this was explained by the glycopolymer being introduced into the hipe instead of the chloride group via the reaction process it is worth noting here that the spectra intensity of cn and co in fig 3d was stronger than in the spectrum shown in fig 3c it was due to hipe30 g pnmg having more cl from vbc group and this made it possible to obtain vicinal hydroxyl groups with secondary amine derived from the nmg reaction the corresponding hipe porous polymer element composition is shown in table 1 we can clearly see that the oxygen element content and ratio of o cl dramatically increased what was also verified was that many vicinal hydroxyl groups were introduced into the hipe porous polymer these results demonstrated that we successfully grafted the nmg and introduced the glycopolymer into the hipe porous polymer 3 2 surface morphology of hipe fig 4 shows the hipe porous polymer exhibiting a clearly visible interconnected porous structure the windows of hipe were formed via continuous phase polymerization reaction and the voids were produced by the droplets triggered by dispersion phase evaporation it emerged that when the vbc content of hipe amounted to 10 the voids of the porous polymer were small and hipe had a distinct hole of the wall with the increase in vbc content the voids structure visible appeared to be an anomaly which is especially the case for the vbc content at 30 it clearly indicated that the voids diameter increased significantly as shown in the ostwald ripening process 28 30 after the nmg was grafted onto the hipe the sem revealed a thin skin polymer layer on the surface of the porous hipe however the microstructure of hipe g pnmg and especially the void indicated no apparent visible change this outcome confirmed that the void sizes were tunable by altering the vbc content 3 3 grafting density and physical property of hipe g pnmg fig 5 a reveals the increase of vbc content led to the grafting yield ratio gradually increasing and this was due to the increase in the group of cl making the introduction of vicinal hydroxyl groups possible establishing the hipe g pnmg mechanical strength was done through the tension test and results are shown in fig 5b it was discovered that the vbc content increased when the st content also rose it presented the pore crush that was due to the decline in mechanical strength of the hipe porous polymer which led to brittle fractures occurring easily this is explained by the st content decline leading to a fall in the molecular weight of the hipe porous polymer and reduced the crystal molecular chain entanglement 31 32 in addition the hipe porous polymer specific surface area was determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms measurement and the result was shown in fig 5c the results indicated that the hipe30 g pnmg has an open cell structure with bet surface area of 21 92 m2 g the visible hysteresis loop was conforming to a type iv isotherms 33 pore size distribution of hipe30 g pnmg was calculated using the bjh method the results revealed the hipe g pnmg has a complex porous structure mainly including mesopores and macropores 34 during the experiment we tried to add more vbc to improve the grafting rate and introduced vicinal hydroxyl groups but the mechanical strength and pore size observed from sem of hipe g pnmg fell persistently therefore the amount of vbc added in the hipe was controlled within 30 to balance the mechanical strength and quantity of hipe active sites 3 4 initial boron concentration effect and adsorption isotherm the standard curve was used to investigate accurately the boron adsorption performance it obtained the regression equation y 3 200x 0 080 and the linearly dependent coefficient r2 was 0 999 fig 6 a shows the hipe30 g pnmg boron uptake capacity with the influence wielded by the initial boron concentration the initial concentrations of boron solution prepared were 4 97 mg l 18 33 mg l 48 60 mg l 99 72 mg l 194 79 mg l and 277 36 mg l respectively these suggested that the initial boron concentration increase led to the boron sorption capacity also increasing the maximum boron adsorption capacity was recorded as being 2 54 mmol g and revealed adsorption plateau when the boron concentration of the solution was more than 100 mg l it is worth noting that boron adsorption capacity was calculated via the whole hipe hierarchical porous polymer rather than the grafting layer during the process of adsorption the interconnected porous structures of hipe helped to form a percolating network and increased the adsorption capacity via the active sites of grafted the vicinal hydroxyl groups the hipe porous polymer s adsorption isotherm was investigated to analyze the boron adsorption mechanism fig 6b depicts the adsorption isotherms of the hipe30 g pnmg porous polymer experimental results were analyzed by utilizing the three models including langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich the langmuir followed eq 4 as written here 4 q e q q m a x b c e q 1 b c e q where qeq is the adsorption equilibrium capacity mmol g ceq is the equilibrium concentration mg l qmax is the maximum boron adsorption capacity of saturation mmol g and b is the sorption coefficient l mg the freundlich model was obtained using eq 5 5 q e q k f c e q 1 n where kf is a constant mmol g and 1 n represents the intensity constant the dubinin radushkevich model has the form of eq 6 6 q e q x m e k ε 2 where ε is polanyi potential according to the equal to rtln 1 1 ceq the ceq is the equilibrium boron concentration mol l xm is the adsorption capacity mmol g k is the adsorption energy constant mol2 kj2 t is the temperature k in this paper the ambient temperature is 298 15 k and r is the gas constant kj k mol table 2 below shows the fitted curve results and isotherm correlation parameters we found that the langmuir isotherm adsorption model was better at describing the hipe30 g pnmg sorption isotherm process it indicated that the surface of the porous polymer had a homogeneous monolayer which demonstrated two things firstly the constant adsorption energy and secondly the adsorption process occurred as a reaction of chemical complexation between the adsorption sites of the vicinal hydroxyl group onto the hipe and boric acid 3 5 adsorption kinetics the hipe30 g pnmg porous polymer adsorption kinetic was investigated at three boric acid solution concentrations of 5 mg l 50 mg l and 100 mg l fig 7 a shows the results of adsorption kinetics it means that the boron adsorption significantly increased as time passed during the incipient stage subsequently the adsorption equilibrium plateau appeared at about 120 min the kinetic equation of lagergren pseudo first order pfo 7 pseudo second order pso 8 and intraparticle diffusion 9 were analyzed so that the process of kinetic sorption could be understood pfo model eq 7 7 q t q e 1 1 e k 1 t pso model eq 8 8 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t intraparticle diffusion model eq 9 9 q t k p t 1 2 where qt is the t time boron intake qe is the adsorption equilibrium capacity k1 k2 and kp are respectively the rate constant for pfo pso and intraparticle diffusion min 1 the kinetic model fitted curve and detailed parameters are shown in fig 7 and table 3 it emerged that the hipe30 g pnmg porous polymer obeyed the kinetic behavior of the pso model which has a higher r2 value and the experiment data was observed as being close to the theoretical value it is suggested here that the limiting step was the bulk diffusion along with the spontaneous chemisorption process 3 6 effect of ph and regeneration test boric acid h3bo3 is a weak acid mainly formed from boron solution and shows a pka value of 9 25 when the ph 9 the b oh 4 occupies the dominate species while conversely the h3bo3 is the dominant form presented at ph 9 thus the porous polymer complexation process depended on ph sensitivity the ph effect on boron adsorption capacity with boron solution concentration 100 mg l is shown in fig 8 it revealed the obvious change in regard to the sorption data and this was similar to our previous study 15 in an alkaline condition there has a mass of oh ion to defend the grafting vicinal hydroxyl group from the hipe30 g pnmg and there was competition to form b oh 4 in an acidic environment the existence of a larger number of h ions promoted the process of desorption the maximum adsorption was 2 54 mmol g when ph 9 and it very was close to the boric acid s pka value assessing the regeneration performance is very important to establish the application and economic viability of the hipe porous polymer the hipe30 g pnmg reuse capacity was tested through the elution process of acid and alkali treatment and the regeneration cycle results for the evolution of the boron uptake capacity are shown in fig 8b it can be seen that the hipe30 g pnmg porous polymer has excellent recyclability and virtually completely maintained steady regeneration efficiency after 10 cycles compared with our previous analysis of organic membrane materials the hipe polymer of st and dvb matrix polymer performs outstandingly well in terms of resisting acid and alkaline conditions we further found that the mechanical strength value of hipe30 g pnmg remained at 0 73 mpa so it was almost unchanged after 10 cycles consequently the hipe porous polymer as an adsorbent has great potential for removing boron 4 conclusions hipe porous polymer was synthesized using monomer radical polymerization and the nmg was successfully grafted onto the hipe this made it possible to introduce the vicinal hydroxyl group by nucleophilic substitution reaction under the catalysis of triethylamine the obtained hipe g pnmg revealed voids sizes in the porous polymer were tunable according to different amounts of different vbc it was verified that adding more vbc reduced the mechanical strength of hipe g pnmg the hipe hierarchical porous structure facile made it possible to transport and adsorb the boron from the solution finally the hipe porous polymer demonstrates a great deal of potential in industrial applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

discussed in detail with reference to adsorption isotherm and kinetics 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials styrene st was purchased from tianjin fuchen chemical reagent factory china divinyl benzene dvb was obtained from beijing j k scientific ltd china the boric acid was purchased from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd the other key experimental materials included p vinylbenzyl chloride vbc triethylamine span80 26 k2s2o8 cacl2 nmg azobisisobutyronitrile aibn curcumine oxalic acid while 95 ethyl alcohol was purchased from tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd china di water was produced by millipore milli q advantage a10 billeerica ma usa all chemical reagents chosen were of analytical grade 2 2 hipe porous polymer preparation firstly the hipe was prepared through the process of radical polymerization the continuous phase volume ratios of st dvb vbc were respectively 8 1 1 7 1 2 and 6 1 3 the 20 vol span 80 as the emulgator and 0 192 g aibn as the initiator were added into the three flasks and stirred vigorously until they were completely dissolved meanwhile we continued to inject n2 in order to remove the dissolved oxygen for 15 min then 0 0005 g k2s2o8 and 0 0024 g cacl2 were dissolved in 24 ml dispersion phase di water subsequently the solution was added into a three necked flask drop by drop and stirred gently following this the hipe porous foam was prepared by mixing the water and oil then stirred rapidly via magnetic stirring at 1200 rpm min at room temperature with nitrogen protection subsequently the emulsion was transferred to beginning the polymerization reaction under 70 c for 16 h this polymerization reaction was carried out under conditions of sealing with a balloon after being filled with nitrogen for 15 min the soxhlet extractor served to purge the hipe porous polymer in order to remove the residual monomer 2 3 one pot synthesis of the glycopolymer hipe g pnmg in our previous work 4 the adsorbent material was synthesized via atrp reaction in an effort to introduce vicinal hydroxyl groups to the process of boron removal the atrp needs to be rigidly controlled and it has multiple reaction steps in this research we introduced the glycopolymer using the simple one step method which employed the triethylamine as a catalyst to obtain the adsorbent the major phase of the experiment was adding in sequence the water 15 ml acetone 15 ml triethylamine 10 ml and nmg 0 5 g into the three necked flask the mixture was then stirred continuously for 60 c over 16 h the specimen used a soxhlet extractor for purging for 2 h with di water and dried in a freeze dryer the obtained hipe was respectively represented as hipe10 g pnmg hipe20 g pnmg and hipe30 g pnmg according to the vbc content the synthesis reaction route of the hipe porous polymer and complexation mechanism are illustrated in fig 1 below the nmg of hipe grafting yield value was calculated using the initial and final masses according to the following eq 1 1 gr w 1 w 0 w 0 where w1 mg and w0 mg were respectively the hipe g pnmg and hipe weight 2 4 hipe porous polymer surface characterization the fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir verified the hipe porous polymer surface chemical composition bruker vector 22 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps performed the hipe kratos axis ultra surface morphology of the hipe porous polymer was obtained via scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 japan the hipe porous polymer tensile properties according to iso 1184 1983 standard were recorded by a snas electronic universal testing machine mts china n2 adsorption desorption measurements were performed at 77 k quantachrome asiq usa 2 5 hipe porous polymer boron removal experiments for the static boron adsorption experiment the hipe porous polymer specimen was weighed after pre drying and transferred into a conical flask with high density polyethylene hdpe in this paper the adsorbent of porous polymer weight was controlled at 0 01 g this flask contained 50 ml of various concentrations of boric acid solution and controlled ph in the cell then the conical flask was sealed and constantly shaken at 30 c for 2 h the curcumine method with spectrophotometer served to analyze the boron concentration at the wavelength λ 540 nm 27 research into the kinetic adsorption was done by predetermined time intervals to withdraw the boron solution at various boron concentrations the boron uptake capacity q was calculated according to eq 2 below 2 q c 0 c e v m m where c0 mg l is the initial boron concentration ce mg l is the equilibrium boron concentration v l is the volume solution m g is the weight of dry hipe or hipe g nmg porous polymer and m is the boron acid mole weight g mol 2 6 regeneration of the porous polymer the acid leaching method helped to research the regenerability of the hipe porous polymer the saturated hipe was soaked and stirred into the hcl solution with 0 1 mol l for 0 5 h then the porous polymer was flushed by di water and immediately transferred into the naoh solution with 0 1 mol l for 0 5 h the porous polymer used a large amount of di water that was subjected to rinsing until neutralized and obtained the regenerated porous polymer hipe the hipe regeneration efficiency re was calculated according to eq 3 3 re q 2 q 1 100 where the q1 mmol g is the boron uptake capacity of the first adsorption capacity and q2 mmol g is the boron uptake capacity of the cycle used 3 results and discussion 3 1 hipe surface compositions fig 2 depicts the ftir results for the hipe porous polymer surface composition with various amounts of vbc evident are the characteristic features of the ccl stretching vibration peak at 710 cm 1 it was clearly seen that the peak intensity of ccl increased significantly when an increase in vbc content in the hipe also occurred meanwhile it indicated there were more active sites on the cl compared with unmodified hipe the hipe g pnmg spectra at 3400 cm 1 is pristine with reference to the oh groups emission peak stretching vibration which is attributed to the vicinal hydroxyl groups of the nmg terminal chain the intensity of the oh peak rose when the vbc content also increased in addition the benzene ring skeletal cc stretching vibration was revealed at 1460 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 the hipe polymer cc stretching vibration s moderate intensity peak was evident at 1640 cm 1 the nmg secondary amine of cn stretching vibration appeared at 1310 cm 1 the hipe micro construction was further investigated using xps the hipe unmodified and modified surfaces wide scans and c1s core level spectra are illustrated in fig 3 before hipe was modified it revealed the cl2p emission peaks at 199 8 ev and 285 1 ev emission peaks assigned to c1s fig 3a and b it was observed that the cl2p peak intensity clearly increased with vbc content the c1s core level spectra confirmed that the cl content further increased at 286 7 ev fig 3a and b the modified hipe porous polymer emission peaks appeared at 197 2 ev 400 9 ev and 532 1 ev at the wide spectra which was attributed to cl2p n1s and o1s respectively fig 3c and d the new spectra indicated that the nmg group was successfully grafted into the hipe in addition the pristine hipe g pnmg c1s emission peaks at 285 4 ev and 287 2 ev were attributed to co and cn spectra when comparing fig 3a and b the spectrum intensity of ccl obviously decreased and the spectra of cn and co then emerged this was explained by the glycopolymer being introduced into the hipe instead of the chloride group via the reaction process it is worth noting here that the spectra intensity of cn and co in fig 3d was stronger than in the spectrum shown in fig 3c it was due to hipe30 g pnmg having more cl from vbc group and this made it possible to obtain vicinal hydroxyl groups with secondary amine derived from the nmg reaction the corresponding hipe porous polymer element composition is shown in table 1 we can clearly see that the oxygen element content and ratio of o cl dramatically increased what was also verified was that many vicinal hydroxyl groups were introduced into the hipe porous polymer these results demonstrated that we successfully grafted the nmg and introduced the glycopolymer into the hipe porous polymer 3 2 surface morphology of hipe fig 4 shows the hipe porous polymer exhibiting a clearly visible interconnected porous structure the windows of hipe were formed via continuous phase polymerization reaction and the voids were produced by the droplets triggered by dispersion phase evaporation it emerged that when the vbc content of hipe amounted to 10 the voids of the porous polymer were small and hipe had a distinct hole of the wall with the increase in vbc content the voids structure visible appeared to be an anomaly which is especially the case for the vbc content at 30 it clearly indicated that the voids diameter increased significantly as shown in the ostwald ripening process 28 30 after the nmg was grafted onto the hipe the sem revealed a thin skin polymer layer on the surface of the porous hipe however the microstructure of hipe g pnmg and especially the void indicated no apparent visible change this outcome confirmed that the void sizes were tunable by altering the vbc content 3 3 grafting density and physical property of hipe g pnmg fig 5 a reveals the increase of vbc content led to the grafting yield ratio gradually increasing and this was due to the increase in the group of cl making the introduction of vicinal hydroxyl groups possible establishing the hipe g pnmg mechanical strength was done through the tension test and results are shown in fig 5b it was discovered that the vbc content increased when the st content also rose it presented the pore crush that was due to the decline in mechanical strength of the hipe porous polymer which led to brittle fractures occurring easily this is explained by the st content decline leading to a fall in the molecular weight of the hipe porous polymer and reduced the crystal molecular chain entanglement 31 32 in addition the hipe porous polymer specific surface area was determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms measurement and the result was shown in fig 5c the results indicated that the hipe30 g pnmg has an open cell structure with bet surface area of 21 92 m2 g the visible hysteresis loop was conforming to a type iv isotherms 33 pore size distribution of hipe30 g pnmg was calculated using the bjh method the results revealed the hipe g pnmg has a complex porous structure mainly including mesopores and macropores 34 during the experiment we tried to add more vbc to improve the grafting rate and introduced vicinal hydroxyl groups but the mechanical strength and pore size observed from sem of hipe g pnmg fell persistently therefore the amount of vbc added in the hipe was controlled within 30 to balance the mechanical strength and quantity of hipe active sites 3 4 initial boron concentration effect and adsorption isotherm the standard curve was used to investigate accurately the boron adsorption performance it obtained the regression equation y 3 200x 0 080 and the linearly dependent coefficient r2 was 0 999 fig 6 a shows the hipe30 g pnmg boron uptake capacity with the influence wielded by the initial boron concentration the initial concentrations of boron solution prepared were 4 97 mg l 18 33 mg l 48 60 mg l 99 72 mg l 194 79 mg l and 277 36 mg l respectively these suggested that the initial boron concentration increase led to the boron sorption capacity also increasing the maximum boron adsorption capacity was recorded as being 2 54 mmol g and revealed adsorption plateau when the boron concentration of the solution was more than 100 mg l it is worth noting that boron adsorption capacity was calculated via the whole hipe hierarchical porous polymer rather than the grafting layer during the process of adsorption the interconnected porous structures of hipe helped to form a percolating network and increased the adsorption capacity via the active sites of grafted the vicinal hydroxyl groups the hipe porous polymer s adsorption isotherm was investigated to analyze the boron adsorption mechanism fig 6b depicts the adsorption isotherms of the hipe30 g pnmg porous polymer experimental results were analyzed by utilizing the three models including langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich the langmuir followed eq 4 as written here 4 q e q q m a x b c e q 1 b c e q where qeq is the adsorption equilibrium capacity mmol g ceq is the equilibrium concentration mg l qmax is the maximum boron adsorption capacity of saturation mmol g and b is the sorption coefficient l mg the freundlich model was obtained using eq 5 5 q e q k f c e q 1 n where kf is a constant mmol g and 1 n represents the intensity constant the dubinin radushkevich model has the form of eq 6 6 q e q x m e k ε 2 where ε is polanyi potential according to the equal to rtln 1 1 ceq the ceq is the equilibrium boron concentration mol l xm is the adsorption capacity mmol g k is the adsorption energy constant mol2 kj2 t is the temperature k in this paper the ambient temperature is 298 15 k and r is the gas constant kj k mol table 2 below shows the fitted curve results and isotherm correlation parameters we found that the langmuir isotherm adsorption model was better at describing the hipe30 g pnmg sorption isotherm process it indicated that the surface of the porous polymer had a homogeneous monolayer which demonstrated two things firstly the constant adsorption energy and secondly the adsorption process occurred as a reaction of chemical complexation between the adsorption sites of the vicinal hydroxyl group onto the hipe and boric acid 3 5 adsorption kinetics the hipe30 g pnmg porous polymer adsorption kinetic was investigated at three boric acid solution concentrations of 5 mg l 50 mg l and 100 mg l fig 7 a shows the results of adsorption kinetics it means that the boron adsorption significantly increased as time passed during the incipient stage subsequently the adsorption equilibrium plateau appeared at about 120 min the kinetic equation of lagergren pseudo first order pfo 7 pseudo second order pso 8 and intraparticle diffusion 9 were analyzed so that the process of kinetic sorption could be understood pfo model eq 7 7 q t q e 1 1 e k 1 t pso model eq 8 8 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t intraparticle diffusion model eq 9 9 q t k p t 1 2 where qt is the t time boron intake qe is the adsorption equilibrium capacity k1 k2 and kp are respectively the rate constant for pfo pso and intraparticle diffusion min 1 the kinetic model fitted curve and detailed parameters are shown in fig 7 and table 3 it emerged that the hipe30 g pnmg porous polymer obeyed the kinetic behavior of the pso model which has a higher r2 value and the experiment data was observed as being close to the theoretical value it is suggested here that the limiting step was the bulk diffusion along with the spontaneous chemisorption process 3 6 effect of ph and regeneration test boric acid h3bo3 is a weak acid mainly formed from boron solution and shows a pka value of 9 25 when the ph 9 the b oh 4 occupies the dominate species while conversely the h3bo3 is the dominant form presented at ph 9 thus the porous polymer complexation process depended on ph sensitivity the ph effect on boron adsorption capacity with boron solution concentration 100 mg l is shown in fig 8 it revealed the obvious change in regard to the sorption data and this was similar to our previous study 15 in an alkaline condition there has a mass of oh ion to defend the grafting vicinal hydroxyl group from the hipe30 g pnmg and there was competition to form b oh 4 in an acidic environment the existence of a larger number of h ions promoted the process of desorption the maximum adsorption was 2 54 mmol g when ph 9 and it very was close to the boric acid s pka value assessing the regeneration performance is very important to establish the application and economic viability of the hipe porous polymer the hipe30 g pnmg reuse capacity was tested through the elution process of acid and alkali treatment and the regeneration cycle results for the evolution of the boron uptake capacity are shown in fig 8b it can be seen that the hipe30 g pnmg porous polymer has excellent recyclability and virtually completely maintained steady regeneration efficiency after 10 cycles compared with our previous analysis of organic membrane materials the hipe polymer of st and dvb matrix polymer performs outstandingly well in terms of resisting acid and alkaline conditions we further found that the mechanical strength value of hipe30 g pnmg remained at 0 73 mpa so it was almost unchanged after 10 cycles consequently the hipe porous polymer as an adsorbent has great potential for removing boron 4 conclusions hipe porous polymer was synthesized using monomer radical polymerization and the nmg was successfully grafted onto the hipe this made it possible to introduce the vicinal hydroxyl group by nucleophilic substitution reaction under the catalysis of triethylamine the obtained hipe g pnmg revealed voids sizes in the porous polymer were tunable according to different amounts of different vbc it was verified that adding more vbc reduced the mechanical strength of hipe g pnmg the hipe hierarchical porous structure facile made it possible to transport and adsorb the boron from the solution finally the hipe porous polymer demonstrates a great deal of potential in industrial applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

13543,in view of water resource depletion treated wastewater can serve as an alternative source for crop irrigation however conventional wastewater treatment plants are energy intensive and costly to construct and operate especially for lower middle income countries the present study focused on improving the quality of wastewater by incorporating a coupled microalgal bacterial biofilm cmbb treatment in wastewater ponds standard polyether sponges were dipped in raw wastewater samples to enhance biofilm development on them the enriched sponges were used to treat wastewater with or without external energy for aeration wastewater parameters were analyzed during the enrichment and treatment processes the cmbb technology and aeration resulted in similar improvement of effluent quality but the former saved on energy costs and reduced total chemical oxygen demand cod by 36 within 24 h and 71 within 4 days the values of biochemical oxygen demand bod ammonium and phosphates decreased by 80 64 and 95 respectively within 7 days the resultant cod and bod values were below the maximum allowed for reuse and discharge keywords wastewater treatment microalgal bacterial biofilm sponge rural area 1 introduction an estimated 1 1 billion people worldwide lack access to water 2 4 billion people do not have adequate sanitation and 2 million people die every year from diarrheal diseases 1 use of water in our homes and industry produces wastewater and with the increases in population and living standards the need to find affordable wastewater treatment solutions is becoming more pressing eighty percent of the wastewater produced worldwide is discharged into surface water sources without adequate treatment 2 high income countries treat about 70 of their wastewater upper middle income countries about 38 and the rate drops to 28 for lower middle income countries 3 the asia pacific region releases 80 90 of their wastewater untreated 4 thereby polluting water sources properly treated wastewater can become a solution rather than a problem by serving as a source of water and energy conventional wastewater treatments applied in high income countries are energy demanding 5 for example reaching 1 4 of the total energy production in united states 6 the major portion of the electricity goes to pumping an adequate volume of oxygen during the biological treatment 5 centralized wastewater treatment facilities collect treat and discharge large quantities of wastewater for large communities at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and provide high quality effluent with values according to standards stipulated by the regulatory agencies however they cannot be adapted to low and lower middle income countries frequently with sewerage only at the main cities but due to the high maintenance cost fewer treatment plants work effectively 7 decentralized systems collect treat and reuse dispose treated wastewater at or near the generation point especially for scattered low density populated rural areas however small cities and villages often do not have the resources and knowledge base to build operate manage and maintain proper decentralized solutions that require also suitable planning and policy india is a lower middle income country that treats only 37 of its domestic wastewater in urban areas at a secondary level 7 in rural areas this number is even lower and the wastewater is discharged without any treatment into the village ponds or rivers polluting the water sources used for drinking and agricultural irrigation the primary income source of about 58 of india s population is agriculture 8 mainly focusing on the wheat paddy cycle which requires a huge amount of water in the dry season when water is scarce the use of raw untreated wastewater or poor quality water in agriculture is very common resulting in deterioration of the soil and carrying health risks 9 due to water scarcity the wastewater must be treated to disrupt the cycle of pollution especially in rural areas waste stabilization ponds can provide a low cost and low maintenance technology to treat the local villages wastewater enabling safer reuse of this water for irrigation however the treated wastewater or effluent has to reach quality standards for safe irrigation microalgal bacterial consortia can improve wastewater treatment 10 11 providing a self sustaining oxygen supply efficient nutrient removal and low maintenance requirements 11 13 su et al 14 used the synergistic relationship between microalgae and activated sludge to improve wastewater treatment with a 5 1 ratio of algae to sludge achieving 91 and 93 5 reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus respectively another study used a xenic culture broth to improve flocculation of chlorella vulgaris and demonstrated that microalgae associated bacteria improved microalgal flocculation by increasing the floc size which lead to higher sedimentation improving microalgae harvest 15 removal efficiency of 87 and 98 was observed for cod and tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen respectively using symbiotic microalgal bacterial consortium in photobioreactor to treat municipal wastewater 16 gou et al developed an efficient reactor system that improved cod and ammonium removal rates to 90 in a retention time of 12 h 17 the use of microalgae for oxygen enrichment and reduction of nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and organic compounds in wastewater can be cost effective compared to conventional treatment systems various ranges of water quality parameters as ph temperature and do were reported for wastewater treatment with a mixed microalgae and bacteria culture 11 do profiles can impact the symbiosis between bacteria that consume oxygen and microalgae that produce oxygen for example the study by mhedhbi et al 18 showed that do varied from 2 to 11 mg l 1 when the microalgae started producing oxygen and decreased during the dark phase delgadillo mirquez et al 19 showed ph increase from 7 8 to 10 0 that can be a result from the microalgal growth co2 uptake by autotrophic and or mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae and or excretion from biodegradation of organic matter growth conditions for microalgae cultures can vary with temperature between 10 45 c with optimal conditions from 20 to 25 c 20 and for bacterial cultures can vary from 0 to 49 c 21 depending on the species of microalgae and bacteria several studies used immobilized biofilm of microalgal bacterial consortia as a secondary treatment for wastewater however more research is required to find better surface attachment 22 in addition the use of biofilm consortia without energy investment was not reported yet a simple and affordable wastewater treatment that is easy to operate and maintain is required to improve effluent quality from rural wastewater ponds the goal of this study was to develop a low cost solution to achieve this and supply water to the field crops in punjab india and elsewhere using a coupled microalgal bacterial biofilm cmbb treatment a mixed culture of indigenous microalgae and bacteria was supported on polyether sponges in the enrichment phase collected and placed into the treatment phase wastewater pond with minimal to no use of external energy wastewater parameters were analyzed during the enrichment and treatment processes the outcome of this study also addresses food security and health aspects by enabling the delivery of good quality effluent for the irrigation of agricultural fields 2 material and methods 2 1 samples and experimental conditions the experiments were carried out in two phases enrichment and treatment in the enrichment phase biofilm growth on the substrate was monitored for 14 days and in the treatment phase enriched biofilms were placed in raw wastewater for an additional 7 days of treatment experiments were performed simultaneously at tel aviv university israel tau and at thapar institute of engineering technology patiala india tiet to investigate different indigenous biomass wastewater types and system designs 2 1 1 enrichment biofilm growth for the enrichment phase different types of low cost substrates were examined bottle caps polypropylene plastic coral artificial corals available in fish shops moving bed bioreactor mbbr carriers polyethylene and two types of polyether sponges of identical size with different densities 0 02 and 0 03 g cm 3 raw sewage was sampled from the shafdan wastewater treatment plant israel after primary treatment and from haripur oxidation pond india after the inlet screening chamber each substrate was placed individually in the sampled sewage the enrichment phase was performed at a plant growth chamber pgi 550 rh mrc laboratory and equipments with retention time rt of 14 days irradiation of 20 000 lx was provided by 9 fluorescent lamps of 9 w each placed inside the chamber at 27 c biofilm weight was calculated and modified according to protocols of heffernan et al and mahlmann et al 23 24 the average weight of 10 sponge pieces was measured before enrichment after enrichment three sponges from each experiment were dried at 65 c for 24 h placed in a desiccator for 1 h and the average weight was measured the total amount of biofilm was calculated by subtracting the initial from the final sponge weight 2 1 2 wastewater treatment after enrichment the sponges were added to a fresh raw wastewater sample as the treatment phase the treatment was performed using a setup similar to that of the enrichment phase fig 1 where the control was wastewater without cmbb sponges that was aerated a or not aerated na and the cmbb treatment referred to treatment with sponges and aeration cmbb a or with sponges without aeration cmbb na with a rt of 7 days an air diffuser

wastewater for each sponge under 10 000 lx 10 h dark 14 h light at tiet the enrichment treatment was performed in open glass vessels of 4 l filled with 1 2 l of wastewater from the sewage treatment plant located at tiet with 20 cmbb enriched sponges added to each vessel 60 ml of wastewater for each sponge under 20 000 lx 12 h dark 12 h light the same sponges and air diffusers were used in both locations only the experimental vessels and wastewater differed all of the experiments were performed in triplicate 2 2 biochemical oxygen demand bod samples were prepared according to apha method

sample was added to the am vial followed by salicylate reagent and cyanurate reagent the samples were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min absorbance of the samples was read using a lovibond md100 colorimeter 2 5 microalgal chlorophyll concentration the concentration of free floating microalgae was estimated by chlorophyll concentration where 5 ml of sample was filtered through a 1 2 μm glass microfiber filter the glass filter was immersed in 5 ml of 95 ethanol incubated for 5 min at 78 c and then at room temperature for 24 h in the dark 26 the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 4 000 x g and absorbance at 664 2 nm and 648 6 nm was measured in a spectrophotometer the chlorophyll concentration was calculated as 27 1 chlorophyll a μg ml 1 13 36 a664 2 5 19 a648 6 2 6

effect of color or dyes are negligible and the concentration of microalgae and bacteria can be estimated without interference from chlorophyll pigment 2 7 nitrates and phosphates an integrion reagent free ion chromatography rfic system dionex usa consisting of a gp40 gradient pump an ad20 uv vis detector and an lc20 enclosure was used at tau data were acquired and analyzed using the chromatography

performed with hydroxide eluent at a constant temperature of 30 c the eluent flow rate was 1 5 ml min 1 and the sample loop volume was 10 μl at tiet biochemical analyses were performed according to apha methods 4500 no3 and 4500 p 25 2 8 scanning electron microscopy sem sem imaging was performed using a quanta 200 feg environmental scanning electron microscope equipped with a field emission electron gun feg electron source cmbb enriched sponges were lyophilized and coated with gold palladium 2 9 confocal microscopy fresh cmbb enriched sponges were analyzed using a zeiss lsm510 meta confocal inverted microscope equipped with a 40x water immersion objective images were acquired with 488 nm excitation laser employing two channels 1 red chlorophyll fluorescence at emission wavelengths 630 750 nm 2 syto 9 fluorescence in an emission collection range of 500 550 nm images of 8 bits were acquired with line averaging of 4 and pinhole of 1 airy unit z stack acquisition ensured a slice overlap of 50 raw images were analyzed with fiji imagej 28 2 10 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed with the spss version 25 statistical software package p 0 05 was considered statistically significant experiments were carried out in triplicates biological replicates one way anova and post hoc analysis with tukey adjustment were used to evaluate the significance of the differences in each experiment with time 3 results and discussion 3 1 enrichment biofilm growth the first step of the cmbb treatment developed in this study was to naturally enhance a biofilm of indigenous microalga and bacteria on a substrate immersed in a dedicated raw wastewater tank this substrate with the attached biofilm was then separated from the tank and placed in the oxidation ponds with the aim of improving water quality for agricultural irrigation first different types of substrates were examined bottle caps plastic corals mbbr carriers and two types of sponges made from the same material fig 2 shows the weight of the biofilm for the different substrates tested in this preliminary step the highest weight of biofilm was obtained with the 0 03 g cm 3 density sponge 27 3 mg and 33 5 mg of biofilm per sponge at tau and tiet respectively the bottle caps mbbr carriers and corals have a smooth surface different from the porous structure of the sponges that assisted in trapping the microorganisms in the pores to form a biofilm which probably prevents easy detachment from the sponges the smooth surfaces of the other supports probably enhances detachment of the biofilm flocs to the bottom of the vessel sponges were also used by nguyen et al 21 who examined the effect of sponge size on primary effluent treatment using an up flow bioreactor sem images of the cmbb enriched sponges were taken at the end of the enrichment phase fig 3 different angles and magnifications showed that the biofilm layer was attached to the sponge fig 3 spherical microorganisms of diameter 3 1 0 3 μm possibly microalgae can be seen together with a mucopolysaccharide web covering the sponge strips chlorella sp and coelastrella sp for example are microalgae with spherical shape frequently found in wastewater samples sem analysis of chlorella sp showed spherical diameter varying from 3 to 8 μm another study characterized few species of the coelastrella genus and some species presented spherical shapes with diameter varying from 3 5 until 14 μm 29 30 the most common bacterial biofilms grown in wastewater are heterotrophic bacteria ammonium oxidizing bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria and phosphate accumulating organisms 12 while the most common microalgae found in wastewater are scenedesmus sp chlorella sp oscillatoria sp closterium sp chroococcus sp and diatoms 31 interactions between bacteria and microalgae can be cooperative or competitive depending on the species 32 for example compounds excreted by chlorella sp after being exposed to water enhanced escherichia coli e coli growth 33 whereas competitive interactions were reported between an alga and leptothrix ochracea 34 suspended e coli were found to enhance the growth of chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus 35 moreover microalgae have the ability to produce sheaths made of protein carbohydrates and metal ions supporting both microalgal cell aggregation and bacteria reducing diffusion distance and permitting substrate exchange 36 37 the bacteria and microalgae are mixed together throughout the biofilm possibly in a synergistic way i e socializing with each other in a symbiotic relationship 38 however this relationship can change depending on the conditions type of substrate light availability aeration source of food and others 12 the microalgal bacterial synergy can accomplish tasks that are very difficult or even impossible for a single species or strain together they can find stability in face of environmental fluctuations as temperature ph concentrations of microorganisms food scarcity and nutrients and can resist to species that may disturb the environment 39 40 confocal microscopy was used to differentiate microalgae from bacteria in the mixed biofilm structure fig 4 the substrate alone presented background fluorescence mostly at the edges of both channels chlorophyll 630 750 nm and syto 9 500 550 nm fig 4b nevertheless it was possible to distinguish the substrate fluorescence from the biofilm different magnifications and angles of the cmbb sponge were observed showing a combination of bacteria and microalgae fig 4a during the initial days of the enrichment mainly bacteria grew as chlorophyll concentration was low supplementary material fig s1 a similar phenomenon was demonstrated in a study that showed initial biofilm formation of pseudomonas aeruginosa after 17 h 41 after a few days the microalgal population began to grow concomitantly with the bacteria supplementary material video s1 and fig 4a cmbb 3d image microalgae and bacteria initially adsorb to the conditioned sponge surface with time and increased concentration of microorganisms result in biofilm growth and after maturation the biofilm starts to lose parts of it in the form of flocs fig 5 a each type of bacterium prefers a specific spot within the biofilm that is beneficial to or allows its existence the bacteria s distribution throughout the biofilm should reflect their needs bacteria that require low oxygen concentrations should be physically under the microalgae heterotrophic bacteria should be close to the microalgae to benefit from the oxygen produced by the latter nitrifying bacteria will prefer spots close to the substrate due to their low growth rates and microalgae will grow at the biofilm surface where they can use light from the external environment thereby protecting the bacteria from adverse conditions 12 bacteria use oxygen in the microenvironment surrounding the microalgae to degrade organic matter while microalgae utilize co2 growth factors produced by bacteria and nutrients from the wastewater and released by bacteria for growth and oxygen production through photosynthesis fig 5b 42 44 thus the microalgae reduce the bacteria s need for aeration and decrease energy costs flocs are bacteria bacterial colonies and inorganic particles that are trapped in a net of exocellular polymeric substances 45 in our case the microalgae are also part of the floc as observed in fig 4a floc inside cmbb showing a floc confined inside the substrate 3 2 wastewater treatment 3 2 1 reduction in cod and bod after 1 day of rt in the treatment phase small flocs were noticed at the bottom of the vessels at tau after 1 day rt cmbb a was the most effective treatment combination reducing the codt by 74 followed by control a cmbb na and control na with 48 36 and 9 removal p 0 05 respectively after 4 days rt cmbb na control a and cmbb a presented an average 73 reduction in codt with no significant difference between them while control na reduced codt by 37 table 1 and supplementary material table s1 aeration generally increases the efficiency of the wastewater treatment 48 however aeration processes are very expensive increasing treatment costs by 15 49 49 our results showed that cmbb alone without aeration can be potentially used as an alternative to aerobic wastewater treatment for cod removal without the additional oxygenation costs table 1 after 4 days rt cmbb with or without aeration showed efficiency similar to that of aeration alone within 7 days rt cmbb na and cmbb a showed an increase in codt while it continued to decrease in the controls this might be due to the equilibrium between organic matter being consumed and produced in a batch system and cell growth death the re increase of cod is common and difficult to be treated because it is impossible to control the organic matter that is released by the microalgae and bacteria i e polysaccharides the re increase of cod was reported lee et al 50 their study searched for an optimal timing to add activated sludge and avoid cod re increase to avoid the impact of particles and dead cells the cod was filtered to obtain cods similar behavior was observed for cods and for absorbance at 750 nm supplementary material fig s2 results from tiet showed significant differences between control and cmbb treatments p 0 05 on the other hand there were no significant differences between aeration a and no aeration na fig 6 the wide vessel s open surface area might have resulted in dispersion of air bubbles to the surface compared to the erlenmeyer used at tau with its narrow opening showing the need to optimize the treatment reactor dimensions at 1 day rt codt reduction reached 10 13 with cmbb na and a whereas controls presented only 0 2 removal after 3 days rt cmbb na and a reached 28 35 removal vs controls with 8 9 and at 7 days rt cmbb na and a reached 60 63 removal and controls only 21 25 table 1 at tau after 7 days rt cmbb a showed a 97 reduction in bod followed by control a cmbb na control na with 84 80 and 67 reduction respectively significant differences were only obtained between the controls and between control na and cmbb a table 1 bod reduction in waste stabilization ponds varies between 60 and 75 51 confirming the results obtained for control na cmbb a improved the reduction and cmbb alone showed a reduction similar to aeration without the sponges but with the advantage of no energy investment at tiet the use of cmbb removed 63 65 of bod while the controls showed 11 15 reduction the different bod removal percentages between tau and tiet can be explained by the volume of wastewater per sponge used 40 ml at tau and 60 ml at tiet higher number of sponges per wastewater volume can support more biofilm mass per support and higher removal percentages fig 7 showed that when the ratio of bod removal is normalized per cmbb per wastewater volume are compared the values are similar with no significant differences between them demonstrating that same bod removal rates were observed in both setups and correlation between bod removal and the number of cmbb per wastewater volume bod analysis was only performed at the start and end of the experiment and therefore we do not know if a shorter rt would present similar removal the composition of domestic wastewater is very complex and composed of wastewater from human activities in households laundry bath kitchen toilet that may be similar but also may vary in the organic load 52 53 denser areas such as the dan region shafdan may produce stronger wastewater higher organic load and small villages in india for example may produce weaker 51 moreover input from industry and season sampling time can also result in different cod and bod loadings another important factor is presence of a latrine at the village houses sewage outlet which allows some of the solids in the wastewater to settle thereby decreasing the total suspended solids tss at the shafdan wastewater treatment plant in israel initial tss was 154 26 mg l 1 whereas at the village ponds and at the sewage treatment plant in india tss was 32 15 mg l 1 data provided by shafdan wastewater treatment plant and punjab pollution control board respectively the difference in tau and tiet efficiencies can be related to the higher cod and bod values different proportions of constituents and microorganisms and amount of sponge per milliliter of wastewater tau 40 ml and tiet 60 ml of wastewater per sponge nevertheless similar trends were observed with cmbb having the potential to considerably improve wastewater treatment and thus to deliver better quality water for irrigation cod and bod are important parameters for verifying effluent quality in india according to the general standards for discharge of environmental pollutants effluents 54 the maximum cod allowed for water reuse and discharge is 250 mg l 1 and bod is 100 mg l 1 in other countries such as israel these values are lower 150 mg l 1 and 15 mg l 1 respectively 55 our results show that even with a high initial load cmbb treated water easily meets the required standards in india and this treatment has the potential to decrease these values even more however studies are still required to achieve the best experimental and practical setup wastewater specifications sponges per volume of wastewater and air diffusion moreover climate and operation and maintenance practices can also play important roles 51 3 2 2 microalgal growth growth of free floating microalgae was monitored by the concentration of chlorophyll extracted from the wastewater fig 8 initially almost no chlorophyll was found however after 4 days rt higher chlorophyll concentration was observed in the cmbb na and cmbb a treatments 1 7 μg ml 1 and 1 1 μg ml 1 respectively possibly due to the microalgae attached to the sponge after 7 days rt control na cmbb na and cmbb a had similar microalgal concentrations 1 7 μg ml 1 with no significant difference control a had a lower microalgal concentration in the enrichment and treatment phases fig 8 and supplementary material fig s1 indicating a negative effect of aeration on microalgal growth in the unaerated treatments co2 stripping is prevented and thus more carbon is available to support microalgal growth 56 in addition higher co2 availability decreases competition between autotrophic bacteria nitrifying bacteria and microalgae for dissolved organic matter leading to a more stable consortium of microalgae and bacteria 56 after 4 days ph and chlorophyll concentration in the control na treatment showed no significant increase from the beginning of the experiment fig 8 chlorophyll concentration and ph followed similar trends in cmbb na displaying a high increase in ph from 7 4 to 9 2 and in chlorophyll from 0 05 to 1 74 μg ml 1 this behavior was also observed after 7 days rt for both of the nonaerated experiments for the aerated systems air containing co2 was pumped during the experiment keeping the ph lower than 9 0 the maximum ph allowed for irrigation 54 however unaerated experiments showed high chlorophyll concentration and exhibited a significant increase in ph due to microalgal photosynthesis during photosynthesis the microalgae take up dissolved co2 in the water then the enzyme carbonic anhydrase converts bicarbonate into co2 releasing hydroxyl ions which consequently increase ph this is why surface water ponds have a higher ph at the end of a sunny day 57 58 overall the presence of microalgae improved the removal of organic compounds and added produced oxygen to the water moreover the additional produced biomass can be used as slow release fertilizer for the crops increasing the soil s organic content and its water holding capacity 52 3 2 3 water quality for agricultural irrigation nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are the primary nutrients required by plants for normal healthy growth contributing to nutrient content plant enzyme function biochemical processes and plant cell integrity nitrogen is used by plants in two forms ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 and is found in amino acids nucleic acids and chlorophyll nitrogen deficiency is a limiting factor for crop productivity and growth whereas excess nitrogen can be toxic to humans and cause groundwater pollution 59 61 excess phosphorus can inhibit growth cause leaf necrosis and reduce zinc availability leading to loss of nutritional elements and organic metabolites 62 reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus can be achieved through the cooperative interactions of multiple species 39 nitrate concentration was low at the beginning and during the treatment typical of raw domestic wastewater which is characterized by high alkalinity and ammonia with very low or zero nitrate and nitrite 63 as also observed in stabilization ponds 64 the initial ammonia concentration was decreased 98 by the cmbb a treatment and 97 by control a table 2 cmbb na removed 64 of the ammonia and control na showed 36 removal table 2 ammonia removal of 77 99 was also observed in suspended cultures depending on the proportion of microalgae and bacteria used 65 high ammonia concentration in the irrigation water can be toxic to crops especially sensitive ones that can be affected by as little as 5 mg l 1 however most crops are not affected until the ammonia concentration reaches 30 mg l 1 66 decrease in ammonia concentration is also correlated with decrease in chlorophyll concentration and proteins yang et al and negi et al 31 67 reported that complete removal of ammonium leads to a decrease in chlorophyll concentration leading to accumulation of fatty acids absence of nitrogen results in changes in the chloroplast membrane structure 68 safe levels of orthophosphate in irrigation water are 0 2 mg l 1 according to the food and agriculture organization 66 after 4 days of treatment with cmbb na or cmbb a orthophosphate in the tau wastewater was at safe levels for agriculture table 2 safe levels were not reached with either control treatment even after 7 days rt table 2 the low levels of phosphates observed with cmbb may be correlated to the microalgae presence as some types of microalgae can efficient remove phosphates a recent study showed that microalgae biofilm of chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus vacuolatus completely removed phosphates 4 and 6 5 mg l 1 after 1 day and 2 days respectively from synthetic wastewater 69 while another study showed 97 removal of phosphorous using scenedesmus obliquus to polish urban wastewater 70 if aeration is not economically feasible cmbb can be an effective way to enhance ammonia and orthophosphate reduction making treated wastewater suitable for the irrigation of general crops 4 conclusion cmbb treatment significantly improved wastewater quality for irrigation with no additional energy costs in laboratory tests cmbb treatment removed 36 of codt whereas the control no sponges removed only 9 reflecting a 4 fold improvement by the former treatment even after only 1 day after 4 days rt the cmbb treatment showed a reduction similar to that with aeration alone indicating the former s potential for both shorter and longer treatment times cmbb treatment also enhanced the removal of bod ammonia and phosphates from the wastewater to 80 64 and 95 within 7 days respectively aeration had a negative effect on microalgal growth compared to the non aerated treatment but it helped maintain the ph at standard values the next step is to conduct a microbiological characterization of the biofilm and a set of small scale field studies to determine the optimal ratio of substrate to wastewater the best design in the pond for positioning the cmbb supports e g columns walls free floating or other and the optimal residence time for removing cod and bod below discharge limits and ammonia to levels that are not toxic to crops while retaining nutrients to decrease the amount of fertilizer that needs to be added in a larger scale with continuous flow of wastewater facility the enrichment period and the effectiveness of cmbb will be examined

13543,in view of water resource depletion treated wastewater can serve as an alternative source for crop irrigation however conventional wastewater treatment plants are energy intensive and costly to construct and operate especially for lower middle income countries the present study focused on improving the quality of wastewater by incorporating a coupled microalgal bacterial biofilm cmbb treatment in wastewater ponds standard polyether sponges were dipped in raw wastewater samples to enhance biofilm development on them the enriched sponges were used to treat wastewater with or without external energy for aeration wastewater parameters were analyzed during the enrichment and treatment processes the cmbb technology and aeration resulted in similar improvement of effluent quality but the former saved on energy costs and reduced total chemical oxygen demand cod by 36 within 24 h and 71 within 4 days the values of biochemical oxygen demand bod ammonium and phosphates decreased by 80 64 and 95 respectively within 7 days the resultant cod and bod values were below the maximum allowed for reuse and discharge keywords wastewater treatment microalgal bacterial biofilm sponge rural area 1 introduction an estimated 1 1 billion people worldwide lack access to water 2 4 billion people do not have adequate sanitation and 2 million people die every year from diarrheal diseases 1 use of water in our homes and industry produces wastewater and with the increases in population and living standards the need to find affordable wastewater treatment solutions is becoming more pressing eighty percent of the wastewater produced worldwide is discharged into surface water sources without adequate treatment 2 high income countries treat about 70 of their wastewater upper middle income countries about 38 and the rate drops to 28 for lower middle income countries 3 the asia pacific region releases 80 90 of their wastewater untreated 4 thereby polluting water sources properly treated wastewater can become a solution rather than a problem by serving as a source of water and energy conventional wastewater treatments applied in high income countries are energy demanding 5 for example reaching 1 4 of the total energy production in united states 6 the major portion of the electricity goes to pumping an adequate volume of oxygen during the biological treatment 5 centralized wastewater treatment facilities collect treat and discharge large quantities of wastewater for large communities at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and provide high quality effluent with values according to standards stipulated by the regulatory agencies however they cannot be adapted to low and lower middle income countries frequently with sewerage only at the main cities but due to the high maintenance cost fewer treatment plants work effectively 7 decentralized systems collect treat and reuse dispose treated wastewater at or near the generation point especially for scattered low density populated rural areas however small cities and villages often do not have the resources and knowledge base to build operate manage and maintain proper decentralized solutions that require also suitable planning and policy india is a lower middle income country that treats only 37 of its domestic wastewater in urban areas at a secondary level 7 in rural areas this number is even lower and the wastewater is discharged without any treatment into the village ponds or rivers polluting the water sources used for drinking and agricultural irrigation the primary income source of about 58 of india s population is agriculture 8 mainly focusing on the wheat paddy cycle which requires a huge amount of water in the dry season when water is scarce the use of raw untreated wastewater or poor quality water in agriculture is very common resulting in deterioration of the soil and carrying health risks 9 due to water scarcity the wastewater must be treated to disrupt the cycle of pollution especially in rural areas waste stabilization ponds can provide a low cost and low maintenance technology to treat the local villages wastewater enabling safer reuse of this water for irrigation however the treated wastewater or effluent has to reach quality standards for safe irrigation microalgal bacterial consortia can improve wastewater treatment 10 11 providing a self sustaining oxygen supply efficient nutrient removal and low maintenance requirements 11 13 su et al 14 used the synergistic relationship between microalgae and activated sludge to improve wastewater treatment with a 5 1 ratio of algae to sludge achieving 91 and 93 5 reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus respectively another study used a xenic culture broth to improve flocculation of chlorella vulgaris and demonstrated that microalgae associated bacteria improved microalgal flocculation by increasing the floc size which lead to higher sedimentation improving microalgae harvest 15 removal efficiency of 87 and 98 was observed for cod and tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen respectively using symbiotic microalgal bacterial consortium in photobioreactor to treat municipal wastewater 16 gou et al developed an efficient reactor system that improved cod and ammonium removal rates to 90 in a retention time of 12 h 17 the use of microalgae for oxygen enrichment and reduction of nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and organic compounds in wastewater can be cost effective compared to conventional treatment systems various ranges of water quality parameters as ph temperature and do were reported for wastewater treatment with a mixed microalgae and bacteria culture 11 do profiles can impact the symbiosis between bacteria that consume oxygen and microalgae that produce oxygen for example the study by mhedhbi et al 18 showed that do varied from 2 to 11 mg l 1 when the microalgae started producing oxygen and decreased during the dark phase delgadillo mirquez et al 19 showed ph increase from 7 8 to 10 0 that can be a result from the microalgal growth co2 uptake by autotrophic and or mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae and or excretion from biodegradation of organic matter growth conditions for microalgae cultures can vary with temperature between 10 45 c with optimal conditions from 20 to 25 c 20 and for bacterial cultures can vary from 0 to 49 c 21 depending on the species of microalgae and bacteria several studies used immobilized biofilm of microalgal bacterial consortia as a secondary treatment for wastewater however more research is required to find better surface attachment 22 in addition the use of biofilm consortia without energy investment was not reported yet a simple and affordable wastewater treatment that is easy to operate and maintain is required to improve effluent quality from rural wastewater ponds the goal of this study was to develop a low cost solution to achieve this and supply water to the field crops in punjab india and elsewhere using a coupled microalgal bacterial biofilm cmbb treatment a mixed culture of indigenous microalgae and bacteria was supported on polyether sponges in the enrichment phase collected and placed into the treatment phase wastewater pond with minimal to no use of external energy wastewater parameters were analyzed during the enrichment and treatment processes the outcome of this study also addresses food security and health aspects by enabling the delivery of good quality effluent for the irrigation of agricultural fields 2 material and methods 2 1 samples and experimental conditions the experiments were carried out in two phases enrichment and treatment in the enrichment phase biofilm growth on the substrate was monitored for 14 days and in the treatment phase enriched biofilms were placed in raw wastewater for an additional 7 days of treatment experiments were performed simultaneously at tel aviv university israel tau and at thapar institute of engineering technology patiala india tiet to investigate different indigenous biomass wastewater types and system designs 2 1 1 enrichment biofilm growth for the enrichment phase different types of low cost substrates were examined bottle caps polypropylene plastic coral artificial corals available in fish shops moving bed bioreactor mbbr carriers polyethylene and two types of polyether sponges of identical size with different densities 0 02 and 0 03 g cm 3 raw sewage was sampled from the shafdan wastewater treatment plant israel after primary treatment and from haripur oxidation pond india after the inlet screening chamber each substrate was placed individually in the sampled sewage the enrichment phase was performed at a plant growth chamber pgi 550 rh mrc laboratory and equipments with retention time rt of 14 days irradiation of 20 000 lx was provided by 9 fluorescent lamps of 9 w each placed inside the chamber at 27 c biofilm weight was calculated and modified according to protocols of heffernan et al and mahlmann et al 23 24 the average weight of 10 sponge pieces was measured before enrichment after enrichment three sponges from each experiment were dried at 65 c for 24 h placed in a desiccator for 1 h and the average weight was measured the total amount of biofilm was calculated by subtracting the initial from the final sponge weight 2 1 2 wastewater treatment after enrichment the sponges were added to a fresh raw wastewater sample as the treatment phase the treatment was performed using a setup similar to that of the enrichment phase fig 1 where the control was wastewater without cmbb sponges that was aerated a or not aerated na and the cmbb treatment referred to treatment with sponges and aeration cmbb a or with sponges without aeration cmbb na with a rt of 7 days an air diffuser cylinder of 2 5 4 cm was used in each vessel for the aerated treatments at tau a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask was filled with 160 ml of primary raw wastewater and 4 cmbb enriched sponges 40 ml of wastewater for each sponge under 10 000 lx 10 h dark 14 h light at tiet the enrichment treatment was performed in open glass vessels of 4 l filled with 1 2 l of wastewater from the sewage treatment plant located at tiet with 20 cmbb enriched sponges added to each vessel 60 ml of wastewater for each sponge under 20 000 lx 12 h dark 12 h light the same sponges and air diffusers were used in both locations only the experimental vessels and wastewater differed all of the experiments were performed in triplicate 2 2 biochemical oxygen demand bod samples were prepared according to apha method 5210 b 25 bod bottles 300 ml were used and samples were incubated in the dark at 20 2 c after incubation for 5 days bod5 was measured by a skalar analytical b v netherlands analyzer at tau and by titration at tiet 2 3 chemical oxygen demand cod total cod codt and soluble cod cods filtered at 0 45 μ m were determined according to apha method 5220 c 25 using lovibond tintario group uk vario mr cod 0 1500 mg l 1 at tau and a laboratory prepared at tiet a 2 ml aliquot of samples from each experiment was added to the cod vial mixed and incubated at 150 c for 2 h after cooling the cod values were measured by spectrophotometry and hach usa dr 890 colorimeter at tau and by titration at tiet 2 4 ammonia total ammonia nh3 and nh4 content was measured using lovibond vario am lr and hr each sample was added to the am vial followed by salicylate reagent and cyanurate reagent the samples were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min absorbance of the samples was read using a lovibond md100 colorimeter 2 5 microalgal chlorophyll concentration the concentration of free floating microalgae was estimated by chlorophyll concentration where 5 ml of sample was filtered through a 1 2 μm glass microfiber filter the glass filter was immersed in 5 ml of 95 ethanol incubated for 5 min at 78 c and then at room temperature for 24 h in the dark 26 the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 4 000 x g and absorbance at 664 2 nm and 648 6 nm was measured in a spectrophotometer the chlorophyll concentration was calculated as 27 1 chlorophyll a μg ml 1 13 36 a664 2 5 19 a648 6 2 6 conductivity ph dissolved oxygen temperature and absorbance conductivity and temperature were measured using a multi 3510 ids instrument wtw germany and ph was measured using a lab 860 ph meter schott germany a wtw fdo 925 sensor was used to measure dissolved oxygen cell density measurements were performed by absorbance at 750 nm in a spectrophotometer varian cary 100 bio australia at 750 nm the effect of color or dyes are negligible and the concentration of microalgae and bacteria can be estimated without interference from chlorophyll pigment 2 7 nitrates and phosphates an integrion reagent free ion chromatography rfic system dionex usa consisting of a gp40 gradient pump an ad20 uv vis detector and an lc20 enclosure was used at tau data were acquired and analyzed using the chromatography software chromeleon 7 the samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter before analysis ionpac as11 hc 4 μm 4 250 mm and ag11 guard 4 50 mm columns were obtained from dionex isocratic elution was performed with hydroxide eluent at a constant temperature of 30 c the eluent flow rate was 1 5 ml min 1 and the sample loop volume was 10 μl at tiet biochemical analyses were performed according to apha methods 4500 no3 and 4500 p 25 2 8 scanning electron microscopy sem sem imaging was performed using a quanta 200 feg environmental scanning electron microscope equipped with a field emission electron gun feg electron source cmbb enriched sponges were lyophilized and coated with gold palladium 2 9 confocal microscopy fresh cmbb enriched sponges were analyzed using a zeiss lsm510 meta confocal inverted microscope equipped with a 40x water immersion objective images were acquired with 488 nm excitation laser employing two channels 1 red chlorophyll fluorescence at emission wavelengths 630 750 nm 2 syto 9 fluorescence in an emission collection range of 500 550 nm images of 8 bits were acquired with line averaging of 4 and pinhole of 1 airy unit z stack acquisition ensured a slice overlap of 50 raw images were analyzed with fiji imagej 28 2 10 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed with the spss version 25 statistical software package p 0 05 was considered statistically significant experiments were carried out in triplicates biological replicates one way anova and post hoc analysis with tukey adjustment were used to evaluate the significance of the differences in each experiment with time 3 results and discussion 3 1 enrichment biofilm growth the first step of the cmbb treatment developed in this study was to naturally enhance a biofilm of indigenous microalga and bacteria on a substrate immersed in a dedicated raw wastewater tank this substrate with the attached biofilm was then separated from the tank and placed in the oxidation ponds with the aim of improving water quality for agricultural irrigation first different types of substrates were examined bottle caps plastic corals mbbr carriers and two types of sponges made from the same material fig 2 shows the weight of the biofilm for the different substrates tested in this preliminary step the highest weight of biofilm was obtained with the 0 03 g cm 3 density sponge 27 3 mg and 33 5 mg of biofilm per sponge at tau and tiet respectively the bottle caps mbbr carriers and corals have a smooth surface different from the porous structure of the sponges that assisted in trapping the microorganisms in the pores to form a biofilm which probably prevents easy detachment from the sponges the smooth surfaces of the other supports probably enhances detachment of the biofilm flocs to the bottom of the vessel sponges were also used by nguyen et al 21 who examined the effect of sponge size on primary effluent treatment using an up flow bioreactor sem images of the cmbb enriched sponges were taken at the end of the enrichment phase fig 3 different angles and magnifications showed that the biofilm layer was attached to the sponge fig 3 spherical microorganisms of diameter 3 1 0 3 μm possibly microalgae can be seen together with a mucopolysaccharide web covering the sponge strips chlorella sp and coelastrella sp for example are microalgae with spherical shape frequently found in wastewater samples sem analysis of chlorella sp showed spherical diameter varying from 3 to 8 μm another study characterized few species of the coelastrella genus and some species presented spherical shapes with diameter varying from 3 5 until 14 μm 29 30 the most common bacterial biofilms grown in wastewater are heterotrophic bacteria ammonium oxidizing bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria and phosphate accumulating organisms 12 while the most common microalgae found in wastewater are scenedesmus sp chlorella sp oscillatoria sp closterium sp chroococcus sp and diatoms 31 interactions between bacteria and microalgae can be cooperative or competitive depending on the species 32 for example compounds excreted by chlorella sp after being exposed to water enhanced escherichia coli e coli growth 33 whereas competitive interactions were reported between an alga and leptothrix ochracea 34 suspended e coli were found to enhance the growth of chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus 35 moreover microalgae have the ability to produce sheaths made of protein carbohydrates and metal ions supporting both microalgal cell aggregation and bacteria reducing diffusion distance and permitting substrate exchange 36 37 the bacteria and microalgae are mixed together throughout the biofilm possibly in a synergistic way i e socializing with each other in a symbiotic relationship 38 however this relationship can change depending on the conditions type of substrate light availability aeration source of food and others 12 the microalgal bacterial synergy can accomplish tasks that are very difficult or even impossible for a single species or strain together they can find stability in face of environmental fluctuations as temperature ph concentrations of microorganisms food scarcity and nutrients and can resist to species that may disturb the environment 39 40 confocal microscopy was used to differentiate microalgae from bacteria in the mixed biofilm structure fig 4 the substrate alone presented background fluorescence mostly at the edges of both channels chlorophyll 630 750 nm and syto 9 500 550 nm fig 4b nevertheless it was possible to distinguish the substrate fluorescence from the biofilm different magnifications and angles of the cmbb sponge were observed showing a combination of bacteria and microalgae fig 4a during the initial days of the enrichment mainly bacteria grew as chlorophyll concentration was low supplementary material fig s1 a similar phenomenon was demonstrated in a study that showed initial biofilm formation of pseudomonas aeruginosa after 17 h 41 after a few days the microalgal population began to grow concomitantly with the bacteria supplementary material video s1 and fig 4a cmbb 3d image microalgae and bacteria initially adsorb to the conditioned sponge surface with time and increased concentration of microorganisms result in biofilm growth and after maturation the biofilm starts to lose parts of it in the form of flocs fig 5 a each type of bacterium prefers a specific spot within the biofilm that is beneficial to or allows its existence the bacteria s distribution throughout the biofilm should reflect their needs bacteria that require low oxygen concentrations should be physically under the microalgae heterotrophic bacteria should be close to the microalgae to benefit from the oxygen produced by the latter nitrifying bacteria will prefer spots close to the substrate due to their low growth rates and microalgae will grow at the biofilm surface where they can use light from the external environment thereby protecting the bacteria from adverse conditions 12 bacteria use oxygen in the microenvironment surrounding the microalgae to degrade organic matter while microalgae utilize co2 growth factors produced by bacteria and nutrients from the wastewater and released by bacteria for growth and oxygen production through photosynthesis fig 5b 42 44 thus the microalgae reduce the bacteria s need for aeration and decrease energy costs flocs are bacteria bacterial colonies and inorganic particles that are trapped in a net of exocellular polymeric substances 45 in our case the microalgae are also part of the floc as observed in fig 4a floc inside cmbb showing a floc confined inside the substrate 3 2 wastewater treatment 3 2 1 reduction in cod and bod after 1 day of rt in the treatment phase small flocs were noticed at the bottom of the vessels at tau after 1 day rt cmbb a was the most effective treatment combination reducing the codt by 74 followed by control a cmbb na and control na with 48 36 and 9 removal p 0 05 respectively after 4 days rt cmbb na control a and cmbb a presented an average 73 reduction in codt with no significant difference between them while control na reduced codt by 37 table 1 and supplementary material table s1 aeration generally increases the efficiency of the wastewater treatment 48 however aeration processes are very expensive increasing treatment costs by 15 49 49 our results showed that cmbb alone without aeration can be potentially used as an alternative to aerobic wastewater treatment for cod removal without the additional oxygenation costs table 1 after 4 days rt cmbb with or without aeration showed efficiency similar to that of aeration alone within 7 days rt cmbb na and cmbb a showed an increase in codt while it continued to decrease in the controls this might be due to the equilibrium between organic matter being consumed and produced in a batch system and cell growth death the re increase of cod is common and difficult to be treated because it is impossible to control the organic matter that is released by the microalgae and bacteria i e polysaccharides the re increase of cod was reported lee et al 50 their study searched for an optimal timing to add activated sludge and avoid cod re increase to avoid the impact of particles and dead cells the cod was filtered to obtain cods similar behavior was observed for cods and for absorbance at 750 nm supplementary material fig s2 results from tiet showed significant differences between control and cmbb treatments p 0 05 on the other hand there were no significant differences between aeration a and no aeration na fig 6 the wide vessel s open surface area might have resulted in dispersion of air bubbles to the surface compared to the erlenmeyer used at tau with its narrow opening showing the need to optimize the treatment reactor dimensions at 1 day rt codt reduction reached 10 13 with cmbb na and a whereas controls presented only 0 2 removal after 3 days rt cmbb na and a reached 28 35 removal vs controls with 8 9 and at 7 days rt cmbb na and a reached 60 63 removal and controls only 21 25 table 1 at tau after 7 days rt cmbb a showed a 97 reduction in bod followed by control a cmbb na control na with 84 80 and 67 reduction respectively significant differences were only obtained between the controls and between control na and cmbb a table 1 bod reduction in waste stabilization ponds varies between 60 and 75 51 confirming the results obtained for control na cmbb a improved the reduction and cmbb alone showed a reduction similar to aeration without the sponges but with the advantage of no energy investment at tiet the use of cmbb removed 63 65 of bod while the controls showed 11 15 reduction the different bod removal percentages between tau and tiet can be explained by the volume of wastewater per sponge used 40 ml at tau and 60 ml at tiet higher number of sponges per wastewater volume can support more biofilm mass per support and higher removal percentages fig 7 showed that when the ratio of bod removal is normalized per cmbb per wastewater volume are compared the values are similar with no significant differences between them demonstrating that same bod removal rates were observed in both setups and correlation between bod removal and the number of cmbb per wastewater volume bod analysis was only performed at the start and end of the experiment and therefore we do not know if a shorter rt would present similar removal the composition of domestic wastewater is very complex and composed of wastewater from human activities in households laundry bath kitchen toilet that may be similar but also may vary in the organic load 52 53 denser areas such as the dan region shafdan may produce stronger wastewater higher organic load and small villages in india for example may produce weaker 51 moreover input from industry and season sampling time can also result in different cod and bod loadings another important factor is presence of a latrine at the village houses sewage outlet which allows some of the solids in the wastewater to settle thereby decreasing the total suspended solids tss at the shafdan wastewater treatment plant in israel initial tss was 154 26 mg l 1 whereas at the village ponds and at the sewage treatment plant in india tss was 32 15 mg l 1 data provided by shafdan wastewater treatment plant and punjab pollution control board respectively the difference in tau and tiet efficiencies can be related to the higher cod and bod values different proportions of constituents and microorganisms and amount of sponge per milliliter of wastewater tau 40 ml and tiet 60 ml of wastewater per sponge nevertheless similar trends were observed with cmbb having the potential to considerably improve wastewater treatment and thus to deliver better quality water for irrigation cod and bod are important parameters for verifying effluent quality in india according to the general standards for discharge of environmental pollutants effluents 54 the maximum cod allowed for water reuse and discharge is 250 mg l 1 and bod is 100 mg l 1 in other countries such as israel these values are lower 150 mg l 1 and 15 mg l 1 respectively 55 our results show that even with a high initial load cmbb treated water easily meets the required standards in india and this treatment has the potential to decrease these values even more however studies are still required to achieve the best experimental and practical setup wastewater specifications sponges per volume of wastewater and air diffusion moreover climate and operation and maintenance practices can also play important roles 51 3 2 2 microalgal growth growth of free floating microalgae was monitored by the concentration of chlorophyll extracted from the wastewater fig 8 initially almost no chlorophyll was found however after 4 days rt higher chlorophyll concentration was observed in the cmbb na and cmbb a treatments 1 7 μg ml 1 and 1 1 μg ml 1 respectively possibly due to the microalgae attached to the sponge after 7 days rt control na cmbb na and cmbb a had similar microalgal concentrations 1 7 μg ml 1 with no significant difference control a had a lower microalgal concentration in the enrichment and treatment phases fig 8 and supplementary material fig s1 indicating a negative effect of aeration on microalgal growth in the unaerated treatments co2 stripping is prevented and thus more carbon is available to support microalgal growth 56 in addition higher co2 availability decreases competition between autotrophic bacteria nitrifying bacteria and microalgae for dissolved organic matter leading to a more stable consortium of microalgae and bacteria 56 after 4 days ph and chlorophyll concentration in the control na treatment showed no significant increase from the beginning of the experiment fig 8 chlorophyll concentration and ph followed similar trends in cmbb na displaying a high increase in ph from 7 4 to 9 2 and in chlorophyll from 0 05 to 1 74 μg ml 1 this behavior was also observed after 7 days rt for both of the nonaerated experiments for the aerated systems air containing co2 was pumped during the experiment keeping the ph lower than 9 0 the maximum ph allowed for irrigation 54 however unaerated experiments showed high chlorophyll concentration and exhibited a significant increase in ph due to microalgal photosynthesis during photosynthesis the microalgae take up dissolved co2 in the water then the enzyme carbonic anhydrase converts bicarbonate into co2 releasing hydroxyl ions which consequently increase ph this is why surface water ponds have a higher ph at the end of a sunny day 57 58 overall the presence of microalgae improved the removal of organic compounds and added produced oxygen to the water moreover the additional produced biomass can be used as slow release fertilizer for the crops increasing the soil s organic content and its water holding capacity 52 3 2 3 water quality for agricultural irrigation nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are the primary nutrients required by plants for normal healthy growth contributing to nutrient content plant enzyme function biochemical processes and plant cell integrity nitrogen is used by plants in two forms ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 and is found in amino acids nucleic acids and chlorophyll nitrogen deficiency is a limiting factor for crop productivity and growth whereas excess nitrogen can be toxic to humans and cause groundwater pollution 59 61 excess phosphorus can inhibit growth cause leaf necrosis and reduce zinc availability leading to loss of nutritional elements and organic metabolites 62 reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus can be achieved through the cooperative interactions of multiple species 39 nitrate concentration was low at the beginning and during the treatment typical of raw domestic wastewater which is characterized by high alkalinity and ammonia with very low or zero nitrate and nitrite 63 as also observed in stabilization ponds 64 the initial ammonia concentration was decreased 98 by the cmbb a treatment and 97 by control a table 2 cmbb na removed 64 of the ammonia and control na showed 36 removal table 2 ammonia removal of 77 99 was also observed in suspended cultures depending on the proportion of microalgae and bacteria used 65 high ammonia concentration in the irrigation water can be toxic to crops especially sensitive ones that can be affected by as little as 5 mg l 1 however most crops are not affected until the ammonia concentration reaches 30 mg l 1 66 decrease in ammonia concentration is also correlated with decrease in chlorophyll concentration and proteins yang et al and negi et al 31 67 reported that complete removal of ammonium leads to a decrease in chlorophyll concentration leading to accumulation of fatty acids absence of nitrogen results in changes in the chloroplast membrane structure 68 safe levels of orthophosphate in irrigation water are 0 2 mg l 1 according to the food and agriculture organization 66 after 4 days of treatment with cmbb na or cmbb a orthophosphate in the tau wastewater was at safe levels for agriculture table 2 safe levels were not reached with either control treatment even after 7 days rt table 2 the low levels of phosphates observed with cmbb may be correlated to the microalgae presence as some types of microalgae can efficient remove phosphates a recent study showed that microalgae biofilm of chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus vacuolatus completely removed phosphates 4 and 6 5 mg l 1 after 1 day and 2 days respectively from synthetic wastewater 69 while another study showed 97 removal of phosphorous using scenedesmus obliquus to polish urban wastewater 70 if aeration is not economically feasible cmbb can be an effective way to enhance ammonia and orthophosphate reduction making treated wastewater suitable for the irrigation of general crops 4 conclusion cmbb treatment significantly improved wastewater quality for irrigation with no additional energy costs in laboratory tests cmbb treatment removed 36 of codt whereas the control no sponges removed only 9 reflecting a 4 fold improvement by the former treatment even after only 1 day after 4 days rt the cmbb treatment showed a reduction similar to that with aeration alone indicating the former s potential for both shorter and longer treatment times cmbb treatment also enhanced the removal of bod ammonia and phosphates from the wastewater to 80 64 and 95 within 7 days respectively aeration had a negative effect on microalgal growth compared to the non aerated treatment but it helped maintain the ph at standard values the next step is to conduct a microbiological characterization of the biofilm and a set of small scale field studies to determine the optimal ratio of substrate to wastewater the best design in the pond for positioning the cmbb supports e g columns walls free floating or other and the optimal residence time for removing cod and bod below discharge limits and ammonia to levels that are not toxic to crops while retaining nutrients to decrease the amount of fertilizer that needs to be added in a larger scale with continuous flow of wastewater facility the enrichment period and the effectiveness of cmbb will be examined

13544,in this study the effect of calcification on methanogenic activity basic properties microbial community structure and microstructure of anaerobic granular sludge angs was investigated results indicated that inorganic crystals were deposited in the sludge in the form of calcite which increased sludge density and led them to deposit at the bottom of the anaerobic reactor calcification markedly reduced the values of volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss and extracellular polymeric substances eps content by 35 0 and 27 1 respectively chloroflexi actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the most dominant functional species in both types of samples accounting for 69 1 of the calcified samples and lower than 71 8 of the uncalcified samples compared to uncalcified sludge the abundance of methanosaeta 9 7 in the calcified sludge decreased by 34 0 and calcification reduces the abundance of gene pathway and methane related enzymes in addition the proportion of inorganic crystals in calcified sludge was 180 6 higher than that in uncalcified sludge while the proportion of biomass and pores decreased by 11 7 and 73 8 respectively and the proportion of larger pores was significantly reduced these factors lead to the cumulative methane production in calcified angs decreased by 26 8 and the specific methanogenic activity sma reduced by 16 2 keywords calcification methanogenic activity internal structure community structure 1 introduction anaerobic treatment technology has been used for more than a hundred years 1 anaerobic digestion provides a potentially cost effective solution for the treatment of high strength organic wastewater because it generates smaller amounts of sludge for further landfilling and also produces methane which is a useful renewable energy source 2 at present converting organic waste into methane through anaerobic digestion is an economic and cost effective energy strategy furthermore methane can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve environmental problems such as global warming 3 however within this anaerobic process the production of calcium is an important factor that affects methane production calcium is an essential requirement in several biological membrane fusion events 4 and it can also promote sludge granulation by bridging the eps of cells 5 addition of calcium 150 300 mg l 1 to upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors enhanced the three steps of sludge granulation adsorption adhesion and multiplication 6 when treating wastewater created during papermaking using angs the cumulative gas production was maximum when the ca2 concentration in the substrate was 120 mg l 1 in addition the abundance of the important bacterial family ruminococcaceae in the anaerobic fermentation hydrolysis stage was drastically reduced and methane production increased when the ca2 concentration was below 200 mg l 1 unfortunately high calcium is a common feature of various kinds of industrial wastewater especially papermaking wastewater which is mostly treated by anaerobic technology 7 8 a high ca2 concentration 1200 mg l 1 in the substrate not only cause low and unstable cod removal efficiency 60 90 and eventually lead to the sludge bed cementation but also influence the granule structure and interferes with the physiological function 9 10 in order to reveal the deactivation mechanism of calcified sludge a lot of studies for biophysical aspect were conducted by researchers a common argument claims that the calcium precipitates in the center caco3 dominates or the outer layer cax po4 y dominates of granules occupy the space for microbes colonization and block the channels for mass transfer 11 resulting in the decrease of sludge activity 12 13 nevertheless the method of quantitatively analyzing the internal microstructure of sludge has not been widely adopted and it is not clear how the changes in microstructure and microbial community distribution affect the anaerobic activity of sludge from a microscopic view in this study we compared the basic properties of and changes in the methane producing activity of calcification and the calcification of angs furthermore the morphology and crystal type of the calcium nuclei were also observed in addition we also quantitatively analyzed the proportion of inorganic crystal area biomass area and blank area in the sludge and explored the effect of calcification on pore distribution finally the inactivation mechanism of calcified angs is explained in combination with the change of microbial community structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed sludge and synthetic wastewater uncalcified and calcified angs was obtained from different heights of a uasb reactor for processing wastewater from wastepaper and papermaking processes in the guangdong province the uncalcified sludge was obtained from a height of 7 m vss tss 70 51 and the calcified sludge was obtained from a height of 1 m vss tss 45 83 the influent chemical oxygen demand concentration was 1550 2 mg l 1 and the effluent concentration was 499 6 mg l 1 to resuscitate microbial activity angs was acclimated using glucose as a substrate before the experiment the characteristics of the synthetic wastewater which included glucose as the carbon source were as follows glucose 4 08 g l 1 nahco3 2 6 g l 1 nh4cl 0 48 g l 1 kh2po4 0 09 g l 1 feso4 4h2o 0 032 g l 1 cacl2 0 038 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o 0 042 g l 1 and ph 7 20 0 20 2 2 anaerobic digestion experiment batch experiments were conducted in two 250 ml anaerobic bottles a mixture of 50 ml sludge and 150 ml synthetic wastewater was added to each bottle the bottles were marked to indicate calcified and uncalcified samples then the bottles were emptied of air by flushing them with nitrogen for 15 min and sealed with stoppers and tapes both types of reactors were maintained at 37 1 c using a constant temperature water bath for five days all studies were performed in triplicates the gas produced by reactors were passed through a 1 mol l 1 naoh solution to remove acid gases and determined the volume of methane gas when the anaerobic digestion experiment was carried out the amount of methane production was measured every day and the sma was obtained after the experiment 2 3 analytical methods ash tss and vss in seed sludge were determined using standard methods 14 eps extraction of seed sludge was conducted using the naoh formaldehyde method 15 in brief the method involved a solution of formaldehyde 36 5 and naoh 1 mol l 1 which was added to the sludge the mixture was then agitated at 200 rpm for 2 3 h and then centrifuged at 4200 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was collected after filtering through a 0 22 μm membrane polysaccharides ps content was determined using the anthrone sulfuric acid method 16 and proteins pn and humic acid ha were analyzed using the folin lowry method 17 2 4 calcified core analysis the seed sludge was taken out and oscillated in a numerically controlled ultrasonic cleaning machine xc 1000c the temperature was set to 60 c the heating time was 30 min the power was 40 w and the shaking was carried out for 4 h after taking it out it was dried at 40 c for 8 h to obtain the calcified skeleton of anaerobic granular sludge then scanning electron microscope sem results were obtained using an f16502 sem phenom netherlands polymorph was identified by x ray diffraction xrd analysis with rigaku d max diffractometer using cu radiation with ni filtered cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å at 40 kv 40 ma with a step size of 0 02 and present time of 1 s at each step 2 5 micro ct analysis granule samples in seed sludge were scanned using a micro computed tomography micro ct machine brucker skyscan 2211 kontich belgium with a resolution of 1 μm and operated at 45 kv and 330 μa to analyze the internal structure of the angs and the 3d reconstruction model is completed using ctvox 3 3 software 2 6 dna extraction sequencing of 16s rrna genes and data analysis the samples were collected from seed sludge and sent to mijorbio shanghai china for dna extraction and amplicon sequencing according to miseq protocols dna quality was determined by 2 agarose gel electrophoresis for high throughput sequencing hts the v3 and v4 hypervariable regions of the 16 s rrna were amplified using 338 f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggact achvgggtwtctaat 3 the ensuing conditions of amplification were followed initial denaturation at 95 for 3 min followed by 29 cycles each of 94 for 30 s 55 for 30 s and 72 for 30 s and a final extension step at 72 for 5 min sequence analysis was performed using the qiime software package the statistical analysis included optimization sequence statistics distribution statistics dilution curve analysis diversity index analysis and taxonomy analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 calcification affected the basic properties organic composition and methane production performance of angs anaerobic granules are an aggregate of functional microorganisms its ratio of vss tss can indicate effective biomass retention which is a vital factor for maintaining excellent anaerobic performance 18 the composition and content of eps affect the properties of biofilms flocculation and structural stability of angs and control over proper eps production would be a feasible approach to enhance the performance in biological wastewater treatment systems in beneficial or detrimental environments 19 since pn ps and ha have been reported as the major components in extracted eps they are commonly used to represent eps content 20 therefore the vss tss pn ps and ha contents in extracted eps of the angs were analyzed as depicted in table s1 the density of calcified sludge is slightly higher than that of uncalcified sludge thus calcified sludge is deposited at the bottom of the uasb reactor chen et al identified that calcified granules covered the bottom of the sludge bed first 21 the vss tss values of uncalcified and calcified samples were 70 51 and 45 83 respectively indicating that uncalcified samples have a higher proportion of organic components fig 1 a as shown in fig 1b the contents of pn ps and ha were 7 32 mg g 1 vss 8 30 mg g 1 vss 2 05 mg g 1 vss in uncalcified samples respectively while in calcified samples they were 9 18 mg g 1 vss 3 87 mg g 1 vss 2 10 mg g 1 vss respectively and the total content of the three components in calcified samples decreased by 27 11 compared with that in uncalcified this may be because there were a lot of calcium deposits on the surface of calcified angs which prevented bacteria in the sludge from contacting organic matter reduced the probability of bacteria producing eps and therefore reduced the content of each component in eps eps can not only combine with cells to form a network structure to protect cells from dehydration and toxic substances 22 but also accelerate the formation of microbial aggregates by closely combining cells 23 therefore reduction in eps content may lead to a consequent decrease in the biological activity of angs however vss and tss contents in calcified sludge were higher than those in uncalcified sludge therefore calcified sludge is expected to retain considerable activity fig 1c illustrates the course of ch4 production in days during anaerobic digestion cumulative methane production in the calcification reactor after five days was 221 ml which was 26 82 lower than that in the uncalcified reactor and there was significant difference of sma between the uncalcified group and calcified group fig 1d the sma of the calcified reactor is 1 85 g codch4 gvss d 1 which is 16 23 lower than that of the uncalcified reactor 3 2 characterization of calcified cores the morphology of the calcified skeleton was observed using a sem the results are shown in fig 2 a and b the calcified skeleton is irregular in shape and consists of many nodular solids its interior is cluster like and contains several pores xrd analysis an efficient tool for determining the presence of a crystalline structure 24 was used to analyze the calcified core its diffractogram is shown in fig 2c comparing it with reference spectra the crystal was identified as calcite with 2θ values of 23 08 29 43 36 02 39 45 43 20 47 52 and 48 54 2θ 29 34 was the major peak as indicated in fig 2d 3 3 effect of calcification on the internal structure of granular sludge the microstructure distribution in the anaerobic granules was analyzed using micro ct and the results are shown in fig 3 and table s2 white red and green in fig 3 represent the pores biomass and inorganic crystals in the sludge respectively more inorganic crystals were deposited on the surface of the calcified samples than on the uncalcified samples fig 3a and b table s2 outlines the distribution of different density areas specifically divided into pores biomass and inorganic crystals compared to uncalcified anaerobic granules the biomass and pores of calcified particles had a smaller volume ratio however inorganic crystals occupied a much larger proportion the distribution of the pore sizes of the two granule samples was significantly different fig 3c in the uncalcified samples pores of 4 10 μm constituted 84 49 of the pores and it contained a small amount of 14 18 μm pores however 2 μm pores accounted for 65 62 of the calcified pores and there were no pores larger than 14 μm this indicates that calcification increased the number of smaller pores in the sludge and decreases the number of larger pores the mass transfer is the rate limiting step in the decomposition of organic pollutants by the anaerobic granules and pollutants are absorbed and converted by functional microorganisms after they enter the anaerobic granule through the pores 25 26 in larger pores the substrate can be transported through seepage therefore a good pore structure is extremely beneficial for the metabolic activity of anaerobic granules 11 however excessive calcium salt accumulation in the anaerobic granules will occupy space that is supposed to be available for functional microorganisms or cause pore blockage leading to a decrease in cell density metabolic activity and mass transfer performance ultimately this will influence the effect of anaerobic granules 11 however calcified sludge remained active as it also contains a certain volume of biomass and pores which is consistent with the results in fig 1c and d 3 4 effect of calcification on the microbial community 3 4 1 alpha diversity hts was used to analyze microbial community diversity and abundance of angs the chao and shannon indices decreased by 1 87 and 12 55 respectively in the calcified samples compared with the uncalcified samples the simpson index increased by 50 in the calcified samples compared with the uncalcified samples table s3 these results suggest that calcification led to a decrease in microbial diversity and abundance high microbial diversity and abundance are beneficial for anaerobic digestion 27 therefore calcification leads to reduced sludge activity which is consistent with the results in fig 1c and d 3 4 2 analysis of microbial community structure to investigate the effect of calcification on the microbial community structure of angs we analyzed the differences in bacteria and archaea by hts as shown in fig 4 a at the phylum level firmicutes and chloroflexi showed the highest abundance in the uncalcified and calcified samples respectively chloroflexi actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the most dominant functional species in both types of samples they accounted for 69 12 of the calcified samples and lower than 71 81 of the uncalcified samples since they are the principal hydrolytic and acidifying phyla 28 29 any decrease in their relative abundance may limit the hydrolysis acidification process of angs moreover the relative abundance of armatimonadetes aegiribacteria and latescibacteria indicated the most significant differences armatimonadetes and aegiribacteria were 94 78 and 94 14 less in uncalcified angs respectively than in calicified angs on the other hand latescibacteria was 96 9 more in uncalcified angs than in calcified angs at the genus level norank f norank o sbr1031 12 54 and norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 11 98 were the most dominant functional microorganisms in the uncalcified and calcified samples respectively fig 4b syntrophobacter anaerolinea candidatus caldatribacterium longilinea and norank f norank o rgb 13 54 9 were found in more abundance in the calcified samples than in the uncalcified samples however lactobacillus georgenia bacteroides bifidobacterium and norank f norank o aminicenantales were found in lesser amounts in the calcified samples than in the uncalcified samples thus it can be concluded that calcification alters the community structure as well as the dominant population of microorganisms at the phylum level the microbial composition of the granular sludge was nearly the same in both uncalcified and calcified samples with euryarchaeota being the dominant archaea compared with the uncalcified samples the relative abundance of euryarchaeota 91 24 and thaumarchaeota 4 42 in the calcified samples increased by 2 13 and 51 72 respectively while that of crenarchaeota 3 63 decreased by 45 51 fig 5 a euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota often co occur in the same anaerobic digestion system and have cooperative synergistic interactions 30 however as seen from the results calcification alters their proportions possibly leading to an imbalance in their synergistic interactions which reduces methanogenic activity at the genus level methanobacterium and methanosaeta were the dominant methanogenic archaea in both types of samples the archaeal community structure in the calcified samples changed considerably as compared with the structure in the uncalcified samples thus the relative abundance of methanobacterium 58 91 in the calcified samples increased by 11 8 while that of methanosaeta 9 72 and norank f norank o norank c bathyarchaeia 3 59 decreased by 34 0 and 44 6 respectively fig 5b since methanosaeta is a methanogen with acetic acid as its substrate 31 its reduction may lead to the accumulation of acidity as acetic acid produced by acidogenic bacteria is not consumed in time thus affecting methanogen activity in conclusion calcification may limit methane production efficiency by inhibiting hydrolytic fermentation and acetic acid type methane production processes 3 4 3 effect of calcification on the abundance of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg gene pathway and methane related enzyme pathway in sludge the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states software and the kegg database were used to compare and analyze gene abundance within the calcified and uncalcified samples the two most abundant pathways in uncalcified and calcified samples were identified to be ribosome ko03010 and purine metabolism ko00230 their relative abundances in uncalcified samples were 8 84 and 6 81 respectively which were all higher than their abundances of 8 35 and 6 44 in calcified samples respectively fig 6 a most importantly ko00860 is a methane metabolism pathway its abundance in calcified sample was 3 28 which was less than 6 24 in uncalcified sample this showed that calcification can reduce the gene abundance of the methane metabolism pathway the methanogenesis pathway requires the participation of related coenzymes such as formate dehydrogenase ec 1 2 1 2 acetyl coa synthase ec 6 2 1 1 coenzyme 420 dehydrogenase ec 1 12 98 1 and furan dehydrogenase ec 1 2 99 5 etc 32 33 except for the common pathway gene abundance the total abundance of genes for the hydrogenotrophic pathway in the uncalcified and calcified samples was 3 45 and 3 31 respectively while that for the acetotrophic pathway in calcified samples was 1 43 which was lower than the abundance of 1 47 in uncalcified samples fig 6b this indicateed that calcification weakened the sludges hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway and acetotrophic methanogenesis pathway which was consistent with the cumulative methane production and sma analysis results 4 conclusions this study indicated that some inorganic crystals are deposited in the form of calcite in calcified sludge which increases sludge density and deposits at the bottom of the anaerobic reactor the proportion of organic matter and eps content also decreased and the microbial community structure altered calcification was also found to reduce the efficiency of hydrolytic fermentation and acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in anaerobic fermentation systems which impacted methanogenesis activity in particular reduction in the abundance of chloroflexi actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes limited hydrolysis and fermentation rates furthermore reduction in the abundance of methanosaeta prevented acetic acid from being consumed in time leading to acidity accumulation the kegg pathway also indicated that calcification weakened the hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogenesis pathways from the perspective of the internal microstructure of the sludge some inorganic crystals were deposited on the surface of the sludge and the other part were deposited irregularly in the form of calcite in the particles occupying a part of the space that could be used for functional microorganisms and the proportion of macropores decreased which was not conducive to material exchange and reduced sludge activity eventually led to a decrease in cumulative methane production and sma credit authorship contribution statement yueru wu

13544,in this study the effect of calcification on methanogenic activity basic properties microbial community structure and microstructure of anaerobic granular sludge angs was investigated results indicated that inorganic crystals were deposited in the sludge in the form of calcite which increased sludge density and led them to deposit at the bottom of the anaerobic reactor calcification markedly reduced the values of volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss and extracellular polymeric substances eps content by 35 0 and 27 1 respectively chloroflexi actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the most dominant functional species in both types of samples accounting for 69 1 of the calcified samples and lower than 71 8 of the uncalcified samples compared to uncalcified sludge the abundance of methanosaeta 9 7 in the calcified sludge decreased by 34 0 and calcification reduces the abundance of gene pathway and methane related enzymes in addition the proportion of inorganic crystals in calcified sludge was 180 6 higher than that in uncalcified sludge while the proportion of biomass and pores decreased by 11 7 and 73 8 respectively and the proportion of larger pores was significantly reduced these factors lead to the cumulative methane production in calcified angs decreased by 26 8 and the specific methanogenic activity sma reduced by

the method of quantitatively analyzing the internal microstructure of sludge has not been widely adopted and it is not clear how the changes in microstructure and microbial community distribution affect the anaerobic activity of sludge from a microscopic view in this study we compared the basic properties of and changes in the methane producing activity of calcification and the calcification of angs furthermore the morphology and crystal type of the calcium nuclei were also observed in addition we also quantitatively analyzed the proportion of inorganic crystal area biomass area and blank area in the sludge and explored the effect of calcification on pore distribution finally the inactivation mechanism of calcified angs is explained in combination with the change of microbial community structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed sludge and synthetic wastewater uncalcified and calcified angs was obtained from different heights of a uasb reactor for processing wastewater from wastepaper and papermaking processes in the guangdong province the uncalcified sludge was obtained from a height of 7 m vss tss 70 51 and the calcified sludge was obtained from a height of 1 m vss tss 45 83 the influent chemical oxygen demand concentration was 1550 2 mg l 1 and the effluent concentration was 499 6 mg l 1 to resuscitate microbial activity angs was acclimated using glucose as a substrate before the experiment the characteristics of the synthetic wastewater which included glucose as the carbon source were as follows glucose 4 08 g l 1 nahco3 2 6 g l 1 nh4cl 0 48 g l 1 kh2po4 0 09 g l 1 feso4 4h2o 0 032 g l 1 cacl2 0 038 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o 0 042 g l 1 and ph 7 20 0 20 2 2 anaerobic digestion experiment batch experiments were conducted in two 250 ml anaerobic bottles a mixture of 50 ml sludge and 150 ml synthetic wastewater was added to each bottle the bottles were marked to indicate calcified and uncalcified samples then the bottles were emptied of air by flushing them with nitrogen for 15 min and sealed with stoppers and tapes both types of reactors were maintained at 37 1 c using a constant temperature water bath for five days all studies were performed in triplicates the gas produced by reactors were passed through a 1 mol l 1 naoh solution to remove acid gases and determined the volume of methane gas when the anaerobic digestion experiment was carried out the amount of methane production was measured every day and the sma was obtained after the experiment 2 3 analytical methods ash tss and vss in seed sludge were determined using standard methods 14 eps extraction of seed sludge was conducted using the naoh formaldehyde method 15 in brief the method involved a solution of formaldehyde 36 5 and naoh 1 mol l 1 which was added to the sludge the mixture was then agitated at 200 rpm for 2 3 h and then centrifuged at 4200 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was collected after filtering through a 0 22 μm membrane polysaccharides ps content was determined using the anthrone sulfuric acid method 16 and proteins pn and humic acid ha were analyzed using the folin lowry method 17 2 4 calcified core analysis the seed sludge was taken out and oscillated in a numerically controlled ultrasonic cleaning machine xc 1000c the temperature was set to 60 c the heating time was 30 min the power was 40 w and the shaking was carried out for 4 h after taking it out it was dried at 40 c for 8 h to obtain the calcified skeleton of anaerobic granular sludge then scanning electron microscope sem results were obtained using an f16502 sem phenom netherlands polymorph was identified by x ray diffraction xrd analysis with rigaku d max diffractometer using cu radiation with ni filtered cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å at 40 kv 40 ma with a step size of 0 02 and present time of 1 s at each step 2 5 micro ct analysis granule samples in seed sludge were scanned using a micro computed tomography micro ct machine brucker skyscan 2211 kontich belgium with a resolution of 1 μm and operated at 45 kv and 330 μa to analyze the internal structure of the angs and the 3d reconstruction model is completed using ctvox 3 3 software 2 6 dna extraction sequencing of 16s rrna genes and data analysis the samples were collected from seed sludge and sent to mijorbio shanghai china for dna extraction and amplicon sequencing according to miseq protocols dna quality was determined by 2 agarose gel electrophoresis for high throughput sequencing hts the v3 and v4 hypervariable regions of the 16 s rrna were amplified using 338 f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggact achvgggtwtctaat 3 the ensuing conditions of amplification were followed initial denaturation at 95 for 3 min followed by 29 cycles each of 94 for 30 s 55 for 30 s and 72 for 30 s and a final extension step at 72 for 5 min sequence analysis was performed using the qiime software package the statistical analysis included optimization sequence statistics distribution statistics dilution curve analysis diversity index analysis and taxonomy analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 calcification affected the basic properties organic composition and methane production performance of angs anaerobic granules are an aggregate of functional microorganisms its ratio of vss tss can indicate effective biomass retention which is a vital factor for maintaining excellent anaerobic performance 18 the composition and content of eps affect the properties of biofilms flocculation and structural stability of angs and control over proper eps production would be a feasible approach to enhance the performance in biological wastewater treatment systems in beneficial or detrimental environments 19 since pn ps and ha have been reported as the major components in extracted eps they are commonly used to represent eps content 20 therefore the vss tss pn ps and ha contents in extracted eps of the angs were analyzed as depicted in table s1 the density of calcified sludge is slightly higher than that of uncalcified sludge thus calcified sludge is deposited at the bottom of the uasb reactor chen et al identified that calcified granules covered the bottom of the sludge bed first 21 the vss tss values of uncalcified and calcified samples were 70 51 and 45 83 respectively indicating that uncalcified samples have a higher proportion of organic components fig 1 a as shown in fig 1b the contents of pn ps and ha were 7 32 mg g 1 vss 8 30 mg g 1 vss 2 05 mg g 1 vss in uncalcified samples respectively while in calcified samples they were 9 18 mg g 1 vss 3 87 mg g 1 vss 2 10 mg g 1 vss respectively and the total content of the three components in calcified samples decreased by 27 11 compared with that in uncalcified this may be because there were a lot of calcium deposits on the surface of calcified angs which prevented bacteria in the sludge from contacting organic matter reduced the probability of bacteria producing eps and therefore reduced the content of each component in eps eps can not only combine with cells to form a network structure to protect cells from dehydration and toxic substances 22 but also accelerate the formation of microbial aggregates by closely combining cells 23 therefore reduction in eps content may lead to a consequent decrease in the biological activity of angs however vss and tss contents in calcified sludge were higher than those in uncalcified sludge therefore calcified sludge is expected to retain considerable activity fig 1c illustrates the course of ch4 production in days during anaerobic digestion cumulative methane production in the calcification reactor after five days was 221 ml which was 26 82 lower than that in the uncalcified reactor and there was significant difference of sma between the uncalcified group and calcified group fig 1d the sma of the calcified reactor is 1 85 g codch4 gvss d 1 which is 16 23 lower than that of the uncalcified reactor 3 2 characterization of calcified cores the morphology of the calcified skeleton was observed using a sem the results are shown in fig 2 a and b the calcified skeleton is irregular in shape and consists of many nodular solids its interior is cluster like and contains several pores xrd analysis an efficient tool for determining the presence of a crystalline structure 24 was used to analyze the calcified core its diffractogram is shown in fig 2c comparing it with reference spectra the crystal was identified as calcite with 2θ values of 23 08 29 43 36 02 39 45 43 20 47 52 and 48 54 2θ 29 34 was the major peak as indicated in fig 2d 3 3 effect of calcification on the internal structure of granular sludge the microstructure distribution in the anaerobic granules was analyzed using micro ct and the results are shown in fig 3 and table s2 white red and green in fig 3 represent the pores biomass and inorganic crystals in the sludge respectively more inorganic crystals were deposited on the surface of the calcified samples than on the uncalcified samples fig 3a and b table s2 outlines the distribution of different density areas specifically divided into pores biomass and inorganic crystals compared to uncalcified anaerobic granules the biomass and pores of calcified particles had a smaller volume ratio however inorganic crystals occupied a much larger proportion the distribution of the pore sizes of the two granule samples was significantly different fig 3c in the uncalcified samples pores of 4 10 μm constituted 84 49 of the pores and it contained a small amount of 14 18 μm pores however 2 μm pores accounted for 65 62 of the calcified pores and there were no pores larger than 14 μm this indicates that calcification increased the number of smaller pores in the sludge and decreases the number of larger pores the mass transfer is the rate limiting step in the decomposition of organic pollutants by the anaerobic granules and pollutants are absorbed and converted by functional microorganisms after they enter the anaerobic granule through the pores 25 26 in larger pores the substrate can be transported through seepage therefore a good pore structure is extremely beneficial for the metabolic activity of anaerobic granules 11 however excessive calcium salt accumulation in the anaerobic granules will occupy space that is supposed to be available for functional microorganisms or cause pore blockage leading to a decrease in cell density metabolic activity and mass transfer performance ultimately this will influence the effect of anaerobic granules 11 however calcified sludge remained active as it also contains a certain volume of biomass and pores which is consistent with the results in fig 1c and d 3 4 effect of calcification on the microbial community 3 4 1 alpha diversity hts was used to analyze microbial community diversity and abundance of angs the chao and shannon indices decreased by 1 87 and 12 55 respectively in the calcified samples compared with the uncalcified samples the simpson index increased by 50 in the calcified samples compared with the uncalcified samples table s3 these results suggest that calcification led to a decrease in microbial diversity and abundance high microbial diversity and abundance are beneficial for anaerobic digestion 27 therefore calcification leads to reduced sludge activity which is consistent with the results in fig 1c and d 3 4 2 analysis of microbial community structure to investigate the effect of calcification on the microbial community structure of angs we analyzed the differences in bacteria and archaea by hts as shown in fig 4 a at the phylum level firmicutes and chloroflexi showed the highest abundance in the uncalcified and calcified samples respectively chloroflexi actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the most dominant functional species in both types of samples they accounted for 69 12 of the calcified samples and lower than 71 81 of the uncalcified samples since they are the principal hydrolytic and acidifying phyla 28 29 any decrease in their relative abundance may limit the hydrolysis acidification process of angs moreover the relative abundance of armatimonadetes aegiribacteria and latescibacteria indicated the most significant differences armatimonadetes and aegiribacteria were 94 78 and 94 14 less in uncalcified angs respectively than in calicified angs on the other hand latescibacteria was 96 9 more in uncalcified angs than in calcified angs at the genus level norank f norank o sbr1031 12 54 and norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 11 98 were the most dominant functional microorganisms in the uncalcified and calcified samples respectively fig 4b syntrophobacter anaerolinea candidatus caldatribacterium longilinea and norank f norank o rgb 13 54 9 were found in more abundance in the calcified samples than in the uncalcified samples however lactobacillus georgenia bacteroides bifidobacterium and norank f norank o aminicenantales were found in lesser amounts in the calcified samples than in the uncalcified samples thus it can be concluded that calcification alters the community structure as well as the dominant population of microorganisms at the phylum level the microbial composition of the granular sludge was nearly the same in both uncalcified and calcified samples with euryarchaeota being the dominant archaea compared with the uncalcified samples the relative abundance of euryarchaeota 91 24 and thaumarchaeota 4 42 in the calcified samples increased by 2 13 and 51 72 respectively while that of crenarchaeota 3 63 decreased by 45 51 fig 5 a euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota often co occur in the same anaerobic digestion system and have cooperative synergistic interactions 30 however as seen from the results calcification alters their proportions possibly leading to an imbalance in their synergistic interactions which reduces methanogenic activity at the genus level methanobacterium and methanosaeta were the dominant methanogenic archaea in both types of samples the archaeal community structure in the calcified samples changed considerably as compared with the structure in the uncalcified samples thus the relative abundance of methanobacterium 58 91 in the calcified samples increased by 11 8 while that of methanosaeta 9 72 and norank f norank o norank c bathyarchaeia 3 59 decreased by 34 0 and 44 6 respectively fig 5b since methanosaeta is a methanogen with acetic acid as its substrate 31 its reduction may lead to the accumulation of acidity as acetic acid produced by acidogenic bacteria is not consumed in time thus affecting methanogen activity in conclusion calcification may limit methane production efficiency by inhibiting hydrolytic fermentation and acetic acid type methane production processes 3 4 3 effect of calcification on the abundance of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg gene pathway and methane related enzyme pathway in sludge the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states software and the kegg database were used to compare and analyze gene abundance within the calcified and uncalcified samples the two most abundant pathways in uncalcified and calcified samples were identified to be ribosome ko03010 and purine metabolism ko00230 their relative abundances in uncalcified samples were 8 84 and 6 81 respectively which were all higher than their abundances of 8 35 and 6 44 in calcified samples respectively fig 6 a most importantly ko00860 is a methane metabolism pathway its abundance in calcified sample was 3 28 which was less than 6 24 in uncalcified sample this showed that calcification can reduce the gene abundance of the methane metabolism pathway the methanogenesis pathway requires the participation of related coenzymes such as formate dehydrogenase ec 1 2 1 2 acetyl coa synthase ec 6 2 1 1 coenzyme 420 dehydrogenase ec 1 12 98 1 and furan dehydrogenase ec 1 2 99 5 etc 32 33 except for the common pathway gene abundance the total abundance of genes for the hydrogenotrophic pathway in the uncalcified and calcified samples was 3 45 and 3 31 respectively while that for the acetotrophic pathway in calcified samples was 1 43 which was lower than the abundance of 1 47 in uncalcified samples fig 6b this indicateed that calcification weakened the sludges hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway and acetotrophic methanogenesis pathway which was consistent with the cumulative methane production and sma analysis results 4 conclusions this study indicated that some inorganic crystals are deposited in the form of calcite in calcified sludge which increases sludge density and deposits at the bottom of the anaerobic reactor the proportion of organic matter and eps content also decreased and the microbial community structure altered calcification was also found to reduce the efficiency of hydrolytic fermentation and acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in anaerobic fermentation systems which impacted methanogenesis activity in particular reduction in the abundance of chloroflexi actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes limited hydrolysis and fermentation rates furthermore reduction in the abundance of methanosaeta prevented acetic acid from being consumed in time leading to acidity accumulation the kegg pathway also indicated that calcification weakened the hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogenesis pathways from the perspective of the internal microstructure of the sludge some inorganic crystals were deposited on the surface of the sludge and the other part were deposited irregularly in the form of calcite in the particles occupying a part of the space that could be used for functional microorganisms and the proportion of macropores decreased which was not conducive to material exchange and reduced sludge activity eventually led to a decrease in cumulative methane production and sma credit authorship contribution statement yueru wu
