430,twelve actual evaporation datasets are evaluated for their ability to improve the performance of the fully distributed mesoscale hydrologic model mhm the datasets consist of satellite based diagnostic models mod16a2 ssebop alexi cmrset sebs satellite based prognostic models gleam v3 2a gleam v3 3a gleam v3 2b gleam v3 3b and reanalysis era5 merra 2 jra 55 four distinct multivariate calibration strategies basin average pixel wise spatial bias accounting and spatial bias insensitive using actual evaporation and streamflow are implemented resulting in 48 scenarios whose results are compared with a benchmark model calibrated solely with streamflow data a process diagnostic approach is adopted to evaluate the model responses with in situ data of streamflow and independent remotely sensed data of soil moisture from esa cci and terrestrial water storage from grace the method is implemented in the volta river basin which is a data scarce region in west africa for the period from 2003 to 2012 results show that the evaporation datasets have a good potential for improving model calibration but this is dependent on the calibration strategy all the multivariate calibration strategies outperform the streamflow only calibration the highest improvement in the overall model performance is obtained with the spatial bias accounting strategy 29 followed by the spatial bias insensitive strategy 26 and the pixel wise strategy 24 while the basin average strategy 20 gives the lowest improvement on average using evaporation data in addition to streamflow for model calibration decreases the model performance for streamflow 7 which is counterbalance by the increase in the performance of the terrestrial water storage 11 temporal dynamics of soil moisture 6 and spatial patterns of soil moisture 89 in general the top three best performing evaporation datasets are merra 2 gleam v3 3a and ssebop while the bottom three datasets are mod16a2 sebs and era5 however performances of the evaporation products diverge according to model responses and across climatic zones these findings open up avenues for improving process representation of hydrological models and

spatiotemporal variability of hydrological processes is the crux of effective water resource management global warming is expected to intensify i e accelerate the hydrological cycle thus increasing or decreasing evaporation depending on places donat et al 2016 famiglietti and rodell 2013 huntington 2006 evaporation is a dominant flux of the water cycle martens et al 2018 oki and kanae 2006 it represents the exchange of water and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere therefore evaporation can be used as a proxy for moisture availability and its consumption rate he et al 2019 joiner et al 2018 van der ent et al 2010 the basic theories and estimation methods of evaporation are widely documented e g chen and liu 2020 liou and kar 2014 mcmahon et al 2013 pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 accurate representation of evaporation in hydrological models is important for studies that link climate and land use change because evaporation is the central flux that defines land atmosphere interactions fisher et al 2017 mueller et al 2011 reliably modelling evaporation is essential in semi arid catchments where evaporation represents the dominant outgoing water flux in such environments a classical hydrological model calibration on streamflow alone could lead to important model biases more generally for catchments with strong anthropogenic influences on the water cycle e g irrigation schemes dams etc or in data scarce regions the inclusion of evaporation data in model calibration has the potential to better constrain a hydrological model rather than streamflow alone becker et al 2019 jiang and wang 2019 accordingly calibrating hydrological models solely based on streamflow is not sufficient to guarantee an accurate representation of the hydrological system because streamflow is the result of several inter linked processes thereby it masks spatial heterogeneity tobin and bennett 2017 wambura et al 2018 this limitation in model implementation has been overcome by the advent of multivariate calibration techniques using satellite based datasets which offers models a chance for better spatial heterogeneity efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 rakovec et al 2016 in the quest to improve process representation in hydrological models large scale distributed hydrological modelling faces the challenging requirement of spatially explicit observational datasets for model setup and performance evaluation clark et al 2017 fatichi et al 2016 hrachowitz and clark 2017 correspondingly satellite remote sensing srs and reanalysis datasets of various hydrological processes have been used as input data beck et al 2017 maggioni and massari 2018 or as calibration and evaluation data for hydrological models koppa and gebremichael 2020 mccabe et al 2017 evaporation estimates from srs are increasingly used in multivariate calibration of hydrological models because it is a key indicator of surface water availability evaporation is an essential source of information for better constraining the spatiotemporal representation of processes in hydrological models bai and liu 2018 cui et al 2019 talsma et al 2018 the increasing availability and diversity of gridded evaporation datasets has triggered many evaluation and comparison studies long et al 2014 vinukollu et al 2011b which highlight significant differences between the datasets and thereby indicate underlying uncertainty in the evaporation estimates baik et al 2018 lópez et al 2017 the uncertainty stems from the strong variability of bio geophysical variables that drive evaporation e g albedo net radiation surface roughness and temperature and the diversity of the model structures model parametrizations and input datasets used to estimate evaporation badgley et al 2015 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2020 therefore the choice and use of srs evaporation data in hydrological modelling should be done cautiously particularly in catchments with strong anthropogenic influences senkondo et al 2019 yang et al 2016 generally the following four approaches are adopted to evaluate gridded evaporation products i analysis of the variance between several products e g jimenez et al 2011 khan et al 2018 mueller et al 2011 senkondo et al 2019 trambauer et al 2014 ii point to pixel comparison with ground based measurements e g chen et al 2014 mccabe et al

weerasinghe et al 2020 and iv assessing the ability of evaporation datasets in improving the parameter estimation of hydrological models e g demirel et al 2018 immerzeel and droogers 2008 jiang et al 2020 pomeon et al 2018 winsemius et al 2008 assessing the uncertainty of evaporation estimates at large scale is challenging due to the limited availability of ground based measurements bhattarai et al 2019 ceperley et al 2017 the uncertainty in evaporation varies in space and according to climate regions blatchford et al 2020 vinukollu et al 2011a in evaluating the contribution of gridded evaporation datasets to hydrological model calibration some limitations can be denoted in previous studies most previous studies only use or compare few evaporation datasets e g kunnath poovakka et al 2016 vervoort et al 2014 and rarely if any investigate the use of reanalysis datasets i e retrospective analysis cf bosilovich et al 2008 which are an important source of spatial evaporation estimates feng et al 2019 usually a lumped or semi distributed model is used e g odusanya et al 2019 rientjes et al 2013 which does not harness the full potential of the gridded evaporation datasets that is their spatial patterns armstrong et al 2019 stisen et al 2018 most studies do not test different model calibration strategies with some exceptions that use a semi distributed model e g herman et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 finally a few studies use a bias insensitive metric to focus only on the spatial patterns of gridded evaporation products dembélé et al 2020a koch et al 2018 this study aims to fill current knowledge gaps by evaluating the utility of nine satellite based prognostic and diagnostic and three reanalysis evaporation datasets in improving the performance of a distributed hydrological model using four distinct calibration strategies this study does not intend to quantify the intrinsic accuracy of the evaporation products nor determine whether a product is better than the others in terms of absolute values rather it strives to evaluate their ability to improve the simulations of a distributed hydrological model when used as a calibration variable besides the high number and diversity of gridded evaporation datasets evaluated the novelty of this study is the implementation of four distinct model calibration strategies with a fully distributed hydrological model the evaluation of the model responses with multiple variables i e streamflow soil moisture and terrestrial water storage to test evaporation error propagation on other hydrological processes and the application of the experiment in a large basin spread across four eco climatic zones with considerable anthropogenic influence this study strives to answer two inter related research questions firstly what is the ability of satellite and reanalysis evaporation datasets to improve the overall predictive skill of a fully distributed hydrological model secondly how important is the model calibration strategy in improving the representation of hydrological processes the proposed research is carried out in the volta river basin located in west africa using the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm over a period of ten consecutive years 2003 2012 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the transboundary volta river basin vrb is shared among six countries of west africa i e burkina faso ghana togo mali benin and côte d ivoire and covers approximately 415 600 km2 fig 1 most of the basin lies below 400 m a s l with a predominantly flat topography fig 1b the volta river flows north south over a distance of 1 850 km and drains into the atlantic ocean at the gulf of guinea after transiting through lake volta 8 502 km2 formed by the akosombo dam 7 94 mm3 dembélé et al 2019 dembélé et al 2020a williams et al 2016 the basin area is composed of grassland interspersed with shrubs and trees 75 cropland 13 forest 9 water bodies 2 and bare land and settlements 1 fig 1c the vrb extends over four eco climatic zones i e sahelian sudano sahelian sudanian and guinean characterized by increasing vegetation density and receiving increasing precipitation from north to south fig 1a table 1 the information provided in table 1 is obtained from the global aridity index database trabucco and zomer 2018 and the wfdei meteorological data see table 2 weedon et al 2014 for the period 1979 2016 fig 1 and table 1 are adapted from dembélé et al 2020a the climate is driven by the inter tropical convergence zone itcz and varies from sub humid in the south to semi arid in the north dembélé et al 2019 fao giews 1998 mul et al 2015 actual evaporation varies between 70 and 90 of annual rainfall in the basin 2 2 distributed hydrological model the fully distributed mesoscale hydrologic model mhm is a conceptual model that simulates dominant hydrological processes e g evaporation soil moisture and discharge per grid cell in the modelling domain kumar et al 2013 samaniego et al 2010 samaniego et al 2011 provide a schematic representation of the processes accounted for in mhm a multiscale routing model based on the muskingum cunge method cunge 1969 is used for the routing of the total grid generated runoff through the river network thober et al 2019 the sub grid variability of the basin physical characteristics e g soil texture land cover is accounted for with a multiscale parameter regionalization technique samaniego et al 2017 the model parameters e g hydraulic conductivity soil porosity are linked to the basin physical characteristics via pedo transfer functions and global parameters thirty six global parameters cf pokhrel et al 2008 are tuned during model calibration for this study table s6 mhm was found reliable for modelling hydrological processes in the vrb dembélé et al 2020a the version 5 9 of mhm is used in this study reference evaporation e ref is calculated following the method of hargreaves and samani 1985 which was found to be reliable for semi arid regions like the vrb bai et al 2016 er raki et al 2010 gao et al 2017 e ref is formulated as follows 1 e ref κ r a λ t avg 17 8 t max t min 0 5 where r a mj m2 day is the extraterrestrial radiation computed based on the latitude of the location and the day of the year allen et al 1998 λ 2 45 mj kg is the latent heat of vaporization of water the unit of radiation is converted into equivalent water evaporation in mm day with the ratio r a λ the differences in advection or vapor transfer effect are compensated by the constant κ 0 0023 and t avg t max and t min represent the daily average maximum and minimum air temperature in degrees celcius c at a given location potential evaporation e p is calculated by adjusting e ref with a dynamical scaling function f ds based on leaf area index allen et al 1998 demirel et al 2018 therefore accounting for vegetation climate interactions bai et al 2018 birhanu et al 2019 jiao et al 2017 e p is formulated as follows 2 e p f ds e ref with 3 f ds a b 1 e c i la where a is the intercept term b is the vegetation dependent component and c represents the degree of nonlinearity of the leaf area index i la the coefficients a b and c are determined through model calibration in this study actual evaporation e a is defined as the sum of transpiration and evaporation from interception land and water bodies coenders gerrits et al 2020 shuttleworth 1993 e a is calculated as a fraction of e p from soil layers depending on soil moisture availability and the rooting depth feddes et al 1976 soil moisture is estimated by a multi layer infiltration capacity approach adopting a three layer soil scheme 0 5 5 30 and 30 100 cm depths terrestrial water storage at each grid cell is the sum of the surface and subsurface water storage i e lakes wetlands soil moisture reservoirs interflow and baseflow more information on the calculation of hydrological processes in mhm can be found in the work of kumar 2010 and samaniego et al 2010 2 3 input datasets the morphological datasets i e elevation slope land cover etc and meteorological datasets i e rainfall and air temperature used to set up and run the distributed model are described in table 2 the meteorological datasets are selected based on their accuracy dembélé and zwart 2016 and their suitability to plausibly represent hydrological processes in the vrb dembélé et al 2020b all morphological data are resampled to a resolution of 1 512 200 m at the equator using the nearest neighbor technique while the meteorological data are resampled to 0 0625 7 km using bilinear resampling due to the good ability of mhm in parameter transferability across scales dembélé et al 2020a the model is run at daily time step with a spatial discretization of 0 25 28 km corresponding to 619 modelling grid cells in the basin which attenuate the computational demand in situ streamflow data and gridded datasets of evaporation are used for model calibration section 2 4 the description of the evaporation datasets is provided in section 2 3 the quality control and the gap filling of the streamflow data are described by dembélé et al 2019 in addition to in situ streamflow srs datasets of soil moisture and terrestrial water storage are used to evaluate the model performance after calibration the surface soil moisture s u dataset is obtained from esa cci dorigo et al 2017 and represents the first soil layer i e 2 5 cm depth the blended product of both passive and active microwave products is used here gruber et al 2017 liu et al 2012 wagner et al 2012 the terrestrial water storage s t anomaly data release rl05 is obtained from grace landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2012 the ensemble arithmetic mean of different solutions from three processing centers i e center for space research at university of texas geoforschungs zentrum potsdam and jet propulsion laboratory is used in this study because it has been shown to be more effective in reducing noise in the earth s gravity signal than the individual solutions sakumura et al 2014 2 4 evaporation datasets twelve gridded actual evaporation datasets including nine srs based products mod16a2 ssebop alexi cmrset sebs gleam v3 2a gleam v3 3a gleam v3 2b gleam v3 3b and three reanalysis products era5 merra 2 jra 55 are evaluated in this study based on evaporation modelling approaches yilmaz et al 2014 the srs based datasets can be further classified as diagnostic products mod16a2 ssebop alexi cmrset sebs or prognostic products gleam v3 2a gleam v3 3a gleam v3 2b gleam v3 3b while the reanalysis datasets are all prognostic products a summary of the evaporation datasets is provided in table 3 and more details on each dataset can be found in the corresponding references four versions of the gleam product are evaluated they differ in terms of input data used for their production and in terms of their spatiotemporal coverage cf table 1 in martens et al 2017 the version v3 3 differs from the v3 2 in the following forcing datasets surface radiation near surface air temperature and land cover maps the versions v3 3a and v3 2a are produced with reanalysis satellite and gauge based datasets while the versions v3 3b and v3 2b are mainly produced with satellite datasets considerable differences can be observed both in the temporal dynamics and the spatial patterns of the 12 gridded evaporation datasets across the climatic zones in the vrb figs 2 and 3 2 5 model calibration and evaluation the modelling period extends from 2000 to 2012 with 3 years of model warm up 2000 2002 6 years for calibration 2003 2008 and 4 years for evaluation 2009 2012 available daily in situ streamflow datasets from 11 gauging locations are used for model calibration and evaluation while monthly datasets of e a table 3 are used for model calibration and monthly datasets of s u esa cci and s t grace are used for model evaluation all the e a datasets are rescaled to 0 25 using bilinear interpolation to match the modelling spatial resolution and sub monthly data are aggregated to monthly resolution only the first soil layer of mhm is compared to the esa cci data which represents the surface soil moisture first a streamflow only calibration is adopted as benchmark then the contribution of evaporation datasets in improving hydrological model calibration is tested by simultaneously constraining the model with streamflow and each of the twelve gridded evaporation datasets using four calibration strategies for each fig 4 therefore 48 scenarios i e 12 datasets times 4 calibration strategies are developed and compared to the benchmark calibration to evaluate the impact of different calibration strategies on model performance the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 is used for parameter estimation using 5 000 iterations for each of the 48 scenarios and for the benchmark model calibration the computational runtime is about 6 days for each of the 49 model simulations on a computer intel xeon processor e5 2697 v3 with 64 gb of ram 2 5 1 calibration on streamflow data benchmark the benchmark calibration case q is elaborated by calibrating the hydrological model solely with streamflow q data the objective function for case q φq to be minimized is obtained by calculating the average kling gupta efficiency e kg over the 11 gauging points for q in the basin and subtracting it from 1 φq ranges from its optimal value that is 0 to positive infinity and is formulated as follows 4 φ q 1 1 g i 1 g e kg i q mod i q obs i with 5 e kg 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where g is the total number of streamflow gauging stations in the basin e kg is the modified kling gupta efficiency kling et al 2012 calculated for the observed q obs i and modelled q mod i streamflow of the ith gauging point e kg is composed of the pearson correlation coefficient r the bias term β i e the ratio of the means and the variability term γ i e the ratio of the coefficients of variation cf eq 8 e kg ranges from negative infinity to its optimal value that is 1 a model is better than the mean observed flow if e kg 0 41 knoben et al 2019 2 5 2 multivariate calibration with streamflow and evaporation 2 5 2 1 spatial pattern efficiency metric a bias insensitive and multi component metric developed by dembélé et al 2020a is used to quantify the degree of reproduction of the spatial patterns of hydrological processes the proposed spatial pattern efficiency e sp metric only considers the spatial pattern of the underlying variables and ignores their absolute values e sp is an integrated measure of the dynamics the spatial variability and the locational matching of grid cells between the modelled x mod and observed x obs variables with x obs and x mod composed of n cells e sp is defined as follows 6 e sp 1 r s 1 2 γ 1 2 α 1 2 with 7 r s 1 6 1 n d i 2 n n 2 1 8 γ σ mod μ mod σ obs μ obs and 9 α 1 e rms z x mod z x obs where r s is the spearman rank order correlation coefficient with d i the difference between the ranks of the i th cell of x mod and x obs γ is the variability ratio i e the ratio of the coefficients of variation and α the spatial location matching term calculated as the root mean squared error e rms of the standardized values z scores z x of x mod and x obs dembélé et al 2020a e sp ranges from negative infinity to its optimal value that is unity e sp 0 when there is a moderate relationship between the ranks of the observed and modelled variables i e r s 0 55 and e sp 0 67 when the ranks are not related i e r s 0 more details on e sp are provided by dembélé et al 2020a 2 5 2 2 multivariate calibration strategies four multivariate calibration strategies with distinct objective functions are proposed to simultaneously consider q and e a data as calibration variables each objective function eqs 11 15 17 and 19 is formulated based on the euclidean distance approach eq 10 in which all elements are equally weighted khu and madsen 2005 the euclidian distance d e between two points x and y of coordinates x 1 x 2 x n and y 1 y 2 y n in an n dimensional space upton and cook 2014 is given by 10 d e i 1 n x i y i 2 the four multivariate calibration strategies differ from each other based on the formulation of the sub objective function for e a i e φ e a while φq remains unchanged the observed variable e a obs and the modelled variable e a mod of actual evaporation are represented each by a 3d array of dimension m x n x t with m the number of rows n the number of columns and t the number of time steps fig 5 for this study m represents 40 latitude rows n represents 36 longitude columns and t represents 72 months i e calibration period the modelling domain has 1440 grid cells of which 619 are active i e grid cells representing the basin area the inactive grid cells are masked out during the calculation of the performance metrics in the following e a t is a 2d array of actual evaporation represented by all cells i j in the spatial domain ω and e a i j is the time series of actual evaporation for a given cell at row i and column j the four multivariate calibration strategies are defined as follows 1 temporal basin average ba the matching of the observed and modelled e a is done on basin averaged time series the sub objective function φ e a ba to be minimized is obtained by calculating the e kg for the observed and modelled time series of basin average actual evaporation e a obs and e a mod and subtracting it from 1 the objective function φba is formulated as follows 11 φ ba φ q 2 φ e a ba 2 with 12 φ e a ba 1 e kg e a mod e a obs where 13 e a mod t 1 m n t 1 i j ω t e a mod t i j and 14 e a obs t 1 m n t 1 i j ω t e a obs t i j 2 temporal pixel wise pw the matching of the modelled and observed e a is done individually on the time series of each grid cell in the basin the e kg is calculated for the observed and modelled time series of e a at each grid cell in the basin and the sub objective function φ e a pw to be minimized is the average of the e kg calculated for all grids subtracted from 1 the objective function φpw is formulated as follows 15 φ pw φ q 2 φ e a pw 2 with 16 φ e a pw 1 1 m n 1 i m 1 j n t t e kg e a mod i j e a obs i j 3 spatial bias accounting sb the matching of the modelled and observed e a is done for all pixels at each time step the e kg is calculated at each time step between all the pixels of the observed and modelled e a the sub objective function φ e a sb to be minimized is the average of the e kg calculated for all time steps subtracted from 1 the objective function φsb is formulated as follows 17 φ sb φ q 2 φ e a sb 2 with 18 φ e a sb 1 1 t t 1 i j ω t e kg e a mod t i j e a obs t i j 4 spatial bias insensitive sp the sub objective function φ e a sp to be minimized is similarly calculated as for the sb calibration except that a bias insensitive metric i e e sp is used as skill score instead of e kg the objective function φsp is formulated as follows 19 φ sp φ q 2 φ e a sp 2 with 20 φ e a sp 1 1 t t 1 i j ω t e sp e a mod t i j e a obs t i j all the objective functions φba φpw φsb and φsp vary between their optimal value that is 0 and positive infinity except case sp that is a bias insensitive approach other calibration strategies consider the absolute values i e raw data of evaporation 2 6 model output evaluation in addition to daily streamflow data independent monthly datasets of satellite based soil moisture s u and terrestrial water storage s t table 2 are used for model evaluation the temporal dynamics of streamflow is evaluated with e kg both the temporal dynamics and the spatial patterns of modelled s u are evaluated using the pearson correlation coefficient r and the spatial pattern efficiency metric e sp while only the temporal dynamics of modelled s t is assessed using r due to the coarse spatial resolution of the grace data the skill scores for the temporal dynamics are calculated for each pixel or gauging point in the basin while spatial skill scores are calculated per time step 3 results in general the trend of the model performance high vs low scores among the scenarios i e evaporation datasets vs calibration strategies is conserved between the calibration and the evaluation periods for all variables therefore the following results are presented for the entire simulation period that comprises the calibration and evaluation periods whose results are additionally provided in the supplementary materials 3 1 model performance for multiple hydrological processes in the vrb the model performance for various hydrological processes in the vrb reveals the potential of srs and reanalysis evaporation datasets to improve the model responses if the appropriate calibration strategy is used fig 6 detailed results are provided in the supplementary material figures s1 s2 for q the benchmark model i e q only yields a median e kg of 0 69 in the multivariate calibration scenarios i e q e a the e kg of q varies between 0 42 for sebs with case pw to 0 73 for cmrset with case sp the best multivariate calibration strategy is the case sb with an average e kg of 0 68 and 75 of the evaporation datasets producing a higher model performance than the benchmark followed by case sp e kg 0 67 case pw e kg 0 63 and case ba e kg 0 60 the top 3 best evaporation datasets for the average e kg of q over the calibration strategies are gleam v3 2b e kg 0 71 gleam v3 3b e kg 0 71 and gleam v3 3a e kg 0 70 while the worst are alexi e kg 0 61 sebs e kg 0 56 and era5 e kg 0 51 the decrease in the model performance for q in the multivariate calibration might be an artifact caused by equifinality i e non uniqueness of model parameters beven 2006 savenije 2001 that occurred with the q only calibration which gives more degrees of freedom for constraining the model parameter space dembélé et al 2020a in fact figures s68 s71 show that the high performance for q achieved with the q only calibration is obtained at the expense of poor performance for other hydrological processes while the multivariate calibrations with q e a result in parameter sets that provide equivalent model performance for q but higher model performance for s t and s u these results support the findings of dembélé et al 2020a thereby confirming the pitfalls of the q only calibration bouaziz et al 2020 stisen et al 2018 the evaporation datasets show a high potential to improve the temporal dynamics of modelled s t as 79 of the multivariate calibration scenarios outperform the case q r 0 73 with an average r of 0 81 the lowest average r of s t among the calibration strategies is given by case sp r 0 79 but interestingly it outperforms the case q the highest performances for median r of s t are obtained with merra 2 r 0 87 ssebop r 0 87 and alexi r 0 84 while lowest performances are given by sebs r 0 77 mod16a2 r 0 76 and era5 r 0 74 the temporal dynamics of modelled s u show a higher model performance than that of s t with an average r of 0 91 and 98 of the multivariate calibration scenarios that outperform the case q r 0 86 the case ba performs similarly to case pw and case sp with an average r of 0 91 across evaporation datasets and outperformed by case sb r 0 93 the highest r of s u is 0 93 and it is obtained with gleam v3 3a merra 2 and gleam v3 2a while the weakest scores are obtained with mod16a2 r 0 91 sebs r 0 89 and era5 r 0 89 the representation of the spatial patterns of s u improves for all the multivariate scenarios as compared to the case q however case sb e sp 0 0 has the highest average performance across the evaporation datasets while case ba e sp 0 04 has the lowest performance the best evaporation datasets for the simulation of the spatial patterns of s u considering all the calibration strategies are ssebop e sp 0 02 merra 2 e sp 0 01 and gleam v3 3a e sp 0 01 while the worst are mod16a2 e sp 0 04 sebs e sp 0 07 and era5 e sp 0 09 in general it is observed that the model performances for s t and s u improve for most of the multivariate calibration scenarios among the multivariate calibration strategies case sb gives the best results considering the average model performance for all variables q s t and s u in fig 7 b the highest average relative change in model performance by multivariate calibration strategies as compared to the q only calibration is obtained with case sb is 29 followed by case sp 26 case pw 24 and case ba 20 consequently all grid based model calibration strategies outperform the basin average calibration case ba which gives the lowest average model performance these results highlight the value of calibrating hydrological models on the full extent of gridded evaporation datasets it is noted that in most of the scenarios calibrating the model only on the spatial patterns case sp of the evaporation datasets thereby ignoring their absolute values improves the predictive skill of the model with a higher performance than that of case q and case ba fig 6 with these findings case sp i e only spatial patterns of evaporation datasets can be preferred to case sb i e absolute values of evaporation datasets for the calibration of hydrological models because the propagation of the errors of the evaporation estimates into the modelling process can be case specific and depends on the model structure this observation also draw attention on the adequacy of the model for a given experiment addor and melsen 2019 moreover for a given evaporation dataset the spatial variation in biases in the estimates can lead to contrasting performance across regions jung et al 2019 nicholson 2000 the spatial patterns of alexi followed by those of mod16a2 and cmrset were the least informative for the model calibration in case sp fig 6 considering all hydrological processes and model calibration strategies the top three best performing evaporation datasets are merra 2 gleam v3 3a and ssebop while the bottom three datasets are mod16a2 sebs and era5 figs 6 and 7a however it is noteworthy that they outperform the q only calibration when used in case sp meaning that only their spatial patterns improve the model performance in general the versions 3 3 of gleam show a slightly higher model performance than the versions 3 2 3 2 impact of calibration strategies on spatial patterns different model calibration strategies result in different spatial patterns of modelled e a and s u as shown for selected scenarios in fig 8 additional maps of e a s u and s t for other scenarios are provided in the supplementary material figures s58 59 figures s65 66 and figures s38 39 along with those obtained with the q only calibration figure s12 in general the south to north gradient of increasing aridity observed with modelled e a and s u is well depicted for all the calibration strategies however considerable mismatches in the variability of the patterns are observed among the calibration strategies such discrepancies in spatial patterns have implications for water resources assessment including water accounting flood and drought monitoring and prediction aghakouchak et al 2015 klemas 2014 teng et al 2017 west et al 2019 knowing when flood or drought events occur is important but knowing the spatial extent of the event is crucial for deploying efficient adaptation and mitigation strategies brunner et al 2020 diaz et al 2019 he et al 2020 consequently improving the representation of the spatial patterns of hydrological processes should be a key consideration in modelling with spatially distributed models the comparison of the maps of modelled e a fig 8a with the reference alexi dataset fig 3 reveals that the spatial patterns of e a in the case ba show the highest mismatch with the reference thereby unveiling the potential pitfalls of the basin average calibration the highest improvement of the spatial patterns of s u is obtained with case sb 101 followed by case sp 93 and case pw 85 while case ba 76 provides the least improvement fig 7b 3 3 analysis per climatic zone the analysis of the model performance according to climatic zones is done for all hydrological processes except q because of the few gauging stations which are unevenly distributed across the vrb cf fig 1 the results reveal contrasting model performances across climatic zones fig 9 additional results are provided in the supplementary material figures s3 s11 in average the model performance at predicting the temporal dynamics of s t and the spatial patterns of s u is higher in the intermediate climatic regions i e sudano sahelian and sudanian zones than in the driest and wettest regions i e sahelian and guinean zones of the vrb in terms of the temporal dynamics of s u the model performance decreases slightly from the driest to the wettest regions in general the multivariate calibration scenarios with evaporation datasets lead to a higher model performance for all hydrological processes in all climatic zones as compared to the q only calibration fig 9 figure s13 although the gleam products globally perform well they are the least effective at predicting the temporal dynamics of s t in the sahelian zone the top three best evaporation datasets for improving the average model performance across climatic zones are ssebop merra 2 and alexi for the temporal dynamics of s t merra 2 gleam v3 3a and gleam v3 2a for the temporal dynamics of s u and gleam v3 3b gleam v3 3a and gleam v3 2a for the spatial patterns of s u similar to results obtained at the entire vrb scale section 3 1 mod16a2 sebs and era5 still show the lowest contribution in improving the model performance across different climatic zones more details on the ranking of the evaporation datasets are provided in the supplementary material tables s1 s5 figures s14 s21 and s40 contrary to the basin scale analysis case sp is the least efficient calibration strategy per climatic zones this result can be justified by the fact that the model calibration on the spatial patterns of evaporation datasets is done at the scale of the vrb consequently the spatial variability of hydrological processes at large scale is not representative of the climatic zones where the patterns are more homogenous for regions with strong spatial variability sub region model calibration on spatial patterns can be a way forward in overcoming the pitfalls of domain wide calibration thereby ultimately resulting in a higher model performance 4 discussions the results presented are primarily valid for the vrb because errors in evaporation estimates are known to vary according to region hartanto et al 2017 sörensson and ruscica 2018 however the innovative model evaluation approach proposed in this study is not location specific and can be applied to other regions using a grid based hydrological model the robust evaluation approach for evaporation datasets is based on multiple hydrological processes and responds to the recent call of the scientific community for process oriented diagnostics of earth system models maloney et al 2019 melsen et al 2016 the same methodology can be deployed for the evaluation of other spatial observational datasets such as gridded soil moisture estimates using robust metrics dong et al 2019 and subsequently be used to estimate their value for hydrological modelling moreover this study highlights the potential of satellite and reanalysis evaporation datasets to improve the representation of various hydrological processes which might guide modellers in choosing the adequate product for their applications and support the data developers in their quest of improving global estimates of evaporation mccabe et al 2019 it must be noted that the overall ranking in fig 9 does not systematically determine whether a dataset is good or bad rather it shows which evaporation product provides the highest or lowest model performance for a given hydrological flux or state variable only the skill scores allow a judgement on the ability of a given dataset to yield a good model performance there might be uncertainties related to the rescaling of the evaporation datasets from their native spatial resolutions to that of the hydrological modelling resolution however for a fair comparison all the datasets should be used at the same spatiotemporal resolution the high performance of the gleam datasets is most likely due to the integration of soil moisture information in the calculation of actual evaporation therefore gleam is expected to perform well for hydrological modelling surprisingly merra 2 ranks among the best evaporation datasets notwithstanding its coarse spatial resolution the high performance of merra 2 can be explained by its high temporal resolution which might compensate its lower spatial resolution in general there is no clear tendency of srs datasets to outperform the reanalysis datasets and vice versa thus besides their use as forcing data reanalysis datasets represent a valuable source of information for the calibration of hydrological models satellite data of soil moisture and terrestrial water storage used for model evaluation in this study are not free of errors however at large scale and in poorly gauged regions they are the only source of data that can be used for spatial model evaluation peters lidard et al 2019 overall this study strives to provide solutions to some of the current challenges in hydrology i e modelling methods uncertainty and spatial variability blöschl et al 2019 the proposed methodology represents an innovative way to use satellite and reanalysis datasets to improve process representation in hydrological models clark et al 2015 peters lidard et al 2017 develop hydrological water accounting hunink et al 2019 and advance prediction in ungauged basins hrachowitz et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 future studies should test the advantages of a multi scale calibration framework that accounts for both domain wide and sub domain spatial heterogeneity which might lead to better prediction of spatial patterns across climatic zones at large scale calibration strategies with multiple non commensurable variables as well as spatial patterns is a way forward in advancing process representation in hydrological models dembélé et al 2020a nijzink et al 2018 zink et al 2018 more importantly the choice of the calibration strategy or the objective function is determinant for high model performance mainly under a changing environment fowler et al 2018 schaefli et al 2010 uncertainties in the structure of the mhm model might influence the modelled hydrological processes for instance the calculation of actual evaporation section 2 1 might be subject to a double accounting of stress from both the leaf area index and soil moisture however in such case the sources of stress can be proportionally adjusted by the model parameters during the calibration further work should investigate the impact of different model structures on the methodology proposed in this study and assess the parameter sensitivity of mhm depending on calibration strategies and variables which is beyond the scope of the current study besides improving model calibration satellite and reanalysis datasets can play an important role in identifying deficiencies in model structures and contribute to model improvement hulsman et al 2020 as the accuracy of the satellite and reanalysis datasets depends on the quality of the input meteorological datasets used for their production it is also important to assess the impact of precipitation datasets on evaporation modelling dembélé et al 2020b mao and wang 2017 or and lehmann 2019 finally an ensemble product that merges different evaporation datasets is a potential way forward in reducing regional uncertainties and thereby improving global estimates da motta paca et al 2019 jiménez et al 2018 such advances in evaporation product development can facilitate prediction in ungauged basins using earth observations 5 conclusion four model calibration strategies are used to evaluate twelve satellite and reanalysis datasets in the large transboundary volta river basin located in west africa the experiment is done with the mhm model over the period 2003 2012 the key findings can be summarized as follows satellite and reanalysis datasets can improve the predictive skill of the hydrological model if the appropriate calibration strategy is used overall merra 2 gleam v3 3a and ssebop individually provide the highest contribution in improving the model performance model calibration on the full extent of the gridded evaporation datasets result in a higher model performance than calibration on basin average estimates using only the spatial patterns of gridded evaporation data for model calibration and not their absolute values yields higher model performance than classical approaches based on basin average evaporation signal or based only on streamflow contrasting spatial patterns of soil moisture are obtained depending on the modelling scenarios with differences in the model performances according to climatic zones these findings contribute to solving current challenges related to large scale hydrological modelling and provide avenues for improving process representation with the use of increasingly available satellite and reanalysis datasets improving the representation of the spatial patterns of hydrological processes should be a key consideration in modelling with spatially distributed models which would allow better predicting floods and droughts moreover the results provide insights to the developers of the evaporation datasets and might serve of guidance for future developments however a replication of the proposed methodology to evaluate evaporation datasets should be applied in other regions with different hydro climatic conditions and with different hydrological and land surface models future work should also investigate the possibility of prediction in ungauged basins solely from earth observation datasets which are increasingly and readily

430,twelve actual evaporation datasets are evaluated for their ability to improve the performance of the fully distributed mesoscale hydrologic model mhm the datasets consist of satellite based diagnostic models mod16a2 ssebop alexi cmrset sebs satellite based prognostic models gleam v3 2a gleam v3 3a gleam v3 2b gleam v3 3b and reanalysis era5 merra 2 jra 55 four distinct multivariate calibration strategies basin average pixel wise spatial bias accounting and spatial bias insensitive using actual evaporation and streamflow are implemented resulting in 48 scenarios whose results are compared with a benchmark model calibrated solely with streamflow data a process diagnostic approach is adopted to evaluate the model responses with in situ data of streamflow and independent remotely sensed data of soil moisture from esa cci and terrestrial water storage from grace the method is implemented in the volta river basin which is a data scarce region in west africa for the period from 2003 to 2012 results show that the evaporation datasets have a good potential for improving model calibration but this is dependent on the calibration strategy all the multivariate calibration strategies outperform the streamflow only calibration the highest improvement in the overall model performance is obtained with the spatial bias accounting strategy 29 followed by the spatial bias insensitive strategy 26 and the pixel wise strategy 24 while the basin average strategy 20 gives the lowest improvement on average using evaporation data in addition to streamflow for model calibration decreases the model performance for streamflow 7 which is counterbalance by the increase in the performance of the terrestrial water storage 11 temporal dynamics of soil moisture 6 and spatial patterns of soil moisture 89 in general the top three best performing evaporation datasets are merra 2 gleam v3 3a and ssebop while the bottom three datasets are mod16a2 sebs and era5 however

spatiotemporal variability of hydrological processes is the crux of effective water resource management global warming is expected to intensify i e accelerate the hydrological cycle thus increasing or decreasing evaporation depending on places donat et al 2016 famiglietti and rodell 2013 huntington 2006 evaporation is a dominant flux of the water cycle martens et al 2018 oki and kanae 2006 it represents the exchange of water and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere therefore evaporation can be used as a proxy for moisture availability and its consumption rate he et al 2019 joiner et al 2018 van der ent et al 2010 the basic theories and estimation methods of evaporation are widely documented e g chen and liu 2020 liou and kar 2014 mcmahon et al 2013 pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 accurate representation of evaporation in hydrological models is important for studies that link climate and land use change because evaporation is the central flux that defines land atmosphere interactions fisher et al 2017 mueller et al 2011 reliably modelling evaporation is essential in semi arid catchments where evaporation represents the dominant outgoing water flux in such environments a classical hydrological model calibration on streamflow alone could lead to important model biases more generally for catchments with strong anthropogenic influences on the water cycle e g irrigation schemes dams etc or in data scarce regions the inclusion of evaporation data in model calibration has the potential to better constrain a hydrological model rather than streamflow alone becker et al 2019 jiang and wang 2019 accordingly calibrating hydrological models solely based on streamflow is not sufficient to guarantee an accurate representation of the hydrological system because streamflow is the result of several inter linked processes thereby it masks spatial heterogeneity tobin and bennett 2017 wambura et al 2018 this limitation in model implementation has been overcome by the advent of multivariate calibration techniques using satellite based datasets which offers models a chance for better spatial heterogeneity efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 rakovec et al 2016 in the quest to improve process representation in hydrological models large scale distributed hydrological modelling faces the challenging requirement of spatially explicit observational datasets for model setup and performance evaluation clark et al 2017 fatichi et al 2016 hrachowitz and clark 2017 correspondingly satellite remote sensing srs and reanalysis datasets of various hydrological processes have been used as input data beck et al 2017 maggioni and massari 2018 or as calibration and evaluation data for hydrological models koppa and gebremichael 2020 mccabe et al 2017 evaporation estimates from srs are increasingly used in multivariate calibration of hydrological models because it is a key indicator of surface water availability evaporation is an essential source of information for better constraining the spatiotemporal representation of processes in hydrological models bai and liu 2018 cui et al 2019 talsma et al 2018 the increasing availability and diversity of gridded evaporation datasets has triggered many evaluation and comparison studies long et al 2014 vinukollu et al 2011b which highlight significant differences between the datasets and thereby indicate underlying uncertainty in the evaporation estimates baik et al 2018 lópez et al 2017 the uncertainty stems from the strong variability of bio geophysical variables that drive evaporation e g albedo net radiation surface roughness and temperature and the diversity of the model structures model parametrizations and input datasets used to estimate evaporation badgley et al 2015 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2020 therefore the choice and use of srs evaporation data in hydrological modelling should be done cautiously particularly in catchments with strong anthropogenic influences senkondo et al 2019 yang et al 2016 generally the following four approaches are adopted to evaluate gridded evaporation products i analysis of the variance between several

evaporation datasets to hydrological model calibration some limitations can be denoted in previous studies most previous studies only use or compare few evaporation datasets e g kunnath poovakka et al 2016 vervoort et al 2014 and rarely if any investigate the use of reanalysis datasets i e retrospective analysis cf bosilovich et al 2008 which are an important source of spatial evaporation estimates

their spatial patterns armstrong et al 2019 stisen et al 2018 most studies do not test different model calibration strategies with some exceptions that use a semi distributed model e g herman et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 finally a few studies use a bias insensitive metric to focus only on the spatial patterns of gridded evaporation products dembélé et al 2020a koch et al 2018 this study aims to fill current knowledge gaps by evaluating the utility of nine satellite based prognostic and diagnostic and three reanalysis evaporation datasets in improving the performance of a distributed hydrological model using four distinct calibration strategies this study does not intend to quantify the intrinsic accuracy of the evaporation products nor determine whether a product is better than the others in terms of absolute values rather it strives to evaluate their ability to improve the simulations of a distributed hydrological model when used as a calibration variable besides the high number and diversity of gridded evaporation datasets evaluated the novelty of this study is the implementation of four distinct model calibration strategies with a fully distributed hydrological model the evaluation of the model responses with multiple variables i e streamflow soil moisture and terrestrial water storage to test evaporation error propagation on other hydrological processes and the application of the experiment in a large basin spread across four eco climatic zones with considerable anthropogenic influence this study strives to answer two inter related research questions firstly what is the ability of satellite and reanalysis evaporation datasets to improve the overall predictive skill of a fully distributed hydrological model secondly how important is the model calibration strategy in improving the representation of hydrological processes the proposed research is carried out in the volta river basin located in west africa using the mesoscale hydrologic model mhm over a period of ten consecutive years 2003 2012 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the transboundary volta river basin vrb is shared among six countries of west africa i e burkina faso ghana togo mali benin and côte d ivoire and covers approximately 415 600 km2 fig 1 most of the basin lies below 400 m a s l with a predominantly flat topography fig 1b the volta river flows north south over a distance of 1 850 km and drains into the atlantic ocean at the gulf of guinea after transiting through lake volta 8 502 km2 formed by the akosombo dam 7 94 mm3 dembélé et al 2019 dembélé et al 2020a williams et al 2016 the basin area is composed of grassland interspersed with shrubs and trees 75 cropland 13 forest 9 water bodies 2 and bare land and settlements 1 fig 1c the vrb extends over four eco climatic zones i e sahelian sudano sahelian sudanian and guinean characterized by increasing vegetation density and receiving increasing precipitation from north to south fig 1a table 1 the

et al 2020a the version 5 9 of mhm is used in this study reference evaporation e ref is calculated following the method of hargreaves and samani 1985 which was found to be reliable for semi arid regions like the vrb bai et al 2016 er raki et al 2010 gao et al 2017 e ref is formulated as follows 1 e ref κ r a λ t avg 17 8 t max t min 0 5 where r a mj m2 day is the extraterrestrial radiation computed based on the latitude of the location and the day of the year allen et al 1998 λ 2 45 mj kg is the latent heat of vaporization of water the unit of radiation is converted into equivalent water evaporation in mm day with the ratio r a λ the differences in advection or vapor transfer effect are compensated by the constant κ 0 0023 and t avg t max and t min represent the daily average maximum and minimum air temperature in degrees celcius c at a given location potential evaporation e p is calculated by adjusting e ref with a dynamical scaling function f ds based on leaf area index allen et al 1998 demirel et al 2018 therefore accounting for vegetation climate interactions bai et al 2018 birhanu et al 2019 jiao et al 2017 e p is formulated as follows 2 e p f ds e ref with 3 f ds a b 1 e c i la where a is the intercept term b is the vegetation dependent component and c represents the degree of nonlinearity of the leaf area index i la the coefficients a b and c are determined through model calibration in this study actual evaporation e a is defined as the sum of transpiration and evaporation from interception land and water bodies coenders gerrits et al 2020 shuttleworth 1993 e a is calculated as a fraction of e p from soil layers depending on soil moisture availability and the rooting depth feddes et al 1976 soil moisture is estimated by a multi layer infiltration capacity approach adopting a three layer soil scheme 0 5 5 30 and 30 100 cm depths terrestrial water storage at each grid cell is the sum of the surface and subsurface water storage i e lakes wetlands soil moisture reservoirs interflow and baseflow more information on the calculation of hydrological processes in mhm can be found in the work of kumar 2010 and samaniego et al 2010 2 3 input datasets the morphological datasets i e elevation slope land cover etc and meteorological datasets i e rainfall and air temperature used to set up and run the distributed model are described in table 2 the meteorological datasets are selected based on their accuracy dembélé and zwart 2016 and their suitability to plausibly represent hydrological processes in the vrb dembélé et al 2020b all morphological data are resampled to a resolution of 1 512 200 m at the equator using the nearest neighbor technique while the meteorological data are resampled to 0 0625 7 km using bilinear resampling due to the good ability of mhm in parameter transferability across scales dembélé et al 2020a the model is run at daily time step with a spatial discretization of 0 25 28 km corresponding to 619 modelling grid cells in the basin which attenuate the computational demand in situ streamflow data and gridded datasets of evaporation are used for model calibration section 2 4 the description of the evaporation datasets is provided in section 2 3 the quality control and the gap filling of the streamflow data are described by dembélé et al 2019 in addition to in situ streamflow srs datasets of soil moisture and terrestrial water storage are used to evaluate the model performance after calibration the surface soil moisture s u dataset is obtained from esa cci dorigo et al 2017 and represents the first soil layer i e 2 5 cm depth the blended product of both passive and active microwave products is used here gruber et al 2017 liu et al 2012 wagner et al 2012 the terrestrial water storage s t anomaly data release rl05 is obtained from grace landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2012 the ensemble arithmetic mean of different solutions from three processing centers i e center for space research at university of texas geoforschungs zentrum potsdam and jet propulsion laboratory is used in this study because it has been shown to be more effective in reducing noise in the earth s gravity signal than the individual solutions sakumura et al 2014 2 4 evaporation datasets twelve gridded actual evaporation datasets including nine srs based products mod16a2 ssebop alexi cmrset sebs gleam v3 2a gleam v3 3a gleam v3 2b gleam v3 3b and three reanalysis products era5 merra 2 jra 55 are evaluated in this study based on evaporation modelling approaches yilmaz et al 2014 the srs based datasets can be further classified as diagnostic products mod16a2 ssebop alexi cmrset sebs or prognostic products gleam v3 2a gleam v3 3a gleam v3 2b gleam v3 3b while the reanalysis datasets are all prognostic products a summary of the evaporation datasets is provided in table 3 and more details on each dataset can be found in the corresponding references four versions of the gleam product are evaluated they differ in terms of input data used for their production and in terms of their spatiotemporal coverage cf table 1 in martens et al 2017 the version v3 3 differs from the v3 2 in the following forcing datasets surface radiation near surface air temperature and land cover maps the versions v3 3a and v3 2a are produced with reanalysis satellite and gauge based datasets while the versions v3 3b and v3 2b are mainly produced with satellite datasets considerable differences can be observed both in the temporal dynamics and the spatial patterns of the 12 gridded evaporation datasets across the climatic zones in the vrb figs 2 and 3 2 5 model calibration and evaluation the modelling period extends from 2000 to 2012 with 3 years of model warm up 2000 2002 6 years for calibration 2003 2008 and 4 years for evaluation 2009 2012 available daily in situ streamflow datasets from 11 gauging locations are used for model calibration and evaluation while monthly datasets of e a table 3 are used for model calibration and monthly datasets of s u esa cci and s t grace are used for model evaluation all the e a datasets are rescaled to 0 25 using bilinear interpolation to match the modelling spatial resolution and sub monthly data are aggregated to monthly resolution only the first soil layer of mhm is compared to the esa cci data which represents the surface soil moisture first a streamflow only calibration is adopted as benchmark then the contribution of evaporation datasets in improving hydrological model calibration is tested by simultaneously constraining the model with streamflow and each of the twelve gridded evaporation datasets using four calibration strategies for each fig 4 therefore 48 scenarios i e 12 datasets times 4 calibration strategies are developed and compared to the benchmark calibration to evaluate the impact of different calibration strategies on model performance the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 is used for parameter estimation using 5 000 iterations for each of the 48 scenarios and for the benchmark model calibration the computational runtime is about 6 days for each of the 49 model simulations on a computer intel xeon processor e5 2697 v3 with 64 gb of ram 2 5 1 calibration on streamflow data benchmark the benchmark calibration case q is elaborated by calibrating the hydrological model solely with streamflow q data the objective function for case q φq to be minimized is obtained by calculating the average kling gupta efficiency e kg over the 11 gauging points for q in the basin and subtracting it from 1 φq ranges from its optimal value that is 0 to positive infinity and is formulated as follows 4 φ q 1 1 g i 1 g e kg i q mod i q obs i with 5 e kg 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where g is

evaporation 2 5 2 1 spatial pattern efficiency metric a bias insensitive and multi component metric developed by dembélé et al 2020a is used to quantify the degree of reproduction of the spatial patterns of hydrological processes the proposed spatial pattern efficiency e sp metric only considers the spatial pattern of the underlying variables and ignores their absolute values e sp is an integrated measure of the dynamics the spatial variability and the locational matching of grid cells between the modelled x mod and observed x obs variables with x obs and x mod composed of n cells e sp is defined as follows 6 e sp 1 r s 1 2 γ 1 2 α 1 2 with 7 r s 1 6 1 n d i 2 n n 2 1 8 γ σ mod μ mod σ obs μ obs and 9 α 1 e rms z x mod z x obs where r s is the spearman rank order correlation coefficient with d i the difference between the ranks of the i th cell of x mod and x obs γ is the variability ratio i e the ratio of the coefficients of variation and α the spatial location matching term calculated as the root mean squared error e rms of the standardized values z scores z x of x mod and x obs dembélé et al 2020a e sp ranges from negative infinity to its optimal value that is unity e sp 0 when there is a moderate relationship between the ranks of the observed and modelled variables i e r s 0 55 and e sp 0 67 when the ranks are not related i e r s 0 more details on e sp are provided by dembélé et al 2020a 2 5 2 2 multivariate calibration strategies four multivariate calibration strategies with distinct objective functions are proposed to simultaneously consider q and e a data as calibration variables each objective function eqs 11 15 17 and 19 is formulated based on the euclidean distance approach eq 10 in which all elements are equally weighted khu and madsen 2005

calibration strategies differ from each other based on the formulation of the sub objective function for e a i e φ e a while φq remains unchanged the observed variable e a obs and the modelled variable e a mod of actual evaporation are represented each by a 3d array of dimension m x n x t with m the number of rows n the number of columns and t the number of time steps fig 5 for this study m represents 40 latitude rows n represents 36 longitude columns and t represents 72 months i e calibration period the modelling domain has 1440 grid cells of which 619 are active i e grid cells representing the basin area the inactive grid cells are masked out during the calculation of the performance metrics in the following e a t is a 2d array of actual evaporation represented by all cells i j in the spatial domain ω and e a i j is the time series of actual evaporation for a given cell at row i and column j the four multivariate calibration strategies are defined as follows 1 temporal basin average ba the matching of the observed and modelled e a is done on basin averaged time series the sub objective function φ e a ba to be minimized is obtained by calculating the e kg for the observed and modelled time series of basin average actual evaporation e a obs and e a mod and subtracting it from 1 the objective function φba is formulated as follows 11 φ ba φ q 2 φ e a ba 2 with 12 φ e a ba 1 e kg e a mod e a obs where 13 e a mod t 1 m n t 1 i j ω t e a mod t i j and 14 e a obs t 1 m n t 1 i j ω t e a obs t i j 2 temporal pixel wise pw the matching of the modelled and observed e

as follows 19 φ sp φ q 2 φ e a sp 2 with 20 φ e a sp 1 1 t t 1 i j ω t e sp e a mod t i j e a obs t i j all the objective functions φba φpw φsb and φsp vary between their optimal value that is 0 and

daily streamflow data independent monthly datasets of satellite based soil moisture s u and terrestrial water storage s t table 2 are used for model evaluation the temporal dynamics of streamflow is evaluated with e kg both the temporal dynamics and the spatial patterns of modelled s u are evaluated using the pearson correlation coefficient r and the spatial pattern efficiency metric e sp while only the temporal dynamics of modelled s t is assessed using r due to the coarse spatial resolution of the grace data the skill scores for the temporal dynamics are calculated for each pixel or gauging point in the basin while spatial skill scores are calculated per time step 3 results in general the trend of the model performance high vs low scores among the scenarios i e evaporation datasets vs calibration strategies is conserved between the calibration and the evaluation periods for all variables therefore the following results are presented for the entire simulation period that comprises the calibration and evaluation periods whose results are additionally provided in the supplementary materials 3 1 model performance for multiple hydrological processes in the vrb the model performance for various hydrological processes in the vrb reveals the potential of srs and reanalysis evaporation datasets to improve the model responses if the appropriate calibration strategy is used fig 6 detailed results are provided in the supplementary material figures s1 s2 for q the benchmark model i e q only yields a median e kg of 0 69 in the multivariate calibration scenarios i e q e a the e kg of q varies between 0 42 for sebs with case pw to 0 73 for cmrset with case sp the best multivariate calibration strategy is the case sb with an average e kg of 0 68 and 75 of the evaporation datasets producing a higher model performance than the benchmark followed by case sp e kg 0 67 case pw e kg 0 63 and case ba e kg 0 60 the top 3 best evaporation datasets for the average e kg of q over the calibration strategies are gleam v3 2b e kg 0 71 gleam v3 3b e kg 0 71 and gleam v3 3a e kg 0 70 while the worst are alexi e kg 0 61 sebs e kg 0 56 and era5 e kg 0 51 the decrease in the model performance for q in the multivariate calibration might be an artifact caused by equifinality i e non uniqueness of model parameters beven 2006 savenije 2001 that occurred with the q only calibration which gives more degrees of freedom for constraining the model parameter space dembélé et al 2020a in fact figures s68 s71 show that the high performance for q achieved with the q only calibration is obtained at the expense of poor performance for other hydrological processes while the multivariate calibrations with q e a result in parameter sets that provide equivalent model performance for q but higher model performance for s t and s u these results support the findings of dembélé et al 2020a thereby confirming the pitfalls of the q only calibration bouaziz et al 2020 stisen et al 2018 the evaporation datasets show a high potential to improve the temporal dynamics of modelled s t as 79 of the multivariate calibration scenarios outperform the case q r 0 73 with an average r of 0 81 the lowest average r of s t among the calibration strategies is given by case sp r 0 79 but interestingly it outperforms the case q the highest performances for median r of s t are obtained with merra 2 r 0 87 ssebop r 0 87 and alexi r 0 84 while lowest performances are given by sebs r 0 77 mod16a2 r 0 76 and era5 r 0 74 the temporal dynamics of modelled s u show a higher model performance than that of s t with an average r of 0 91 and 98 of the multivariate calibration scenarios that outperform the case q r 0 86 the case ba performs similarly to case pw and case sp with an average r of 0 91 across evaporation datasets and outperformed by case sb r 0 93 the highest r of s u is 0 93 and it is obtained with gleam v3 3a merra 2 and gleam v3 2a while the weakest scores are obtained with mod16a2 r 0 91 sebs r 0 89 and era5 r 0 89 the representation of the spatial patterns of s u improves for all the multivariate scenarios as compared to the case q however case sb e sp 0 0 has the highest average performance across the evaporation datasets while case ba e sp 0 04 has the lowest performance the best evaporation datasets for the simulation of the spatial patterns of s u considering all the calibration strategies are ssebop e sp 0 02 merra 2 e sp 0 01 and gleam v3 3a e sp 0 01 while the worst are mod16a2 e sp 0 04 sebs e sp 0 07 and era5 e sp 0 09 in general it is observed that the model performances for s t and s u improve for most of the multivariate calibration scenarios among the multivariate calibration strategies case sb gives the best results considering the average model performance for all variables q s t and s u in fig 7 b the highest average relative change in model performance by multivariate calibration strategies as compared to the q only calibration is obtained with case sb is 29 followed by case sp 26 case pw 24 and case ba 20 consequently all grid based model calibration strategies outperform the basin average calibration case ba which gives the lowest average model performance these results highlight the value of calibrating hydrological models on the full extent of gridded evaporation datasets it is noted that in most of the scenarios calibrating the model only on the spatial patterns case sp of the evaporation datasets thereby ignoring their absolute values improves the predictive skill of the model with a higher performance than that of case q and case ba fig 6 with these findings case sp i e only spatial patterns of evaporation datasets can be preferred to case sb i e absolute values of evaporation datasets for the calibration of hydrological models because the propagation of the errors of the evaporation estimates into the modelling process can be case specific and depends on the model structure this observation also draw attention on the adequacy of the model for a given experiment addor and melsen 2019 moreover for a given evaporation dataset the spatial variation in biases in the estimates can lead to contrasting performance across regions jung et al 2019 nicholson 2000 the spatial patterns of alexi followed by those of mod16a2 and cmrset were the least informative for the model calibration in case sp fig 6 considering all hydrological processes and model calibration strategies the top three best performing evaporation datasets are merra 2 gleam v3 3a and ssebop while the bottom three datasets are mod16a2 sebs and era5 figs 6 and 7a however it is noteworthy that they outperform the q only calibration when used in case sp meaning that only their spatial patterns improve the model performance in general the versions 3 3 of gleam show a slightly higher model performance than the versions 3 2 3 2 impact of calibration strategies on spatial patterns different model calibration strategies result in different spatial patterns of modelled e a and s u as shown for selected scenarios in fig 8 additional maps of e a s u and s t for other scenarios are provided in the supplementary material figures s58 59 figures s65 66 and figures s38 39 along with those obtained with the q only calibration figure s12 in general the south to north gradient of increasing aridity observed with modelled e a and s u is well depicted for all the calibration strategies however considerable mismatches in the variability of the patterns are observed among the calibration strategies such discrepancies in spatial patterns have implications for water resources assessment including water accounting flood and drought monitoring and prediction aghakouchak et al 2015 klemas 2014 teng et al 2017 west et al 2019 knowing when flood or drought events occur is important but knowing the spatial extent of the event is crucial for deploying efficient adaptation and mitigation strategies brunner et al 2020 diaz et al 2019 he et al 2020 consequently improving the representation of the spatial patterns of hydrological processes should be a key consideration in modelling with spatially distributed models the comparison of the maps of modelled e a fig 8a with the reference alexi dataset fig 3 reveals that the spatial patterns of e a in the case ba show the highest mismatch with the reference thereby unveiling the potential pitfalls of the basin average calibration the highest improvement of the spatial patterns of s u is obtained with case sb 101 followed by case sp 93 and case pw 85 while case ba 76 provides the least improvement fig 7b 3 3 analysis per climatic zone the analysis of the model performance according to climatic zones is done for all hydrological processes except q because of the few gauging stations which are unevenly distributed across the vrb cf fig 1 the results reveal contrasting model performances across climatic zones fig 9 additional results are provided in the supplementary material figures s3 s11 in average the model performance at predicting the temporal dynamics of s t and the spatial patterns of s u is higher in the intermediate climatic regions i e sudano sahelian and sudanian zones than in the driest and wettest regions i e sahelian and guinean zones of the vrb in terms of the temporal dynamics of s u the model performance decreases slightly from the driest to the wettest regions in general the multivariate calibration scenarios with evaporation datasets lead to a higher model performance for all hydrological processes in all climatic zones as compared to the q only calibration fig 9 figure s13 although the gleam products globally perform well they are the least effective at predicting the temporal dynamics of s t in the sahelian zone the top three best evaporation datasets for improving the average model performance across climatic zones are ssebop merra 2 and alexi for the temporal dynamics of s t merra 2 gleam v3 3a and gleam v3 2a for the temporal dynamics of s u and gleam v3 3b gleam v3 3a and gleam v3 2a for the spatial patterns of s u similar to results obtained at the entire vrb scale section 3 1 mod16a2 sebs and era5 still show the lowest contribution in improving the model performance across different climatic zones more details on the ranking of the evaporation datasets are provided in the supplementary material tables s1 s5 figures s14 s21 and s40 contrary to the basin scale analysis case sp is the least efficient calibration strategy per climatic zones this result can be justified by the fact that the model calibration on the spatial patterns of evaporation datasets is done at the scale of the vrb consequently the spatial variability of hydrological processes at large scale is not representative of the climatic zones where the patterns are more homogenous for regions with strong spatial variability sub region model calibration on spatial patterns can be a way forward in overcoming the pitfalls of domain wide calibration thereby ultimately resulting in a higher model performance 4 discussions the results presented are primarily valid for the vrb because errors in evaporation estimates are known to vary according to region hartanto et al 2017 sörensson and ruscica 2018 however the innovative model evaluation approach proposed in this study is not location specific and can be applied to other regions using a grid based hydrological model the robust evaluation approach for evaporation datasets is based on multiple hydrological processes and responds to the recent call of the scientific community for process oriented diagnostics of earth system models maloney et al 2019 melsen et al 2016 the same methodology can be deployed for the evaluation of other spatial observational datasets such as gridded soil moisture estimates using robust metrics dong et al 2019 and subsequently be used to estimate their value for hydrological modelling moreover this study highlights the potential of satellite and reanalysis evaporation datasets to improve the representation of various hydrological processes which might guide modellers in choosing the adequate product for their applications and support the data developers in their quest of improving global estimates of evaporation mccabe et al 2019 it must be noted that the overall ranking in fig 9 does not systematically determine whether a dataset is good or bad rather it shows which evaporation product provides the highest or lowest model performance for a given hydrological flux or state variable only the skill scores allow a judgement on the ability of a given dataset to yield a good model performance there might be uncertainties related to the rescaling of the evaporation datasets from their native spatial resolutions to that of the hydrological modelling resolution however for a fair comparison all the datasets should be used at the same spatiotemporal resolution the high performance of the gleam datasets is most likely due to the integration of soil moisture information in the calculation of actual evaporation therefore gleam is expected to perform well for hydrological modelling surprisingly merra 2 ranks among the best evaporation datasets notwithstanding its coarse spatial resolution the high performance of merra 2 can be explained by its high temporal resolution which might compensate its lower spatial resolution in general there is no clear tendency of srs datasets to outperform the reanalysis datasets and vice versa thus besides their use as forcing data reanalysis datasets represent a valuable source of information for the calibration of hydrological models satellite data of soil moisture and terrestrial water storage used for model evaluation in this study are not free of errors however at large scale and in poorly gauged regions they are the only source of data that can be used for spatial model evaluation peters lidard et al 2019 overall this study strives to provide solutions to some of the current challenges in hydrology i e modelling methods uncertainty and spatial variability blöschl et al 2019 the proposed methodology represents an innovative way to use satellite and reanalysis datasets to improve process representation in hydrological models clark et al 2015 peters lidard et al 2017 develop hydrological water accounting hunink et al 2019 and advance prediction in ungauged basins hrachowitz et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 future studies should test the advantages of a multi scale calibration framework that accounts for both domain wide and sub domain spatial heterogeneity which might lead to better prediction of spatial patterns across climatic zones at large scale calibration strategies with multiple non commensurable variables as well as spatial patterns is a way forward in advancing process representation in hydrological models dembélé et al 2020a nijzink et al 2018 zink et al 2018 more importantly the choice of the calibration strategy or the objective function is determinant for high model performance mainly under a changing environment fowler et al 2018 schaefli et al 2010 uncertainties in the structure of the mhm model might influence the modelled hydrological processes for instance the calculation of actual evaporation section 2 1 might be subject to a double accounting of stress from both the leaf area index and soil moisture however in such case the sources of stress can be proportionally adjusted by the model parameters during the calibration further work should investigate the impact of different model structures on the methodology proposed in this study and assess the parameter sensitivity of mhm depending on calibration strategies and variables which is beyond the scope of the current study besides improving model calibration satellite and reanalysis datasets can play an important role in identifying deficiencies in model structures and contribute to model improvement hulsman et al 2020 as the accuracy of the satellite and reanalysis datasets depends on the quality of the input meteorological datasets used for their production it is also important to assess the impact of precipitation datasets on evaporation modelling dembélé et al 2020b mao and wang 2017 or and lehmann 2019 finally an ensemble product that merges different evaporation datasets is a potential way forward in reducing regional uncertainties and thereby improving global estimates da motta paca et al 2019 jiménez et al 2018 such advances in evaporation product development can facilitate prediction in ungauged basins using earth observations 5 conclusion four model calibration strategies are used to evaluate twelve satellite and reanalysis datasets in the large transboundary volta river basin located in west africa the experiment is done with the mhm model over the period 2003 2012 the key findings can be summarized as follows satellite and reanalysis datasets can improve the predictive skill of the hydrological model if the appropriate calibration strategy is used overall merra 2 gleam v3 3a and ssebop individually provide the highest contribution in improving the model performance model calibration on the full extent of the gridded evaporation datasets result in a higher model performance than calibration on basin average estimates using only the spatial patterns of gridded evaporation data for model calibration and not their absolute values yields higher model performance than classical approaches based on basin average evaporation signal or based only on streamflow contrasting spatial patterns of soil moisture are obtained depending on the modelling scenarios with differences in the model performances according to climatic zones these findings contribute to solving current challenges related to large scale hydrological modelling and provide avenues for improving process representation with the use of increasingly available satellite and reanalysis datasets improving the representation of the spatial patterns of hydrological processes should be a key consideration in modelling with spatially distributed models which would allow better predicting floods and droughts moreover the results provide insights to the developers of the evaporation datasets and might serve of guidance for future developments however a replication of the proposed methodology to evaluate evaporation datasets should be applied in other regions with different hydro climatic conditions and with different hydrological and land surface models future work should also investigate the possibility of prediction in ungauged basins solely from earth observation datasets which are increasingly and readily

431,lateral unsaturated flow was found to contribute little to rainfall induced shallow landslides but it can be important when the landslides are triggered under conditions of varying boundary water level by considering a hillslope with an impermeable bedrock and rising water level at the uphill downhill boundary this study explored how lateral unsaturated flow would affect slope stability three different hillslope storage boussinesq models that differ in their treatment of the unsaturated flow were coupled with the same infinite slope stability model to predict and compare the safety factor and instability time specific to the situations considered this study discovered that despite the inclusion of lateral unsaturated flow effect the hillslope remains stable when water level at the downhill boundary rises under the condition of increasing uphill boundary water level the consideration of lateral unsaturated flow leads to earlier slope failure for loamy hillslopes with a moderate slope also the lateral unsaturated flow may not induce slope failure for mildly sloping loamy hillslopes and plays an ignorable role when landslides occur fast in very steep hillslopes by contrast the lateral unsaturated flow does not affect much the failure of sandy hillslopes moreover when water level at the uphill boundary increases faster the lateral unsaturated flow exerts a greater influence on initiating slope failure further examination shows that intensive rainfall may weaken the effect of lateral unsaturated flow on shallow landslides triggering under the condition of rising uphill boundary water level keywords shallow landslides triggering infinite slope stability safety factor lateral unsaturated flow hsb model 1 introduction landslides as one of the most widespread geohazards in the world are an important process of landscape formation by releasing sediments from slopes to allow transportation through the fluvial systems iverson et al 1997 therefore landslides help to maintain the long term dynamic equilibrium between erosion and uplift singh et al 2010 however for humans landslides are devastating disasters that cause not only enormous economic losses for destroying buildings and infrastructure kjekstad and highland 2009 but also more severely thousands of deaths or injuries per year worldwide petley 2012 given these consequences researchers have conducted many studies to predict the likelihood of landslides by assessing slope stability to warn people living in susceptible landslide areas restrepo et al 2008 landslides can be triggered by various factors of which prolonged or intense rainfall is the primary one direct rainfall infiltration through the unsaturated soil leads to the propagation of the wetting front which increases the pore water pressure and soil moisture content reduces the shear strength of the soil increases the sliding force ultimately initiating slope failure baum et al 2010 saito et al 2010 early research has explored how different rainfall characteristics would affect the initiation of shallow landslides mainly including rainfall intensity althuwaynee et al 2018 chang et al 2017 saito et al 2010 rainfall duration aleotti 2004 chen et al 2015 godt et al 2006 lu and godt 2008 and temporal patterns of rainfall fan et al 2020 ran et al 2018 associated with the rainfall infiltration flow in the unsaturated zone is predominantly vertical and the lateral unsaturated flow is negligible for barely contributing to landslide activation talebi et al 2008 according to iverson 2000 besides direct rainfall infiltration at the hillslope surface lateral flow caused by saturated groundwater flow from adjacent materials may also induce slope failure in situations of river damming and reservoir filling the water level at the downhill boundary of a hillslope will increase thereby deteriorating the slope stability kaczmarek et al 2015 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2014 the statistics of riemer 1992 revealed that about 85 of the landslides around reservoirs are triggered either at the stage of construction and filling or in the first few years of operation after filling during the operation or filling of reservoirs the boundary water level change influences the hydrostatic groundwater pressure inside the hillslope and may cause landslides near these artificial water bodies zhang et al 2010 kaczmarek et al 2015 discovered that the filling and exploitation of the włocławek reservoir in northern poland led to intensified landslide activities the water level at the uphill boundary of a hillslope may also increase when there are cracks or ponds at the uphill boundary and the soil layer is covered by a very thin layer of fine grained soil vertical infiltration into the soil matrix is ignorable and rainfall flows into the cracks or ponds leading to a rising uphill boundary water level and lateral flow in the soil matrix galeandro et al 2014 leach and moore 2015 xu et al 2016 xu et al 2016 showed that the water level increase in the subvertical crack at the uphill boundary had contributed considerably to the initiation of kualiangzi landslide in the sichuan basin china subsequently they proposed a significant negative correlation between uphill boundary water level and slope stability although lateral unsaturated flow can be ignored in rainfall induced shallow landslides it may be critical when landslides are activated by the above mentioned water level variations at the uphill or downhill boundary of a hillslope under these conditions lateral rather than vertical unsaturated flow controls the drainage flux in the unsaturated zone subsequently the change of groundwater pressure heads and moisture content in hillslopes early research showed that the consideration of lateral unsaturated flow improved the prediction accuracy of hillslope drainage process kong et al 2016 a common way to evaluate slope stability is to use the groundwater pressure heads and moisture content derived by hillslope hydrological models as the input parameters of a slope stability model therefore lateral unsaturated flow is likely to be important for slope failure induced by varying boundary water levels however previous work did not investigate this problem specifically the hydrological trigger is a major type of shallow landslides triggers and the lateral unsaturated flow is a nonignorable factor influencing the hillslope hydrological process in this regard it is worth examining the impact of lateral unsaturated flow on triggering slope failure under varying boundary water level conditions although the role of lateral unsaturated flow in initiating slope failure remains unexplored it has been found to be important for hillslope hydrology in many ways lateral unsaturated flow commonly exists in hillslopes it dramatically affects the redistribution of soil moisture and contributes to the nonnegligible drainage flux in the unsaturated zone gannon et al 2017 proposed that lateral unsaturated water flux led to the formation of spatial soil heterogeneity in the headwater catchment at the hubbard brook experimental forest in new hampshire by integrating lateral unsaturated flow into the hillslope storage boussinesq hsb model kong et al 2016 achieved more accurate prediction of the hillslope drainage process e g groundwater outflow rates hydrographs lateral unsaturated flow is also critical for recession flow analysis luo et al 2018 revealed that neglecting lateral unsaturated flow would result in an inaccurate estimate of the slopes of recession curves in certain situations more importantly with lateral unsaturated flow considered there could be three power law regimes two transition points of the recession curves instead of two power law regimes one transition point that were reported in most previous studies due to the strong link to hillslope hydrology it is anticipated that lateral unsaturated flow may play a role when slope failure is activated under the conditions of varying boundary water level but to what extent remains unclear therefore in this study we hypothesized that the triggering of shallow landslides may be attributed to lateral unsaturated flow in situations of varying boundary water level at the uphill or downhill boundary and the extent depends on several factors mainly including slope angle soil type and hillslope length to test the hypothesis we coupled three hsb models which differ in their treatment of the unsaturated flow with the same infinite slope stability model and ran a series of simulations the hsb models we selected were proposed by troch et al 2003 troch hsb model which neglects unsaturated flow hilberts et al 2005 hilberts hsb model which considers vertical unsaturated flow and kong et al 2016 kong hsb model which considers both vertical and lateral unsaturated flow respectively note that in some studies the slope stability model was coupled with 2 d 3 d models that account for variably saturated flow based on the richards equation cai and ugai 2004 collins and znidarcic 2004 hussain et al 2007 however these models are computationally expensive even for small scale problems meanwhile uncertainties of subsurface properties make the parametrization of these models rather difficult bresciani et al 2014 in comparison boussinesq type equations are 1 d and can be analytically solved for various problems so their computational efficiency is higher rocha et al 2007 troch et al 2002 therefore we focused on the hsb models instead of those based on the richards equation following previous research the three hsb models were used to simulate the groundwater pressure heads and soil moisture content of a hillslope with landslide potential simulation results were then used by the same infinite slope stability model to calculate the time varying slope safety factor fs which is the ratio of shear stress available to downslope shear stress and the instability time if landslides occurred which corresponds to the time when fs falls below one we set up numerous cases to include the factors that would affect the role of lateral unsaturated flow e g soil type slope angle slope length boundary conditions and rainfall intensity the research outcomes would promote a deeper understanding of slope failure mechanisms and assist in more accurate evaluation of shallow landslides 2 methodology 2 1 hsb models the original hsb model was proposed by troch et al 2003 to describe the hydrological process in homogeneous hillslopes fig 1 1a w f h t w q x n w 1b f θ s θ r 1c q k s h h x c o s i s i n i where w m is the hillslope width along the sloping bed f is the effective drainable porosity h m is the water table height perpendicular to the impermeable layer t s is the time q m2 s is the darcy flux per unit width along the hillslope x m is the distance from the outlet measured parallel to the impermeable layer n m s is the recharge rate and used to represent rainfall intensity in this study ks m s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity i is the slope angle and θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual water content respectively as eq 1b shows the troch hsb model does not consider unsaturated flow since f is treated as a constant readers should note that the presence of an impermeable bedrock under the soil cover as assumed in this study is not always the case so the results and discussions in following sections apply to such situations only also our study mainly considered slope failure induced by the build up of positive pore water pressure while it may also be triggered by other factors e g slope inclination angle friction angle and effective cohesion of the soil cover the drainable porosity f is a storage coefficient that accounts for the impact of the unsaturated zone on water table fluctuations and as shown in eq 1b it is treated as a constant by troch et al 2003 however indeed this parameter depends on the water retention characteristics of soil and depth to the water table by assuming hydrostatic pressure distribution along the direction normal to the hillslope base fig 1 hilberts et al 2005 analytically expressed f as a function of water table depth to obtain the analytical expression a function that describes the relationship between soil moisture θ ψ and pressure head ψ is required and the van genuchten vg 1980 function is the most widely used 2a θ θ r θ s θ r s w 2b s w 1 1 α vg ψ n m 2c m 1 1 n where αvg 1 m and n are the original vg parameters s w is the saturation under the assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution along the direction normal to the hillslope base fig 1 ψ h z cos i however it is difficult to drive the analytical expression by directly using the original vg functions troch 1993 found that by assuming m 1 1 nh nh n it is possible to fit the soil water retention curves for various soil types 3 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h ψ n h 1 1 n h where α h 1 m and nh are the modified vg parameters that can be obtained by fitting to the original vg curves based on eq 3 hilberts et al 2005 derived the analytical expression of f by assuming zero vertical flux in the unsaturated zone 4 f θ s θ r 1 1 α h h d c o s i n h 1 1 n h where d m is the thickness of soil substituting eq 4 into eq 1 gives the hilberts hsb model readers may refer to hilberts et al 2005 for more details of the derivation despite the improvement of the hilberts hsb model there is still a discrepancy between predictions and measurements kong et al 2016 pointed out that the discrepancy may result from the neglection of lateral unsaturated flow and so further improved the hsb model by considering this component during the hillslope drainage process to derive the new hsb model kong et al 2016 also needed the expression of θ ψ ψ and followed the approach of troch 1993 namely eq 3 which generates two modified vg parameters α 1 m and n1 in the kong hsb model described below besides the derivation of kong hsb model also needed the expression of k ψ ψ which is described by the vg function as k ψ k s s w 1 2 1 1 s w 1 m m 2 however this function is inapplicable to the derivation noticing that the characteristic curves of k ψ ψ and θ ψ ψ exhibit similar distribution features kong et al 2016 resolved the inapplicability issue by transforming the vg expression of k ψ ψ into a format similar to that of eq 3 namely 5 k ψ k s 1 1 β ψ n 2 1 1 n 2 where β 1 m and n2 are new modified vg parameters relative to soil properties in this regard there are four modified vg parameters in the kong hsb model and their values can be obtained by fitting to the original vg curves the expression of kong hsb model is given below and readers may refer to kong et al 2016 for more details of the derivation process 6a w f h t w q x n w 6b q k s max h 0 p h x c o s i s i n i 6c p d h 1 β h d cos i n 2 1 n 2 min h 0 1 β h cos i n 2 1 n 2 6d f θ s θ r 1 α min h 0 cos i n 1 1 1 n 1 1 α h d cos i n 1 1 1 n 1 where f is the equivalent drainable porosity proposed by kong et al 2016 and p m is the equivalent propagation thickness in the unsaturated zone note that all three hsb models use residual water content θ r as the lower limit of unsaturated water content field capacity which represents the upper limit of drainable water after infiltration or wetting is generally larger than θ r and independent of groundwater level therefore the use of θ r may underestimate the actual total soil water storage and the neglection of field capacity as a typical initial condition of the unsaturated soil before infiltration will affect the instability time nonetheless the comparison of time varying fs and instability time predicted by the three coupled models based on θ r would demonstrate a trend similar to that based on field capacity the above governing equations show that the three hsb models mainly differ in their treatment of the unsaturated flow as reflected in the expression of f the storage coefficient that accounts for the effect of the unsaturated zone on groundwater dynamics the troch hsb model treats f as a constant without considering the dependence on depth to the water table and water retention characteristics of the soil based on the assumption of quasi steady state hydraulic equilibrium zero vertical flux the hilberts hsb model expresses f as a function of water table depth thereby partially considering the influence of unsaturated zone on water table fluctuations while the kong hsb model makes further improvement by considering additional lateral unsaturated flow also the troch hsb and hilberts hsb models ignore the effect of variation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which is considered by the kong hsb model 2 2 infinite slope stability model in hilly areas the bedrock may be impermeable and covered by a thin layer of soil parallel to the base when the pore water pressure of the soil layer increases rapidly the pressure head rises subsequently increasing the sliding force reducing the shear capacity of the soil and finally triggering landslides meanwhile previous research found that the contact surface between the impermeable substrate and the soil layer is often where landslides begin fig 1 following these studies we focus on shallow landslides triggered by the rising water table that builds up at the interface between the soil cover and the impermeable substrate however readers should be aware that such a scenario is not universal since the bedrock may be permeable e g weathered or fractured bedrock montgomery et al 2002 and shallow landslides can sometimes be triggered in unsaturated soil conditions kim and jeong 2017 in particular the infiltration and exfiltration processes through permeable bedrock have been found to affect the triggering intensity and volume of shallow landslides brönnimann et al 2013 onda et al 2004 in this regard the results presented are only applicable to the specific scenario considered in most situations the thickness of the soil layer is quite small compared to the length and width so the infinite slope stability theory can be applied aristizabal et al 2016 rosso et al 2006 talebi et al 2008 the theory calculates the safety factor fs to predict the likelihood of shallow landslides fs at location x along the hillslope is given as 7 f s τ f τ where τf kg m s2 or interchangeably kn m2 is the shear stress available and τ kg m s2 is the downslope shear stress according to the mohr coulomb failure criterion the shear strength of soil along the potential failure plane is related to the cohesive force and internal friction angle and can be obtained via the effective stress method 8 τ f c σ u t a n φ where c kg m s2 is the effective soil cohesion σ kg m s2 is the normal stress u kg m s2 is the pore water pressure and ϕ is the effective internal friction angle of soil note that eq 8 is only applicable under the assumption that the soil at the failure surface is fully saturated based on the coordinate system in fig 1 the expressions for σ u and τ are 9a σ d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z c o s i 9b u γ w h c o s i 9c τ d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z s i n i where γd kn m3 is the dry bulk unit weight of soil γw kn m3 is the unit weight of water z m is the elevation of calculating point perpendicular to the hillslope base and θ is the water content

from eq 12 that the increase of water level at the uphill boundary is detrimental to the slope stability by reducing fs in contrast the rising water level at the downhill boundary helps stabilize the slope and this effect can be reflected by rewriting eq 12 as 13 f s 0 l c d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z c o s i γ w h c o s i 1 2 γ w h w 2 s i n i t a n φ d x 0 l d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z s i n i d x 1 2 γ w h w 2

condition of a rising uphill boundary water level we set two slope lengths 10 m and 50 m the two slope lengths are within the value range used in previous studies for example ran et al 2018 adopted a 10 m long hillslope in their numerical investigation of rainfall induced shallow landslides while talebi et al 2008 set a slope length of 100 m to investigate the effect of vertical unsaturated flow on hillslope failure two soil types that commonly exist in natural settings and differ in their strength of unsaturated flow were used loam and sand following early research on hillslope drainage process hilberts et al 2005 troch et al 2003 the combination of slope length and soil type created case 1 loam 10 m uphill case 2 loam 50 m uphill case 3 sand 10 m uphill and case 4 sand 50 m uphill since the hillslope is inherently prone to local instability and almost unaffected by the slope length when the water level at the downhill boundary increases we set two soil types with the same 50 m slope length generating case 5 loam 50 m downhill and case 6 sand 50 m downhill the rising rate of water level at the uphill cases 1 4 or downhill cases 5 6 boundary was set as 0 2 m hour based on the observations of early research for example the monitoring of xu et al 2016 recorded a 1 4 5 m day water level increase in the crack at the uphill boundary of the kualiangzi landslide and simpson et al 2018 reported that the filling rate of the koyna reservoir in western india was between 0 6 m day during 1960 2010 more details of the simulation setup are given in table 1 to further explore the role of lateral unsaturated flow we conducted a sensitivity analysis based on case 1 by changing the slope angle to 20 case 7 22 case 8 24 case 9 and 28 case 10 hillslopes with these slope angles are common and have been studied in terms of their drainage process pauritsch et al 2015 also we varied the rising rate of uphill boundary water level from the 0 2 m hour in case 1 to 0 05 m hour case 11 0 4 m hour case 12 and 0 6 m hour case 13 moreover we examined the combined effects of rainfall and boundary water level change based on cases 1 and 5 thereby generating cases 14 19 and cases 20 25 rainfall intensity increases from 10 mm day to 60 mm day with an increment of 10 mm day in both groups respectively these rainfall intensities have been widely used in preceding work on the mechanisms of rainfall induced shallow landslides ran et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 readers may refer to table 1 for more details about the case conditions in the sensitivity analysis 2 3 2 parameters this study assumed a homogeneous and isotropic hillslope the hydrological parameters are adopted from previous studies on hillslope drainage process and recession flow analysis hilberts et al 2005 kong et al 2016 luo et al 2018 while the geotechnical parameters are based on the study of talebi et al 2008 which examined rainfall induced hillslope failure table 2 2 3 3 simulation runs we used the stable groundwater level formed under the condition of 0 3 m downhill and 0 1 m uphill boundary water level in each case as the initial condition to ensure a moist slope contact face starting from the initial condition each simulation was carried out with a varying uphill downhill boundary water level so no warming up stage was needed note that the different slope lengths and soil types across cases led to different initial water level distributions even under the same prescribed boundary water level however the differences were minor and did not affect the investigation on the role of lateral unsaturated flow in activating slope failure for each case the three hsb models were respectively run to simulate the water table height and water content inside the hillslope using the finite difference method appendix a and the infinite slope stability model was then employed to calculate fs at each time step therefore the difference in water table height and water content caused by the effect of the lateral unsaturated flow can be reflected in the fs each simulation began as the uphill or downhill boundary water level rose and kept running until reaching the stable groundwater level inside the hillslope no matter shallow landslide occurred or not by comparing the instability time when fs 1 predicted by the three coupling models we could understand the effect of lateral unsaturated flow on causing shallow landsliding 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of lateral unsaturated flow on groundwater pressure heads fig 2 compares how the water table level predicted by the three hsb models changes with time in cases 1 6 it is notable that regardless of the boundary condition and slope length the water table variations predicted by kong hsb model in loamy hillslopes cases 1 2 and 5 deviate more from the predictions of troch hsb and hilberts hsb models than in sandy hillslopes cases 3 4 and 6 the greater deviation for loamy hillslopes may be explained by the fact that the unsaturated zone of loam is thicker than that of sand and the corresponding lateral unsaturated flow plays a greater role in unsaturated water content redistribution and hence the groundwater level variation as water level at the uphill boundary rises for loamy hillslopes cases 1 2 the groundwater level simulated by the kong hsb model propagates downhill the fastest sequentially followed by the hilberts hsb model and the troch hsb model reflecting the effect of vertical unsaturated water content distribution and lateral unsaturated flow on promoting groundwater propagations when the water level reaches the stable state there is no vertical redistribution of unsaturated water content whereas lateral unsaturated flow still exists consequently for the part near the downhill boundary the kong hsb model predicts lower values than the forecast of the troch hsb and hilberts hsb models with the latter two deriving almost identical predictions note that as the slope length increases from 10 m case 1 to 50 m case 2 despite the same trend it takes a much longer time one order of magnitude higher for the water table level to reach the stable state due to the weaker capillarity of sand under the condition of rising uphill boundary water level lateral unsaturated flow exerts much less significant influence on groundwater wave propagations in sandy hillslopes cases 3 4 than in loamy hillslopes cases 1 2 the weak role is indicated by the rather similar water table levels predicted by the three hsb models nonetheless it is noteworthy that the stable water table level simulated by the kong hsb model is still slightly lower than the other two models have predicted therefore it is clear from the results of cases 1 4 that when lateral flow in the unsaturated zone is neglected the stable water level will be overestimated under the condition of rising uphill boundary water level in the scenario of rising water level at the downhill boundary cases 5 6 groundwater spreads uphill faster and forms a higher stable water level when considering the lateral unsaturated flow particularly for the loamy hillslope case 5 it can be inferred from cases 5 6 that as downhill boundary water level increases the stable water level in a hillslope may be underestimated without considering the lateral unsaturated flow 3 2 effect of lateral unsaturated flow on fs 3 2 1 condition of rising uphill boundary water level fig 3 a 3 d compare the variation of fs predicted by the three hsb models for different cases under the scenario of increasing uphill boundary water level in general the four cases exhibit a similar trend namely the decrease of fs with time irrespective of the hsb model used for loamy hillslopes fig 3 a 3 b at the initial stage the decreasing rates of fs predicted by the three hsb models are quite close afterwards for the short 10 m hillslope case 1 fig 3 a kong hsb model predicts the fastest decline of fs and so the earliest slope failure followed by hilberts hsb model and troch hsb model the instability time corresponding to hilberts hsb model and troch hsb model is 29 72 and 39 hours respectively increasing by 15 3 and 51 3 compared to the 25 78 hours forecast by kong hsb model when the loamy hillslope is longer 50 m case 2 before the initiation of the shallow landslide fs 1 fs forecast by kong hsb and hilberts hsb models falls at similar speeds and approaches slope instability almost simultaneously indicating that the effect of lateral unsaturated flow on triggering slope failure depends on the hillslope length for a longer hillslope the degree to which considering lateral unsaturated flow would predict earlier slope failure is lower fig 3 b the percentage differences of instability time between troch hsb and kong hsb models and between hilberts hsb and kong hsb models are 45 3 and 2 2 in case 2 respectively table 3 these two numbers both decrease greatly in comparison to those in case 1 showing the weaker impact of lateral unsaturated flow on a longer loamy hillslope in a long hillslope the hydrological process allows sufficient time for the water table height to slowly rise to the same level as the uphill boundary water level consequently the ratio of the unsaturated zone to the saturated zone is smaller than in the case of a short hillslope e g fig 2 a 2 b and the effect of lateral unsaturated flow is weaker in case 2 both hilberts hsb model and kong hsb model predict a quicker occurrence of slope failure than troch hsb model which ignores the unsaturated flow table 3 the significant difference in terms of instability time highlights the importance of unsaturated flow in evaluating the stability of loamy hillslopes there are two reasons 1 the capillary fringe above the water table plays an important role in storing and releasing water and thus affecting groundwater table dynamics and water content variations while the capillarity of loam is much stronger than that of sand 2 more importantly relative hydraulic conductivity exerts a greater influence on soil water movement and capillary fringe dynamics and the low relative hydraulic conductivity of loam will more significantly decrease water movement in the unsaturated zone than that of sand by coupling and comparing troch hsb model and hilberts hsb model with the same infinite slope stability model talebi et al 2008 concluded a negligible effect of the unsaturated zone in rainfall induced shallow landsliding of complex hillslopes however fig 3 b shows that when slope instability occurs due to rising water level at the uphill boundary even considering the vertical redistribution of unsaturated water content can predict an earlier occurrence the unsaturated zone of sand is much thinner than that of loam so the declining rates of fs and corresponding instability time table 3 simulated by the three hsb models are rather close regardless of the hillslope length cases 3 and 4 fig 3 c 3 d therefore it may be safe to neglect the unsaturated flow when evaluating the stability of sandy hillslopes 3 2 2 condition of rising downhill boundary water level as water level at the downhill boundary rises the groundwater level cannot respond quickly to reach the same height the resulting large water pressure gradient not only promotes water to infiltrate into the hillslope but also forms an extra jacking force that stabilises the slope therefore at the initial stage the water table height inside the hillslope is lower than the downhill boundary water level and fs increases correspondingly particularly for the loamy hillslope case 5 fig 3 e the increase of fs due to hydrostatic loading at the downhill boundary was also reported in early research shen et al 2018 wang et al 2014 as water gradually seeps into the hillslope the pore water pressure and soil moisture content increase so fs decreases in cases 5 and 6 with lateral unsaturated flow considered fs decreases more quickly and finally reaches a smaller value fig 3 e 3 f moreover fs remains greater than one when the groundwater level distribution has reached the stable state indicating that slope failure may not occur in the scenario of rising downhill boundary water level this finding is consistent with the study of zhang et al 2010 who concluded the little effect of rising reservoir water on slope stability 3 3 combined effects of lateral unsaturated flow and other factors 3 3 1 slope angle and lateral unsaturated flow fig 4 compares how fs predicted by the three hsb models varies with time for different slope angles based on the setup of case 1 although lateral unsaturated flow may result in an earlier occurrence of slope failure for mild slope angles e g 20 and 22 as shown in fig 4 a 4 b the hillslope remains stable even with unsaturated flow effect considered once the slope angle exceeds a certain threshold shallow landslides tend to occur earlier as the hillslope becomes steeper fig 4 c d and kong hsb model still predicts the fastest occurrence lateral unsaturated flow exerts negligible influence on shallow landslide triggering for steep hillslopes e g 28 under such a steepness the increase of uphill boundary water level will generate quite large pressure head gradients that induce slope failure before the lateral unsaturated flow comes into effect the ignorable role of lateral unsaturated flow is manifested in the almost identical instability time predicted by the three hsb models fig 4 e 4 f note that the hillslope remains stable when slope angle is smaller e g 20 and immediately fails as the simulation begins for large slope angles e g 28 for brevity we did not show these results as they do not provide a further insight into how slope angle and lateral unsaturated flow may combine to affect the slope stability it is noteworthy that the above trend revealed is based on the numerical setup adopted in the current study and it might be different if the values of friction angle and soil cohesion were varied 3 3 2 rising rate of uphill boundary water level and lateral unsaturated flow fig 5 compares the variation trends of fs for different rising rates of uphill boundary water level based on the setup in case 1 as can be seen corresponding to the hydraulic conductivity assumed for loam fs is less sensitive to the rising rate of water level at the uphill boundary overall the changes of fs exhibit a similar trend for different rising rates namely that kong hsb model predicts the earliest slope failure followed by hilberts hsb model and troch hsb model fig 5 a 5 d fig 5 e demonstrates that a faster rising rate shortens the instability time and this trend holds for all the hsb models moreover note that the predicted instability time decreases sharply as the rising rate increases from 0 05 m hour to 0 2 m hour afterwards the decreasing trend slows down when the rising rate keeps going up fig 5 e kong hsb model and troch hsb model predict an instability time of 37 67 hours and 51 44 hours respectively for the 0 05 m hour rising rate and the percentage difference is 36 6 in comparison when the rising rate is 0 6 m hour although the instability time is shorter the corresponding percentage difference is greater reaching 56 3 23 11 hours for kong hsb model and 36 11 hours for troch hsb model since kong hsb model considers both vertical redistribution of unsaturated water content and lateral unsaturated flow whereas troch hsb model does not account for the effect of the unsaturated zone the increasing percentage difference reflects a stronger role of unsaturated zone at a high rising rate of uphill boundary water level in addition the percentage difference between the instability time predicted by kong hsb model and hilberts hsb model increases from 11 9 37 67 hours for kong hsb model and 42 17 hours for hilberts hsb model for the 0 05 m hour rising rate to 16 4 23 11 hours for kong hsb model and 26 89 hours for hilberts hsb model for the 0 6 m hour rising rate indicating that the separate effect of lateral unsaturated flow is stronger when the uphill boundary water level increases faster again note that as stated above these results are dependent on the soil hydraulic conductivity the variation of which may lead to a different trend 3 3 3 rainfall and lateral unsaturated flow in certain situations rainfall and rising boundary water level may cooccur to induce shallow landsliding we considered extra rainfall of different intensities 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 mm day based on the setup of cases 1 and 5 to examine the variation of fs note that all three hsb models neglect vertical transient flow during intense rainfall events unsaturated soil above the vertical infiltration front would accumulate a significant amount of water at the very beginning thereby dampening the rainfall signal hilberts et al 2007 in this regard neglecting the vertical flow might affect the predicted fs and instability time however the trend of comparison amongst the three coupled models would be similar variations of fs under the combined effects of rising uphill boundary water level and rainfall of different intensities are shown in fig 6 the addition of rainfall does not alter the overall trend that kong hsb model predicts the fastest occurrence of slope failure followed by hilberts hsb model and troch hsb model however as rainfall intensity increases the instability time predicted by the three hsb models all decreases monotonically and the discrepancies of instability time reduce as well fig 6 h the decreased discrepancies imply that intensive rainfall may inhibit the role of lateral unsaturated flow in triggering slope failure fig 7 demonstrates how rainfall and the rising downhill boundary water level may add up to affect the stability of a hillslope as it shows the hillslope remains stable when rainfall intensity is or equal to 40 mm day fig 7 a 7 e but loses its stability once the rainfall becomes more intensive e g 50 mm day and 60 mm day fig 7 f 7 g in addition as long as shallow landsliding is triggered by rainfall and rising downhill boundary water level the increasing rainfall intensity will shorten the instability time fig 7 h 4 conclusion this study numerically examined the role of lateral unsaturated flow in shallow landslides triggering under varying boundary water level conditions three hsb models that differ in their treatment of unsaturated flow were coupled with the same slope stability model to evaluate the stability of a hillslope with an impermeable bedrock and covered by a thin layer of soil specific to the scenarios considered the following findings were obtained 1 lateral unsaturated flow exerts a more significant influence on the stability of loamy hillslopes and results in a much earlier occurrence of slope failure while it may be negligible for sandy hillslopes moreover even for loamy hillslopes the lateral unsaturated flow may induce earlier landslides only under the condition of a rising uphill boundary water level while the hillslope remains stable as the water level at the downhill boundary increases 2 the extent to which lateral unsaturated flow may trigger shallow landsliding in advance depends on the slope angle for mild slopes shallow landslides may not occur even with lateral unsaturated flow considered once the slope angle exceeds a certain threshold its increase tends to reduce the instability time for very steep slopes slope failure will occur rather quickly before lateral unsaturated flow takes effect 3 when the water level at the uphill boundary rises faster the lateral unsaturated flow will result in earlier slope failure and the percentage difference of instability time predicted by hsb models that include or exclude lateral unsaturated flow is greater for a faster rising rate 4 under the condition of rising uphill boundary water level intensive rainfall may inhibit the effect of lateral unsaturated flow on triggering shallow landsliding furthermore although lateral unsaturated flow cannot trigger slope failure in the situation of increasing downhill boundary water level the addition of rainfall may cause landsliding and the instability time reduces as the rainfall intensity increases despite the above findings this study considers a rectangular hillslope while a more complex hillslope geometry e g divergent convergent may mediate the role of lateral unsaturated flow for example talebi et al 2008 discovered that convergent hillslopes might become unstable more quickly than divergent hillslopes also the hillslope examined in the current study is assumed to be homogeneous but heterogeneity is more common in natural settings and the slope failure may be strongly dependent on the local heterogeneities lehmann and or 2012 moreover the present study sets a constant rainfall intensity throughout the entire simulation whereas in reality rainfall may vary dramatically in terms of intensity and duration aleotti 2004 guzzetti et al 2008 notwithstanding these limitations this study still provides an insight into the effects of lateral unsaturated flow on triggering shallow landslides and may assist with the toolbox design of shallow landslides prediction credit authorship contribution statement chengji shen conceptualization methodology investigation writing original

431,lateral unsaturated flow was found to contribute little to rainfall induced shallow landslides but it can be important when the landslides are triggered under conditions of varying boundary water level by considering a hillslope with an impermeable bedrock and rising water level at the uphill downhill boundary this study explored how lateral unsaturated flow would affect slope stability three different hillslope storage boussinesq models that differ in their treatment of the unsaturated flow were coupled with the same infinite slope stability model to predict and compare the safety factor and instability time specific to the situations considered this study discovered that despite the inclusion of lateral unsaturated flow effect the hillslope remains stable when water level at the downhill boundary rises under the condition of increasing uphill boundary water level the consideration of lateral unsaturated flow leads to earlier slope failure for loamy hillslopes with a moderate slope also the lateral unsaturated flow may not induce slope failure for mildly sloping loamy hillslopes and plays an ignorable role when landslides occur fast in very steep hillslopes by contrast the lateral unsaturated flow does not affect much the failure of sandy hillslopes moreover when water level at the uphill boundary increases faster the lateral unsaturated flow exerts a greater influence on initiating slope failure further examination shows that intensive rainfall may weaken the effect of lateral unsaturated flow on shallow landslides triggering under the condition of rising uphill boundary water level keywords shallow landslides triggering infinite slope stability safety factor lateral unsaturated flow hsb model 1 introduction landslides as one of the most widespread geohazards in the world are an important process of landscape formation by releasing sediments from slopes to allow transportation through the fluvial systems iverson et al 1997 therefore landslides help to maintain the long term dynamic equilibrium between erosion and uplift singh et al 2010 however for humans landslides are devastating disasters that cause not only enormous economic losses for destroying buildings and infrastructure kjekstad and highland 2009 but also more severely thousands of deaths or injuries per year worldwide petley 2012 given these consequences researchers have conducted many studies to predict the likelihood of landslides by assessing slope stability to warn people living in susceptible landslide areas restrepo et al 2008 landslides can be triggered by various factors of which prolonged or intense rainfall is the primary one direct rainfall infiltration through the unsaturated soil leads to the propagation of the wetting front which increases the pore water pressure and soil moisture content reduces the shear strength of the soil increases the sliding force ultimately initiating slope failure baum et al 2010 saito et al 2010 early research has explored how different rainfall characteristics would affect the initiation of shallow landslides mainly including rainfall intensity althuwaynee et al 2018 chang et al 2017 saito et al 2010 rainfall duration aleotti 2004 chen et al 2015 godt et al 2006 lu and godt 2008 and temporal patterns of rainfall fan et al 2020 ran et al 2018 associated with the rainfall infiltration flow in the unsaturated zone is predominantly vertical and the lateral unsaturated flow is negligible for barely contributing to landslide activation talebi et al 2008 according to iverson 2000 besides direct rainfall infiltration at the hillslope surface lateral flow caused by saturated groundwater flow from adjacent materials may also induce slope failure in situations of river damming and reservoir filling the water level at the downhill boundary of a hillslope will increase thereby deteriorating the slope stability kaczmarek et al 2015 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2014 the statistics of riemer 1992 revealed that about 85 of the landslides around reservoirs are triggered either at the stage of construction and filling or in the first few years of operation after filling during the operation or filling of reservoirs the boundary water level change influences the hydrostatic groundwater pressure inside the hillslope and may cause landslides near these artificial water bodies zhang et al 2010 kaczmarek et al 2015 discovered that the filling and exploitation of the włocławek reservoir in northern poland led to intensified landslide activities the water level at the uphill boundary of a hillslope may also increase when there are cracks or ponds at the uphill boundary and the soil layer is covered by a very thin layer of fine grained soil vertical infiltration into the soil matrix is ignorable and rainfall flows into the cracks or ponds leading to a rising uphill boundary water level and lateral flow in the soil matrix galeandro et al 2014 leach and moore 2015 xu et al 2016 xu et al 2016 showed that the water level increase in the subvertical crack at the uphill boundary had contributed considerably to the initiation of kualiangzi landslide in the sichuan basin china subsequently they proposed a significant negative correlation between uphill boundary water level and slope stability although lateral unsaturated flow can be ignored in rainfall induced shallow landslides it may be critical when landslides are activated by the above mentioned water level variations at the uphill or downhill boundary of a hillslope under these conditions lateral rather than vertical unsaturated flow controls the drainage flux in the unsaturated zone subsequently the change of groundwater pressure heads and moisture content in hillslopes early research showed that the consideration of lateral unsaturated flow improved the prediction accuracy of hillslope drainage process kong et al 2016 a common way to evaluate slope stability is to use the groundwater pressure heads and moisture content derived by hillslope hydrological models as the input parameters of a slope stability model therefore lateral unsaturated flow is likely to be important for slope failure induced by varying boundary water levels however previous work did not investigate this problem specifically the hydrological trigger is a major type of shallow landslides triggers and the lateral unsaturated flow is a nonignorable factor influencing the hillslope hydrological process in this regard it is worth examining the impact of lateral unsaturated flow on triggering slope failure under varying boundary water level conditions although the role of lateral unsaturated flow in initiating slope failure remains unexplored it has been found to be important for hillslope hydrology in many ways lateral unsaturated flow commonly exists in hillslopes it dramatically affects the redistribution of soil moisture and contributes to the nonnegligible drainage flux in the unsaturated zone gannon et al 2017 proposed that lateral unsaturated water flux led to the formation of spatial soil heterogeneity in the headwater catchment at the hubbard brook experimental forest in new hampshire by integrating lateral unsaturated flow into the hillslope storage boussinesq hsb model kong et al 2016 achieved more accurate prediction of the hillslope drainage process e g groundwater outflow rates hydrographs lateral unsaturated flow is also critical for recession flow analysis luo et al 2018 revealed that neglecting lateral unsaturated flow would result in an inaccurate estimate of the slopes of recession curves in certain situations more importantly with lateral unsaturated flow considered there could be three power law regimes two transition points of the recession curves instead of two power law regimes one transition point that were reported in most previous studies due to the strong link to hillslope hydrology it is anticipated that lateral unsaturated flow may play a role when slope failure is activated under the conditions of varying boundary water level but to what extent remains unclear therefore in this study we hypothesized that the triggering of shallow landslides may be attributed to lateral unsaturated flow in situations of varying boundary water level at the uphill or downhill boundary and the extent depends on several factors mainly including slope angle soil type and hillslope length to test the hypothesis we coupled three hsb models which differ in their treatment of the unsaturated flow with the same infinite slope stability model and ran a series of simulations the hsb models we selected were proposed by troch et al 2003 troch hsb model which neglects unsaturated flow hilberts et al 2005 hilberts hsb model which considers vertical unsaturated flow and kong et al 2016 kong hsb model which considers both vertical and lateral unsaturated flow respectively note that in some studies the slope stability model was coupled with 2 d 3 d models that account for variably saturated flow based on the richards equation cai and ugai 2004 collins and znidarcic 2004 hussain et al 2007 however these models are computationally expensive even for small scale problems meanwhile uncertainties of subsurface properties make the parametrization of these models rather difficult bresciani et al 2014 in comparison boussinesq type equations are 1 d and can be analytically solved for various problems so their computational efficiency is higher rocha et al 2007 troch et al 2002 therefore we focused on the hsb models instead of those based on the richards equation following previous research the three hsb models were used to simulate the groundwater pressure heads and soil moisture content of a hillslope with landslide potential simulation results were then used by the same infinite slope stability model to calculate the time varying slope safety factor fs which is the ratio of shear stress available to downslope shear stress and the instability time if landslides occurred which corresponds to the time when fs falls below one we set up numerous cases to include the factors that would affect the role of lateral unsaturated flow e g soil type slope angle slope length boundary conditions and rainfall intensity the research outcomes would promote a deeper understanding of slope failure mechanisms and assist in more accurate evaluation of shallow landslides 2 methodology 2 1 hsb models the original hsb model was proposed by troch et al 2003 to describe the hydrological process in homogeneous hillslopes fig 1 1a w f h t w q x n w 1b f θ s θ r 1c q k s h h x c o s i s i n i where w m is the hillslope width along the sloping bed f is the effective drainable porosity h m is the water table height perpendicular to the impermeable layer t s is the time q m2 s is the darcy flux per unit width along the hillslope x m is the distance from the outlet measured parallel to the impermeable layer n m s is the recharge rate and used to represent rainfall intensity in this study ks m s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity i is the slope angle and θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual water content respectively as eq 1b shows the troch hsb model does not consider unsaturated flow since f is treated as a constant readers should note that the presence of an impermeable bedrock under the soil cover as assumed in this study is not always the case so the results and discussions in following sections apply to such situations only also our study mainly considered slope failure induced by the build up of positive pore water pressure while it may also be triggered by other factors e g slope inclination angle friction angle and effective cohesion of the soil cover the drainable porosity f is a storage coefficient that accounts for the impact of the unsaturated zone on water table fluctuations and as shown in eq 1b it is treated as a constant by troch et al 2003 however indeed this parameter depends on the water retention characteristics of soil and depth to the water table by assuming hydrostatic pressure distribution along the direction normal to the hillslope base fig 1 hilberts et al 2005 analytically expressed f as a function of water table depth to obtain the analytical expression a function that describes the relationship between soil moisture θ ψ and pressure head ψ is required and the van genuchten vg 1980 function is the most widely used 2a θ θ r θ s θ r s w 2b s w 1 1 α vg ψ n m 2c m 1 1 n where αvg 1 m and n are the original vg parameters s w is the saturation under the assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution along the direction normal to the hillslope base fig 1 ψ h z cos i however it is difficult to drive the analytical expression by directly using the original vg functions troch 1993 found that by assuming m 1 1 nh nh n it is possible to fit the soil water retention curves for various soil types 3 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h ψ n h 1 1 n h where α h 1 m and nh are the modified vg parameters that can be obtained by fitting to the original vg curves based on eq 3 hilberts et al 2005 derived the analytical expression of f by assuming zero vertical flux in the unsaturated zone 4 f θ s θ r 1 1 α h h d c o s i n h 1 1 n h where d m is the thickness of soil substituting eq 4 into eq 1 gives the hilberts hsb model readers may refer to hilberts et al 2005 for more details of the derivation despite the improvement of the hilberts hsb model there is still a discrepancy between predictions and measurements kong et al 2016 pointed out that the discrepancy may result from the neglection of lateral unsaturated flow and so further improved the hsb model by considering this component during the hillslope drainage process to derive the new hsb model kong et al 2016 also needed the expression of θ ψ ψ and followed the approach of troch 1993 namely eq 3 which generates two modified vg parameters α 1 m and n1 in the kong hsb model described below besides the derivation of kong hsb model also needed the expression of k ψ ψ which is described by the vg function as k ψ k s s w 1 2 1 1 s w 1 m m 2 however this function is inapplicable to the derivation noticing that the characteristic curves of k ψ ψ and θ ψ ψ exhibit similar distribution features kong et al 2016 resolved the inapplicability issue by transforming the vg expression of k ψ ψ into a format similar to that of eq 3 namely 5 k ψ k s 1 1 β ψ n 2 1 1 n 2 where β 1 m and n2 are new modified vg parameters relative to soil properties in this regard there are four modified vg parameters in the kong hsb model and their values can be obtained by fitting to the original vg curves the expression of kong hsb model is given below and readers may refer to kong et al 2016 for more details of the derivation process 6a w f h t w q x n w 6b q k s max h 0 p h x c o s i s i n i 6c p d h 1 β h d cos i n 2 1 n 2 min h 0 1 β h cos i n 2 1 n 2 6d f θ s θ r 1 α min h 0 cos i n 1 1 1 n 1 1 α h d cos i n 1 1 1 n 1 where f is the equivalent drainable porosity proposed by kong et al 2016 and p m is the equivalent propagation thickness in the unsaturated zone note that all three hsb models use residual water content θ r as the lower limit of unsaturated water content field capacity which represents the upper limit of drainable water after infiltration or wetting is generally larger than θ r and independent of groundwater level therefore the use of θ r may underestimate the actual total soil water storage and the neglection of field capacity as a typical initial condition of the unsaturated soil before infiltration will affect the instability time nonetheless the comparison of time varying fs and instability time predicted by the three coupled models based on θ r would demonstrate a trend similar to that based on field capacity the above governing equations show that the three hsb models mainly differ in their treatment of the unsaturated flow as reflected in the expression of f the storage coefficient that accounts for the effect of the unsaturated zone on groundwater dynamics the troch hsb model treats f as a constant without considering the dependence on depth to the water table and water retention characteristics of the soil based on the assumption of quasi steady state hydraulic equilibrium zero vertical flux the hilberts hsb model expresses f as a function of water table depth thereby partially considering the influence of unsaturated zone on water table fluctuations while the kong hsb model makes further improvement by considering additional lateral unsaturated flow also the troch hsb and hilberts hsb models ignore the effect of variation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which is considered by the kong hsb model 2 2 infinite slope stability model in hilly areas the bedrock may be impermeable and covered by a thin layer of soil parallel to the base when the pore water pressure of the soil layer increases rapidly the pressure head rises subsequently increasing the sliding force reducing the shear capacity of the soil and finally triggering landslides meanwhile previous research found that the contact surface between the impermeable substrate and the soil layer is often where landslides begin fig 1 following these studies we focus on shallow landslides triggered by the rising water table that builds up at the interface between the soil cover and the impermeable substrate however readers should be aware that such a scenario is not universal since the bedrock may be permeable e g weathered or fractured bedrock montgomery et al 2002 and shallow landslides can sometimes be triggered in unsaturated soil conditions kim and jeong 2017 in particular the infiltration and exfiltration processes through permeable bedrock have been found to affect the triggering intensity and volume of shallow landslides brönnimann et al 2013 onda et al 2004 in this regard the results presented are only applicable to the specific scenario considered in most situations the thickness of the soil layer is quite small compared to the length and width so the infinite slope stability theory can be applied aristizabal et al 2016 rosso et al 2006 talebi et al 2008 the theory calculates the safety factor fs to predict the likelihood of shallow landslides fs at location x along the hillslope is given as 7 f s τ f τ where τf kg m s2 or interchangeably kn m2 is the shear stress available and τ kg m s2 is the downslope shear stress according to the mohr coulomb failure criterion the shear strength of soil along the potential failure plane is related to the cohesive force and internal friction angle and can be obtained via the effective stress method 8 τ f c σ u t a n φ where c kg m s2 is the effective soil cohesion σ kg m s2 is the normal stress u kg m s2 is the pore water pressure and ϕ is the effective internal friction angle of soil note that eq 8 is only applicable under the assumption that the soil at the failure surface is fully saturated based on the coordinate system in fig 1 the expressions for σ u and τ are 9a σ d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z c o s i 9b u γ w h c o s i 9c τ d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z s i n i where γd kn m3 is the dry bulk unit weight of soil γw kn m3 is the unit weight of water z m is the elevation of calculating point perpendicular to the hillslope base and θ is the water content substituting eqs 9a 9c into eqs 7 and 8 yields the general expression for fs 10 f s c d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z c o s i γ w h c o s i t a n φ d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z s i n i note that eq 7 calculates fs at a certain location along the hillslope to obtain fs for the whole hillslope τ f and τ should be integrated along the entire length of the hillslope leading to the following expression based on eq 10 11 f s 0 l c d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z c o s i γ w h c o s i t a n φ d x 0 l d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z s i n i d x eq 11 does not include the effect of the hydrostatic pressure at the uphill or downhill boundary following xu et al 2016 the effect of uphill hydrostatic pressure can be considered by adding an extra term into eq 11 12 f s 0 l c d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z c o s i γ w h c o s i 1 2 γ w h w 2 s i n i t a

from eq 12 that the increase of water level at the uphill boundary is detrimental to the slope stability by reducing fs in contrast the rising water level at the downhill boundary helps stabilize the slope and this effect can be reflected by rewriting eq 12 as 13 f s 0 l c d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z c o s i γ w h c o s i 1 2 γ w h w 2 s i n i t a n φ d x 0 l d γ d γ w 0 d θ d z s i n i d x 1 2 γ w h w 2 c o s i 2 3 modeling setup 2 3 1 simulation cases we considered a rising water level at the uphill downhill boundary with the water level at the downhill uphill boundary held constant under the condition of a rising uphill boundary water level we set two slope lengths 10 m and 50 m the two slope lengths are within the value range used in previous studies for example ran et al 2018 adopted a 10 m long hillslope in their numerical investigation of rainfall induced shallow landslides while talebi et al 2008 set a slope length of 100 m to investigate the effect of vertical unsaturated flow on hillslope failure two soil types that commonly exist in natural settings and differ in their strength of unsaturated flow were used loam and sand following early research on hillslope drainage process hilberts et al 2005 troch et al 2003 the combination of slope length and soil type created case 1 loam 10 m uphill case 2 loam 50 m uphill case 3 sand 10 m uphill and case 4 sand 50 m uphill since the hillslope is inherently prone to local instability and almost unaffected by the slope length when the water level at the downhill boundary increases we set two soil types with the same 50 m slope length generating case 5 loam 50 m downhill and case 6 sand 50 m downhill the rising rate of water level at the uphill cases 1 4 or downhill cases 5 6 boundary was set as 0 2 m hour based on the observations of early research for example the monitoring of xu et al 2016 recorded a 1 4 5 m day water level increase in the crack at the uphill boundary of the kualiangzi landslide and simpson et al 2018 reported that the filling rate of the koyna reservoir in western india was between 0 6 m day during 1960 2010 more details of the simulation setup are given in table 1 to further explore the role of lateral unsaturated flow we conducted a sensitivity analysis based on case 1 by changing the slope angle to 20 case 7 22 case 8 24 case 9 and 28 case 10 hillslopes with these slope angles are common and have been studied in terms of their drainage process pauritsch et al 2015 also we varied the rising rate of uphill boundary water level from the 0 2 m hour in case 1 to 0 05 m hour case 11 0 4 m hour case 12 and 0 6 m hour case 13 moreover we examined the combined effects of rainfall and boundary water level change based on cases 1 and 5 thereby generating cases 14 19 and cases 20 25 rainfall intensity increases from 10 mm day to 60 mm day with an increment of 10 mm day in both groups respectively these rainfall intensities have been widely used in preceding work on the mechanisms of rainfall induced shallow landslides ran et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 readers may refer to table 1 for more details about the case conditions in the sensitivity analysis 2 3 2 parameters this study assumed a homogeneous and isotropic hillslope the hydrological parameters are adopted from previous studies on hillslope drainage process and recession flow analysis hilberts et al 2005 kong et al 2016 luo et al 2018 while the geotechnical parameters are based on the study of talebi et al 2008 which examined rainfall induced hillslope failure table 2 2 3 3 simulation runs we used the stable groundwater level formed under the condition of 0 3 m downhill and 0 1 m uphill boundary water level in each case as the initial condition to ensure a moist slope contact face starting from the initial condition each simulation was carried out with a varying uphill downhill boundary water level so no warming up stage was needed note that the different slope lengths and soil types across cases led to different initial water level distributions even under the same prescribed boundary water level however the differences were minor and did not affect the investigation on the role of lateral unsaturated flow in activating slope failure for each case the three hsb models were respectively run to simulate the water table height and water content inside the hillslope using the finite difference method appendix a and the infinite slope stability model was then employed to calculate fs at each time step therefore the difference in water table height and water content caused by the effect of the lateral unsaturated flow can be reflected in the fs each simulation began as the uphill or downhill boundary water level rose and kept running until reaching the stable groundwater level inside the hillslope no matter shallow landslide occurred or not by comparing the instability time when fs 1 predicted by the three coupling models we could understand the effect of lateral unsaturated flow on causing shallow landsliding 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of lateral unsaturated flow on groundwater pressure heads fig 2 compares how the water table level predicted by the three hsb models changes with time in cases 1 6 it is notable that regardless of the boundary condition and slope length the water table variations predicted by kong hsb model in loamy hillslopes cases 1 2 and 5 deviate more from the predictions of troch hsb and hilberts hsb models than in sandy hillslopes cases 3 4 and 6 the greater deviation for loamy hillslopes may be explained by the fact that the unsaturated zone of loam is thicker than that of sand and the corresponding lateral unsaturated flow plays a greater role in unsaturated water content redistribution and hence the groundwater level variation as water level at the uphill boundary rises for loamy hillslopes cases 1 2 the groundwater level simulated by the kong hsb model propagates downhill the fastest sequentially followed by the hilberts hsb model and the troch hsb model reflecting the effect of vertical unsaturated water content distribution and lateral unsaturated flow on promoting groundwater propagations when the water level reaches the stable state there is no vertical redistribution of unsaturated water content whereas lateral unsaturated flow still exists consequently for the part near the downhill boundary the kong hsb model predicts lower values than the forecast of the troch hsb and hilberts hsb models with the latter two deriving almost identical predictions note that as the slope length increases from 10 m case 1 to 50 m case 2 despite the same trend it takes a much longer time one order of magnitude higher for the water table level to reach the stable state due to the weaker capillarity of sand under the condition of rising uphill boundary water level lateral unsaturated flow exerts much less significant influence on groundwater wave propagations in sandy hillslopes cases 3 4 than in loamy hillslopes cases 1 2 the weak role is indicated by the rather similar water table levels predicted by the three hsb models nonetheless it is noteworthy that the stable water table level simulated by the kong hsb model is still slightly lower than the other two models have predicted therefore it is clear from the results of cases 1 4 that when lateral flow in the unsaturated zone is neglected the stable water level will be overestimated under the condition of rising uphill boundary water level in the scenario of rising water level at the downhill boundary cases 5 6 groundwater spreads uphill faster and forms a higher stable water level when considering the lateral unsaturated flow particularly for the loamy hillslope case 5 it can be inferred from cases 5 6 that as downhill boundary water level increases the stable water level in a hillslope may be underestimated without considering the lateral unsaturated flow 3 2 effect of lateral unsaturated flow on fs 3 2 1 condition of rising uphill boundary water level fig 3 a 3 d compare the variation of fs predicted by the three hsb models for different cases under the scenario of increasing uphill boundary water level in general the four cases exhibit a similar trend namely the decrease of fs with time irrespective of the hsb model used for loamy hillslopes fig 3 a 3 b at the initial stage the decreasing rates of fs predicted by the three hsb models are quite close afterwards for the short 10 m hillslope case 1 fig 3 a kong hsb model predicts the fastest decline of fs and so the earliest slope failure followed by hilberts hsb model and troch hsb model the instability time corresponding to hilberts hsb model and troch hsb model is 29 72 and 39 hours respectively increasing by 15 3 and 51 3 compared to the 25 78 hours forecast by kong hsb model when the loamy hillslope is longer 50 m case 2 before the initiation of the shallow landslide fs 1 fs forecast by kong hsb and hilberts hsb models falls at similar speeds and approaches slope instability almost simultaneously indicating that the effect of lateral unsaturated flow on triggering slope failure depends on the hillslope length for a longer hillslope the degree to which considering lateral unsaturated flow would predict earlier slope failure is lower fig 3 b the percentage differences of instability time between troch hsb and kong hsb models and between hilberts hsb and kong hsb models are 45 3 and 2 2 in case 2 respectively table 3 these two numbers both decrease greatly in comparison to those in case 1 showing the weaker impact of lateral unsaturated flow on a longer loamy hillslope in a long hillslope the hydrological process allows sufficient time for the water table height to slowly rise to the same level as the uphill boundary water level consequently the ratio of the unsaturated zone to the saturated zone is smaller than in the case of a short hillslope e g fig 2 a 2 b and the effect of lateral unsaturated flow is weaker in case 2 both hilberts hsb model and kong hsb model predict a quicker occurrence of slope failure than troch hsb model which ignores the unsaturated flow table 3 the significant difference in terms of instability time highlights the importance of unsaturated flow in evaluating the stability of loamy hillslopes there are two reasons 1 the capillary fringe above the water table plays an important role in storing and releasing water and thus affecting groundwater table dynamics and water content variations while the capillarity of loam is much stronger than that of sand 2 more importantly relative hydraulic conductivity exerts a greater influence on soil water movement and capillary fringe dynamics and the low relative hydraulic conductivity of loam will more significantly decrease water movement in the unsaturated zone than that of sand by coupling and comparing troch hsb model and hilberts hsb model with the same infinite slope stability model talebi et al 2008 concluded a negligible effect of the unsaturated zone in rainfall induced shallow landsliding of complex hillslopes however fig 3 b shows that when slope instability occurs due to rising water level at the uphill boundary even considering the vertical redistribution of unsaturated water content can predict an earlier occurrence the unsaturated zone of sand is much thinner than that of loam so the declining rates of fs and corresponding instability time table 3 simulated by the three hsb models are rather close regardless of the hillslope length cases 3 and 4 fig 3 c 3 d therefore it may be safe to neglect the unsaturated flow when evaluating the stability of sandy hillslopes 3 2 2 condition of rising downhill boundary water level as water level at the downhill boundary rises the groundwater level cannot respond quickly to reach the same height the resulting large water pressure gradient not only promotes water to infiltrate into the hillslope but also forms an extra jacking force that stabilises the slope therefore at the initial stage the water table height inside the hillslope is lower than the downhill boundary water level and fs increases correspondingly particularly for the loamy hillslope case 5 fig 3 e the increase of fs due to hydrostatic loading at the downhill boundary was also reported in early research shen et al 2018 wang et al 2014 as water gradually seeps into the hillslope the pore water pressure and soil moisture content increase so fs decreases in cases 5 and 6 with lateral unsaturated flow considered fs decreases more quickly and finally reaches a smaller value fig 3 e 3 f moreover fs remains greater than one when the groundwater level distribution has reached the stable state indicating that slope failure may not occur in the scenario of rising downhill boundary water level this finding is consistent with the study of zhang et al 2010 who concluded the little effect of rising reservoir water on slope stability 3 3 combined effects of lateral unsaturated flow and other factors 3 3 1 slope angle and lateral unsaturated flow fig 4 compares how fs predicted by the three hsb models varies with time for different slope angles based on the setup of case 1 although lateral unsaturated flow may result in an earlier occurrence of slope failure for mild slope angles e g 20 and 22 as shown in fig 4 a 4 b the hillslope remains stable even with unsaturated flow effect considered once the slope angle exceeds a certain threshold shallow landslides tend to occur earlier as the hillslope becomes steeper fig 4 c d and kong hsb model still predicts the fastest occurrence lateral unsaturated flow exerts negligible influence on shallow landslide triggering for steep hillslopes e g 28 under such a steepness the increase of uphill boundary water level will generate quite large pressure head gradients that induce slope failure before the lateral unsaturated flow comes into effect the ignorable role of lateral unsaturated flow is manifested in the almost identical instability time predicted by the three hsb models fig 4 e 4 f note that the hillslope remains stable when slope angle is smaller e g 20 and immediately fails as the simulation begins for large slope angles e g 28 for brevity we did not show these results as they do not provide a further insight into how slope angle and lateral unsaturated flow may combine to affect the slope stability it is noteworthy that the above trend revealed is based on the numerical setup adopted in the current study and it might be different if the values of friction angle and soil cohesion were varied 3 3 2 rising rate of uphill boundary water level and lateral unsaturated flow fig 5 compares the variation trends of fs for different rising rates of uphill boundary water level based on the setup in case 1 as can be seen corresponding to the hydraulic conductivity assumed for loam fs is less sensitive to the rising rate of water level at the uphill boundary overall the changes of fs exhibit a similar trend for different rising rates namely that kong hsb model predicts the earliest slope failure followed by hilberts hsb model and troch hsb model fig 5 a 5 d fig 5 e demonstrates that a faster rising rate shortens the instability time and this trend holds for all the hsb models moreover note that the predicted instability time decreases sharply as the rising rate increases from 0 05 m hour to 0 2 m hour afterwards the decreasing trend slows down when the rising rate keeps going up fig 5 e kong hsb model and troch hsb model predict an instability time of 37 67 hours and 51 44 hours respectively for the 0 05 m hour rising rate and the percentage difference is 36 6 in comparison when the rising rate is 0 6 m hour although the instability time is shorter the corresponding percentage difference is greater reaching 56 3 23 11 hours for kong hsb model and 36 11 hours for troch hsb model since kong hsb model considers both vertical redistribution of unsaturated water content and lateral unsaturated flow whereas troch hsb model does not account for the effect of the unsaturated zone the increasing percentage difference reflects a stronger role of unsaturated zone at a high rising rate of uphill boundary water level in addition the percentage difference between the instability time predicted by kong hsb model and hilberts hsb model increases from 11 9 37 67 hours for kong hsb model and 42 17 hours for hilberts hsb model for the 0 05 m hour rising rate to 16 4 23 11 hours for kong hsb model and 26 89 hours for hilberts hsb model for the 0 6 m hour rising rate indicating that the separate effect of lateral unsaturated flow is stronger when the uphill boundary water level increases faster again note that as stated above these results are dependent on the soil hydraulic conductivity the variation of which may lead to a different trend 3 3 3 rainfall and lateral unsaturated flow in certain situations rainfall and rising boundary water level may cooccur to induce shallow landsliding we considered extra rainfall of different intensities 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 mm day based on the setup of cases 1 and 5 to examine the variation of fs note that all three hsb models neglect vertical transient flow during intense rainfall events unsaturated soil above the vertical infiltration front would accumulate a significant amount of water at the very beginning thereby dampening the rainfall signal hilberts et al 2007 in this regard neglecting the vertical flow might affect the predicted fs and instability time however the trend of comparison amongst the three coupled models would be similar variations of fs under the combined effects of rising uphill boundary water level and rainfall of different intensities are shown in fig 6 the addition of rainfall does not alter the overall trend that kong hsb model predicts the fastest occurrence of slope failure followed by hilberts hsb model and troch hsb model however as rainfall intensity increases the instability time predicted by the three hsb models all decreases monotonically and the discrepancies of instability time reduce as well fig 6 h the decreased discrepancies imply that intensive rainfall may inhibit the role of lateral unsaturated flow in triggering slope failure fig 7 demonstrates how rainfall and the rising downhill boundary water level may add up to affect the stability of a hillslope as it shows the hillslope remains stable when rainfall intensity is or equal to 40 mm day fig 7 a 7 e but loses its stability once the rainfall becomes more intensive e g 50 mm day and 60 mm day fig 7 f 7 g in addition as long as shallow landsliding is triggered by rainfall and rising downhill boundary water level the increasing rainfall intensity will shorten the instability time fig 7 h 4 conclusion this study numerically examined the role of lateral unsaturated flow in shallow landslides triggering under varying boundary water level conditions three hsb models that differ in their treatment of unsaturated flow were coupled with the same slope stability model to evaluate the stability of a hillslope with an impermeable bedrock and covered by a thin layer of soil specific to the scenarios considered the following findings were obtained 1 lateral unsaturated flow exerts a more significant influence on the stability of loamy hillslopes and results in a much earlier occurrence of slope failure while it may be negligible for sandy hillslopes moreover even for loamy hillslopes the lateral unsaturated flow may induce earlier landslides only under the condition of a rising uphill boundary water level while the hillslope remains stable as the water level at the downhill boundary increases 2 the extent to which lateral unsaturated flow may trigger shallow landsliding in advance depends on the slope angle for mild slopes shallow landslides may not occur even with lateral unsaturated flow considered once the slope angle exceeds a certain threshold its increase tends to reduce the instability time for very steep slopes slope failure will occur rather quickly before lateral unsaturated flow takes effect 3 when the water level at the uphill boundary rises faster the lateral unsaturated flow will result in earlier slope failure and the percentage difference of instability time predicted by hsb models that include or exclude lateral unsaturated flow is greater for a faster rising rate 4 under the condition of rising uphill boundary water level intensive rainfall may inhibit the effect of lateral unsaturated flow on triggering shallow landsliding furthermore although lateral unsaturated flow cannot trigger slope failure in the situation of increasing downhill boundary water level the addition of rainfall may cause landsliding and the instability time reduces as the rainfall intensity increases despite the above findings this study considers a rectangular hillslope while a more complex hillslope geometry e g divergent convergent may mediate the role of lateral unsaturated flow for example talebi et al 2008 discovered that convergent hillslopes might become unstable more quickly than divergent hillslopes also the hillslope examined in the current study is assumed to be homogeneous but heterogeneity is more common in natural settings and the slope failure may be strongly dependent on the local heterogeneities lehmann and or 2012 moreover the present study sets a constant rainfall intensity throughout the entire simulation whereas in reality rainfall may vary dramatically in terms of intensity and duration aleotti 2004 guzzetti et al 2008 notwithstanding these limitations this study still provides an insight into the effects of lateral unsaturated flow on triggering shallow landslides and may assist with the toolbox design of shallow landslides prediction credit authorship contribution statement chengji shen conceptualization methodology investigation writing original

432,unforeseen clogging and low well productivity during exploitation of oil and gas reservoirs result from a mobilisation of densely deposited particles the proposed model predicts the mobilisation in unsaturated porous media based on the changes in water level and hydrophilicity and size of mobilisable particles domains of particle attachment sliding rolling and lifting were found from a phase diagram based on a mechanical equilibrium the degree of mobilisation was correlated with experimental data through a maximum retention function the validity of the proposed model was confirmed by a close match of theoretical predictions with results of 46 laboratory tests on particle detachment our analysis shows that it is practically impossible to remove 2 μm charged colloids from a dry porous media nearly desalinated water with ionic strength of 0 001 m or less are needed to mobilise particles in saturated media at typical groundwater conditions a gradual increase in water level is key for

thoroughly studied in electronic and pharmaceutical industries and environmental processes gradoń 2009 a detailed list includes cleaning of silicon wafers reinhardt and kern 2018 nuclear accidents steinhauser et al 2014 detection of explosives keedy et al 2012 subsoil transport of hazardous materials yan et al 2013 pneumatic conveying hilton and cleary 2011 and transport of particles in respiratory ways hinds 2012 recent studies show that clogging of pores in porous media and low well productivity and injectivity during exploitation of oil and gas reservoirs are due to particle detachment chequer et al 2018 russell et al 2017 yang and bedrikovetsky 2017 a resuspension of densely deposited particles in porous media stays outside of previously studied phenomenon a classic model starts from a media bare of deposit gitis et al 2010 ziskind et al 2011 and ends when a number of deposited particles becomes significant in the case of granular media filtration the filter is simply backwashed and a new cycle starts once again from a presumable clean filter in subsoils the presence of accumulated particles especially in large numbers results in either increased attachment or in clogging of pores and decline of the effective permeability russell and bedrikovetsky 2018 separate models for former saturated and latter unsaturated media are formulated and solved using an assumption of a constant degree of saturation lenhart and saiers 2002 frequent changes in water level due to imbibition or drainage are disregarded in practice groundwater level changes spatially and temporally previous models are unable to link the resuspension of deposited particles to dynamic changes in water level another shortcoming of previous models is their pre occupation with particle accumulation the mobilisation is usually discussed in view of dynamic equilibrium between accumulation and mobilisation stages but not as a separate phenomenon a theoretical base for the study of particle mobilisation includes a physically sound force balance on a single attached particle solved analytically or numerically and verified by experiments fig 1 is a sketch of forces acting on a particle attached to a solid surface in a completely dry or fully saturated media the forces exerted on a fully immersed particle are related to the particle itself the porous media and the external forces and torques originated from a surrounding fluid the attachment forces include gravity and van der waals forces the detachment forces are buoyancy electrostatic repulsion and born occasional detachment forces are lift and drag that may cause particle lifting rolling or sliding kalantariasl et al 2015 kalantariasl et al 2014 bradford et al 2013 alshakhs and kovscek 2016 takahashi and kovscek 2010 summing acting forces tangential or normal to the surface or summing torques generated by each acting force indicates if a particle remains attached or will be mobilised bradford et al 2013 muecke 1979 sarkar and sharma 1990 a particle will be lifted off a surface if a vertical projection of detachment forces is higher than a projection of attachment forces a particle will slide along the grain surface if a horizontal projection of detachment forces will be higher than a projection of attachment forces a particle will roll over a grain surface if the torque balance of detachment momentum will be positive the difference between a fully and partially immersed particle is in the presence of an additional capillary force the force is at least an order of magnitude higher than other forces including electrostatic and hydrodynamic sarkar and sharma 1990 and can hold a particle near a grain surface shang et al 2008 sharma et al 2008 or empower its mobilisation lazouskaya et al 2013 huang et al 2018 aramrak et al 2011 the force becomes critical at imbibition or drainage implying a presence of moving front lazouskaya et al 2013 or inclined grain surface veerapaneni et al 2000 j wan and tokunaga 1997 thus the force does not act along the x y axis and is decomposed into normal and tangential to the air water interface components a tangential projection of a capillary force affects the sliding of colloids over the media surface a normal projection is a detrimental addition to attractive or repulsive forces veerapaneni et al 2000 j wan and tokunaga 1997 fig 2 exemplifies how the presence of capillary force changes the probability of particle mobilisation in completely dry fig 2a slightly wet fig 2b partially saturated fig 2c and completely saturated fig 2d porous media although the entire analysis describes all four cases we found the case of a partially immersed particle depicted in fig 2c especially interesting it is where the capillary force turns repulsive and helps to mobilise the particle three additional factors to enhance the detachment are low water salinity high ph and high velocity oliveira et al 2014 you et al 2016 bradford et al 2011 the fraction of the remaining particles during the detachment at given flow conditions is determined by the maximum retention function bedrikovetsky et al 2011 this function is a mathematical model for fines detachment and provides a convenient way to compare the theoretical predictions with laboratory data produced by observations of the mobilised particle concentration with the induced permeability decline chequer et al 2018 chequer and bedrikovetsky 2019 zeinijahromi et al 2012 the central assumption of the comparison is that mobilised colloids travel along a porous media until eventually get captured between two firmly attached grains a gradual development of a neck or a pocket reduces the permeability and that macroscopic change can be easily measured the method to calculate maximum retention function and consequent permeability decline with particle straining has been developed for single phase flows you et al 2016 bedrikovetsky et al 2011 and form a basics for governing equations of suspension colloidal transport in porous media chequer et al 2018 yang and bedrikovetsky 2017 russell and bedrikovetsky 2018 maximum retention function for particles in two phase flow under the action of capillary force was not developed yet our study offers a convenient way to correlate between a microscopic theoretical examination of particle mobilisation potential and macroscopic variations of retained concentrations and permeability for two phase transport with the consequent change in well productivity in subterranean reservoirs the examination is based on the changing position of the water level and considers the lifting rolling and sliding as potential particle mobilisation mechanisms the current work was motivated by the complexity of possible detachment scenarios at some point despite many interesting works in the field bradford et al 2013 lazouskaya et al 2013 chatterjee et al 2012 lazouskaya et al 2011 we felt that a proper comprehensive description of the possible scenario is still needed a method of mathematical modelling of fines detachment and migration on the core and reservoir scales based on micro scale mechanical equilibrium is not available additional motivation came from the observation that the majority of the literature describes the cases of drainage but not the imbibition russell et al 2017 khilar and fogler 1998 sharma and yortsos 1986 the history of interactions between a grain and a particle is important as under similar conditions a different degree of resuspension after the drainage and the imbibition is expected beliaev and hassanizadeh 2001 the investigation of this hysteresis is not available in the current work we theoretically investigated the colloid release in dry confined unsaturated and saturated media and tested our findings by comparison with available experimental data based on the mechanical equilibrium of a particle attached to the substrate under the presence of water air meniscus we propose a phase diagram that marks the areas of attachment rolling lifting and sliding an unbiased knowledge of media conditions can now serve to predict the most probable particle behaviour the mobilisation predictions based on the phase diagrams were confirmed by experimental data of 46 laboratory tests and can be used to forecast potential well clogging the mechanical equilibrium conditions of the particle attached to a substrate for different water levels allowed calculation of the maximum retention concentration versus water saturation in a model porous medium the calculations exhibit a close match with the laboratory data which validates the maximum retention function as a mathematical model for fines detachment under water saturation variations in porous media at the core and reservoir scales the structure of the text is as follows section 2 gives details about the forces acting on a particle attached to a solid surface and discusses rolling sliding and lifting as the potential mechanisms of particle mobilisation section 3 provides the analysis of forces and theoretical calculations for different detachment scenarios section 4 presents the maximum concentration of attached particles as a function of water saturation section 5 concludes the study 2 forces balances and torques mobilisation of a colloidal particle attached to a plane solid surface is a function of forces acting on it their balance and torques a particle on a solid surface is always influenced by particle level and contact level forces the particle level forces are universal and always exist gravity and buoyancy are examples of these forces contact level forces are plausible yet require reasonable assumptions such as charge or water level the presence of a charge implies the presence of electrostatic repulsion and attraction if the particle and the media are surrounded by a gas phase the attraction forces are coulomb force and van der waals attraction the latter can be due to an induced charge that a grain imparts on the particle and a particle imparts on the grain if the particle and the media are submerged in a polar liquid such as water the significant attraction forces are only those that a grain imparts on a particle particle particle interactions become significant in the absence of media grains the electrostatic repulsion in the aqueous phase includes born repulsion the presence of water introduces capillary and buoyancy forces fig 2a delineates forces that act between a single particle and a media grain interacting through the air coulomb van der waals and gravity are the involved forces coulomb force on the figure is repulsive under an assumption that both the particle and the grain are negatively charged in fig 2b the interactions between the particle and the surface are through a thin electrolyte layer and therefore van der waals attraction and electrostatic repulsions replace the coulomb forces in an updated force balance different from the previous case the particle is now under the influence of capillary force fig 2c considers the presence of a hydraulic shell around the media grain the capillary force governs attachment or mobilisation of a particle to from a grain at a low water level the capillary force is mainly attractive and particles will be held on the surface repulsive capillary force at increased water level will release a particle from the surface finally fig 2d shows a fully saturated media in which a particle is first released from the grain by changes in the surrounding environment flury and aramrak 2017 and only after that swiped by the flow in absence of the effect of drag or lift forces the entire force balance accounts only for particle and contact forces without any external intervention all four scenarios are interrelated through changes in the degree of saturation defined as a ratio of pore volume filled with water to the total pore volume our analyses are based on a number of assumptions that can be briefly described as 1 single spherical particles no clusters 2 one layered adsorption and deposition 3 the incoming fluid is free of particles so resuspended particles do not interact with particles in the bulk 4 no external force mechanical brushing hydraulic waves except blowing with a constant velocity in laminar flow regime no flow fluctuations vortices turbulence 5 a media grain is much larger than the particle and presents a perfectly smooth horizontal surface 6 particle is a perfect sphere and its adhesion to the grain surface is elastic 7 a single interaction between a particle and a flat surface 8 the diffusion is negligible 9 the water level on top of the grain is horizontal i e the capillaries are filled from the media grain surface and not from the meniscus across the capillary 10 laminar flow regime and constant flow velocity 11 negligible charge heterogeneity and surface roughness 12 fully water wet substrate 2 1 capillary force the capillary force consists of two components laplace pressure force and the surface tension force a dominating component changes as a function of water level laplace pressure force is important in a low saturation pendular regime when the degree of saturation is below 0 07 denoth 1999 here a water phase is isolated and the air phase is continuous throughout the media water is arranged in an isolated meniscus in a contact region between a particle and a grain fig 2b the capillary force is given by the expression scheludko and nikolov 1975

by extrapolating the meniscus shape through a thin film region to the solid surface eq 1 is developed from a more general equation o brien and hermann 1973 under the assumption that both the particle and the media grain are made of the same material and their contact angles with a fluid are similar thus the contact angle θ is the parameter that determines the position of a particle at the interface i e its immersed fraction the depth of immersion l under equilibrium conditions can be derived directly from the contact angle hórvölgyi et al 1993 aveyard et al 2000 paunov 2003 2 l r s 1 c o s θ the funicular regime covers a higher saturation regime with a water level between 0 07 and 0 4 the air water pattern changes from annular to churn to slug to bubble in the annular pattern a constant liquid film at the grain surface coexists with a continuous gas phase yarin et al 2008 a churn pattern is extremely chaotic and the air water interface is irregular air and water phases have no distinct shapes in a slug pattern air slugs exist in a continuous aqueous phase spanned through most of the porous media and are separated by water plugs in the axial direction the bubble pattern has a continuous water phase and isolated gas bubbles trapped in the water the expression for capillary force in the funicular regime is shang et al 2008 lazouskaya et al 2013 3 f c 2 π r s γ g l s i n φ sin θ φ where φ is an arbitrary angle that determines the water level around the particle the angle φ is introduced to change the capillary force from attractive to repulsive as a function of water level lazouskaya et al 2013 chatterjee et al 2012 eq 3 suggests that the capillary force has a sinusoidal form it can be attractive if φ θ and repulsive if φ θ and has two maximum values at φ π θ 2 and φ π θ 2 when a free water surface forms on top of a particle the capillary force ceases to exist morrow 1970 eq 3 can be re written assuming the water level around the particle h is equal to

electrostatic forces every soil particle carries an electrical charge although theoretically a soil particle can carry either a net negative or positive charge only net negative charges have been measured amongst five possible factors to the presence of a charge only isomorphous substitution crystal lattice defects or broken bonds can explain the electrostatic interactions in the air nagaraj and srinivasa 1994 according to tien tien 2013 three electrostatic forces are involved in the attachment of particles to media grains in the air and affect their detachment those are coulomb forces fec acting between a charged particle and a charged media grain these can be attractive or repulsive depending on similar opposite charge of a particle and a grain van der waals attraction force fei between a charged media grain and a particle the force is originated from an induced charge that a charged grain imparts on a particle the result of the induction is that the particle receives an imposed charge opposite in sign to that of the grain van der waals attraction force fem that a charged particle induces on a grain the electrostatic force in a dry media is the total of coulomb force

neumann 1977 joseph et al 2003 singh and joseph 2005 accounts also for the meniscus effect when a meniscus is present the buoyancy force lifts not only the immersed sphere but also the water above the water level that is attached to the particle due to the capillary effect that volume is considered negligible in the current work and is omitted from a further force balance 3 2 hydrodynamic forces

2004 reported to be equal to 89 5 rolling a particle over a surface requires an application of a dynamic moment that acts at the centre of the mass the drag and lift forces are multiplied by the fraction of water volume vw presented in eq 16 to account for the part of the particle immersed in water 3 3 torques and force balances a particle attached to a surface is mobilised when the force that detaches a particle from a surface overcomes the force that attaches a particle to the surface wang wang 1990 described three models of inceptive motion that lead to the removal of a particle from a surface lift off when the particle is lifted from the surface sliding when the particle first slides along the surface and later detaches from it rolling when the particle first rolls along the surface and after that departs from the surface the common knowledge is that rolling and sliding are the main mechanisms of particle resuspension ziskind 2006 in both air and water sliding or rolling do not necessarily lead to a resuspension only when the particle set off the surface for more than its diameter it is considered resuspended the torque balance is expressed in the following form 19 m d f d u l y f l u f b l x f c f g f e l x where ly and lx are the normal and tangential lever arms respectively expressions for the lever arms require further assumptions regarding the exact position of the particle in its interactions with the surface and its rigidity a rigid particle on the rigid surface corresponds to a point contact defined in derjaguin muller and toporov dmt model derjaguin et al 1975 here the normal lever arm ly rs and the tangential lever arm is lx 0 01 rs van oss van oss 2006 suggested the value of 0 6 nm for a lx point contact if the particle is at the distance h between a particle and the surface the ly rs h in the case of a soft particle or a soft surface the contact area is calculated based on johnson kendall and roberts jkr model johnson et al 1971 the jkr model is based on a view that the detachment occurs when the mobilisation forces overcome the extended dlvo forces expressed as the net electrostatic force fe at the secondary energy minimum the dlvo forces arise from derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory of interaction of charged colloids in a polar fluid in the absence of direct physical contact between the colloids and the surface the corresponding contact length is given as israelachvili 2011 20 l x f e r s 4 k y 1 3 here fe is the sum of electrostatic attraction repulsive forces including van der waals born and electrostatic

collectors and polystyrene particles the lx 0 125rp is often used for simplicity to avoid calculations of fe in eq 20 and to account for the influence of capillary force if the soft area is off the grain surface the lx value from eq 19 is multiplied by 0 63 bergendahl and grasso 2000 and the ly arm is calculated as bradford et al 2013 21 l y r s 2 l x 2 h in the presence of asperities the

electrostatic forces for hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles as a function of water level per definition hydrophobic particles have a θ value larger than 64 israelachvili and pashley 1984 and truly hydrophilic are the particles with a contact angle less than 15 derjaguin and churaev 1989 the dimensionless water level was calculated here as h 2rs and varied from zero to one the electrostatic force was calculated for a spherical particle of 1 μm radius immersed in 0 6 m nacl water the calculated electrostatic force was equal to 4 08 10 9 n a mostly positive capillary force means a maximal immersion in water typical for hydrophilic particles a mostly negative capillary force implies a maximal exposure to water air interface typical for hydrophobic particles the capillary force if present is the most important force for the entire water level range of all particles except for dry media with water level below 0 05 that observation is expected and consistent with previous reports dörmann and schmid 2014 de souza et al 2008 saiers and lenhart saiers and lenhart 2003 reported no transport of colloids up to 12 water saturation under most experimental conditions probably due to the presence of a condense meniscus at the wetting interface yang et al 2014 yang et al 2016 the capillary force is positive for water levels between 0 05 and 1 0 for very hydrophilic θ 10 and between 0 05 and 0 8 for somewhat hydrophilic particles θ 50 the capillary force is negative in a water level range between 0 2 and 1 0 for very hydrophobic particles θ 130 only when the media is completely dry or fully saturated i e the water level is 0 or 1 capillary force ceases to act and electrostatic attraction repulsion dlvo forces become important in the entire range of partially immersed particles the capillary force is mainly attractive for hydrophilic particles and mostly repulsive for hydrophobic particles a comparison of capillary and electrostatic forces show that capillary force is between one and two orders of magnitude larger than electrostatic force that claim is different from a general assumption that the attachment detachment of a colloid on from a media grain is governed by electrostatic attraction repulsion dlvo forces the usual approach is that summing van der waals attraction double layer electrostatic and born repulsive energies over a separation distance between a colloid and a grain in dlvo interaction energy profile accurately predicts the attachment detachment of a colloid the profiles show that this is true for a fully saturated media in unsaturated media the water level and particle hydrophilicity are the most important parameters in colloid mobilisation fig 4 compares the relative importance of drag and electrostatic forces for different velocities fig 4a and water levels fig 4b the drag force eq 17 was changed to tangential to the surface velocity u expressed in dimensionless form as reynolds number rel ul ν in a range 10 6 u 10 3 m s the velocity range is typical for aquifers and oil production here l is the characteristic contact length of water and solid phases in unit volume setting the l of 0 1 μm and ν of 1 0035 m2 sec 20 c re varies from 10 7 to 10 4 inside a laminar flow regime the electrostatic forces were altered by ionic strengths is between 0 6 and 0 001 m encompassing the entire range from brine to low saline almost distilled water the calculations were performed for rp 35 μm rs 1 μm θ 90 and γgl 0 0729 n m a water ionic strength is is the key factor in electrostatic repulsion of colloidal particles in extremely low saline water with is 0 001 m a particle is electrostatically repulsed from the grain surface and can be dragged away fig 4b any increase in is values increases the value of electrostatic force and the attraction of a particle to the grain typical drag forces are not strong enough to drag away a particle held by electrostatic forces near the grain surface except for a salinity is 0 001 m and water level below 0 4 for a higher salinity the drag force is not strong enough to detach particles from the surface for the typical velocity range in porous media the relative importance of drag forces decreases as the water level increases in absolute terms lift and drag forces are significantly smaller than the capillary force that act on a particle in our calculations the ratio of lift to electrostatic forces is within 10 10 range for the entire water level scale the ratio of drag to electrostatic force is within 10 5 range the detachment of a particle is less affected by lift and drag and it is more a subject of the electrostatic and capillary forces acting on a particle without an internal release of the particle from a surface the mobilisation forces will hardly remove a particle that is under the influence of capillary force fig 5 draws domains of particle mobilisation mechanisms as a function of the level of brine 0 6 m is water all other data is similar to fig 4 lifting is the main detachment mechanism sliding and rolling are not important for a u value of 10 5 m s fig 5a the areas for sliding and rolling coincide with straight line h 2rs 1 cos π θ 2 the probability of lifting increases with an increase in particle hydrophilicity hydrophilic particles with θ 60 cosθ 0 5 are lifted when the water level is above 0 8 hydrophobic particles are lifted at even smaller level small particles are mobilised first as their water coverage is constantly higher than that of large particles a higher degree of retention of large particles in unsaturated porous media was reported by mitropoulou et al mitropoulou et al 2013 a particle with a contact angle of 90 can be lifted when the capillary force turns repulsive i e water level becomes higher than 0 5 fig 5b it is a two stage mechanism when the particle is first released from a surface by capillary force and only after that lifted at low reynolds numbers and low water level the attractive capillary force is strong and holds the particle near the surface the mobilisation of particles by lifting requires re numbers higher than 10 i e the tangential velocities higher than 2 m s the mobilisation by rolling starts from re of 0 1 i e velocities of 0 02 m s at re of 1 and higher almost all particles are mobilised by rolling the sliding roughly starts from re of 1 i e from a velocity of 0 2 m s it is easier to mobilise a particle by rolling than by sliding extreme efforts are needed to mobilise a particle by lifting for water levels lower than 0 5 the release of truly hydrophilic particles requires saturated media and extremely hydrophobic particles can be mobilised at 0 01 water level fig 5c presents the sensitivity of the phase diagram to the hydrophilicity of a particle a truly hydrophilic particle with θ 30 will remain attached for almost the entire range of re numbers until the water level will exceed 0 95 i e the entire particle will be almost immersed in water for a water level lower than 0 95 it will be easier to mobilise a particle by rolling and sliding than by lifting a hydrophobic particle with θ 110 will be retained until the water level will exceed 0 35 fig 6 sets the boundaries of particle mobilisation as a function of tangential velocity expressed by re vs particle radii in saturated fig 6a and unsaturated fig 6b media all data is similar to fig 4 fig 6b was calculated for the water level of 0 3 and an attractive capillary force the boundaries were calculated using eqs 25 27 all particles can be mobilised if their radii are higher than the critical rscr the mobilisation by rolling requires lower values of u than a mobilisation by sliding higher velocities are needed to mobilise a particle by lifting it is easier to mobilise a particle of the same radius in saturated than in unsaturated media the difference in re and hence in tangential velocity can be up to two orders of magnitude for example the rolling in saturated media starts from re of 10 3 in saturated media and re of 10 1 in unsaturated media required average velocities for mobilisation of 1 μm particle range between 10 m s in unsaturated and 10 4 m s in saturated media boundaries between attachment rolling sliding and lifting domains decline monotonically with an increase in re under the same flow conditions large particles are mobilised first higher velocities are needed to mobilise small particles a detachment of larger particles is due to larger drag and lift forces and drag lever arm as a result of higher velocity acting at the centre of mass large particles experience stronger detaching forces even though all particles are subject to the same flow conditions fig 7 compares the theoretical predictions based on the data set detailed in fig 4 with results of 46 laboratory tests performed in unsaturated media wan and tokunaga j wan and tokunaga 1997 knappenberger et al knappenberger et al 2014 and keller and sirivithayapakorn keller and sirivithayapakorn 2004 published the results of mobilisation of polystyrene particles from a column of clean dry sand grains the results are marked as 1 2 and 4 respectively results of silica particle mobilisation from quartz sand grains were reported by lenhart and saiers lenhart and saiers 2002 and are marked as 3 the experimental procedure included stages of an injection of a suspension with a constant concentration of colloids followed by an injection of a colloid free solution the water level was established before the experiment the number of mobilised colloids was detected at the exit from the column as a function of water level the experiments encompass a velocity range between 10 8 to 10 3 m s the is between 0 1 to 1 mm the ph from 5 5 to 10 and particle sizes between 14 nm to 3 μm all the experimental points placed in the lifting domain correspond to the majority of the particles being mobilised during the injection for all points placed in the attachment domain the majority of the particles remained attached during the injections the experimental detachment data closely match the mechanical equilibrium criteria presented in eqs 25 27 hence the experimental results can be predicted by the theoretical approximation detailed above 5 particle mobilisation by imbibition in a single pore the section presents a way to correlate between the maximum concentration of attached particles and the water saturation level imbibition is the displacement of one fluid by another immiscible fluid in a porous matrix during the imbibition a liquid gas interface advances and broadens often complex topologies of the porous matrix induce local fluctuations in capillary pressures and hydraulic permeabilities in the bulk here we apply the above derived criteria of mechanical equilibrium eqs 25 27 to triangle pores and derive the formulae for a maximum attached concentration the pores are in triangular shapes but their size is described by a radius of a circle inscribed inside the triangle fig 8 the water level is defined as the ratio of the area covered by water to the total area of the triangles the critical pore size corresponds to a water level that fills all corners with water and leaves the inscribed circle with air fig 8b smaller pores are completely filled with water fig 8a and bigger pores have an imbibition meniscus fig 8c on the pore scale phase pressures are constant and equal in all pores so the capillary pressure and menisci radii are also uniform in all pores thus the meniscus radius r and the water level in the pores pictured in figs 8b and 8c are the same an increase in water level increases the critical pore size and the number of pores completely filled with water in an unsaturated porous media the particles are initially attached to grains an increase in water level results in a gradual mobilisation of particles when the conditions described in eqs 25 27 are fulfilled particles embedded in water are detached and particles in the dry area of the pores bigger than the critical pore size are still attached to the solid surface fig 8c the concentration of mobilised particles is a function of the area swept by the meniscus the volumetric content of clay per unit of the rock volume is cc the concentration of movable particles on the rock surface is αcc where α 0 005 0 02 for kaolinite clays in sandstones russell et al 2017 then the concentration of attached movable particles per unit length of the pore cross section boundary is you et al 2016 bedrikovetsky et al 2011 28 σ a l n 6 3 0 r p f

correlation between a water level and the concentration of attached particles the concentration of attached and or detached particles can be calculated as a function of changes in the water level detached particles moving through a porous media with distributed pore sizes can get strained in pores smaller than their sizes resulting in blockage and consequent permeability decline taylor s series expansion can be used to express a rock permeability decline as a function of the particle concentration pang and sharma 1997 31 k 0 k σ 1 β σ s 0 σ 2 where a small magnitude in concentration of strained particles justifies a further neglection of all terms of order σ2 and above here β is the formation damage coefficient and k is the rock permeability a core length is typically much longer than a particle capture free run so the mobilised particles are strained by the rock resulting in permeability decline this allows calculating the so called impedance chequer et al 2018 sharma and

normalised pressure drop the impedance is equal to 1 at the beginning when no particles have been captured in pore throats and permeability is equal to a particle free media and increases as particles are captured in the porous media reducing the rock permeability fig 9 presents the calculations of a concentration of attached particles σcr as a function of pore fraction filled with water sw for different particle loads n and pore size variations cv the σcr changes from its maximum at sw 0 in dry porous media to 0 when the imbibition meniscus detaches particles and sw 1 at low saturation the pore size distribution cv almost does not affect the maximum retained concentration σcr curves of n cv n 2cv and n 0 5cv are identical for sw 0 2 for sw values higher than 0 2 more particles are retained at n 2cv than at n cv and n 0 5cv a higher variation in pore sizes can incorporate more particles when small pores are filled first there is less detachment of particles from large pores the particle detachment is gradual small pores are filled uniformly and the release of particles from pores partially filled with water is simultaneous a higher initial concentration of attached particles implies the higher rate of their mobilisation a slope of 2n cv curve is higher than a slope of n cv curve both slopes are steeper than a slope of a 0 5n cv curve fig 10 compares the theoretical predictions of concentration of attached particles σcr with the results of laboratory tests performed in unsaturated media the theoretical predictions for σcr were based on eq 30 and tuned by the concentration of attached particles per unit length n and by pore size distribution cv the results of saiers and lenhart saiers and lenhart 2003 with γgl 0 0729 n m is 1 mm 1 6 10 6 u 8 3 10 5 m s and θ 90 are marked as 1 and 2 in the tests a quartz sand column was wet packed with silica colloids the results of gao et al gao et al 2004 with γgl 0 0729 n m is 1 mm 1 1 10 4 u 4 4 10 4 m s and θ 46 are marked as 3 in the tests a sand column was wet packed with clay colloids both papers explicitly reported σcr values found through mass balance another test of saiers and lenhart saiers and lenhart 2003 and gao et al gao et al 2004 are marked 4 and 5 and are presented in fig 10b along with the theoretical predictions the figure shows a permeability decrease due to fines release and pore throat blocking with water saturation increase the theoretical predictions for impedance were based on eq 32 assuming β 2000 table 1 displays the coefficient of determination r2 used to evaluate the quality of the fit of theoretical predictions of σcr to data sets 1 5 displayed on fig 10 the prediction curves σcr sw have two degrees of freedom so high tuning by two model parameter validates the model 30 for detachment of fines in porous media the r2 values between 0 97 and 0 99 show a high agreement between the laboratory and modelling data both tunning parameters have values in the same order for a variety of tests a constant velocity inside the porous media was assumed a more realistic approach should incorporate the fact that the velocity in a saturated porous media varies with pore size and not all particles are subject to the same velocity this is especially important when the electrostatic force is comparable with the drag force e g water salinity is low is 0 001 m in unsaturated porous media the detachment is controlled by the capillary force and an incorporation of a velocity gradient becomes less relevant chemical heterogeneity and surface roughness are interesting future research topics they can be addressed through a force and a moment balance on attachment and detachment of a particle 6 conclusions the detachment of colloidal particles from media grains is a complex phenomenon not all of the conditions can be described by the same set of equations the analyses provided in this study described four different case scenarios for particles attachment rolling sliding and lifting in an unsaturated media all the scenarios depend on a single variable the water level following theoretical considerations and analytical derivations backed up by experimental data we found that a gradual increase of the water level mobilises attached colloids from the solid surface particles with a radius of 1 μm firmly attached to a dry porous media cannot be effectively detached under the studied conditions and require flooding of the media the higher the water level around the particle the easier the release hydrodynamic shear forces alone at typical groundwater conditions are not effective to release attached particles under high electrostatic attraction i e in the presence of high salinity water the drag force is important only for low saline water is 0 001 m and can be disregarded in water with higher salinity the release is a two stage process that requires an internal release of a particle from the surface followed by its removal by the flow the release is due to an expansion of the electric double layer in low salinity water the expansion weakens the adhesion of particles to the surface as a pre request before the detachment the mobilisation of particles in saturated media differs from the mobilisation in unsaturated media in saturated media for a positive normal force the lifting case the mobilised particles leave the grain surface and move along with carrier water velocity in an unsaturated porous media the water level and particle hydrophilicity are the most important parameters in colloid mobilisation the mobilised particles leave the media surface and remain on the interface at the height where capillary force ceases to exist the above principles were confirmed in experiments with data gathered from previous publications the mobilisation by rolling requires lower values of velocity than the mobilisation by sliding or lifting it is easier to mobilise a particle of the same radius in saturated than in unsaturated media if the capillary force attaches the particle to the surface the boundaries between attachment rolling sliding and lifting domains decrease monotonically with re which means that for the same flow conditions large particles are mobilised first a close match between the experimental results on particle detachment and the theoretical predictions based on mechanical equilibrium has been observed it suggests that the concentration of attached and released particles can be predicted based on particle size hydrophilicity water level and ionic strength the mechanical equilibrium conditions for the particle attached to a substrate determine the maximum retention concentration of the attached particles as a function of water saturation in a model porous media the maximum retention function predicts fines mobilisation during the changes in water level the derived maximum retention function is in a high agreement with the experimental data declaration of competing interest none 
432,unforeseen clogging and low well productivity during exploitation of oil and gas reservoirs result from a mobilisation of densely deposited particles the proposed model predicts the mobilisation in unsaturated porous media based on the changes in water level and hydrophilicity and size of mobilisable particles domains of particle attachment sliding rolling and lifting were found from a phase diagram based on a mechanical equilibrium the degree of mobilisation was correlated with experimental data through a maximum retention function the validity of the proposed model was confirmed by a close match of theoretical predictions with results of 46 laboratory tests on particle detachment our analysis shows that it is practically impossible to remove 2 μm charged colloids from a dry porous media nearly desalinated water with ionic strength of 0 001 m or less are needed to mobilise particles in saturated media at typical groundwater conditions a gradual increase in water level is key for

respiratory ways hinds 2012 recent studies show that clogging of pores in porous media and low well productivity and injectivity during exploitation of oil and gas reservoirs are due to particle detachment chequer et al 2018 russell et al 2017 yang and bedrikovetsky 2017 a resuspension of densely deposited particles in porous media stays outside of previously studied phenomenon a classic model starts from a media bare of deposit gitis et al 2010 ziskind et al 2011 and ends when a number of deposited particles becomes significant in the case of granular media filtration the filter is simply backwashed and a new cycle starts once again from a presumable clean filter in subsoils the presence of accumulated particles especially in large numbers results in either increased attachment or in clogging of pores and decline of the effective permeability russell and bedrikovetsky 2018 separate models for former saturated and latter unsaturated media are formulated and solved using an assumption of a constant degree of saturation lenhart and saiers 2002 frequent changes in water level due to imbibition or drainage are disregarded in practice groundwater level changes spatially and temporally previous models are unable to link the resuspension of deposited particles to dynamic changes in water level another shortcoming of previous models is their pre occupation with particle accumulation the mobilisation is usually discussed in view of dynamic equilibrium between accumulation and mobilisation stages but not as a separate phenomenon a theoretical base for the study of particle mobilisation includes a physically sound force balance on a single attached particle solved analytically or numerically and verified by experiments fig 1 is a sketch of forces acting on a particle attached to a solid surface in a completely dry or fully saturated media the forces exerted on a fully immersed particle are related to the particle itself the porous media and the external forces and torques originated from a surrounding fluid the attachment forces include gravity and van der waals forces the detachment forces are buoyancy electrostatic repulsion and born occasional detachment forces are lift and drag that may cause particle lifting rolling or sliding kalantariasl et al 2015 kalantariasl et al 2014 bradford et al 2013 alshakhs and kovscek 2016 takahashi and kovscek 2010 summing acting forces tangential or normal to the surface or summing torques generated by each acting force indicates if a particle remains attached or will be mobilised bradford et al 2013 muecke 1979 sarkar and sharma 1990 a particle will be lifted off a surface if a vertical projection of detachment forces is higher than a projection of attachment forces a particle will slide along the grain surface if a horizontal projection of detachment forces will be higher than a projection of attachment forces a particle will roll over a grain surface if the torque balance of detachment momentum will be positive the difference between a fully and partially immersed particle is in the presence of an additional capillary force the force is at least an order of magnitude higher than other forces including electrostatic and hydrodynamic sarkar and sharma 1990 and can hold a particle near a grain surface shang et al 2008 sharma et al 2008 or empower its mobilisation lazouskaya et al 2013 huang et al 2018 aramrak et al 2011 the force becomes critical at imbibition or drainage implying a presence of moving front lazouskaya et al 2013 or inclined grain surface veerapaneni et al 2000 j wan and tokunaga 1997 thus the force does not act along the x y axis and is decomposed into normal and tangential to the air water interface components a tangential projection of a capillary force affects the sliding of colloids over the media surface a normal projection is a detrimental addition to attractive or repulsive forces veerapaneni et al 2000 j wan and tokunaga 1997 fig 2 exemplifies how the presence of capillary force changes the probability of particle mobilisation in completely dry fig 2a slightly wet fig 2b partially saturated fig 2c and completely saturated fig 2d porous media although the entire analysis describes all four cases we found the case of a partially immersed particle depicted in fig 2c especially interesting it is where the capillary force turns repulsive and helps to mobilise the particle three additional factors to enhance the detachment are low water salinity high ph and high velocity oliveira et al 2014 you et al 2016 bradford et al 2011 the fraction of the remaining particles during the detachment at given flow conditions is determined by the maximum retention function bedrikovetsky et al 2011 this function is a mathematical model for fines detachment and provides a convenient way to compare the theoretical predictions with laboratory data produced by observations of the mobilised particle concentration with the induced permeability decline chequer et al 2018 chequer and bedrikovetsky 2019 zeinijahromi et al 2012 the central assumption of the comparison is that mobilised colloids travel along a porous media until eventually get captured between two firmly attached grains a gradual development of a neck or a pocket reduces the permeability and that macroscopic change can be easily measured the method to calculate maximum retention function and consequent permeability decline with particle straining has been developed for single phase flows you et al 2016 bedrikovetsky et al 2011 and form a basics for governing equations of suspension colloidal transport in porous media chequer et al 2018 yang and bedrikovetsky 2017 russell and bedrikovetsky 2018 maximum retention function for particles in two phase flow under the action of capillary force was not developed yet our study offers a convenient way to correlate between a microscopic theoretical examination of particle mobilisation potential and macroscopic variations of retained concentrations and permeability for two phase transport with the consequent change in well productivity in subterranean reservoirs the examination is based on the changing position of the water level and considers the lifting rolling and sliding as potential particle mobilisation mechanisms the current work was motivated by the complexity of possible detachment scenarios at some point despite many interesting works in the field bradford et al 2013 lazouskaya et al 2013 chatterjee et al 2012 lazouskaya et al 2011 we felt that a proper comprehensive description of the possible scenario is still needed a method of mathematical modelling of fines detachment and migration on the core and reservoir scales based on micro scale mechanical equilibrium is not available additional motivation came from the observation that the majority of the literature describes the cases of drainage but not the imbibition russell et al 2017 khilar and fogler 1998 sharma and yortsos 1986 the history of interactions between a grain and a particle is important as under similar conditions a different degree of resuspension after the drainage and the imbibition is expected beliaev and hassanizadeh 2001 the investigation of this hysteresis is not available in the current work we theoretically investigated the colloid release in dry confined unsaturated and saturated media and tested our findings by comparison with available experimental data based on the mechanical equilibrium of a particle attached to the substrate under the presence of water air meniscus we propose a phase diagram that marks the areas of attachment rolling lifting and sliding an unbiased knowledge of media conditions can now serve to predict the most probable particle behaviour the mobilisation predictions based on the phase diagrams were confirmed by experimental data of 46 laboratory tests and can be used to forecast potential well clogging the mechanical equilibrium conditions of the particle attached to a substrate for different water levels allowed calculation of the maximum retention concentration versus water saturation in a model porous medium the calculations exhibit a close match with the laboratory data which validates the maximum retention function as a mathematical model for fines detachment under water saturation variations in porous media at the core and reservoir scales the structure of the text is as follows section 2 gives details about the forces acting on a particle attached to a solid surface and discusses rolling sliding and lifting as the potential mechanisms of particle mobilisation section 3 provides the analysis of forces and theoretical calculations for different detachment scenarios section 4 presents the maximum concentration of attached particles as a function of water saturation section 5 concludes the study 2 forces balances and torques mobilisation of a colloidal particle attached to a plane solid surface is a function of forces acting on it their balance and torques a particle on a solid surface is always influenced by particle level and contact level forces the particle level forces are universal and always exist gravity and buoyancy are examples of these forces contact level forces are plausible yet require reasonable assumptions such as charge or water level the presence of a charge implies the presence of electrostatic repulsion and attraction if the particle and the media are surrounded by a gas phase the attraction forces are coulomb force and van der waals attraction the latter can be due to an induced charge that a grain imparts on the particle and a particle imparts on the grain if the particle and the media are submerged in a polar liquid such as water the significant attraction forces are only those that a grain imparts on a particle particle particle interactions become significant in the absence of media grains the electrostatic repulsion in the aqueous phase includes born repulsion the presence of water introduces capillary and buoyancy forces fig 2a delineates forces that act between a single particle and a media grain interacting through the air coulomb van der waals and gravity are the involved forces coulomb force on the figure is repulsive under an assumption that both the particle and the grain are negatively charged in fig 2b the interactions between the particle and the surface are through a thin electrolyte layer and therefore van der waals attraction and electrostatic repulsions replace the coulomb forces in an updated force balance different from the previous case the particle is now under the influence of capillary force fig 2c considers the presence of a hydraulic shell around the media grain the capillary force governs attachment or mobilisation of a particle to from a grain at a low water level the capillary force is mainly attractive and particles will be held on the surface repulsive capillary force at increased water level will release a particle from the surface finally fig 2d shows a fully saturated media in which a particle is first released from the grain by changes in the surrounding environment flury and aramrak 2017 and only after that swiped by the flow in absence of the effect of drag or lift forces the entire force balance accounts only for particle and contact forces without any external intervention all four scenarios are interrelated through changes in the degree of saturation defined as a ratio of pore volume filled with water to the total pore volume our analyses are based on a number of assumptions that can be briefly described as 1 single spherical particles no clusters 2 one layered adsorption and deposition 3 the incoming fluid is free of particles so resuspended particles do not interact with particles in the bulk 4 no external force mechanical brushing hydraulic waves except blowing with a constant velocity in laminar flow regime no flow fluctuations vortices turbulence 5 a media grain is much larger than the particle and presents a perfectly smooth horizontal surface 6 particle is a perfect sphere and its adhesion to the grain surface is elastic 7 a single interaction between a particle and a flat surface 8 the diffusion is negligible 9 the water level on top of the grain is horizontal i e the capillaries are filled from the media grain surface and not from the meniscus across the capillary 10 laminar flow regime and constant flow velocity 11 negligible charge heterogeneity and surface roughness 12 fully water wet substrate 2 1 capillary force the capillary force consists of two components laplace pressure force and the surface tension force a dominating component changes as a function of water level laplace pressure force is important in a low saturation pendular regime when the degree of saturation is below 0 07 denoth 1999 here a water phase is isolated and the air phase is continuous throughout the media water is arranged in an isolated meniscus in a contact region between a particle and a grain fig 2b the capillary force is given by the expression scheludko and nikolov 1975

and the media grain are made of the same material and their contact angles with a fluid are similar thus the contact angle θ is the parameter that determines the position of a particle at the interface i e its immersed fraction the depth of immersion l under equilibrium conditions can be derived directly from the contact angle hórvölgyi et al 1993 aveyard et al 2000 paunov 2003 2 l r s 1 c o s θ the funicular regime covers a higher saturation regime with a water level between 0 07 and 0 4 the air water pattern changes from annular to churn to slug to bubble in the annular pattern a constant liquid film at the grain surface coexists with a continuous gas phase yarin et al 2008 a churn pattern is extremely chaotic and the air water interface is irregular air and water phases have no distinct shapes in a slug pattern air slugs exist in a continuous aqueous phase spanned through most of the porous media and are separated by water plugs in the axial direction the bubble pattern has a continuous water phase and isolated gas bubbles trapped in the water the expression for capillary force in the funicular regime is shang et al 2008 lazouskaya et al 2013 3 f c 2 π r s γ g l s i

water level lazouskaya et al 2013 chatterjee et al 2012 eq 3 suggests that the capillary force has a sinusoidal form it can be attractive if φ θ and repulsive if φ θ and has two maximum values at φ π θ 2 and φ π θ 2 when a free water surface forms on top of a particle the capillary force ceases to exist morrow 1970 eq 3 can be re written assuming the water level around the particle h is equal to

electrostatic forces every soil particle carries an electrical charge although theoretically a soil particle can carry either a net negative or positive charge only net negative charges have been measured amongst five possible factors to the presence of a charge only isomorphous substitution crystal lattice defects or broken bonds can explain the electrostatic interactions in the air nagaraj and srinivasa 1994 according to tien tien 2013 three electrostatic forces are involved in the attachment of particles to media grains in the air and affect their detachment those are coulomb forces

neumann 1977 joseph et al 2003 singh and joseph 2005 accounts also for the meniscus effect when a meniscus is present the buoyancy force lifts not only the immersed sphere but also the water above the water level that is attached to the particle due to the capillary effect that volume is considered negligible in the current work and is omitted from a further force balance 3 2 hydrodynamic forces

2004 reported to be equal to 89 5 rolling a particle over a surface requires an application of a dynamic moment that acts at the centre of the mass the drag and lift forces are multiplied by the fraction of water volume vw presented in eq 16 to account for the part of the particle immersed in water 3 3 torques and force balances a particle attached to a surface is mobilised when the force that detaches a particle from a surface overcomes the force that attaches a particle to the surface wang wang 1990 described three models of inceptive motion that lead to the removal of a particle from a surface lift off when the particle is lifted from the surface sliding when the particle first slides along the surface and later detaches from it rolling when the particle first rolls along the surface and after that departs from the surface the common knowledge is that rolling and sliding are the main mechanisms of particle resuspension ziskind 2006 in both air and water sliding or rolling do not necessarily lead to a resuspension only when the particle set off the surface for more than its diameter it is considered resuspended the torque balance is expressed in the following form 19 m d f d u l y f l u f b l x f c f g f e l x where ly and lx are the normal and tangential lever arms respectively expressions for the lever arms require further assumptions regarding the exact position of the particle in its interactions with the surface and its rigidity a rigid particle on the rigid surface corresponds to a point contact defined in derjaguin muller and toporov dmt model derjaguin et al 1975 here the normal lever arm ly rs and the tangential lever arm is lx 0 01 rs van oss van oss 2006 suggested the value of 0 6 nm for a lx point contact if the particle is at the distance h between a particle and the surface the ly rs h in the case of a soft particle or a soft surface the contact area is calculated based on johnson kendall and roberts jkr model johnson et al 1971 the jkr model is based on a view that the detachment occurs when the mobilisation forces overcome the extended dlvo forces expressed as the net electrostatic force fe at the secondary energy minimum the dlvo forces arise from derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory of interaction of charged colloids in a polar fluid in the absence of direct physical contact between the colloids and the surface the corresponding contact length is given as israelachvili 2011 20 l x f e r s 4 k y 1 3 here fe is the sum of electrostatic attraction repulsive forces including van der waals born and electrostatic repulsion at the secondary energy minimum and ky is the composite young modulus johnson et al 1971 bergendahl and grasso bergendahl and grasso 2000 used a value of 4 014 109 n m2 for glass bead collectors and polystyrene particles the lx 0 125rp is often used for simplicity to avoid calculations of fe in eq 20 and to account for the influence of capillary force if the soft area is off the grain surface the lx value from eq 19 is multiplied by 0 63 bergendahl and grasso 2000 and the ly arm is calculated as bradford et al 2013 21 l y r s 2 l x 2 h in the presence of asperities the expressions for lever arms are 22 l y r s δ l y 23 l x r s 2 l y 2 2 δ l y r s δ l y 2 where δly is the height of the asperity relative to a particle radius the dynamic moment md is calculated as momonoi et al 2004 24 m d 1 2 ρ u 2 c m v here v is the particle volume and c m 0 94339 24 r e zoeteweij et al 2009 the factor 0 94399 corrects for the presence of a surface goldman et al 1967 burdick et al 2005 a proper torque balance distinguishes between lift off sliding and rolling a particle will be elevated from the surface when the lift force acting along with electrostatic repulsion born

number water salinity and particle contact angle a basic set used in our calculations includes pore size rp of 35 μm particle size rs of 1 μm particle contact angle θ of 90 interfacial tension γgl of 0 0729 n m water salinity γ of 0 6 m nacl and flow velocity u of 10 5 m s the results of the calculations are compared with experimental data fig 3 details a relative importance of capillary and electrostatic forces for hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles as a function of water level per definition hydrophobic particles have a θ value larger than 64 israelachvili and pashley 1984 and truly hydrophilic are the particles with a contact angle less than 15 derjaguin and churaev 1989 the dimensionless water level was calculated here as h 2rs and varied from zero to one the electrostatic force was calculated for a spherical particle of 1 μm radius immersed in 0 6 m nacl water the calculated electrostatic force was equal to 4 08 10 9 n a mostly positive capillary force means a maximal immersion in water typical for hydrophilic particles a mostly negative capillary force implies a maximal exposure to water air interface typical for hydrophobic particles the capillary force if present is the most important force for the entire water level range of all particles except for dry media with water level below 0 05 that observation is expected and consistent with previous reports dörmann and schmid 2014 de souza et al 2008 saiers and lenhart saiers and lenhart 2003 reported no transport of colloids up to 12 water saturation under most experimental conditions probably due to the presence of a condense meniscus at the wetting interface yang et al 2014 yang et al 2016 the capillary force is positive for water levels between 0 05 and 1 0 for very hydrophilic θ 10 and between 0 05 and 0 8 for somewhat hydrophilic particles θ 50 the capillary force is negative in a water level range between 0 2 and 1 0 for very hydrophobic particles θ 130 only when the media is completely dry or fully saturated i e the water level is 0 or 1 capillary force ceases to act and electrostatic attraction repulsion dlvo forces become important in the entire range of partially immersed particles the capillary force is mainly attractive for hydrophilic particles and mostly repulsive for hydrophobic particles a comparison of capillary and electrostatic forces show that capillary force is between one and two orders of magnitude larger than electrostatic force that claim is different from a general assumption that the attachment detachment of a colloid on from a media grain is governed by electrostatic attraction repulsion dlvo forces the usual approach is that summing van der waals attraction double layer electrostatic and born repulsive energies over a separation distance between a colloid and a grain in dlvo interaction energy profile accurately predicts the attachment detachment of a colloid the profiles show that this is true for a fully saturated media in unsaturated media the water level and particle hydrophilicity are the most important parameters in colloid mobilisation fig 4 compares the relative importance of drag and electrostatic forces for different velocities fig 4a and water levels fig 4b the drag force eq 17 was changed to tangential to the surface velocity u expressed in dimensionless form as reynolds number rel ul ν in a range 10 6 u 10 3 m s the velocity range is typical for aquifers and oil production here l is the characteristic contact length of water and solid phases in unit volume setting the l of 0 1 μm and ν of 1 0035 m2 sec 20 c re varies from 10 7 to 10 4 inside a laminar flow regime the electrostatic forces were altered by ionic strengths is between 0 6 and 0 001 m encompassing the entire range from brine to low saline almost distilled water the calculations were performed for rp 35 μm rs 1 μm θ 90 and γgl 0 0729 n m a water ionic strength is is the key factor in electrostatic repulsion of colloidal particles in extremely low saline water with is 0 001 m a particle is electrostatically repulsed from the grain surface and can be dragged away fig 4b any increase in is values increases the value of electrostatic force and the attraction of a particle to the grain typical drag forces are not strong enough to drag away a particle held by electrostatic forces near the grain surface except for a salinity is 0 001 m and water level below 0 4 for a higher salinity the drag force is not strong enough to detach particles from the surface for the typical velocity range in porous media the relative importance of drag forces decreases as the water level increases in absolute terms lift and drag forces are significantly smaller than the capillary force that act on a particle in our calculations the ratio of lift to electrostatic forces is within 10 10 range for the entire water level scale the ratio of drag to electrostatic force is within 10 5 range the detachment of a particle is less affected by lift and drag and it is more a subject of the electrostatic and capillary forces acting on a particle without an internal release of the particle from a surface the mobilisation forces will hardly remove a particle that is under the influence of capillary force fig 5 draws domains of particle mobilisation mechanisms as a function of the level of brine 0 6 m is water all other data is similar to fig 4 lifting is the main detachment mechanism sliding and rolling are not important for a u value of 10 5 m s fig 5a the areas for sliding and rolling coincide with straight line h 2rs 1 cos π θ 2 the probability of lifting increases with an increase in particle hydrophilicity hydrophilic particles with θ 60 cosθ 0 5 are lifted when the water level is above 0 8 hydrophobic particles are lifted at even smaller level small particles are mobilised first as their water coverage is constantly higher than that of large particles a higher degree of retention of large particles in unsaturated porous media was reported by mitropoulou et al mitropoulou et al 2013 a particle with a contact angle of 90 can be lifted when the capillary force turns repulsive i e water level becomes higher than 0 5 fig 5b it is a two stage mechanism when the particle is first released from a surface by capillary force and only after that lifted at low reynolds numbers and low water level the attractive capillary force is strong and holds the particle near the surface the mobilisation of particles by lifting requires re numbers higher than 10 i e the tangential velocities higher than 2 m s the mobilisation by rolling starts from re of 0 1 i e velocities of 0 02 m s at re of 1 and higher almost all particles are mobilised by rolling the sliding roughly starts from re of 1 i e from a velocity of 0 2 m s it is easier to mobilise a particle by rolling than by sliding extreme efforts are needed to mobilise a particle by lifting for water levels lower than 0 5 the release of truly hydrophilic particles requires saturated media and extremely hydrophobic particles can be mobilised at 0 01 water level fig 5c presents the sensitivity of the phase diagram to the hydrophilicity of a particle a truly hydrophilic particle with θ 30 will remain attached for almost the entire range of re numbers until the water level will exceed 0 95 i e the entire particle will be almost immersed in water for a water level lower than 0 95 it will be easier to mobilise a particle by rolling and sliding than by lifting a hydrophobic particle with θ 110 will be retained until the water level will exceed 0 35 fig 6 sets the boundaries of particle mobilisation as a function of tangential velocity expressed by re vs particle radii in saturated fig 6a and unsaturated fig 6b media all data is similar to fig 4 fig 6b was calculated for the water level of 0 3 and an attractive capillary force the boundaries were calculated using eqs 25 27 all particles can be mobilised if their radii are higher than the critical rscr the mobilisation by rolling requires lower values of u than a mobilisation by sliding higher velocities are needed to mobilise a particle by lifting it is easier to mobilise a particle of the same radius in saturated than in unsaturated media the difference in re and hence in tangential velocity can be up to two orders of magnitude for example the rolling in saturated media starts from re of 10 3 in saturated media and re of 10 1 in unsaturated media required average velocities for mobilisation of 1 μm particle range between 10 m s in unsaturated and 10 4 m s in saturated media boundaries between attachment rolling sliding and lifting domains decline monotonically with an increase in re under the same flow conditions large particles are mobilised first higher velocities are needed to mobilise small particles a detachment of larger particles is due to larger drag and lift forces and drag lever arm as a result of higher velocity acting at the centre of mass large particles experience stronger detaching forces even though all particles are subject to the same flow conditions fig 7 compares the theoretical predictions based on the data set detailed in fig 4 with results of 46 laboratory tests performed in unsaturated media wan and tokunaga j wan and tokunaga 1997 knappenberger et al knappenberger et al 2014 and keller and sirivithayapakorn keller and sirivithayapakorn 2004 published the results of mobilisation of polystyrene particles from a column of clean dry sand grains the results are marked as 1 2 and 4 respectively results of silica particle mobilisation from quartz sand grains were reported by lenhart and saiers lenhart and saiers 2002 and are marked as 3 the experimental procedure included stages of an injection of a suspension with a constant concentration of colloids followed by an injection of a colloid free solution the water level was established before the experiment the number of mobilised colloids was detected at the exit from the column as a function of water level the experiments encompass a velocity range between 10 8 to 10 3 m s the is between 0 1 to 1 mm the ph from 5 5 to 10 and particle sizes between 14 nm to 3 μm all the experimental points placed in the lifting domain correspond to the majority of the particles being mobilised during the injection for all points placed in the attachment domain the majority of the particles remained attached during the injections the experimental detachment data closely match the mechanical equilibrium criteria presented in eqs 25 27 hence the experimental results can be predicted by the theoretical approximation detailed above 5 particle mobilisation by imbibition in a single pore the section presents a way to correlate between the maximum concentration of attached particles and the water saturation level imbibition is the displacement of one fluid by another immiscible fluid in a porous matrix during the imbibition a liquid gas interface advances and broadens often complex topologies of the porous matrix induce local fluctuations in capillary pressures and hydraulic permeabilities in the bulk here we apply the above derived criteria of mechanical equilibrium eqs 25 27 to triangle pores and derive the formulae for a maximum attached concentration the pores are in triangular shapes but their size is described by a radius of a circle inscribed inside the triangle fig 8 the water level is defined as the ratio of the area covered by water to the total area of the triangles the critical pore size corresponds to a water level that fills all corners with water and leaves the inscribed circle with air fig 8b smaller pores are completely filled with water fig 8a and bigger pores have an imbibition meniscus fig 8c on the pore scale phase pressures are constant and equal in all pores so the capillary pressure and menisci radii are also uniform in all pores thus the meniscus radius r and the water level in the pores pictured in figs 8b and 8c are the same an increase in water level increases the critical pore size and the number of pores completely filled with water in an unsaturated porous media the particles are initially attached to grains an increase in water level results in a gradual mobilisation of particles when the conditions described in eqs 25 27 are fulfilled particles embedded in water are detached and particles in the dry area of the pores bigger than the critical pore size are still attached to the solid surface fig 8c the concentration of mobilised particles is a function of the area swept by the meniscus the volumetric content of clay per unit of the rock volume is cc the concentration of movable particles on the rock surface is αcc where α 0 005 0 02 for kaolinite clays in

correlation between a water level and the concentration of attached particles the concentration of attached and or detached particles can be calculated as a function of changes in the water level detached particles moving through a porous media with distributed pore sizes can get strained in pores smaller than their sizes resulting in blockage and consequent permeability decline taylor s series expansion can be used to express a rock permeability decline as a function of the particle concentration pang and sharma 1997 31 k 0 k σ 1 β σ s 0 σ 2 where a small magnitude in concentration of strained particles justifies a further neglection of all terms of order σ2 and above here β is the formation damage coefficient and k is the rock permeability a core length is typically much longer than a particle capture free run so the mobilised particles are strained by the rock resulting in permeability decline this allows calculating the so called impedance chequer et al 2018 sharma and

normalised pressure drop the impedance is equal to 1 at the beginning when no particles have been captured in pore throats and permeability is equal to a particle free media and increases as particles are captured in the porous media reducing the rock permeability fig 9 presents the calculations of a concentration of attached particles σcr as a function of pore fraction filled with water sw for different particle loads n and pore size variations cv the σcr changes from its maximum at sw 0 in dry porous media to 0 when the imbibition meniscus detaches particles and sw 1 at low saturation the pore size distribution cv almost does not affect the maximum retained concentration σcr curves of n cv n 2cv and n 0 5cv are identical for sw 0 2 for sw values higher than 0 2 more particles are retained at n 2cv than at n cv and n 0 5cv a higher variation in pore sizes can incorporate more particles when small pores are filled first there is less detachment of particles from large pores the particle detachment is gradual small pores are filled uniformly and the release of particles from pores partially filled with water is simultaneous a higher initial concentration of attached particles implies the higher rate of their mobilisation a slope of 2n cv curve is higher than a slope of n cv curve both slopes are steeper than a slope of a 0 5n cv curve fig 10 compares the theoretical predictions of concentration of attached particles σcr with the results of laboratory tests performed in unsaturated media the theoretical predictions for σcr were based on eq 30 and tuned by the concentration of attached particles per unit length n and by pore size distribution cv the results of saiers and lenhart saiers and lenhart 2003 with γgl 0 0729 n m is 1 mm 1 6 10 6 u 8 3 10 5 m s and

2003 and gao et al gao et al 2004 are marked 4 and 5 and are presented in fig 10b along with the theoretical predictions the figure shows a permeability decrease due to fines release and pore throat blocking with water saturation increase the theoretical predictions for impedance were based on eq 32 assuming β 2000 table 1 displays the coefficient of determination r2 used to evaluate the quality of the fit of theoretical predictions of σcr to data sets 1 5 displayed on fig 10 the prediction curves σcr sw have two degrees of freedom so high tuning by two model parameter validates the model 30 for detachment of fines in porous media the r2 values between 0 97 and 0 99 show a high agreement between the laboratory and modelling data both tunning parameters have values in the same order for a variety of tests a constant velocity inside the porous media was assumed a more realistic approach should incorporate the fact that the velocity in a saturated porous media varies with pore size and not all particles are subject to the same velocity this is especially important when the electrostatic force is comparable with the drag force e g water salinity is low is 0 001 m in unsaturated porous media the detachment is controlled by the capillary force and an incorporation of a velocity gradient becomes less relevant chemical heterogeneity and surface roughness are interesting future research topics they can be addressed through a force and a moment balance on attachment and detachment of a particle 6 conclusions the detachment of colloidal particles from media grains is a complex phenomenon not all of the conditions can be described by the same set of equations the analyses provided in this study described four different case scenarios for particles attachment rolling sliding and lifting in an unsaturated media all the scenarios depend on a single variable the water level following theoretical considerations and analytical derivations backed up by experimental data we found that a gradual increase of the water level mobilises attached colloids from the solid surface particles with a radius of 1 μm firmly attached to a dry porous media cannot be effectively detached under the studied conditions and require flooding of the media the higher the water level around the particle the easier the release hydrodynamic shear forces alone at typical groundwater conditions are not effective to release attached particles under high electrostatic attraction i e in the presence of high salinity water the drag force is important only for low saline water is 0 001 m and can be disregarded in water with higher salinity the release is a two stage process that requires an internal release of a particle from the surface followed by its removal by the flow the release is due to an expansion of the electric double layer in low salinity water the expansion weakens the adhesion of particles to the surface as a pre request before the detachment the mobilisation of particles in saturated media differs from the mobilisation in unsaturated media in saturated media for a positive normal force the lifting case the mobilised particles leave the grain surface and move along with carrier water velocity in an unsaturated porous media the water level and particle hydrophilicity are the most important parameters in colloid mobilisation the mobilised particles leave the media surface and remain on the interface at the height where capillary force ceases to exist the above principles were confirmed in experiments with data gathered from previous publications the mobilisation by rolling requires lower values of velocity than the mobilisation by sliding or lifting it is easier to mobilise a particle of the same radius in saturated than in unsaturated media if the capillary force attaches the particle to the surface the boundaries between attachment rolling sliding and lifting domains decrease monotonically with re which means that for the same flow conditions large particles are mobilised first a close match between the experimental results on particle detachment and the theoretical predictions based on mechanical equilibrium has been observed it suggests that the concentration of attached and released particles can be predicted based on particle size hydrophilicity water level and ionic strength the mechanical equilibrium conditions for the particle attached to a substrate determine the maximum retention concentration of the attached particles as a function of water saturation in a model porous media the maximum retention function predicts fines mobilisation during the changes in water level the derived maximum retention function is in a high agreement with the experimental data declaration of competing interest none 
433,there is increasing attention to the development of a myriad of complex methods for nonstationary frequency analysis nfa of floods droughts and other hydrologic processes we assume that the need for nfa arises from well understood deterministic mechanisms of change a common assumption in nfa questioned here is that more accurate estimators of hydrologic statistics result when more realistic complex and sophisticated models are employed by considering the mean annual flood drought or other hydrologic event general conditions are derived when the sample mean sm is a more efficient lower mean square error mse estimator than a regression estimate of the mean rm we introduce an optimal fractional mean estimator fm which is simply the sm of the most recent period of record nf where f is the optimal fraction of the full sample n which leads to minimum mse among all possible values of f interestingly fm is generally preferred over rm for attained significance levels associated with the fitted regression model in excess of about 0 05 given the considerable attention and uncertainty surrounding potential nonstationary conditions we demonstrate that a parsimonious estimator which exploits an optimal recent subset of the historical record may be more attractive than many of the more complex nonstationary approaches commonly advocated keywords floods droughts natural hazards hydrologic design urbanization climate change streamflow rivers infrastructure hydraulic efficiency robustness resistance parsimony subset update current mean 1 introduction one of the most common challenges facing hydrologists involves a determination of design events associated with floods droughts rainfall sediment and other constituent loads as well as a host of other important hydroclimatic variables such design events are normally determined by developing the relationship between the magnitude and frequency of the hydroclimatic variable of interest this study applies to nearly any type of hydrologic frequency analysis hfa however most of our discussions pertain to flood frequency analysis ffa and drought frequency analysis dfa readers are encouraged to envision and apply the findings of this study to other areas of hfa such as its most obvious extension to frequency analysis of rainfall sediment and other constituent loads critical to nearly all traditional approaches to hfa in general and ffa and dfa in particular is the assumption of stationarity loosely defined as conditions when key population statistics of the variable of interest such as their moments or l moments and or probability distribution function pdf parameters do not systematically change over time we distinguish between stationary and nonstationary ffa using the notation sffa and nffa respectively over the past decade there has been a surge of literature on the topic of nffa as evidenced from recent review articles and special journal issues e g khaliq et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 kiang et al 2011 salas et al 2012 madsen et al 2013 hall et al 2014 bayazit 2015 salas et al 2018 francois et al 2019 in spite of this recent surge of literature on nffa serago and vogel 2018 describe the current situation 1 there is no consensus on the need for nffa 2 considerable debate exists over whether one should use sffa or nffa in practice and 3 there is no consensus on an appropriate design event to employ under nonstationary conditions due to the tremendous uncertainty associated with the impacts of climate change on water resources this lack of consensus is to be expected for studies which attempt to capture the impact of climate change on dfa and ffa e g koutsoyiannis et al 2008 hirsch and ryberg 2012 however serago and vogel 2018 blum et al 2019 and hecht and vogel 2020 cite numerous reasons why the need for nffa in urbanized or urbanizing watersheds is paramount those three studies argue that when historical trends in streamflow series are obvious due to documented changes in historical land use and or water infrastructure it is imperative to provide updated estimates of design events that reflect current conditions 1 1 when to consider a nonstationary frequency analysis it is not our goal to provide a comprehensive analysis of the general conditions under which a stationary or nonstationary ffa is to be employed even when change is evident in a hydrologic record such changes may not arise from nonstationary processes cohn and lins 2005 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 importantly one is ill advised to employ nffa on the basis of information obtained only from available hydrologic records koutsoyiannis 2016 luke et al 2017 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 given these concerns it is only when a very clear physical understanding of the deterministic causes of nonstationary behavior are present that a nonstationary analysis is warranted and this is particularly true in any analysis involving extrapolation of historical change into the future koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 suggest a simple rule to decide if a nonstationary analysis is warranted by answering the question can the change be predicted in deterministic terms they argue that only if the answer is positive is it legitimate to invoke nonstationarity examples of such physical drivers of nonstationary behavior which could be predicted in deterministic terms include changes in climate numerous forms of land use change between forest agricultural and urban increased degree of artificial drainage such as tile drainage or ditching and changing agricultural practices including conservation tillage or irrigation a primary assumption inherent in our analysis is that a clear physical basis and understanding exists concerning the mechanisms which result in the nonstationary process under consideration thus our study does not answer the question of whether or not to employ a stationary or nonstationary analysis but rather we assume that the flood drought or other hydrologic series of interest is known to exhibit nonstationary behavior which can be represented in the form of a mathematical model our analysis then attempts to evaluate a number of different approaches for estimation of a relatively simple and important statistic the current mean i e the conditional mean of that nonstationary hydrologic process here we consider a very simple nonstationary model a linear regression model and a very simple statistic conditional mean as opposed to estimating an extreme quantile under more complex nonstationary conditions consider the very common problem in which a hydrologic record of annual maximum or minimum streamflow is available which has been subject to change due to known urbanization processes in such situations the mean annual flood maf along with all other associated hydrologic statistics such as the t year design event will change over time thus an important and common question which forms the basis of this study is how to update the maf or other hydrologic statistic such as the t year design event to reflect current conditions serago and vogel 2018 blum et al 2019 hecht and vogel 2020 when nonstationary processes are known apriori to govern hydrologic behavior our central goal is to examine the level of model and associated estimation complexity needed to update the mean of a hydrologic process to reflect current conditions a natural tradeoff exists between the level of complexity and the reliability of the estimator to be employed this tradeoff involves an understanding of the relationship between the sampling properties i e bias and mean square error associated with various estimators of the design statistic of interest and the sample size and significance level or goodness of fit associated with the fitted nonstationary model under consideration the central challenge addressed by this study involves the appropriate level of complexity associated with the estimator of a hydrologic design event when the hydrologic process under consideration is known to exhibit nonstationary behavior this question is likely to remain an open question for some time to come as evidenced from the recent findings of o brien and burn 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 yu and stedinger 2018 and serinaldi et al 2018 in a careful comparison of the precision uncertainty associated with various estimates of design flood events using both stationary and nonstationary methods luke et al 2017 found that stationary methods were nearly always preferred over nonstationary approaches here we further explore this hypothesis 1 2 on the need for parsimonious models serago and vogel section 2 2018 review the fundamental virtues of most widely accepted methods of sffa which relate to their proven properties of robustness resistance and efficiency all of which stem from the principle of parsimony and all of which have been given little or no attention in the area of nffa it has long been known that efficient low mse estimators also tend to be parsimonious box and jenkins 1976 a parsimonious estimator is one that accomplishes a desired level of prediction efficiency with as few model parameters as possible serago and vogel section 2 2018 document clear evidence of the value of parsimonious models in both sffa kuczera 1982 slack et al 1975 lu and stedinger 1992 laio et al 2009 and di baldassarre et al 2009 and nffa serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 and yu and stedinger 2018 serago and vogel 2018 and others provide extensive evidence of the value of parsimony in sffa and after the three recent studies by serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 and yu and stedinger 2018 we expect the principle of parsimony to play an increasing and equally important role in nffa the primary goal of this study is to contrast the general performance in terms of robustness and efficiency of various estimators of the conditional mean with an emphasis on nonstationary conditions 1 3 use of a subset of historical record to reflect current watershed conditions estimation of streamflow statistics which reflect current watershed conditions is challenging under nonstationary conditions due to the ever present and natural stochastic aspect of streamflow combined with the fact that historical streamflow records may not be representative of current watershed conditions if environmental conditions are changing under nonstationary conditions multiple anthropogenic impacts often occur simultaneously making it very difficult to attribute and model changes in streamflow as a function of climate land use water use and or other watershed characteristics hirsch 2011 allaire et al 2015 as an alternative to the development of a predictive model of streamflow some authors have suggested using a recent subset of the streamflow record that better reflects current conditions at a site than the entire historical record riggs 1972 gebert et al 2016 blum et al 2019 for example in an evaluation of the relationship between magnitude and frequency of low flows for 15 basins in wisconsin gebert et al 2016 recommended use of the 1969 2008 period for determining current streamflow characteristics for design and compliance purposes because that period was shown to represent current land use and climatic condition and was generally free of trends and thus could be considered approximately stationary similarly riggs 1972 suggests that i f the pattern of regulation of a stream has been consistent for several years and is expected to continue so low flow frequency curves based on the record for those years may be useful blum et al 2019 considered estimation of the 7 day 10 year low flow statistic 7q10 under nonstationary conditions blum et al 2019 performed monte carlo experiments to evaluate the performance of a stationary nonparametric quantile estimator applied to a recent subset of the nonstationary annual minimum flow record in comparison with using the complete historical flow record they found that a nonparametric stationary quantile estimator fit using the most recent 30 or 50 years of a 75 year record led to improved accuracy and reduced bias of 7q10 estimators when compared to using the entire flow record under nonstationary conditions this study takes an analogous approach with the goal of obtaining more general conclusions concerning the value of using the sample mean of a subset of the recent observed record which we term the fractional mean fm as compared to a more traditional nonstationary regression model estimator of the mean streamflow which we term rm or employing the entire historical record which we term sm 2 methodology 2 1 theoretical background and estimators to enable us to develop general recommendation regarding the behavior of various hydrologic statistics under nonstationary conditions in this initial study we only consider estimation of the current mean defined as the mean under current conditions under stationary conditions a true mean exists or in other words the current mean is always the true mean however the central focus of this work is on nonstationary conditions in which case we define the current mean as the conditional mean under current watershed conditions although estimation of the mean may seem trivial compared with other statistics nearly all sffa and nffa methods begin with estimation of the mean consider the problem of fitting a nonstationary pdf to a series of annual maximum floods amf denoted by x or its natural logarithm y any application of either sffa or nffa will typically involve estimation of the mean of either x or y or both depending on which pdf estimation method is used our results are general and apply to the mean μ z of any variable z regardless of its pdf in this section we introduce several estimators of μ z suitable for nffa an example of the importance of estimation of the mean would be in low flow frequency analysis when the annual minimum 7 day low flows follow a lognormal distribution in that case the widely used 7 day 2 year low flow statistic is simply the mean of the logarithms of the annual minimum 7 day flows 2 2 conditional mean of a nonstationary hydrologic process most existing approaches to nffa summarized in review articles by khaliq et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 kiang et al 2011 salas et al 2012 madsen et al 2013 ehret et al 2014 hall et al 2014 bayazit 2015 salas et al 2018 and francois et al 2019 involve fitting pdfs whose parameters and or moments are related to exogenous variables which are in turn are related to drivers of nonstationary behavior here we relate streamflow to an exogenous variable using a bivariate regression model 1 z μ z β w μ w ε where z and μ z represent the streamflow variable of interest and its unconditional mean respectively w and μ w represent an explanatory variable and its mean respectively β is the trend slope coefficient and ε is model error which is assumed to have zero mean and constant variance with σ ε 2 σ z 2 1 ρ 2 where ρ denotes the pearson correlation coefficient between zand w the model in 1 is not limited to linear relationships because a wide range of monotonic non linear functions can be linearized with transformations such as tukey s ladder of powers helsel et al 2020 enabling the application of a variety of linear regression methods for fitting highly nonlinear relationships in addition to the ability to model nonlinear trends there are numerous other advantages of regression methods outlined by serago and vogel 2018 including rigorous graphical displays parsimony prediction intervals associated with trend extrapolations accommodation of complex multivariate relationships and an ability to account for missing observations abrupt changes and the impact of stochastic persistence the streamflow variable z could be a series of streamflows x their natural logarithms y or some other suitable transformation here we emphasize that the unconditional mean μ z is of little value to nffa because it does not generally exist for a nonstationary process though it can be interpreted as the conditional mean of z when w μ w the model error term ε in 1 is often treated as an independent and identically distributed random variable in spite of our now widespread knowledge that some hydrologic processes exhibit heteroscedasticity hecht and vogel 2020 stochastic persistence and possibly deterministic trends cohn and lins 2005 ignoring stochastic persistence in 1 when it exists would lead to incorrect statistical inference concerning the variance of the estimators of the model parameters β and μ z issues central to this study matalas and sankarasubramanian 2003 provide approximations to the inflation in the variance associated with estimators of β in 1 when ε arises from markov arma 1 1 and fractional gaussian noise stochastic processes however it is extremely difficult to identify such higher order stochastic persistence structures in typical hydrologic records see examples in vogel et al 1998 thus in this initial study we assume that ε arises from a serially independent stochastic process and we encourage future investigators to employ the results of matalas and sankarasubramanian 2003 to extend the analysis which follows the regression coefficient β in 1 is defined by 2 β ρ σ z σ w where σ z and σ w denote the standard deviation of z and w respectively the conditional mean is the expected value of z conditioned upon w denoted μ z w and is obtained by taking the expectation of 1 to obtain 3 μ z w μ z β w μ w because e ε 0 see serago and vogel 2018 for the derivation of other conditional moments of regression in 1 numerous authors have employed a regression model of the form given in 3 in nffa for example vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2014 and brady et al 2019 found 1 with z equal to the logarithm of the annual maximum flood amf series and w equal to time to be useful for modeling flood series at hundreds of rivers in the u s and the u k regardless of whether or not trends exist we highlight the multilevel or panel version of 1 employed by brady et al 2019 which accounts for interactions among sites in a region in a bayesian framework hirsch and ryberg 2012 used 1 to relate the natural log of amf series at 200 long term rivers in the us to the covariate w equal to carbon dioxide concentrations we emphasize that the form of the regression model in 1 and 2 makes no assumption regarding the pdf of z 2 3 regression estimator of conditional mean rm a regression estimator of the conditional mean μ z w termed rm may be obtained using ordinary least squares estimators in which case 4 r m z β w w where β ρ σ z σ w ρ r i 1 n w i w z i z i 1 n w i w 2 i 1 n z i z 2 σ z 1 n 1 i 1 n z i z 2 z 1 n i 1 n z i σ w 1 n 1 i 1 n w i w 2 w 1 n i 1 n w i as is standard practice hats over greek symbols are used to denote sample estimators the correlation estimator ρ r is the common pearson correlation coefficient estimator see barber et al 2019 we consider the special case in which the explanatory variable w is time which is not a random variable for this case with no missing observations prosdocimi et al 2014 appendix a3 derive expressions for the sample mean and variance of w time given by w n 1 2 and σ w 2 n n 1 12 where w 1 2 n we are interested in estimating the current mean defined as the conditional mean when w n 2 4 the fractional sample mean fm and sample mean sm suppose a record of streamflow is available over the past n years which is known to exhibit nonstationary behavior due to known deterministic effects and guidance exists for selecting a subset of the entire record which best represents current watershed conditions consider as an alternative to the rm a fractional mean estimator fm which is simply the sample mean of the most recent n f years of record where f denotes the fraction of the most recent record of n observations which represents current watershed conditions a fractional mean estimator fm based on a sample z 1 z 2 z n nf z n nf 1 zn is defined as 5 fm 1 n f i 1 n f z n n f i note that the sample mean of the entire historical record z defined in 4 and referred to hereafter as sm is a special case of the fm when f 1 we derive an optimal fractional mean estimator fm which employs 5 with an optimal fraction f termed f derived in the next section as that value of f which leads to a minimum mse of the fm estimator for example suppose a sample of length n 50 is available and one has knowledge that the last n f 30 years are representative of current watershed conditions thus f 30 50 0 6 and fm in 5 would be simply the sample mean of the last 30 values of z 2 5 the attained significance level of a regression model in addition to having solid physical evidence corresponding to the causative mechanisms for a trend in a hydrologic process investigators often augment such physical knowledge with a hypothesis test associated with the estimated regression slope based on hydrologic measurements this is in spite of the numerous concerns over null hypothesis significance testing summarized by vogel et al 2013 serinaldi et al 2018 and others cited therein normally a critical significance level α of say 0 05 is assumed and then an attained significance level p is computed from the data which indicates the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis of no trend β 0 is rejected we assume that one has good physical evidence of the direction of the trend if it exists thus the sign of the alternative hypothesis would be either β 0 or β 0 in which case if the attained significance level p α one should have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and thus support the alternative nonstationary analysis assuming the regression model residuals are normally distributed the attained significance level p for such a one sided test can be computed from see helsel et al 2020 6 p 1 p t n 2 ρ n 2 1 ρ 2 where p denotes the cumulative probability operator and t n 2 represents a students t variate with n 2 degrees of freedom we express the attained significance level p in 6 as a function of the true correlation ρ rather than a sample estimator as is typical in hypothesis testing instead we are only employing this relationship for the purpose of integrating the impact of both sample size and correlation on resulting attained significance levels given concerns raised earlier in section 1 1 as well as the fact that the hypothesis test in 6 does not account for the inflation in variance of the β estimator due to possible stochastic persistence associated with the model errors ε in 1 we do not advocate the use of this or other hypothesis tests to evaluate whether to perform a sffa or nffa in addition to those concerns the result of such tests do not provide critical information concerning the robustness or efficiency of the resulting estimators rm and fm in 4 and 5 respectively instead we employ the attained significance level p in 6 in later comparisons as a metric which measures the impact of both sample size n and correlation coefficient ρ thus reducing the dimensionality of our comparative assessments 2 6 comparisons among estimators of the condional mean if an estimator θ 1 is more efficient than θ 2 the estimator θ 1 will yield a better estimate of the statistic θ than θ 2 the notion of a better estimator of a statistic relies upon the choice of a loss function corresponding to the problem of interest where a loss function quantifies the relative economic and other losses associated with estimation errors among statisticians the most common choice of the form of a loss function is quadratic resulting in the mean squared error mse criterion of optimality see everitt 2002 page 128 one can define the efficiency of the estimator θ 1 relative to the estimator θ 2 using 7 eff θ 1 θ 2 e θ 2 θ 2 e θ 1 θ 2 mse θ 2 mse θ 1 where mse denotes mean square error in general when e f f θ 1 θ 2 1 the estimator θ 1 is said to be more efficient than θ 2 and is thus preferred over the estimator θ 2 for estimation of θ it is well known that the mse variance and bias of an estimator are related via mse θ e θ θ 2 e θ θ 2 e θ e θ 2 bias θ 2 var θ so that an unbiased estimator has mse equal to its variance thus if both estimators are unbiased then the efficiency in 7 reduces to the ratio of the variances of both estimators to enable comparisons among estimators under both stationary and nonstationary conditions using the concept of efficiency in 7 we derive analytical expressions for the bias variance and mse of the estimators in the following sections 2 7 mse of estimators under stationary conditions under stationary conditions the current mean is equal to μ z which does not change over time and both ρ 0 and β 0 in eqs 1 3 under stationary conditions rm sm and fm are unbiased estimators of the true mean regardless of the value of f thus their mse is made up entirely of their variance so that for any independent and identically distributed series of potentially transformed streamflows z 8 mse s fm var s fm σ z 2 n f with the subscript s denoting stationary conditions helsel et al 2020 report the variance of a regression estimator of the mean in the current year n which can be combined with the mean and standard deviation of w given in 4 to obtain 9 mse s rm var s rm σ z 2 1 ρ 2 1 n n w 2 n σ w 2 σ z 2 1 n n n 1 2 2 n n n 1 12 since under stationary conditions ρ 0 2 8 mse of estimators under nonstationary conditions we focus on the current mean in year n w n which would reflect current conditions at the end of the streamflow record under nonstationary conditions the current mean is equal to the conditional mean of z in year n denoted μ z w n in which case rm is unbiased but fm and thus sm will always be biased regardless of the value of f unless n f 1 one can rewrite the expression for fm in 5 using the regression model for z given in 1 which leads to the bias of fm under nonstationary conditions 10 bia s ns fm e fm μ z w n e 1 nf i 1 nf μ z β n nf i n 1 2 ε i μ z β n n 1 2 β 1 nf 2 where the subscript ns denotes nonstationary conditions eq 10 results from the fact that e i 1 n f i n f 1 n f 2 and e ε 0 for a given sample size n the bias in fm increases as both β and f increase under nonstationary conditions each observation z is defined in 1 as z μ z β w μ w ε noting that the first two terms are not random variables thus var z var ε so that varns fm vars fm in eq 8 so that the mse of the fractional mean is given by the sum of its bias squared and its variance 11a mse ns fm β 1 n f 2 2 σ z 2 1 ρ 2 n f which can be simplified using the fact that β ρ σ z σ w ρ σ z 12 n n 1 resulting in 11b mse ns fm σ z 2 3 ρ 2 1 n f 2 n n 1 1 ρ 2 n f under nonstationary conditions rm in 4 is unbiased thus its mse is equal to its variance helsel et al 2020 report the variance of rm which can be combined with the mean and standard deviation of w given in 4 and taking w n to obtain 12 mse n s rm var ns rm σ z 2 1 ρ 2 1 n n w 2 n σ w 2 σ z 2 1 ρ 2 1 n n n 1 2 2 n n n 1 12 2 9 the optimal fractional sample mean fm here we introduce an optimal fractional mean denoted fm as that value of fm which exhibits minimum mse under nonstationary conditions this is accomplished by deriving the optimal fraction f denoted f for which msens fm is minimized the function msens fm given in 11 is minimized with respect to f by setting its first derivative equal to zero m s e n s f m f 0 and solving the resulting expression for ρ the resulting optimal value of f termed f can be computed from 13 ρ n 1 6 f 2 n f n 1 n 1 when the optimal fraction f is substituted into the estimator fm given in 5 we obtain the optimal fractional mean estimator fm given by 14 fm 1 n f i 1 n f z n n f i fm has the unique property under nonstationary conditions of yielding an estimator of the sample mean with both minimum mse as well as maximum efficiency relative to the regression estimator of the mean rm as long as the correlation is known monte carlo experiments are performed to evaluate the sampling properties of fm when the correlation is unknown 3 results we use the expressions for mse and efficiency derived in the previous section to evaluate the general conditions under which one can expect fm to exhibit greater efficiency than either the sample mean sm fm with f 1 or the regression estimator rm under stationary and nonstationary conditions all previous derived theoretical expressions for bias mse and efficiency of the various estimators are a function of the sample size n and the population correlation ρ all such analytical theoretical expressions for rm were derived assuming that in practice an estimate of ρ is obtained from the pearson correlation coefficient estimator r given in 4 since an estimate of ρ is also needed to implement fm and we could not obtain analytical results for its bias mse or efficiency when an estimate of ρ is used monte carlo experiments are performed to consider the additional uncertainty associated with fm resulting from the necessity to estimate ρ 3 1 results stationary conditions unlike nonstationary conditions under stationary conditions a true mean exists and a comparison among the estimators sm fm fm and rm is relatively simple because they are all unbiased so their efficiency defined in 7 reduces to the ratio of their variances for example the efficiency of the sample mean sm relative to the fractional mean fm is equal to 1 f which we denote as e f f s m f m 1 f so that under stationary conditions sm is always more efficient than fm because if f 1 then eff sm fm 1 the efficiency of fm relative to rm under stationary conditions denoted as eff fm rm is obtained by substitution of eqs 8 and 9 into 7 which can be simplified to 15 eff fm rm f 4 n 2 5 n 3 n n 1 because under stationary conditions the correlation coefficient ρ 0 fig 1 summarizes the efficiency of fm relative to rm under stationary conditions and also enables us to make a general efficiency comparison between fm fm rm and sm perhaps the most interesting result in fig 1 involves the efficiency of sm relative to rm which corresponds to the value of eff fm rm when f 1 the range of efficiencies of sm over rm correspond approximately to 3 eff sm rm 4 for 10 n 100 so under stationary conditions sm will yield estimators of the mean with 3 4 times lower mse than rm even though both estimators are unbiased under those conditions this result dramatizes the influence of the added uncertainty associated with rm over sm resulting from having to estimate the regression slope β as expected fig 1 also illustrates that under stationary conditions sm is always preferred over fm for f 1 regardless of the value of n thus under those conditions sm is also always preferred over fm for f 1 fig 1 also illustrates that fm is nearly always preferred over rm for values of f in excess of approximately 0 3 as is shown later on the optimal fractional mean fm usually employs values of f significantly greater than 0 3 thus fm will usually be preferred over rm under stationary conditions these findings are analogous to some early flood frequency studies which documented the general conditions under which an at site estimator is to be preferred over one based on the use of a regional regression model hebson and cunanne 1987 in summary under stationary conditions and f 1 sm is generally preferred to all other estimators considered followed by fm with f 1 which is generally preferred to rm note that the gains in efficiency reported in fig 1 of sm over fm and of sm over rm are often rather considerable and emphasize the need to employ stationary methods when stationary behavior cannot be rejected on the basis of a deterministic analysis as discussed in section 1 1 under nonstationary conditions this ranking among the estimators is more complex and very different highlighting the need to consider both stationary and nonstationary conditions in any hydrologic frequency analysis as emphasized by vogel et al 2013 rosner et al 2014 and salas et al 2018 3 2 results nonstationary conditions rm fm and sm under nonstationary conditions a true mean does not exist and instead the mean is changing over time unlike the stationary case when all the estimators sm fm fm and rm were unbiased under nonstationary conditions only rm is unbiased and only when the true nonstationary model in 1 is known as is assumed here the bias associated with both fm and sm can be evaluated using 10 noting that when f 1 fm reduces to sm in general the sign of the bias associated with fm will depend on the sign of the slope coefficient β for positive negative trends e fm will generally be smaller larger than its true value with that bias increasing as both f and n increase we begin by exploring eff sm rm as a function of ρ and n in fig 2 for nonstationary conditions which is obtained by combining 7 with 11 assuming f 1 and 12 also shown in fig 2 are conditions of mse equivalence among the two estimators which occurs when eff sm rm 1 i e mse of sm is equal to the mse of rm fig 2 illustrates that for very small values of ρ sm is generally preferred over rm in contrast we note that for larger values of ρ rm exhibits much lower mse than sm clearly the values of n and ρ are of considerable importance in understanding the advantages of rm over sm and vice versa to understand the behavior of eff sm rm more fully fig 3 superimposes the relationship between n ρ and the attained significance level p given in 6 over the relationship between eff sm rm n and ρ given by substitution of 11 with f 1 and 12 into 7 for the cases when eff sm rm 1 and when eff sm rm 1 2 note that the condition eff sm rm 1 2 in fig 3 implies that rm is preferred over sm because under those conditions rm has twice the information content or half the variance of sm values of p were adjusted until both of the superimposed relationships in fig 3 roughly line up with each other the important result in fig 3 is that under nonstationary conditions mse equivalence between rm and sm eff sm rm 1 occurs when the attained significance level associated with the fitted regression is approximately equal to 17 this result emphasizes that the estimator rm will have lower mse than sm when the attained significance level is below about 17 it is common practice to choose the regression estimator rm over the sm when significance levels are below 5 or 10 fig 3 illustrates that use of a 5 or 10 level test as is common practice corresponds to conditions under which rm will have considerably more information than sm thus perhaps a higher significance level roughly 17 may be a more appropriate significance threshold in practice 3 3 results nonstationary conditions optimal fractional mean fm the critical question addressed in this section is whether or not a sample mean of an optimal subset of the historical record can be used to improve upon the performance of rm under nonstationary conditions we begin by illustrating the peaked nature of the relationship between eff fm rm and f in fig 4 a which was constructed by combining 7 with 11 and 12 for the cases when ρ 0 2 and n 10 25 and 100 values close to those typically encountered in practice we note that for a given information content associated with the historical record as evidenced by the combined values of n and ρ there always exists a maximum value of eff fm rm corresponding to a single optimal value of f which we term f for values of f either greater or less than f there is a decrease in eff fm rm fig 4a shows that for ρ 0 2 and n 25 any fm estimator with 0 3 f 0 95 is more efficient than rm the general relationship between the optimal fraction f and values of n and ρ given in 13 is illustrated in fig 4b fig 5 a displays the efficiency of fm relative to rm as a function of ρ and n under nonstationary conditions computed by combining 7 with 11 and 12 with the optimal value f computed from 13 fig 5a shows that for the cases when n 10 and n 100 correlations in excess of about 0 5 and 0 2 are needed respectively for rm to have a lower mse than fm this is an important result because correlations of trend models for common hydrologic series typically exhibit relatively low correlations often in the range in which fm is likely to have lower mse than rm rather than citing examples of typical reported trend correlations this issue is explored further below using attained significance levels which combine the impact of both sample size and the magnitude of the correlation coefficient in section 4 0 we report results from a study by douglas et al 2000 which documents the range of attained significance levels observed in practice for both flood and low streamflows fig 5a also indicates that the efficiency of fm relative to rm becomes extremely large as ρ approaches zero because under those conditions fm approaches sm and f 1 as shown in fig 4b in which case sm has a much lower mse than rm as was shown earlier in fig 2 fig 5a is important because it shows that even though rm is an unbiased estimator under nonstationary conditions fm and even sm both have much lower mse than rm when ρ approaches zero due to added uncertainty associated with having to estimate the slope coefficient β we conclude that the values of both ρ and n are central to determining how much better fm and sm are compared to rm under nonstationary conditions fig 5b illustrates the efficiency of fm relative to sm as a function of both ρ and n which documents the considerable gains in efficiency of fm over sm as both n and ρ increase we conclude from fig 5b that fm is always an improvement over sm under nonstationary conditions perhaps our most important practical result is illustrated in fig 6 which is analogous to fig 3 because it was constructed by superimposing the relationship between n ρ and p given in 6 over the relationship between eff fm rm n and ρ given by substitution of 11 with f given in 13 and 12 into 7 the important result in fig 6 is that mse equivalence between fm and rm occurs approximately when the attained significance level associated with the fitted regression is equal to approximately 5 fig 6 also reports conditions when eff fm rm 1 2 which implies that rm is preferred over fm because under those conditions rm has twice the information content or half the variance of fm interestingly even though both rm and fm are designed to perform well under nonstationary conditions rm is generally dominated by fm unless significance levels are below 0 05 this result emphasizes that for rm to have clear advantages over fm would require attained significance levels considerably lower than 5 3 4 impact of uncertainty in estimation of ρ on msens fm until now we have assumed knowledge of the true correlation ρ in this section we consider the ramifications of having to estimate ρ using the common pearson correlation coefficient estimator denoted r barber et al 2019 provide a recent review of literature on estimation of ρ for skewed hydrologic processes our theoretical derivation of msens fm computed by combining 7 with 11 and 12 with the optimal value f computed from 13 ignores uncertainty associated with the estimator of ρ needed to estimate f in fm monte carlo experiments are performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainty in the ρ estimator which in turn is needed to compute f fm and finally msens fm simulation of uncertainty associated with an estimate of ρ denoted r is implemented using an approximation to what is termed the non null sampling distribution of r which describes the distribution of r when the regression model in 1 governs fisher 1915 1921 first introduced exact expressions for the non null sampling distribution of r for large and small samples due to their numerical complexity numerous approximations have been introduced over the years we employ kraemers 1973 approximation who showed that if r is an estimator of the correlation coefficient based on a sample of n observations drawn from a bivariate normal distribution with correlation coefficient ρ then the statistic 16 t r ρ n 2 1 r 2 1 ρ 2 t n 2 is approximately distributed as students t with n 2 degrees of freedom using 16 we generate 10 000 values of r corresponding to a wide range of values of ρ for the two cases n 25 and n 100 for each true value of ρ considered the 10 000 generated values of r are used to estimate 10 000 values of f which are then used to compute 10 000 values of eff fm rm fig 7 compares the mean or steady state value of eff fm rm from those monte carlo experiments with the theoretical value of eff fm rm which ignores uncertainty in our estimator of f plotted earlier in fig 5a interestingly for large samples i e n 100 the approximate analytical and exact monte carlo results are in very good agreement especially for values of ρ in excess of about 0 2 for smaller samples accounting for uncertainty in the estimator of f leads to slightly lower efficiencies eff fm rm than expected on the basis of our analytical results additional monte carlo experiments are needed to formulate more general conclusions for a wider range of conditions 4 discussion we have shown that the decision as to which estimator of the conditional mean to use can be expressed as a function of the attained significance level p which in turn is a complex function of the explanatory power of the trend and sample size as summarized by the values of ρ and n respectively if the monte carlo and analytical results in fig 7 were in exact agreement our analytical results would yield both exact and general decision rules regarding which estimator of the conditional mean to apply for a given observed value of attained significance level when the true nonstationary model is known however given the results in fig 7 the resulting decision rules are only approximate yet still could be quite useful in practice fig 7 documents that our decision rules are only approximate for small values of n and ρ yet are nearly exact for larger values the approximate decision rules concerning the application of the three estimators of the conditional mean sm fm and rm can be summarized as follows 1 under stationary conditions all three estimators are unbiased but sm is always preferred because it exhibits the lowest variance and thus the lowest mse followed by fm with f 1 which is generally preferred to rm 2 under nonstationary conditions rm is the only unbiased estimator considered and the attained significance level p approximates which estimator is preferred when p 0 05 rm is generally preferred and when p 0 05 fm is generally preferred over rm when p 0 17 rm is generally preferred to sm our results indicate that the decision as to whether to employ rm fm or sm under nonstationary conditions depends critically upon the attained significance levels associated with the trend in the range of p 0 17 such values of attained significance levels are commonplace in trend assessments concerning hydrologic series for example in a national study of trends in low flow and flood flow discharges at unregulated watersheds across the u s over a 50 year period douglas et al 2000 table 2 found attained significance levels for low flow trends having a mean of 0 132 and a range from 0 007 to 0 429 and for flood flow trends a mean of 0 264 and a range from 0 035 to 0 386 it is important to note that our results assume full knowledge of the true underlying structure of the nonstationary model naturally in practice one would not know a priori the form of the nonstationary trend model nor the form of any stochastic persistence present in the streamflow observations such knowledge may be critical in practice thus future experiments are needed to evaluate the robustness of our findings under 1 different nonstationary model structures 2 possible heteroscedasticity of the model residuals see hecht and vogel 2020 and 3 different forms of stochastic persistence 5 conclusions there is a constant evolution of the field of hydrologic frequency analysis hfa serago and vogel 2018 section 2 reviewed early developments in hfa in the 1970 s and 1980 s which led to the widespread appreciation of the superiority of and need for parsimonious estimators for use in sffa because they generally yield more efficient estimators of design event quantiles than more complex models in spite of the tremendous increase in the literature on nffa we could only find a few studies which have documented the value of parsimonious estimators such as the fm estimator introduced here the findings of this study along with recent work by serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 and yu and stedinger 2018 provide substantial support for understanding and promoting the value of parsimonious estimators in nffa this study is the first effort to develop a general decision rule concerning which estimator of a conditional mean to employ under nonstationary conditions we have compared the performance of three estimators of the conditional mean fm sm and rm the estimator sm is the most parsimonious estimator of the mean possible because it is nonparametric and requires no parameters in contrast fm and rm are both parametric estimators because fm requires an estimate of f the optimal fraction of the most recent record to employ and rm requires an estimate of both μ z and β regression model parameters we emphasize that we have only considered relatively parsimonious estimators of a conditional mean in contrast to the much more complex and much less parsimonious estimators normally recommended see reviews by khaliq et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 kiang et al 2011 salas et al 2012 madsen et al 2013 hall et al 2014 bayazit 2015 salas et al 2018 and francois et al 2019 we outlined numerous advantages of fm over both rm and sm under nonstationary conditions and if we had considered less parsimonious models of the type often recommended we anticipate the advantages of fm would appear even greater than those outlined here this study takes a different approach then most previous studies which only use the attained significance level p to decide whether or not to perform a nonstationary analysis the result of a hypothesis test i e attained significance level does not provide the critical information needed concerning the robustness or efficiency of the estimators under consideration instead our approach was to relate the attained significance level to the performance of the various estimators in terms of their bias variance and mean square error mse we have shown that the decision whether to employ rm fm or sm under nonstationary conditions depends critically upon the attained significance levels associated with the trend in the range of p 0 17 we have derived analytical expressions for the mse of sm as well as the nonstationary estimators of the conditional mean fm and rm and used those expressions to arrive at the following general conclusions under stationary conditions a true fixed mean exists and sm is always preferred to all other estimators considered followed by fm with f 1 which is generally preferred to rm the gains in efficiency of sm over fm and of sm over rm are often rather considerable and emphasize the need to employ stationary methods when conditions are known to be stationary as determined from a deterministic analysis see section 1 1 under nonstationary conditions no fixed or true mean exists thus we evaluate estimators of the current or conditional mean at the end of the historical record here the ranking among the estimators is more complex and very different than under stationary conditions highlighting the need to consider both stationary and nonstationary conditions in any hydrologic frequency analysis as emphasized by vogel et al 2013 rosner et al 2014 and salas et al 2018 under nonstationary conditions and very small values of the correlation coefficient ρ sm is generally preferred over rm whereas in contrast for larger values of ρ rm exhibits much lower mse than sm in addition to apriori having a solid physical basis for performing a nonstationary analysis the values of sample size n and correlation coefficient ρ are of considerable importance in deciding which estimator to implement this is because estimator rm will only have a lower mse than sm when the attained significance level is below about 17 thus use of a 5 level test as is often done in practice may be misleading interestingly over the range of typical sample sizes n 10 to n 100 correlations in excess of about 0 5 and 0 2 are needed respectively for rm to have lower mse than fm this is an important result because correlations of trend models for common hydrologic series exhibit relatively low correlations often in the range in which fm is likely to have lower mse than rm even though rm is an unbiased estimator under nonstationary conditions when the true model is known both sm and fm have lower mse than rm when ρ approaches zero due to added uncertainty associated with having to estimate the slope parameter β in general fm is always an improvement over sm under nonstationary conditions and is generally an improvement over rm as well when the attained significance level is above about 5 the above conclusions contrasting the behavior of rm and sm are quite rigorous general and complete because our analytical derivations consider the sampling variability of the estimators of β to account for sampling variability in estimators of ρ needed to estimate f in fm it was necessary to resort to a monte carlo simulation to more fully evaluate eff fm rm those experiments indicated only slight reductions in eff fm rm compared to our analytical results those reductions in efficiency mostly occur for smaller sample sizes and are due to the need to estimate ρ additional monte carlo experiments are needed to formulate more general conclusions under a wider range of conditions our theoretical analysis assumes full knowledge of the structure of the nonstationary model monte carlo robustness experiments are needed to evaluate the performance of the various estimators considered when the true nonstationary model is unknown our results are all based on the assumption that the nonstationary regression model in 1 holds with independent homoscedastic and normally distributed residuals while this assumption has been shown to be plausible on the basis of continental analyses of hundreds of annual maximum flood series vogel et al 2011 and prosdocimi et al 2014 there is also good evidence that such series may also exhibit heteroscedasticity hecht and vogel 2020 as well as various forms of both short and long term stochastic persistence which can easily be confused or interpreted as deterministic trends cohn and lins 2005 and koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 a natural extension to this study would consider the impact of short and long term stochastic persistence within the context of the regression in 1 by using the results from matalas and sankarasubramanian 2003 for ar 1 arma 1 1 and

433,there is increasing attention to the development of a myriad of complex methods for nonstationary frequency analysis nfa of floods droughts and other hydrologic processes we assume that the need for nfa arises from well understood deterministic mechanisms of change a common assumption in nfa questioned here is that more accurate estimators of hydrologic statistics result when more realistic complex and sophisticated models are employed by considering the mean annual flood drought or other hydrologic event general conditions are derived when the sample mean sm is a more efficient lower mean square error mse estimator than a regression estimate of the mean rm we introduce an optimal fractional mean estimator fm which is simply the sm of the most recent period of record nf where f is the optimal fraction of the full sample n which leads to minimum mse among all possible values of f interestingly fm is generally preferred over rm for attained significance levels associated with the fitted regression model in excess of about 0 05 given the considerable attention and uncertainty surrounding potential nonstationary conditions we demonstrate that a parsimonious estimator which exploits an optimal recent subset of the historical record may be more attractive than many of the more complex nonstationary approaches commonly advocated keywords floods droughts natural hazards hydrologic design urbanization climate change streamflow rivers infrastructure hydraulic efficiency robustness resistance parsimony subset update current mean 1 introduction one of the most common challenges facing hydrologists involves a determination of design events associated with floods droughts rainfall sediment and other constituent loads as well as a host of other important hydroclimatic variables such design events are normally determined by developing the relationship between the magnitude and frequency of the hydroclimatic variable of interest this study applies to nearly any type of hydrologic frequency analysis hfa however most of our discussions pertain to flood frequency analysis ffa and drought frequency analysis dfa readers are encouraged to envision and apply the findings of this study to other areas of hfa such as its most obvious extension to frequency analysis of rainfall sediment and other constituent loads critical to nearly all traditional approaches to hfa in general and ffa and dfa in particular is the assumption of stationarity loosely defined as conditions when key population statistics of the variable of interest such as their moments or l moments and or probability distribution function pdf parameters do not systematically change over time we distinguish between stationary and nonstationary ffa using the notation sffa and nffa respectively over the past decade there has been a surge of literature on the topic of nffa as evidenced from recent review articles and special journal issues e g khaliq et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 kiang et al 2011 salas et al 2012 madsen et al 2013 hall et al 2014 bayazit 2015 salas et al 2018 francois et al 2019 in spite of this recent surge of literature on nffa serago and vogel 2018 describe the current situation 1 there is no consensus on the need for nffa 2 considerable debate exists over whether one should use sffa or nffa in practice and 3 there is no consensus on an appropriate design event to employ under nonstationary conditions due to the tremendous uncertainty associated with the impacts of climate change on water resources this lack of consensus is to be expected for studies which attempt to capture the impact of climate change on dfa and ffa e g koutsoyiannis et al 2008 hirsch and ryberg 2012 however serago and vogel 2018 blum et al 2019 and hecht and vogel 2020 cite numerous reasons why the need for nffa in urbanized or urbanizing watersheds is paramount those three studies argue that when historical trends in streamflow series are obvious due to documented changes in historical land use and or water infrastructure it is imperative to provide updated estimates of design events that reflect current conditions 1 1 when to consider a nonstationary frequency analysis it is not our goal to provide a comprehensive analysis of the general conditions under which a stationary or nonstationary ffa is to be employed even when change is evident in a hydrologic record such changes may not arise from nonstationary processes cohn and lins 2005 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 importantly one is ill advised to employ nffa on the basis of information obtained only from available hydrologic records koutsoyiannis 2016 luke et al 2017 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 given these concerns it is only when a very clear physical understanding of the deterministic causes of nonstationary behavior are present that a nonstationary analysis is warranted and this is particularly true in any analysis involving extrapolation of historical change into the future koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 suggest a simple rule to decide if a nonstationary analysis is warranted by answering the question can the change be predicted in deterministic terms they argue that only if the answer is positive is it legitimate to invoke nonstationarity examples of such physical drivers of nonstationary behavior which could be predicted in deterministic terms include changes in climate numerous forms of land use change between forest agricultural and urban increased degree of artificial drainage such as tile drainage or ditching and changing agricultural practices including conservation tillage or irrigation a primary assumption inherent in our analysis is that a clear physical basis and understanding exists concerning the mechanisms which result in the nonstationary process under consideration thus our study does not answer the question of whether or not to employ a stationary or nonstationary analysis but rather we assume that the flood drought or other hydrologic series of interest is known to exhibit nonstationary behavior which can be represented in the form of a mathematical model our analysis then attempts to evaluate a number of different approaches for estimation of a relatively simple and important statistic the current mean i e the conditional mean of that nonstationary hydrologic process here we consider a very simple nonstationary model a linear regression model and a very simple statistic conditional mean as opposed to estimating an extreme quantile under more complex nonstationary conditions consider the very common problem in which a hydrologic record of annual maximum or minimum streamflow is available which has been subject to change due to known urbanization processes in such situations the mean annual flood maf along with all other associated hydrologic statistics such as the t year design event will change over time thus an important and common question which forms the basis of this study is how to update the maf or other hydrologic statistic such as the t year design event to reflect current conditions serago and vogel 2018 blum et al 2019 hecht and vogel 2020 when nonstationary processes are known apriori to govern hydrologic behavior our central goal is to examine the level of model and associated estimation complexity needed to update the mean of a hydrologic process to reflect current conditions a natural tradeoff exists between the level of complexity and the reliability of the estimator to be employed this tradeoff involves an understanding of the relationship between the sampling properties i e bias and mean square error associated with various estimators of the design statistic of interest and the sample size and significance level or goodness of fit associated with the fitted nonstationary model under consideration the central challenge addressed by this study involves the appropriate level of complexity associated with the estimator of a hydrologic design event when the hydrologic process under consideration is known to exhibit nonstationary behavior this question is likely to remain an open question for some time to come as evidenced from the recent findings of o brien and burn 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 yu and stedinger 2018 and serinaldi et al 2018 in a careful comparison of the precision uncertainty associated with various estimates of design flood events using both stationary and nonstationary methods luke et al 2017 found that stationary methods were nearly always preferred over nonstationary approaches here we further explore this hypothesis 1 2 on the need for parsimonious models serago and vogel section 2 2018 review the fundamental virtues of most widely accepted methods of sffa which relate to their proven properties of robustness resistance and efficiency all of which stem from the principle of parsimony and all of which have been given little or no attention in the area of nffa it has long been known that efficient low mse estimators also tend to be parsimonious box and jenkins 1976 a parsimonious estimator is one that accomplishes a desired level of prediction efficiency with as few model parameters as possible serago and vogel section 2 2018 document clear evidence of the value of parsimonious models in both sffa kuczera 1982 slack et al 1975 lu and stedinger 1992 laio et al 2009 and di baldassarre et al 2009 and nffa serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 and yu and stedinger 2018 serago and vogel 2018 and others provide extensive evidence of the value of parsimony in sffa and after the three recent studies by serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 and yu and stedinger 2018 we expect the principle of parsimony to play an increasing and equally important role in nffa the primary goal of this study is to contrast the general performance in terms of robustness and efficiency of various estimators of the conditional mean with an emphasis on nonstationary conditions 1 3 use of a subset of historical record to reflect current watershed conditions estimation of streamflow statistics which reflect current watershed conditions is challenging under nonstationary conditions due to the ever present and natural stochastic aspect of streamflow combined with the fact that historical streamflow records may not be representative of current watershed conditions if environmental conditions are changing under nonstationary conditions multiple anthropogenic impacts often occur simultaneously making it very difficult to attribute and model changes in streamflow as a function of climate land use water use and or other watershed characteristics hirsch 2011 allaire et al 2015 as an alternative to the development of a predictive model of streamflow some authors have suggested using a recent subset of the streamflow record that better reflects current conditions at a site than the entire historical record riggs 1972 gebert et al 2016 blum et al 2019 for example in an evaluation of the relationship between magnitude and frequency of low flows for 15 basins in wisconsin gebert et al 2016 recommended use of the 1969 2008 period for determining current streamflow characteristics for design and compliance purposes because that period was shown to represent current land use and climatic condition and was generally free of trends and thus could be considered approximately stationary similarly riggs 1972 suggests that i f the pattern of regulation of a stream has been consistent for several years and is expected to continue so low flow frequency curves based on the record for those years may be useful blum et al 2019 considered estimation of the 7 day 10 year low flow statistic 7q10 under nonstationary conditions blum et al 2019 performed monte carlo experiments to evaluate the performance of a stationary nonparametric quantile estimator applied to a recent subset of the nonstationary annual minimum flow record in comparison with using the complete historical flow record they found that a nonparametric stationary quantile estimator fit using the most recent 30 or 50 years of a 75 year record led to improved accuracy and reduced bias of 7q10 estimators when compared to using the entire flow record under nonstationary conditions this study takes an analogous approach with the goal of obtaining more general conclusions concerning the value of using the sample mean of a subset of the recent observed record which we term the fractional mean fm as compared to a more traditional nonstationary regression model estimator of the mean streamflow which we term rm or employing the entire historical record which we term sm 2 methodology 2 1 theoretical background and estimators to enable us to develop general recommendation regarding the behavior of various hydrologic statistics under nonstationary conditions in this initial study we only consider estimation of the current mean defined as the mean under current conditions under stationary conditions a true mean exists or in other words the current mean is always the true mean however the central focus of this work is on nonstationary conditions in which case we define the current mean as the conditional mean under current watershed conditions although estimation of the mean may seem trivial compared with other statistics nearly all sffa and nffa methods begin with estimation of the mean consider the problem of fitting a nonstationary pdf to a series of annual maximum floods amf denoted by x or its natural logarithm y any application of either sffa or nffa will typically involve estimation of the mean of either x or y or both depending on which pdf estimation method is used our results are general and apply to the mean μ z of any variable z regardless of its pdf in this section we introduce several estimators of μ z suitable for nffa an example of the importance of estimation of the mean would be in low flow frequency analysis when the annual minimum 7 day low flows follow a lognormal distribution in that case the widely used 7 day 2 year low flow statistic is simply the mean of the logarithms of the annual minimum 7 day flows 2 2 conditional mean of a nonstationary hydrologic process most existing approaches to nffa summarized in review articles by khaliq et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 kiang et al 2011 salas et al 2012 madsen et al 2013 ehret et al 2014 hall et al 2014 bayazit 2015 salas et al 2018 and francois et al 2019 involve fitting pdfs whose parameters and or moments are related to exogenous variables which are in turn are related to drivers of nonstationary behavior here we relate streamflow to an exogenous variable using a bivariate regression model 1 z μ z β w μ w ε where z and μ z represent the streamflow variable of interest and its unconditional mean respectively w and μ w represent an explanatory variable and its mean respectively β is the trend slope coefficient and ε is model error which is assumed to have zero mean and constant variance with σ ε 2 σ z 2 1 ρ 2 where ρ denotes the pearson correlation coefficient between zand w the model in 1 is not limited to linear relationships because a wide range of monotonic non linear functions can be linearized with transformations such as tukey s ladder of powers helsel et al 2020 enabling the application of a variety of linear regression methods for fitting highly nonlinear relationships in addition to the ability to model nonlinear trends there are numerous other advantages of regression methods outlined by serago and vogel 2018 including rigorous graphical displays parsimony prediction intervals associated with trend extrapolations accommodation of complex multivariate relationships and an ability to account for missing observations abrupt changes and the impact of stochastic persistence the streamflow variable z could be a series of streamflows x their natural logarithms y or some other suitable transformation here we emphasize that the unconditional mean μ z is of little value to nffa because it does not generally exist for a nonstationary process though it can be interpreted as the conditional mean of z when w μ w the model error term ε in 1 is often treated as an independent and identically distributed random variable in spite of our now widespread knowledge that some hydrologic processes exhibit heteroscedasticity hecht and vogel 2020 stochastic persistence and possibly deterministic trends cohn and lins 2005 ignoring stochastic persistence in 1 when it exists would lead to incorrect statistical inference concerning the variance of the estimators of the model parameters β and μ z issues central to this study matalas and sankarasubramanian 2003 provide approximations to the inflation in the variance associated with estimators of β in 1 when ε arises from markov arma 1 1 and fractional gaussian noise stochastic processes however it is extremely difficult to identify such higher order stochastic persistence structures in typical hydrologic records see examples in vogel et al 1998 thus in this initial study we assume that ε arises from a serially independent stochastic process and we encourage future investigators to employ the results of matalas and sankarasubramanian 2003 to extend the analysis which follows the regression coefficient β in 1 is defined by 2 β ρ σ z σ w where σ z and σ w denote the standard deviation of z and w respectively the conditional mean is the expected value of z conditioned upon w denoted μ z w and is obtained by taking the expectation of 1 to obtain 3 μ z w μ z β w μ w because e ε 0 see serago and vogel 2018 for the derivation of other conditional moments of regression in 1 numerous authors have employed a regression model of the form given in 3 in nffa for example vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2014 and brady et al 2019 found 1 with z equal to the logarithm of the annual maximum flood amf series and w equal to time to be useful for modeling flood series at hundreds of rivers in the u s and the u k regardless of whether or not trends exist we highlight the multilevel or panel version of 1 employed by brady et al 2019 which accounts for interactions among sites in a region in a bayesian framework hirsch and ryberg 2012 used 1 to relate the natural log of amf series at 200 long term rivers in the us to the covariate w equal to carbon dioxide concentrations we emphasize that the form of the regression model in 1 and 2 makes no assumption regarding the pdf of z 2 3 regression estimator of conditional mean rm a regression estimator of the conditional mean μ z w termed rm may be obtained using ordinary least squares estimators in which case 4 r m z β w w where β ρ σ z σ w ρ r i 1 n w i w z i z i 1 n w i w 2 i 1 n z i z 2 σ z 1 n 1 i 1 n z i z 2 z 1 n i 1 n z i σ w 1 n 1 i 1 n w i w 2 w 1 n i 1 n w i as is standard practice hats over greek symbols are used to denote sample estimators the correlation estimator ρ r is the common pearson correlation coefficient estimator see barber et al 2019 we consider the special case in which the explanatory variable w is time which is not a random variable for this case with no missing observations prosdocimi et al 2014 appendix a3 derive expressions for the sample mean and variance of w time given by w n 1 2 and σ w 2 n n 1 12 where w 1 2 n we are interested in estimating the current mean defined as the conditional mean when w n 2 4 the fractional sample mean fm and sample mean sm suppose a record of streamflow is available over the past n years which is known to exhibit nonstationary behavior due to known deterministic effects and guidance exists for selecting a subset of the entire record which best represents current watershed conditions consider as an alternative to the rm a fractional mean estimator fm which is simply the sample mean of the most recent n f years of record where f denotes the fraction of the most recent record of n observations which represents current watershed conditions a fractional mean estimator fm based on a sample z 1 z 2 z n nf z n nf 1 zn is defined as 5 fm 1 n f i 1 n f z n n f i note that the sample mean of the entire historical record z defined in 4 and referred to hereafter as sm is a special case of the fm when f 1 we derive an optimal fractional mean estimator fm which employs 5 with an optimal fraction f termed f derived in the next section as that value of f which leads to a minimum mse of the fm estimator for example suppose a sample of length n 50 is available and one has knowledge that the last n f 30 years are representative of current watershed conditions thus f 30 50 0 6 and fm in 5 would be simply the sample mean of the last 30 values of z 2 5 the attained significance level of a regression model in addition to having solid physical evidence corresponding to the causative mechanisms for a trend in a hydrologic process investigators often augment such physical knowledge with a hypothesis test associated with the estimated regression slope based on hydrologic measurements this is in spite of the numerous concerns over null hypothesis significance testing summarized by vogel et al 2013 serinaldi et al 2018 and others cited therein normally a critical significance level α of say 0 05 is assumed and then an attained significance level p is computed from the data which indicates the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis of no trend β 0 is rejected we assume that one has good physical evidence of the direction of the trend if it exists thus the sign of the alternative hypothesis would be either β 0 or β 0 in which case if the attained significance level p α one should have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and thus support the alternative nonstationary analysis assuming the regression model residuals are normally distributed the attained significance level p for such a one sided test can be computed from see helsel et al 2020 6 p 1 p t n 2 ρ n 2 1 ρ 2 where p denotes the cumulative probability operator and t n 2 represents a students t variate with n 2 degrees of freedom we express the attained significance level p in 6 as a function of the true correlation ρ rather than a sample estimator as is typical in hypothesis testing instead we are only employing this relationship for the purpose of integrating the impact of both sample size and correlation on resulting attained significance levels given concerns raised earlier in section 1 1 as well as the fact that the hypothesis test in 6 does not account for the inflation in variance of the β estimator due to possible stochastic persistence associated with the model errors ε in 1 we do not advocate the use of this or other hypothesis tests to evaluate whether to perform a sffa or nffa in addition to those concerns the result of such tests do not provide critical information concerning the robustness or efficiency of the resulting estimators rm and fm in 4 and 5 respectively instead we employ the attained significance level p in 6 in later comparisons as a metric which measures the impact of both sample size n and correlation coefficient ρ thus reducing the dimensionality of our comparative assessments 2 6 comparisons among estimators of the condional mean if an estimator θ 1 is more efficient than θ 2 the estimator θ 1 will yield a better estimate of the statistic θ than θ 2 the notion of a better estimator of a statistic relies upon the choice of a loss function corresponding to the problem of interest where a loss function quantifies the relative economic and other losses associated with estimation errors among statisticians the most common choice of the form of a loss function is quadratic resulting in the mean squared error mse criterion of optimality see everitt 2002 page 128 one can define the efficiency of the estimator θ 1 relative to the estimator θ 2 using 7 eff θ 1 θ 2 e θ 2 θ 2 e θ 1 θ 2 mse θ 2 mse θ 1 where mse denotes mean square error in general when e f f θ 1 θ 2 1 the estimator θ 1 is said to be more efficient than θ 2 and is thus preferred over the estimator θ 2 for estimation of θ it is well known that the mse variance and bias of an estimator are related via mse θ e θ θ 2 e θ θ 2 e θ e θ 2 bias θ 2 var θ so that an unbiased estimator has mse equal to its variance thus if both estimators are unbiased then the efficiency in 7 reduces to the ratio of the variances of both estimators to enable comparisons among estimators under both stationary and nonstationary conditions using the concept of efficiency in 7 we derive analytical expressions for the bias variance and mse of the estimators in the following sections 2 7 mse of estimators under stationary conditions under stationary conditions the current mean is equal to μ z which does not change over time and both ρ 0 and β 0 in eqs 1 3 under stationary conditions rm sm and fm are unbiased estimators of the true mean regardless of the value of f thus their mse is made up entirely of their variance so that for any independent and identically distributed series of potentially transformed streamflows z 8 mse s fm var s fm σ z 2 n f with the subscript s denoting stationary conditions helsel et al 2020 report the variance of a regression estimator of the mean in the current year n which can be combined with the mean and standard deviation of w given in 4 to obtain 9 mse s rm var s rm σ z 2 1 ρ 2 1 n n w 2 n σ w 2 σ z 2 1 n n n 1 2 2 n n n 1 12 since under stationary conditions ρ 0 2 8 mse of estimators under nonstationary conditions we focus on the current mean in year n w n which would reflect current conditions at the end of the streamflow record under nonstationary conditions the current mean is equal to the conditional mean of z in year n denoted μ z w n in which case rm is unbiased but fm and thus sm will always be biased regardless of the value of f unless n f 1 one can rewrite the expression for fm in 5 using the regression model for z given in 1 which leads to the bias of fm under nonstationary conditions 10 bia s ns fm e fm μ z w n e 1 nf i 1 nf μ z β n nf i n 1 2 ε i μ z β n n 1 2 β 1 nf 2 where the subscript ns denotes nonstationary conditions eq 10 results from the fact that e i 1 n f i n f 1 n f 2 and e ε 0 for a given sample size n the bias in fm increases as both β and f increase under nonstationary conditions each observation z is defined in 1 as z μ z β w μ w ε noting that the first two terms are not random variables thus var z var ε so that varns fm vars fm in eq 8 so that the mse of the fractional mean is given by the sum of its bias squared and its variance 11a mse ns fm β 1 n f 2 2 σ z 2 1 ρ 2 n f

2 1 n n w 2 n σ w 2 σ z 2 1 ρ 2 1 n n n 1 2 2 n n n 1 12 2 9 the optimal fractional sample mean fm here we introduce an optimal fractional mean denoted fm as that value of fm which exhibits minimum mse under nonstationary conditions this is accomplished by deriving the optimal fraction f denoted f for which msens fm is minimized the function msens fm given in 11 is minimized with respect to f by setting its first derivative equal to zero m s e n s f m f 0 and solving the resulting expression for ρ the resulting optimal value of f termed f can be computed from 13 ρ n 1 6 f 2 n f n 1 n 1 when the optimal fraction f is substituted into the estimator fm given in 5 we obtain the optimal fractional mean estimator fm given by 14 fm 1 n f i 1 n f z n n f i fm has the unique property under nonstationary conditions of yielding an estimator of the sample mean with both minimum mse as well as maximum efficiency relative to the regression estimator of the mean rm as long as the correlation is known monte carlo experiments are performed to evaluate the sampling properties of fm when the correlation is unknown 3 results we use the expressions for mse and efficiency derived in the previous section to evaluate the general conditions under which one can expect fm to exhibit greater efficiency than either the sample mean sm fm with f 1 or the regression estimator rm under stationary and nonstationary conditions all previous derived theoretical expressions for bias mse and efficiency of the various estimators are a function of the sample size n and the population correlation ρ all such analytical theoretical expressions for rm were derived assuming that in practice an estimate of ρ is obtained from the pearson correlation coefficient estimator r given in 4 since an estimate of ρ is also needed to implement fm and we could not obtain analytical results for its bias mse or efficiency when an estimate of ρ is used monte carlo experiments are performed to consider the additional uncertainty associated with fm resulting from the necessity to estimate ρ 3 1 results stationary conditions unlike nonstationary conditions under stationary conditions a true mean exists and a comparison among the estimators sm fm fm and rm is relatively simple because they are all unbiased so their efficiency defined in 7 reduces to the ratio of their variances for example the efficiency of the sample mean sm relative to the fractional mean fm is equal to 1 f which we denote as e f f s m f m 1 f so that under stationary conditions sm is always more efficient than fm because if f 1 then eff sm fm 1 the efficiency of fm relative to rm under stationary conditions denoted as eff fm rm is obtained by substitution of eqs 8 and 9 into 7 which can be simplified to 15 eff fm rm f 4 n 2 5 n 3 n n 1 because under stationary conditions the correlation coefficient ρ 0 fig 1 summarizes the efficiency of fm relative to rm under stationary conditions and also enables us to make a general efficiency comparison between fm fm rm and sm perhaps the most interesting result in fig 1 involves the efficiency of sm relative to rm which corresponds to the value of eff fm rm when f 1 the range of efficiencies of sm over rm correspond approximately to 3 eff sm rm 4 for 10 n 100 so under stationary conditions sm will yield estimators of the mean with 3 4 times lower mse than rm even though both estimators are unbiased under those conditions this result dramatizes the influence of the added uncertainty associated with rm over sm resulting from having to estimate the regression slope β as expected fig 1 also illustrates that under stationary conditions sm is always preferred over fm for f 1 regardless of the value of n thus under those conditions sm is also always preferred over fm for f 1 fig 1 also illustrates that fm is nearly always preferred over rm for values of f in excess of approximately 0 3 as is shown later on the optimal fractional mean fm usually employs values of f significantly greater than 0 3 thus fm will usually be preferred over rm under stationary conditions these findings are analogous to some early flood frequency studies which documented the general conditions under which an at site estimator is to be preferred over one based on the use of a regional regression model hebson and cunanne 1987 in summary under stationary conditions and f 1 sm is generally preferred to all other estimators considered followed by fm with f 1 which is generally preferred to rm note that the gains in efficiency reported in fig 1 of sm over fm and of sm over rm are often rather considerable and emphasize the need to employ stationary methods when stationary behavior cannot be rejected on the basis of a deterministic analysis as discussed in section 1 1 under nonstationary conditions this ranking among the estimators is more complex and very different highlighting the need to consider both stationary and nonstationary conditions in any hydrologic frequency analysis as emphasized by vogel et al 2013 rosner et al 2014 and salas et al 2018 3 2 results nonstationary conditions rm fm and sm under nonstationary conditions a true mean does not exist and instead the mean is changing over time unlike the stationary case when all the estimators sm fm fm and rm were unbiased under nonstationary conditions only rm is unbiased and only when the true nonstationary model in 1 is known as is assumed here the bias associated with both fm and sm can be evaluated using 10 noting that when f 1 fm reduces to sm in general the sign of the bias associated with fm will depend on the sign of the slope coefficient β for positive negative trends e fm will generally be smaller larger than its true value with that bias increasing as both f and n increase we begin by exploring eff sm rm as a function of ρ and n in fig 2 for nonstationary conditions which is obtained by combining 7 with 11 assuming f 1 and 12 also shown in fig 2 are conditions of mse equivalence among the two estimators which occurs when eff sm rm 1 i e mse of sm is equal to the mse of rm fig 2 illustrates that for very small values of ρ sm is generally preferred over rm in contrast we note that for larger values of ρ rm exhibits much lower mse than sm clearly the values of n and ρ are of considerable importance in understanding the advantages of rm over sm and vice versa to understand the behavior of eff sm rm more fully fig 3 superimposes the relationship between n ρ and the attained significance level p given in 6 over the relationship between eff sm rm n and ρ given by substitution of 11 with f 1 and 12 into 7 for the cases when eff sm rm 1 and when eff sm rm 1 2 note that the condition eff sm rm 1 2 in fig 3 implies that rm is preferred over sm because under those conditions rm has twice the information content or half the variance of sm values of p were adjusted until both of the superimposed relationships in fig 3 roughly line up with each other the important result in fig 3 is that under nonstationary conditions mse equivalence between rm and sm eff sm rm 1 occurs when the attained significance level associated with the fitted regression is approximately equal to 17 this result emphasizes that the estimator rm will have lower mse than sm when the attained significance level is below about 17 it is common practice to choose the regression estimator rm over the sm when significance levels are below 5 or 10 fig 3 illustrates that use of a 5 or 10 level test as is common practice corresponds to conditions under which rm will have considerably more information than sm thus perhaps a higher significance level roughly 17 may be a more appropriate significance threshold in practice 3 3 results nonstationary conditions optimal fractional mean fm the critical question addressed in this section is whether or not a sample mean of an optimal subset of the historical record can be used to improve upon the performance of rm under nonstationary conditions we begin by illustrating the peaked nature of the relationship between eff fm rm and f in fig 4 a which was constructed by combining 7 with 11 and 12 for the cases when ρ 0 2 and n 10 25 and 100 values close to those typically encountered in practice we note that for a given information content associated with the historical record as evidenced by the combined values of n and ρ there always exists a maximum value of eff fm rm corresponding to a single optimal value of f which we term f for values of f either greater or less than f there is a decrease in eff fm rm fig 4a shows that for ρ 0 2 and n 25 any fm estimator with 0 3 f 0 95 is more efficient than rm the general relationship between the optimal fraction f and values of n and ρ given in 13 is illustrated in fig 4b fig 5 a displays the efficiency of fm relative to rm as a function of ρ and n under nonstationary conditions computed by combining 7 with 11 and 12 with the optimal value f computed from 13 fig 5a shows that for the cases when n 10 and n 100 correlations in excess of about 0 5 and 0 2 are needed respectively for rm to have a lower mse than fm this is an important result because correlations of trend models for common hydrologic series typically exhibit relatively low correlations often in the range in which fm is likely to have lower mse than rm rather than citing examples of typical reported trend correlations this issue is explored further below using attained significance levels which combine the impact of both sample size and the magnitude of the correlation coefficient in section 4 0 we report results from a study by douglas et al 2000 which documents the range of attained significance levels observed in practice for both flood and low streamflows fig 5a also indicates that the efficiency of fm relative to rm becomes extremely large as ρ approaches zero because under those conditions fm approaches sm and f 1 as shown in fig 4b in which case sm has a much lower mse than rm as was shown earlier in fig 2 fig 5a is important because it shows that even though rm is an unbiased estimator under nonstationary conditions fm and even sm both have much lower mse than rm when ρ approaches zero due to added uncertainty associated with having to estimate the slope coefficient β we conclude that the values of both ρ and n are central to determining how much better fm and sm are compared to rm under nonstationary conditions fig 5b illustrates the efficiency of fm relative to sm as a function of both ρ and n which documents the considerable gains in efficiency of fm over sm as both n and ρ increase we conclude from fig 5b that fm is always an improvement over sm under nonstationary conditions perhaps our most important practical result is illustrated in fig 6 which is analogous to fig 3 because it was constructed by superimposing the relationship between n ρ and p given in 6 over the relationship between eff fm rm n and ρ given by substitution of 11 with f given in 13 and 12 into 7 the important result in fig 6 is that mse equivalence between fm and rm occurs approximately when the attained significance level associated with the fitted regression is equal to approximately 5 fig 6 also reports conditions when eff fm rm 1 2 which implies that rm is preferred over fm because under those conditions rm has twice the information content or half the variance of fm interestingly even though both rm and fm are designed to perform well under nonstationary conditions rm is generally dominated by fm unless significance levels are below 0 05 this result emphasizes that for rm to have clear advantages over fm would require attained significance levels considerably lower than 5 3 4 impact of uncertainty in estimation of ρ on msens fm until now we have assumed knowledge of the true correlation ρ in this section we consider the ramifications of having to estimate ρ using the common pearson correlation coefficient estimator denoted r barber et al 2019 provide a recent review of literature on estimation of ρ for skewed hydrologic processes our theoretical derivation of msens fm computed by combining 7 with 11 and 12 with the optimal value f computed from 13 ignores uncertainty associated with the estimator of ρ needed to estimate f in fm monte carlo experiments are performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainty in the ρ estimator which in turn is needed to compute f fm and finally msens fm simulation of uncertainty associated with an estimate of ρ denoted r is implemented using an approximation to what is termed the non null sampling distribution of r which describes the distribution of r when the regression model in 1 governs fisher 1915 1921 first introduced exact expressions for the non null sampling distribution of r for large and small samples due to their numerical complexity numerous approximations have been introduced over the years we employ kraemers 1973 approximation who showed that if r is an estimator of the correlation coefficient based on a sample of n observations drawn from a bivariate normal distribution with correlation coefficient ρ then the statistic 16 t r ρ n 2 1 r 2 1 ρ 2 t n 2 is approximately distributed as students t with n 2 degrees of freedom using 16 we generate 10 000 values of r corresponding to a wide range of values of ρ for the two cases n 25 and n 100 for each true value of ρ considered the 10 000 generated values of r are used to estimate 10 000 values of f which are then used to compute 10 000 values of eff fm rm fig 7 compares the mean or steady state value of eff fm rm from those monte carlo experiments with the theoretical value of eff fm rm which ignores uncertainty in our estimator of f plotted earlier in fig 5a interestingly for large samples i e n 100 the approximate analytical and exact monte carlo results are in very good agreement especially for values of ρ in excess of about 0 2 for smaller samples accounting for uncertainty in the estimator of f leads to slightly lower efficiencies eff fm rm than expected on the basis of our analytical results additional monte carlo experiments are needed to formulate more general conclusions for a wider range of conditions 4 discussion we have shown that the decision as to which estimator of the conditional mean to use can be expressed as a function of the attained significance level p which in turn is a complex function of the explanatory power of the trend and sample size as summarized by the values of ρ and n respectively if the monte carlo and analytical results in fig 7 were in exact agreement our analytical results would yield both exact and general decision rules regarding which estimator of the conditional mean to apply for a given observed value of attained significance level when the true nonstationary model is known however given the results in fig 7 the resulting decision rules are only approximate yet still could be quite useful in practice fig 7 documents that our decision rules are only approximate for small values of n and ρ yet are nearly exact for larger values the approximate decision rules concerning the application of the three estimators of the conditional mean sm fm and rm can be summarized as follows 1 under stationary conditions all three estimators are unbiased but sm is always preferred because it exhibits the lowest variance and thus the lowest mse followed by fm with f 1 which is generally preferred to rm 2 under nonstationary conditions rm is the only unbiased estimator considered and the attained significance level p approximates which estimator is preferred when p 0 05 rm is generally preferred and when p 0 05 fm is generally preferred over rm when p 0 17 rm is generally preferred to sm our results indicate that the decision as to whether to employ rm fm or sm under nonstationary conditions depends critically upon the attained significance levels associated with the trend in the range of p 0 17 such values of attained significance levels are commonplace in trend assessments concerning hydrologic series for example in a national study of trends in low flow and flood flow discharges at unregulated watersheds across the u s over a 50 year period douglas et al 2000 table 2 found attained significance levels for low flow trends having a mean of 0 132 and a range from 0 007 to 0 429 and for flood flow trends a mean of 0 264 and a range from 0 035 to 0 386 it is important to note that our results assume full knowledge of the true underlying structure of the nonstationary model naturally in practice one would not know a priori the form of the nonstationary trend model nor the form of any stochastic persistence present in the streamflow observations such knowledge may be critical in practice thus future experiments are needed to evaluate the robustness of our findings under 1 different nonstationary model structures 2 possible heteroscedasticity of the model residuals see hecht and vogel 2020 and 3 different forms of stochastic persistence 5 conclusions there is a constant evolution of the field of hydrologic frequency analysis hfa serago and vogel 2018 section 2 reviewed early developments in hfa in the 1970 s and 1980 s which led to the widespread appreciation of the superiority of and need for parsimonious estimators for use in sffa because they generally yield more efficient estimators of design event quantiles than more complex models in spite of the tremendous increase in the literature on nffa we could only find a few studies which have documented the value of parsimonious estimators such as the fm estimator introduced here the findings of this study along with recent work by serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 and yu and stedinger 2018 provide substantial support for understanding and promoting the value of parsimonious estimators in nffa this study is the first effort to develop a general decision rule concerning which estimator of a conditional mean to employ under nonstationary conditions we have compared the performance of three estimators of the conditional mean fm sm and rm the estimator sm is the most parsimonious estimator of the mean possible because it is nonparametric and requires no parameters in contrast fm and rm are both parametric estimators because fm requires an estimate of f the optimal fraction of the most recent record to employ and rm requires an estimate of both μ z and β regression model parameters we emphasize that we have only considered relatively parsimonious estimators of a conditional mean in contrast to the much more complex and much less parsimonious estimators normally recommended see reviews by khaliq et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 kiang et al 2011 salas et al 2012 madsen et al 2013 hall et al 2014 bayazit 2015 salas et al 2018 and francois et al 2019 we outlined numerous advantages of fm over both rm and sm under nonstationary conditions and if we had considered less parsimonious models of the type often recommended we anticipate the advantages of fm would appear even greater than those outlined here this study takes a different approach then most previous studies which only use the attained significance level p to decide whether or not to perform a nonstationary analysis the result of a hypothesis test i e attained significance level does not provide the critical information needed concerning the robustness or efficiency of the estimators under consideration instead our approach was to relate the attained significance level to the performance of the various estimators in terms of their bias variance and mean square error mse we have shown that the decision whether to employ rm fm or sm under nonstationary conditions depends critically upon the attained significance levels associated with the trend in the range of p 0 17 we have derived analytical expressions for the mse of sm as well as the nonstationary estimators of the conditional mean fm and rm and used those expressions to arrive at the following general conclusions under stationary conditions a true fixed mean exists and sm is always preferred to all other estimators considered followed by fm with f 1 which is generally preferred to rm the gains in efficiency of sm over fm and of sm over rm are often rather considerable and emphasize the need to employ stationary methods when conditions are known to be stationary as determined from a deterministic analysis see section 1 1 under nonstationary conditions no fixed or true mean exists thus we evaluate estimators of the current or conditional mean at the end of the historical record here the ranking among the estimators is more complex and very different than under stationary conditions highlighting the need to consider both stationary and nonstationary conditions in any hydrologic frequency analysis as emphasized by vogel et al 2013 rosner et al 2014 and salas et al 2018 under nonstationary conditions and very small values of the correlation coefficient ρ sm is generally preferred over rm whereas in contrast for larger values of ρ rm exhibits much lower mse than sm in addition to apriori having a solid physical basis for performing a nonstationary analysis the values of sample size n and correlation coefficient ρ are of considerable importance in deciding which estimator to implement this is because estimator rm will only have a lower mse than sm when the attained significance level is below about 17 thus use of a 5 level test as is often done in practice may be misleading interestingly over the range of typical sample sizes n 10 to n 100 correlations in excess of about 0 5 and 0 2 are needed respectively for rm to have lower mse than fm this is an important result because correlations of trend models for common hydrologic series exhibit relatively low correlations often in the range in which fm is likely to have lower mse than rm even though rm is an unbiased estimator under nonstationary conditions when the true model is known both sm and fm have lower mse than rm when ρ approaches zero due to added uncertainty associated with having to estimate the slope parameter β in general fm is always an improvement over sm under nonstationary conditions and is generally an improvement over rm as well when the attained significance level is above about 5 the above conclusions contrasting the behavior of rm and sm are quite rigorous general and complete because our analytical derivations consider the sampling variability of the estimators of β to account for sampling variability in estimators of ρ needed to estimate f in fm it was necessary to resort to a monte carlo simulation to more fully evaluate eff fm rm those experiments indicated only slight reductions in eff fm rm compared to our analytical results those reductions in efficiency mostly occur for smaller sample sizes and are due to the need to estimate ρ additional monte carlo experiments are needed to formulate more general conclusions under a wider range of conditions our theoretical analysis assumes full knowledge of the structure of the nonstationary model monte carlo robustness experiments are needed to evaluate the performance of the various estimators considered when the true nonstationary model is unknown our results are all based on the assumption that the nonstationary regression model in 1 holds with independent homoscedastic and normally distributed residuals while this assumption has been shown to be plausible on the basis of continental analyses of hundreds of annual maximum flood series vogel et al 2011 and prosdocimi et al 2014 there is also good evidence that such series may also exhibit heteroscedasticity hecht and vogel 2020 as well as various forms of both short and long term stochastic persistence which can easily be confused or interpreted as deterministic trends cohn and lins 2005 and koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 a natural extension to this study would consider the impact of short and long term stochastic persistence within the context of the regression in 1 by using the results from matalas and sankarasubramanian 2003 for ar 1 arma 1 1 and

434,uncertainties related to permeability heterogeneity can be estimated using geostatistical simulation methods usually these methods are applied on regular grids with cells of constant size whereas unstructured grids are more flexible to honor geological structures and offer local refinements for fluid flow simulations however cells of different sizes require to account for the support dependency of permeability statistics support effect this paper presents a novel workflow based on the power averaging technique the averaging exponent ω is estimated using a response surface calibrated from numerical upscaling experiments using spectral turning bands permeability is simulated on points in each unstructured cell and later averaged with a local value of ω that depends on the cell size and shape the method is illustrated on a synthetic case the simulation of a tracer experiment is used to compare this novel geostatistical simulation method with a conventional approach based on a fine scale cartesian grid the results show the consistency of both the simulated permeability fields and the tracer breakthrough curves the computational cost is much lower than the conventional approach based on a pressure solver upscaling keywords upscaling permeability geostatistics power averaging 1 introduction subsurface phenomena cannot be observed directly due to scale issues and inaccessibility in hydrogeology the high spatial variability of rock types and the associated permeability field as well as the high spatial and temporal variability of fluid types and displacements is a main source of uncertainties estimating these uncertainties is particularly important in a context of engineering design and decision making examples of applications include the management of over exploited aquifers or the propagation of dangerous contaminants de marsily et al 1998 similar uncertainty issues coupled with decision making are encountered in other applied geoscience engineering such as oil and gas industry preux 2016 co2 storage in aquifers michael et al 2010 akhurst et al 2015 or geothermal energy production vogt et al 2010 quinlivan et al 2015 witter et al 2019 this paper focuses on the spatial modeling of permeability fields due to rock heterogeneity a measurement at point support is not sufficient to determine accurately the value at another point to assess the uncertainty related to this problem one can employ geostatistical simulation methods deutsch and journel 1992 goovaerts 1997 chilès and delfiner 2012 to represent the spatial variability and to solve numerically the flow and transport equations a mesh is used and its cells are populated with petrophysical properties classical meshes widely known as regular structured or cartesian grids are composed of hexahedral cells in three dimensions the interesting aspect of regular structured grids is that their cells all share the same size depending on the type of numerical methods employed to solve the flow problem other types of grids exist some tools use irregular structured grids also called corner point or stratigraphic grids obtained by distorting hexahedra to follow more faithfully geological layers regular and irregular structured grids are practical for the rapidity of calculation but they present some drawbacks some cells can be degenerated for high thickness variations the geometry of the intersections between faults or wells and the geological structure are approximated and corner point regular grids lack spatial adaptivity to honor local complex features of the parameter field to address these issues unstructured grids can be used each vertex can have a different number of neighbors and the cell s sizes can vary indeed the areas of the grid that present more interest or stronger variations for flow estimations can be refined and other parts coarsened prévost et al 1996 usually to minimize numerical errors the grid is refined around wells or faults but it can also be optimized based on flow patterns mlacnik et al 2003 in addition the cells can have various shapes such as tetrahedron or voronoï polyhedron offering more flexibility to adapt to geological heterogeneity blessent et al 2011 merland et al 2014 however unstructured grids brings an additional difficulty for geostatistical simulations indeed the statistics of the permeability and of the other variables are support dependent i e in stationary settings smaller cells tend to have a smaller internal variability and larger inter cell variability this support effect is well documented both theoretically and experimentally matheron 1967 dagan 1993 tidwell and wilson 1997 the probability distribution function of the permeability is different for cells of different volumes as well as the spatial correlation intuitively small cells will follow the geostatistical properties defined at the point support scale keeping their local average and covariance in opposition for very large blocks having a size greater than the underlying integral scale the associated permeability value may be shown to stabilize to the so called effective permeability that is the self averaging property boschan and noetinger 2012 nœtinger and gautier 1998 noetinger and zargar 2004 it highlights the role of the interaction between the geometry and size of the block and the integral scale that may characterize the internal structure of the aquifer if these support effects are not accounted for the simulation of the petrophysical variables can result in distorted and possibly wrong fluid paths it is therefore crucial to use appropriate geostatistical methods for unstructured grids and incidently for structured corner point grids in which cell volumes vary significantly see bertoncello et al 2008 the simplest approach to account for the support effect is to simulate the properties on a fine scale grid using a geostatistical model defined at measurement support in a second step this grid is overlaid by the unstructured grid of interest the values on the large cells are computed by averaging the values contained in this cell on the fine scale grid e g caumon et al 2005 durlofsky 2005 however modeling the domain of interest at measurement support typically a few cubic centimeter for petrophysical core measurements is particularly challenging to bypass this problem a solution is to simulate directly the property on the unstructured grid accounting for support effect but a second challenge arises because permeability is not additive a property is said to be additive porosity for example when the averaging can be carried out using a weighted arithmetic mean this is possible because quantities of the underlying physical property can be added together in a meaningful manner for example volumes of pores in two parts of a sample can be added together to produce the total volume of pores in the sample for additive properties some direct geostatistical simulation methods accounting for support effect exist they are based on the analytical or numerical estimation of the covariance between data points and cells of different support and geometries among the existing methods the discrete gaussian model or dgm matheron 1976 has been investigated and implemented by emery and ortiz 2011 and zaytsev et al 2015 another possible method is the direct sequential simulation or dss deutsch et al 2002 in all cases the covariance values vary depending on the cell s volumes however permeability is not additive one cannot simply average it using simple summations instead a pressure solver or some approximations must be used renard and de marsily 1997 manchuk et al 2012 khan and dawson 2004 and the geostatistical methods cited above cannot be directly applied the aim of this paper is therefore to introduce a new approach allowing to simulate permeability directly on any unstructured grid accounting for the support effect and avoiding the use of an underlying fine grid the method transforms the permeability into an additive property using power averaging with local exponents which depend on the geometry and size of the cells the exponents are estimated using a limited set of numerical experiments and an experimental design approach the simulation process then relies on a spectral turning bands approach mantoglou and wilson 1982 emery et al 2016 this overall strategy permits to generate efficiently a set of realizations in section 3 the applicability of the method is illustrated on a synthetic case including tracer test simulations 2 methodology the general workflow of the proposed approach is illustrated in fig 1 the details are provided in the following sections let us first introduce the overall approach the first step is the computation of the size and aspect ratio of each cell of the unstructured grid fig 1a the second step consists of a series of numerical experiments allowing to estimate for any cell geometry the exponent ω that would minimize the error between the equivalent conductivity estimated using a power average with the ω exponent and the equivalent conductivity estimated numerically since it is not possible to run numerical experiments for all the cell sizes and geometries we select some representative cell dimensions and construct a response surface fig 1b this is done once at the beginning of the procedure then several points are randomly placed inside each cell and for every realization the permeability is simulated on these points using the spectral turning bands stb approach fig 1c the power averaging technique is then applied using the value of ω derived from the response surface to obtain the equivalent permeability of the cell fig 1d the main strength of this workflow is that the averaging exponents ω are estimated once for a given problem constrained by a permeability distribution a variogram and an unstructured grid after that several realizations of permeability fields can be obtained efficiently using spectral turning bands 2 1 power averaging the proposed method is based on power averaging deutsch et al 2002 journel et al 1986 ababou 1996 desbarats 1992 to estimate the equivalent permeability k eq of a cell 1 k e q 1 n i 1 n k i ω 1 ω with n representing the number of points in a block ki the permeability value at point i and ω the averaging exponent the exponent ω belongs to the interval 1 1 with ω 1 representing an arithmetic mean ω 1 a harmonic mean and lim ω 0 is the geometric mean given by e x p 1 n i 1 n l o g k i the interest of this approach is that the permeability raised at the exponent ω becomes an additive variable however the main question is then to estimate the value of ω for a certain configuration of the fine scale permeability indeed it is expected that it may depend on the type of spatial distributions and on the size and geometry of the cells therefore let us first summarize some theoretical and experimental results from the literature several studies have given estimates of the value of ω for some specific distributions of permeability in two dimensions when the permeability k and its inverse h 1 k have the same probability distributions matheron 1966 1967 1968 proves that the equivalent permeability is the geometric mean if the statistics of the spatial distributions of k and h are invariant by rotation i e ω 0 a case that satisfies the previously mentioned conditions is a 2d isotropic medium with a log normal permeability distribution in three dimensions noetinger 1994 proposes an approximation for this specific case ω 1 3 the validity of this formula up to the fourth order small perturbation has been demonstrated by dagan 1993 however de wit 1995 and abramovich and indelman 1995 later showed using a sixth order development that in three dimensions it is not strictly valid and would necessitate a correction for anisotropic media ababou 1996 desbarats 1992 duquerroix et al 1993 kruel romeu 1994 noetinger and haas 1996 suggest a simple analytical form let λ l v l h be the geometrical anisotropy depending on the ratio of the variogram ranges and κ k v k h be the permeability anisotropy ratio changing variables in the laplace darcy equation allows to define a global anisotropy ratio through α κ λ the proposed value of ω is 2 ω α a r c t a n α π a r c t a n α massonnat 2009 introduces ωh for the horizontal permeability and ωv for the vertical permeability 3 ω h α a r c t a n α π a r c t a n α and 4 ω v 2 ω h 1 for isotropic random media horizontal permeability is approximately equal to vertical permeability with ω 1 3 as discussed above furthermore to account for the finite size of the cells and non ergodic effects the integral scale is not necessarily much smaller than the cell size massonnat 2009 introduced two additional coefficients ϵ h and ϵ v to estimate the global anisotropy ratio 5 α l h l v k v k h ϵ h ϵ v the parameter κ k v k h can be estimated from field measurements but this is rarely done a table of values has been proposed for turbiditic facies wigniolle and massonnat 2013 however the main difficulty revolves around the dependency of ω to the coefficients ϵ h and ϵ v that are hardly possible to estimate without empirical curves godoy et al 2018 showed numerically how the exponent is influenced by the block size the power average was recently revisited by liao et al 2020 and references therein the conclusion from this brief literature review is that numerical experiments must be conducted to estimate ω as there is no simple analytical solution in the following section we will present how the values of ω are defined for all unstructured grid cells but before explaining that aspect we introduce how we compute an equivalent geometry for the cells of the unstructured grids 2 2 characterizing the unstructured cells a preliminary step is to estimate the geometries of the unstructured cells indeed ω depends on the cell s sizes two separate sets of axes are defined fig 2 the xyz space is characterized by the orientation of the unstructured grid i e the orientation of the bounding box of the grid the mmt space is defined following the axis m corresponding to the maximum range of the variogram model in the stratigraphic plane the axis m corresponding to the minimum range of the variogram model in the stratigraphic plane perpendicular to m and the vertical axis t in this work grids are 2 5d which brings z t it is in this depositional space mmt that unstructured cell sizes are defined to define the cell sizes a horizontal aspect ratio h along the mm axes is defined it is computed for every cell all vertices are projected along m and m fig 3 cell s lengths along axes δmu and δmu are defined by the distance between the furthest projected vertices on the considered axis the aspect ratio h is obtained by dividing the projected length along m by the one along m h δ m u δ m u for each unstructured cell an equivalent regular hexahedral cell is defined through a simple system of equations so that the volume of the regular cell vr is equal to the volume of the unstructured cell vu and that both cells have the same aspect ratio h and thicknesses δtr and δtu respectively 6 v r δ m r δ m r δ t r v u h δ m u δ m u δ m r δ m r δ t u δ t r δmu δmu δtu and vu being known the dimensions of the equivalent rectangular cell are obtained for every cell of the unstructured grid 7 δ m r h v u δ t u δ m r v u h δ t u δ t r δ t u for a non extruded unstructured grid the third equation of the system should be replaced by a vertical aspect ratio v δ m δ m δ t describing the unstructured cells in mmt space means that the permeability tensor will be considered in this space for the flow simulators however permeability has to be given in xyz space an additional step at the end of the workflow has to be implemented to rotate the permeability matrix from mmt space to xyz for simplicity however the remainder of this paper considers that mmt axes are aligned to xyz axes coherently with the chosen horizontally isotropic grids and variograms used for the simulations 2 3 generating the response surface of omega in the method presented hereafter ω is estimated for each cell using a response surface methodology the explanatory variables of the response surface are the different parameters having an influence on the value of ω they characterize each cell of the unstructured grid following noetinger and haas 1996 and massonnat 2009 experiments show that three main parameters influence ω variogram ranges proportions of facies and cell geometry in this paper the focus is put on cell sizes and geometry and we neglect for the moment the presence of multiple facies to keep the response surfaces simple and tractable to obtain the response surface the first step consists in choosing n points in the parameter space where the response has to be evaluated the dimension d of the parameter space depends on the type of unstructured grid fig 4 a d 2 for a 2d unstructured grid taking into account cell s sizes along m and m axes d 2 for a 3d unstructured grid with constant cell s size on t axis taking into account cell s sizes along m and m d 2 for a 3d horizontally isotropic grid taking into account the cell s sizes along t axis and the average of the cell s sizes along m and m axes d 3 for a 3d unstructured grid taking into account cell s sizes along m m and t axes for each of the d dimensions the minimum and maximum of the sizes of the equivalent rectangular cells δmr δmr and δtr is computed to limit the ranges of possible cell sizes a set of p points is then randomly and uniformly placed in the parameter space each point corresponds to a d dimensional vector of the form δ m r i δ m r j δ t r k the number of points p should be large enough to cover the entire space fig 4b among those p points n are chosen using the wootton sergent phan tan luu wsp sergent 1989 sergent et al 1997a 1997b space filling design technique from a set of candidate points well distributed experiments are selected following an iterative process depending on an exclusion sphere santiago et al 2012 fig 4c a value of ω is then estimated for each of the n points of the parameter space for each point having d coordinates representing cell sizes e g δ m r exp δ m r exp and δ t r exp if d 3 we use a fine regular grid aligned on the mmt axes to simulate several realizations of fine scale permeability these fine values are then upscaled with a pressure solver using upscaling ratio corresponding to the coordinates of the point treated i e we create upscaled blocks of the size of the equivalent hexahedron of interest it gives a distribution of reference upscaled permeability values and we find the ω for which the power averaging distribution best fits the reference the details of this calibration are given bellow the fine grid for the fine scale simulations is defined once using δ m r s m a l l e s t δ m r s m a l l e s t and δ t r s m a l l e s t respectively δ m r b i g g e s t δ m r b i g g e s t and δ t r b i g g e s t which are the dimensions of the equivalent rectangular cell corresponding to the smallest respectively the biggest unstructured cell in the grid fig 5 top the idea is to create a fine grid covering at least eight equivalent rectangular cells 2 along each axis the bounding box of this structured grid must have dimensions g m s g m s and g t s such that g m s 2 δ m r b i g g e s t g m s 2 δ m r b i g g e s t and g t s 2 δ t r b i g g e s t the voxels of this grid have dimensions c m s c m s and c t s such that c m s δ m r s m a l l e s t c m s δ m r s m a l l e s t and c t s δ t r s m a l l e s t fig 5 bottom then each experiment is performed as follows a fine scale permeability k is simulated on the local grid using spectral turning bands mantoglou and wilson 1982 emery et al 2016 with a distribution and variogram corresponding to the fine scale fig 6 a this step is repeated r times with a different seed for random number generation the permeability distribution can be of any type including lognormal and beta this distribution may characterize the values of permeability or the values of log permeability in the latter case the fine scale permeability values are normalized using a power of 10 the rest of the experiment is then performed on this normalized property upscaling ratios in each direction are set using cell s sizes corresponding to the current experiment u m δ m r exp c m s u m δ m r exp c m s and u t δ t r exp c t s r upscaled permeabilities called reference permeabilities k m r e f k m r e f and k t r e f are computed using a pressure solver upscaler with um um and ut as upscaling ratios fig 6b it gives a distribution of kref values in each direction the upscaler jaquet et al 0000 uses a local scheme and solves the steady state flow equation using a finite volume technique it uses a two point flux given by approximation tpfa scheme two options are available the type of boundary conditions around the domain it can either be of permeameter type or linearly varying heads type see definition and discussion in renard and de marsily 1997 and the formula used to compute the transmissibility between two cells it can either be an arithmetic geometric or harmonic mean the resulting linear system is solved using a conjugate gradient solver the values of ωm ωm and ωt for this experiment are determined by minimizing the global error between kref and the power average keq i e minimizing the sum of the error for the n upscaled blocks fig 6c 8 b l o c k 1 n log k b l o c k r e f log k b l o c k e q in practice determining ω is done using an optimization method that first tries to fit a parabola equation to the error function and find its minimum and if not successful uses a golden search method the error function can have various shapes going from a parabola to a simple monotonous curve fig 7 typically the number r of fine scale permeability realizations must be large enough so that the reference distribution kref has a statistically sufficient number of values to identify a robust value for ω in the case of the biggest possible equivalent hexahedron of size δ m r b i g g e s t δ m r b i g g e s t and δ t r b i g g e s t we obtain eight upscaled values for one realization the fine grid has been defined such that eight biggest hexahedra can be overlaid on it it means that in this case ω will be fitted on n 8 r values which is the limit to take into account when choosing the number r in parallel in the case of a small equivalent hexahedron we will obtain a large number of reference values for each realization because the fine grid is not adapted to the local problem this large number will also be multiplied by r which gives too many unnecessary values to estimate ω and brings unnecessary computational cost to fix this problem if the cell size for the treated experiment is smaller than δ m r b i g g e s t δ m r b i g g e s t δ t r b i g g e s t only the region of the fine grid of size 2 δ m r exp 2 δ m r exp and 2 δ t r exp is simulated and consequently upscaled by doing so kref distribution always has n 8 r values to fit the ω value for each point in parameter space once all numerical experiments have been performed an interpolation between the points of the parameter space is done using kriging fig 8 a and b the correlation function for kriging is assumed stationary and written as follows 9 r x y e x p j 1 d x j y j θ j p with 1 p 2 and d the number of dimensions of the response surface the hyper parameters θj characterizing kriging anisotropy are estimated using the maximum likelihood method however to avoid artifacts on surfaces of response in our work all θj have been set to one in the normalized space the resulting response surface allows determining the exponent ω for each cell of the unstructured grid fig 8c as explained previously in each experiment the upscaling is done in two or three directions resulting in different kref m m or t then two or three values for ω are obtained per experiment one for each direction d in the end not one but two or three response surfaces of ω are interpolated and the same amount of omega properties are painted on the unstructured grid 2 4 direct simulation of permeability on the unstructured grid the next step is to simulate rapidly values on integration points using spectral turning bands stb and average them using the estimated ω the integration points are obtained with a fast generation of quasi random sobol sequences using the method of antonov and saleev 1979 turning bands were introduced in matheron 1973 and further developed by many authors including mantoglou and wilson 1982 tompson et al 1989 lantuéjoul 2002 and emery and lantuéjoul 2006 the general principle of this technique is to reduce a d dimensions simulation problem to a one dimensional simulation the first step is to generate l lines θi such that their orientation is uniformly distributed over the unit sphere a 1d simulation is made along each line using the one dimensional field covariance c θ i resulting from the d dimensional covariance c numerous methods for simulating a one dimensional random field knowing its covariance c θ i are found in the literature including spectral approaches used in this work they can be classified into continuous spectral simulation using cosine functions mantoglou and wilson 1982 shinozuka and jan 1972 discrete spectral simulation using fast fourier transform tompson et al 1989 and circulant embedding dietrich 1995 from these simulated lines the simulated value at any point can be obtained by projection and summation an extension of the spectral turning bands method to non stationary models is available in emery and arroyo 2017 once the lines have been simulated and stored the simulation of each unstructured cell can be made independently from the others for each cell a number of random locations to select is calculated depending on the cell s volume fig 9 a the fine permeability values at these locations are simulated as explained above fig 9b the global cell value is obtained by averaging the point values using the power law and the ω estimated for that cell fig 9c once again not one but two or three permeability values are obtained one for each direction m m and t 3 applications the methodology has been tested and showed to provide correct results on simple cases with known analytical solutions perfectly layered case isotropic log normal distribution etc we do not discuss these results here for the sake of brevity instead we will illustrate the method with a synthetic but realistic example fig 10 we consider a confined aquifer of 2km by 2km with negligible ambient flow the external boundaries are assumed to be impermeable the thickness of the aquifer is varying linearly from 40 m in the eastern side to 4 m in the western side ten wells are positioned across the aquifer two of them are injecting water and seven are pumping fig 15 a tracer is injected in the last well and recovered in the pumping wells this setup was designed to test the proposed geostatistical simulation technique on a realistic unstructured grid and to compare the results of the tracer simulation with a fine scale simulation standard approach in the following sections we describe first the simulation of the permeability and then the tracer simulations 3 1 permeability simulation the 3d unstructured grid for this case is composed of 18 250 voronoï cells with a volume between 25 m3 and 50 103 m3 fig 10a the grid is refined around all ten wells the variogram for both porosity and permeability has two gaussian structures of equal contribution with ranges of 25x25x2 5 m and 250x250x25 m for cell sizes varying between 3 and 90 m horizontally and 0 8 to 8 m vertically fig 10b the porosity has a beta distribution of mean 0 15 and standard deviation 0 05 fig 10c and the permeability distribution is lognormal with a mean of 100 md and a standard deviation of 300 md fig 10d the boundary conditions for the upscaler in the experiments are of permeameter type i e no flow conditions on the sides due to the horizontal isotropy of the aspect ratio of the unstructured cells the mmt axes presented in section 2 2 are taken aligned to xyz axes for the same reason x axis and y axis being equivalent only two response surfaces are presented hereafter one for the horizontal exponent ω h ω x ω y and one for the vertical exponent ωv fig 11 the two axes of the response surfaces represent the horizontal cell sizes δxy taken as the mean of the cell sizes in x and y and the vertical cell sizes δz a smooth variation of ω is observed from 0 to 1 for ωh and from 1 to 1 for ωv the log of permeability is assumed to be correlated to point support porosity with a correlation coefficient of 0 8 which is possible using spectral turning bands porosity on the unstructured grid is obtained using the arithmetic mean fig 12 and two permeability h and v are simulated using the power averaging formula and ω properties generated previously fig 13 a although both kh and kv properties look similar the cross plot on fig 13b shows that kv is globally inferior to kh the similarity between these results will be discussed in the conclusion 3 2 tracer tests tracer simulations are performed accounting only for advection and neglecting diffusion and physical dispersion the tracer response computed using the unstructured grid presented above is compared to the response computed using a fine structured grid having the same extension the aim is to test if the permeability field obtained with the proposed method gives a coherent tracer response the fine grid has 600 600 80 cells of horizontal size 3 3 3 3 m and vertical size from 0 05m to 0 5m using spectral turning bands stb it is possible to obtain the same random field on the points placed in the structured and unstructured cells for the structured one a single point is taken per cell while the number of points in each unstructured cells depends on its volume then for unstructured cells the cell average value is obtained using arithmetic average for porosity and power averaging for permeability using the ω value given by the response surface twenty realizations of porosity and correlated permeability are generated on both grids one example is displayed on fig 14 for each realization a passive tracer is injected in a water saturated reservoir having one well injecting the tracer two wells injecting water and seven production wells fig 15 the water production rate per well is 120 m3 day and the water and tracer injection rate per well is 280 m3 day we observe the concentration of tracer at the producers for the twenty realizations fig 16 for individual realizations some local deviations are observed between the tracer curves of the fine structured reservoir fig 16a and the ones of the unstructured grid fig 16b however in terms of uncertainty assessment the set of tracer curves shows a very consistent behavior for both grids the curves for structured reservoir are slightly more scattered which is coherent with the better precision offered by this grid the q10 q50 and q90 quantile curves fig 16c are almost identical with some minor differences on q10 a 3d visualization of the tracer s concentration evolution shows similar results on structured and unstructured grids fig 17 this similarity is further demonstrated by the visualization of the mean of the twenty realizations of the tracer s concentration evolution at time thirteen years where concentration tendencies are well respected fig 18 as expected for a coarser grid these results show that the unstructured grid does not preserve the details of the propagation visible on the structured grid horizontally and vertically this highlights the importance of the choice of unstructured grid the errors are localized in areas between wells where the unstructured grid is too coarse overall this comparison demonstrates the consistency of the proposed method as compared to the results obtained with a structured grid however the computational times are very different the tracer test simulations on the structured grid takes 112 minutes in average while they only take 4 minutes on the unstructured grid 3 3 computation times the use of an unstructured grid while accounting for the support effect usually requires to generate the geostatistical simulations on a fine structured grid and to upscale numerically the permeability e g aavatsmark et al 1998 prévost et al 1996 for every realization one needs to redo the upscaling the methodology presented in this paper is different since it allows direct simulation of the permeability on the unstructured grid but it shows improved efficiency for multi realizations in particular the computation time for the proposed method is not proportional to the number of cells in the unstructured grid indeed the response surface computation is generally the most computationally demanding step so the main factor influencing the time is the range of cell sizes covered a grid presenting a larger range of cell sizes will require a broader response surface and therefore more experiments in addition the fine structured grid used to perform the experiments is defined from the minimum and maximum cell sizes a higher difference between the two will require a larger fine grid and hence longer upscaling times to evaluate the computation time different tests have been made the procedure has been applied on two grids with different characteristics a small example with 18 250 cells varying from 3 to 90 m horizontally and from 0 8 to 8 m vertically and a larger example with 2 031 995 cells varying from 6 to 2 653 m horizontally and from 3 to 60 m vertically in the following t 0 represents the time required to generate the response surfaces t 3 t 1 t 2 represents the time required to simulate the permeability values on points using stb t 1 and perform power averaging t 2 the total simulation time t is 10 t t 0 n t 3 with n the number of realizations for a response surface with fifty experiments using twenty intel cores on a linux machine the computation times for our java implementation are provided in table 1 this table shows that the time required to perform one realization on the large grid is only doubled compared to the time required for the small grid while the number of cells has been multiplied by a factor 100 showing the efficiency of the method for large grids the computation time is also compared with the classical method fine grid simulation followed by a pressure solver upscaling on a regular grid the experiment is conducted as follows the fine grid is the one presented in section 3 2 with 600x600x80 cells the coarse grid has 60x60x5 cells the upscaling ratios are 10x10x16 this coarse grid has 18 000 regular cells which is close to the 18 250 cells of the unstructured grid for one realization the proposed method takes three minutes more than the classical one table 2 however as soon as one needs to perform at least two realizations the proposed methodology is faster moreover the response surfaces being saved it is almost immediate to simulate permeability fields when parameters have not changed i e when the distribution variogram and grid are the same 4 discussion and conclusion this paper proposes a new workflow allowing to simulate directly permeability fields on unstructured grids accounting for support effects the main originality of the method is that it allows bypassing the use of a potentially memory and time consuming fine grid and the repeated use of local upscaling on every fine scale realization on horizontally isotropic simple cases the applications are encouraging with coarse flow simulations results close to a fine grid taken as reference the proposed method can be used as an extension to previous methods that allowed to generate geostatistical simulation of additive variables directly on an unstructured grid e g zaytsev et al 2015 deutsch et al 2002 emery and arroyo 2017 the methodology raises some questions that are detailed below the obtained results provide some clues to answer these questions and open interesting discussion items the first one relates to the numerical upscaling method used in the experiments as a reference numerical upscaling is more general than analytical solutions but it is strongly dependent on a few parameters such as the type of boundary conditions or the choice of the averaging technique used for transmissibility computation three main boundary conditions are used in general permeameter type linearly varying head and periodic in this paper we presented results that were obtained with permeameter type conditions however the same cases could be studied with linearly varying head conditions to select which method is the most adequate additional research should be conducted the general methodology would however not be affected the second one is whether the power averaging formula is sufficient to capture the details of the spatial complexity of the permeability fields previous numerical experiments e g renard et al 2000 have shown for example a broad dispersion of the equivalent permeabilities around power averages however and rather surprisingly the numerical experiments conducted in this paper show that the method is robust for the studied class of random fields in addition one can note that during the optimization step when the value of ω is estimated from a set of reference upscaled permeabilities we store the remaining error this means that even if we did not encounter this problem yet the methodology includes a step to identify situations in which the method could have difficulties in these situations one could apply a quantile to quantile correction of permeability replacing the permeability in cells flagged as bad by the corresponding reference numerically upscaled permeability the global consistency of the approach can be checked by using the same simulator at the finest and coarse scales it is well known from romeu and noetinger 1995 that any discretized model can yield strongly biased results as soon as the grid block size is on the same order as the underlying correlation scale this bias is due to the underlying numerical scheme that weights the conductivity between grid blocks by means of some averaging formula that may lead to underestimated values for the overall effective conductivity that is observed in the popular case of the harmonic averaging formula employed by most popular commercial simulators in the common practice the mesh of the working model is built by engineers in order to get the best compromise ensuring a global accuracy at the lowest numerical cost close to the wells very fine grid blocks are employed while coarse blocks are used far from the wells the bias issue may thus occur in the transition zone with grid block sizes that may be compared to the size of the heterogeneities such a zone may be expected to be of a rather small size compared to the overall characteristic sizes of the model distances between wells size of the reservoir similar issues were addressed by preux 2016 in order to check the location at which upscaling should be carried out a posteriori estimators may be used to postprocess the solutions in order to indicate zones to be refined see gratien jean marc et al 2016 and references therein regarding the boundary condition issue it can be observed that the effective conductivity of large blocks becomes rather independent on the boundary conditions see colecchio et al 2020 and references therein finally we want to note that the comparison of the computing time for the standard upscaling approach and the proposed one is probably in favor of the standard one indeed the standard approach used in this paper assumes that the upscaling is done on a regular grid computations are easier than if they were done for any possible geometry however we showed that the proposed method becomes faster when the number of realizations increases so we consider that the all cost of designing the experiment running them and interpolating the ω values is rapidly compensated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

434,uncertainties related to permeability heterogeneity can be estimated using geostatistical simulation methods usually these methods are applied on regular grids with cells of constant size whereas unstructured grids are more flexible to honor geological structures and offer local refinements for fluid flow simulations however cells of different sizes require to account for the support dependency of permeability statistics support effect this paper presents a novel workflow based on the power averaging technique the averaging exponent ω is estimated using a response surface calibrated from numerical upscaling experiments using spectral turning bands permeability is simulated on points in each unstructured cell and later averaged with a local value of ω that depends on the cell size and shape the method is illustrated on a synthetic case the simulation of a tracer experiment is used to compare this novel geostatistical simulation method with a conventional approach based on a fine scale cartesian grid the results show the consistency of both the simulated permeability fields and the tracer breakthrough curves the computational cost is much lower than the conventional approach based on a pressure solver upscaling keywords upscaling permeability geostatistics power averaging 1 introduction subsurface phenomena cannot be observed directly due to scale issues and inaccessibility in hydrogeology the high spatial variability of rock types and the associated permeability field as well as the high spatial and temporal variability of fluid types and displacements is a main source of uncertainties estimating these uncertainties is particularly important in a context of engineering design and decision making examples of applications include the management of over exploited aquifers or the propagation of dangerous contaminants de marsily et al 1998 similar uncertainty issues coupled with decision making are encountered in other applied geoscience engineering such as oil and gas industry preux 2016 co2 storage in aquifers michael et al 2010 akhurst et al 2015 or geothermal energy production vogt et al 2010 quinlivan et al 2015 witter et al 2019 this paper focuses on the spatial modeling of permeability fields due to rock heterogeneity a measurement at point support is not sufficient to determine accurately the value at another point to assess the uncertainty related to this problem one can employ geostatistical simulation methods deutsch and journel 1992 goovaerts 1997 chilès and delfiner 2012 to represent the spatial variability and to solve numerically the flow and transport equations a mesh is used and its cells are populated with petrophysical properties classical meshes widely known as regular structured or cartesian grids are composed of hexahedral cells in three dimensions the interesting aspect of regular structured grids is that their cells all share the same size depending on the type of numerical methods employed to solve the flow problem other types of grids exist some tools use irregular structured grids also called corner point or stratigraphic grids obtained by distorting hexahedra to follow more faithfully geological layers regular and irregular structured grids are practical for the rapidity of calculation but they present some drawbacks some cells can be degenerated for high thickness variations the geometry of the intersections between faults or wells and the geological structure are approximated and corner point regular grids lack spatial adaptivity to honor local complex features of the parameter field to address these issues unstructured grids can be used each vertex can have a different number of neighbors and the cell s sizes can vary indeed the areas of the grid that present more interest or stronger variations for flow estimations can be refined and other parts coarsened prévost et al 1996 usually to minimize numerical errors the grid is refined around wells or faults but it can also be optimized based on flow patterns mlacnik et al 2003 in addition the cells can have various shapes such as tetrahedron or voronoï polyhedron offering more flexibility to adapt to geological heterogeneity blessent et al 2011 merland et al 2014 however unstructured grids brings an additional difficulty for geostatistical simulations indeed the statistics of the permeability and of the other variables are support dependent i e in stationary settings smaller cells tend to have a smaller internal variability and larger inter cell variability this support effect is well documented both theoretically and experimentally matheron 1967 dagan 1993 tidwell and wilson 1997 the probability distribution function of the permeability is different for cells of different volumes as well as the spatial correlation intuitively small cells will follow the geostatistical properties defined at the point support scale keeping their local average and covariance in opposition for very large blocks having a size greater than the underlying integral scale the associated permeability value may be shown to stabilize to the so called effective permeability that is the self averaging property boschan and noetinger 2012 nœtinger and gautier 1998 noetinger and zargar 2004 it highlights the role of the interaction between the geometry and size of the block and the integral scale that may characterize the internal structure of the aquifer if these support effects are not accounted for the simulation of the petrophysical variables can result in distorted and possibly wrong fluid paths it is therefore crucial to use appropriate geostatistical methods for unstructured grids and incidently for structured corner point grids in which cell volumes vary significantly see bertoncello et al 2008 the simplest approach to account for the support effect is to simulate the properties on a fine scale grid using a geostatistical model defined at measurement support in a second step this grid is overlaid by the unstructured grid of interest the values on the large cells are computed by averaging the values contained in this cell on the fine scale grid e g caumon et al 2005 durlofsky 2005 however modeling the domain of interest at measurement support typically a few cubic centimeter for petrophysical core measurements is particularly challenging to bypass this problem a solution is to simulate directly the property on the unstructured grid accounting for support effect but a second challenge arises because permeability is not additive a property is said to be additive porosity for example when the averaging can be carried out using a weighted arithmetic mean this is possible because quantities of the underlying physical property can be added together in a meaningful manner for example volumes of pores in two parts of a sample can be added together to produce the total volume of pores in the sample for additive properties some direct geostatistical simulation methods accounting for support effect exist they are based on the analytical or numerical estimation of the covariance between data points and cells of different support and geometries among the existing methods the discrete gaussian model or dgm matheron 1976 has been investigated and implemented by emery and ortiz 2011 and zaytsev et al 2015 another possible method is the direct sequential simulation or dss deutsch et al 2002 in all cases the covariance values vary depending on the cell s volumes however permeability is not additive one cannot simply average it using simple summations instead a pressure solver or some approximations must be used renard and de marsily 1997 manchuk et al 2012 khan and dawson 2004 and the geostatistical methods cited above cannot be directly applied the aim of this paper is therefore to introduce a new approach allowing to simulate permeability directly on any unstructured grid accounting for the support effect and avoiding the use of an underlying fine grid the method transforms the permeability into an additive property using power averaging with local exponents which depend on the geometry and size of the cells the exponents are estimated using a limited set of numerical experiments and an experimental design approach the simulation process then relies on a spectral turning bands approach mantoglou and wilson 1982 emery et al 2016 this overall strategy permits to generate efficiently a set of realizations in section 3 the applicability of the method is illustrated on a synthetic case including tracer test simulations 2 methodology the general workflow of the proposed approach is illustrated in fig 1 the details are provided in the following sections let us first introduce the overall approach the first step is the computation of the size and aspect ratio of each cell of the unstructured grid fig 1a the second step consists of a series of numerical experiments allowing to estimate for any cell geometry the exponent ω that would minimize the error between the equivalent conductivity estimated using a power average with the ω exponent and the equivalent conductivity estimated numerically since it is not possible to run numerical experiments for all the cell sizes and geometries we select some representative cell dimensions and construct a response surface fig 1b this is done once at the beginning of the procedure then several points are randomly placed inside each cell and for every realization the permeability is simulated on these points using the spectral turning bands stb approach fig 1c the power averaging technique is then applied using the value of ω derived from the response surface to obtain the equivalent permeability of the cell fig 1d the main strength of this workflow is that the averaging exponents ω are estimated once for a given problem constrained by a permeability distribution a variogram and an unstructured grid after that several realizations of permeability fields can be obtained efficiently using spectral turning bands 2 1 power averaging the proposed method is based on power averaging deutsch et al 2002 journel et al 1986 ababou 1996 desbarats 1992 to estimate the equivalent permeability k eq of a cell 1 k e q 1 n i 1 n k i ω 1 ω with n representing the number of points in a block ki the permeability value at point i and ω the averaging exponent the exponent ω belongs to the interval 1 1 with ω 1 representing an arithmetic mean ω 1 a harmonic mean and lim ω 0 is the geometric mean given by e x p 1 n i 1 n l o g k i the interest of this approach is that the permeability raised at the exponent ω becomes an additive variable however the main question is then to estimate the value of ω for a certain configuration of the fine scale permeability indeed it is expected that it may depend on the type of spatial distributions and on the size and geometry of the cells therefore let us first summarize some theoretical and experimental results from the literature several studies have given estimates of the value of ω for some specific distributions of permeability in two dimensions when the permeability k and its inverse h 1 k have the same probability distributions matheron 1966 1967 1968 proves that the equivalent permeability is the geometric mean if the statistics of the spatial distributions of k and h are invariant by rotation i e ω 0 a case that satisfies the previously mentioned conditions is a 2d isotropic medium with a log normal permeability distribution in three dimensions noetinger 1994 proposes an approximation for this specific case ω 1 3 the validity of this formula up to the fourth order small perturbation has been demonstrated by dagan 1993 however de wit 1995 and abramovich and indelman 1995 later showed using a sixth order development that in three dimensions it is not strictly valid and would necessitate a correction for anisotropic media ababou 1996 desbarats 1992 duquerroix et al 1993 kruel romeu 1994 noetinger and haas 1996 suggest a simple analytical form let λ l v l h be the geometrical anisotropy depending on the ratio of the variogram ranges and κ k v k h be the permeability anisotropy ratio changing variables in the laplace darcy equation allows to define a global anisotropy ratio through α κ λ the proposed value of ω is 2 ω α a r c t a n α π a r c t a n α massonnat 2009 introduces ωh for the horizontal permeability and ωv for the vertical permeability 3 ω h α a r c t a n α π a r c t a n α and 4 ω v 2 ω h 1 for isotropic random media horizontal permeability is approximately equal to vertical permeability with ω 1 3 as discussed above furthermore to account for the finite size of the cells and non ergodic effects the integral scale is not necessarily much smaller than the cell size massonnat 2009 introduced two additional coefficients ϵ h and ϵ v to estimate the global anisotropy ratio 5 α l h l v k v k h ϵ h ϵ v the parameter κ k v k h can be estimated from field measurements but this is rarely done a table of values has been proposed for turbiditic facies wigniolle and massonnat 2013 however the main difficulty revolves around the dependency of ω to the coefficients ϵ h and ϵ v that are hardly possible to estimate without empirical curves godoy et al 2018 showed numerically how the exponent is influenced by the block size the power average was recently revisited by liao et al 2020 and references therein the conclusion from this brief literature review is that numerical experiments must be conducted to estimate ω as there is no simple analytical solution in the following section we will present how the values of ω are defined for all unstructured grid cells but before explaining that aspect we introduce how we compute an equivalent geometry for the cells of the unstructured grids 2 2 characterizing the unstructured cells a preliminary step is to estimate the geometries of the unstructured cells indeed ω depends on the cell s sizes two separate sets of axes are defined fig 2 the xyz space is characterized by the orientation of the unstructured grid i e the orientation of the bounding box of the grid the mmt space is defined following the axis m corresponding to the maximum range of the variogram model in the stratigraphic plane the axis m corresponding to the minimum range of the variogram model in the stratigraphic plane perpendicular to m and the vertical axis t in this work grids are 2 5d which brings z t it is in this depositional space mmt that unstructured cell sizes are defined to define the cell sizes a horizontal aspect ratio h along the mm axes is defined it is computed for every cell all vertices are projected along m and m fig 3 cell s lengths along axes δmu and δmu are defined by the distance between the furthest projected vertices on the considered axis the aspect ratio h is obtained by dividing the projected length along m by the one along m h δ m u δ m u for each unstructured cell an equivalent regular hexahedral cell is defined through a simple system of equations so that the volume of the regular cell vr is equal to the volume of the unstructured cell vu and that both cells have the same aspect ratio h and thicknesses δtr and δtu respectively 6 v r δ m r δ m r δ t r v u h δ m u δ m u δ m r δ m r δ t u δ t r δmu δmu δtu and vu being known the dimensions of the equivalent rectangular cell are obtained for every cell of the unstructured grid 7 δ m r h v u δ t u δ m r v u h δ t u δ t r δ t u for a non extruded unstructured grid the third equation of the system should be replaced by a vertical aspect ratio v δ m δ m δ t describing the unstructured cells in mmt space means that the permeability tensor will be considered in this space for the flow simulators however permeability has to be given in xyz space an additional step at the end of the workflow has to be implemented to rotate the permeability matrix from mmt space to xyz for simplicity however the remainder of this paper considers that mmt axes are aligned to xyz axes coherently with the chosen horizontally isotropic grids and variograms used for the simulations 2 3 generating the response surface of omega in the method presented hereafter ω is estimated for each cell using a response surface methodology the explanatory variables of the response surface are the different parameters having an influence on the value of ω they characterize each cell of the unstructured grid following noetinger and haas 1996 and massonnat 2009 experiments show that three main parameters influence ω variogram ranges proportions of facies and cell geometry in this paper the focus is put on cell sizes and geometry and we neglect for the moment the presence of multiple facies to keep the response surfaces simple and tractable to obtain the response surface the first step consists in choosing n points in the parameter space where the response has to be evaluated the dimension d of the parameter space depends on the type of unstructured grid fig 4 a d 2 for a 2d unstructured grid taking into account cell s sizes along m and m axes d 2 for a 3d unstructured grid with constant cell s size on t axis taking into account cell s sizes along m and m d 2 for a 3d horizontally isotropic grid taking into account the cell s sizes along t axis and the average of the cell s sizes along m and m axes d 3 for a 3d unstructured grid taking into account cell s sizes along m m and t axes for each of the d dimensions the minimum and maximum of the sizes of the equivalent rectangular cells δmr δmr and δtr is computed to limit the ranges of possible cell sizes a set of p points is then randomly and uniformly placed in the parameter space each point corresponds to a d dimensional vector of the form δ m r i δ m r j δ t r k the number of points p should be large enough to cover the entire space fig 4b among those p points n are chosen using the wootton sergent phan tan luu wsp sergent 1989 sergent et al 1997a 1997b space filling design technique from a set of candidate points well distributed experiments are selected following an iterative process depending on an exclusion sphere santiago et al 2012 fig 4c a value of ω is then estimated for each of the n points of the parameter space for each point having d coordinates representing cell sizes e g δ m r exp δ m r exp and δ t r exp if d 3 we use a fine regular grid aligned on the mmt axes to simulate several realizations of fine scale permeability these fine values are then upscaled with a pressure solver using upscaling ratio corresponding to the coordinates of the point treated i e we create upscaled blocks of the size of the equivalent hexahedron of interest it gives a distribution of reference upscaled permeability values and we find the ω for which the power averaging distribution best fits the reference the details of this calibration are given bellow the fine grid for the fine scale simulations is defined once using δ m r s m a l l e s t δ m r s m a l l e s t and δ t r s m a l l e s t respectively δ m r b i g g e s t δ m r b i g g e s t and δ t r b i g g e s t which are the dimensions of the equivalent rectangular cell corresponding to the smallest respectively the biggest unstructured cell in the grid fig 5 top the idea is to create a fine grid covering at least eight equivalent rectangular cells 2 along each axis the bounding box of this structured grid must have dimensions g m s g m s and g t s such that g m s 2 δ m r b i g g e s t g m s 2 δ m r b i g g e s t and g t s 2 δ t r b i g g e s t the voxels of this grid have dimensions c m s c m s and c t s such that c m s δ m r s m a l l e s t c m s δ m r s m a l l e s t and c t s δ t r s m a l l e s t fig 5 bottom then each experiment is performed as follows a fine scale permeability k is simulated on the local grid using spectral turning bands mantoglou and wilson 1982 emery et al 2016 with a distribution and variogram corresponding to the fine scale fig 6 a this step is repeated r times with a different seed for random number generation the permeability distribution can be of any type including lognormal and beta this distribution may characterize the values of permeability or the values of log permeability in the latter case the fine scale permeability values are normalized using a power of 10 the rest of the experiment is then performed on this normalized property upscaling ratios in each direction are set using cell s sizes corresponding to the current experiment u m δ m r exp c m s u m δ m r exp c m s and u t δ t r exp c t s r upscaled permeabilities called reference permeabilities k m r e f k m r e f and k t r e f are computed using a pressure solver upscaler with um um and ut as upscaling ratios fig 6b it gives a distribution of kref values in each direction the upscaler jaquet et al 0000 uses a local scheme and solves the steady state flow equation using a finite volume technique it uses a two point flux given by approximation tpfa scheme two options are available the type of boundary conditions around the domain it can either be of permeameter type or linearly varying heads type see definition and discussion in renard and de marsily 1997 and the formula used to compute the transmissibility between two cells it can either be an arithmetic geometric or harmonic mean the resulting linear system is solved using a conjugate gradient solver the values of ωm ωm and ωt for this experiment are determined by minimizing the global error between kref and the power average keq i e minimizing the sum of the error for the n upscaled blocks fig 6c 8 b l o c k 1 n log k b l o c k r e f log k b l o c k e q in practice determining ω is done using an optimization method that first tries to fit a parabola equation to the error function and find its minimum and if not successful uses a golden search method the error function can have various shapes going from a parabola to a simple monotonous curve fig 7 typically the number r of fine scale permeability realizations must be large enough so that the reference distribution kref has a statistically sufficient number of values to identify a robust value for ω in the case of the biggest possible equivalent hexahedron of size δ m r b i g g e s t δ m r b i g g e s t and δ t r b i g g e s t we obtain eight upscaled values for one realization the fine grid has been defined such that eight biggest hexahedra can be overlaid on it it means that in this case ω will be fitted on n 8 r values which is the limit to take into account when choosing the number r in parallel in the case of a small equivalent hexahedron we will obtain a large number of reference values for each realization because the fine grid is not adapted to the local problem this large number will also be multiplied by r which gives too many unnecessary values to estimate ω and brings unnecessary computational cost to fix this problem if the cell size for the treated experiment is smaller than δ m r b i g g e s t δ m r b i g g e s t δ t r b i g g e s t only the region of the fine grid of size 2 δ m r exp 2 δ m r exp and 2 δ t r exp is simulated and consequently upscaled by doing so kref distribution always has n 8 r values to fit the ω value for each point in parameter space once all numerical experiments have been performed an interpolation between the points of the parameter space is done using kriging fig 8 a and b the correlation function for kriging is assumed stationary and written as follows 9 r x y e x p j 1 d x j y j θ j p with 1 p 2 and d the number of dimensions of the response surface the hyper parameters θj characterizing kriging anisotropy are estimated using the maximum likelihood method however to avoid artifacts on surfaces of response in our work all θj have been set to one in the normalized space the resulting response surface allows determining the exponent ω for each cell of the unstructured grid fig 8c as explained previously in each experiment the upscaling is done in two or three directions resulting in different kref m m or t then two or three values for ω are obtained per experiment one for each direction d in the end not one but two or three response surfaces of ω are interpolated and the same amount of omega properties are painted on the unstructured grid 2 4 direct simulation of permeability on the unstructured grid the next step is to simulate rapidly values on integration points using spectral turning bands stb and average them using the estimated ω the integration points are obtained with a fast generation of quasi random sobol sequences using the method of antonov and saleev 1979 turning bands were introduced in matheron 1973 and further developed by many authors including mantoglou and wilson 1982 tompson et al 1989 lantuéjoul 2002 and emery and lantuéjoul 2006 the general principle of this technique is to reduce a d dimensions simulation problem to a one dimensional simulation the first step is to generate l lines θi such that their orientation is uniformly distributed over the unit sphere a 1d simulation is made along each line using the one dimensional field covariance c θ i resulting from the d dimensional covariance c numerous methods for simulating a one dimensional random field knowing its covariance c θ i are found in the literature including spectral approaches used in this work they can be classified into continuous spectral simulation using cosine functions mantoglou and wilson 1982 shinozuka and jan 1972 discrete spectral simulation using fast fourier transform tompson et al 1989 and circulant embedding dietrich 1995 from these simulated lines the simulated value at any point can be obtained by projection and summation an extension of the spectral turning bands method to non stationary models is available in emery and arroyo 2017 once the lines have been simulated and stored the simulation of each unstructured cell can be made independently from the others for each cell a number of random locations to select is calculated depending on the cell s volume fig 9 a the fine permeability values at these locations are simulated as explained above fig 9b the global cell value is obtained by averaging the point values using the power law and the ω estimated for that cell fig 9c once again not one but two or three permeability values are obtained one for each direction m m and t 3 applications the methodology has been tested and showed to provide correct results on simple cases with known analytical solutions perfectly layered case isotropic log normal distribution etc we do not discuss these results here for the sake of brevity instead we will illustrate the method with a synthetic but realistic example fig 10 we consider a confined aquifer of 2km by 2km with negligible ambient flow the external boundaries are assumed to be impermeable the thickness of the aquifer is varying linearly from 40 m in the eastern side to 4 m in the western side ten wells are positioned across the aquifer two of them are injecting water and seven are pumping fig 15 a tracer is injected in the last well and recovered in the pumping wells this setup was designed to test the proposed geostatistical simulation technique on a realistic unstructured grid and to compare the results of the tracer simulation with a fine scale simulation standard approach in the following sections we describe first the simulation of the permeability and then the tracer simulations 3 1 permeability simulation the 3d unstructured grid for this case is composed of 18 250 voronoï cells with a volume between 25 m3 and 50 103 m3 fig 10a the grid is refined around all ten wells the variogram for both porosity and permeability has two gaussian structures of equal contribution with ranges of 25x25x2 5 m and 250x250x25 m for cell sizes varying between 3 and 90 m horizontally and 0 8 to 8 m vertically fig 10b the porosity has a beta distribution of mean 0 15 and standard deviation 0 05 fig 10c and the permeability distribution is lognormal with a mean of 100 md and a standard deviation of 300 md fig 10d the boundary conditions for the upscaler in the experiments are of permeameter type i e no flow conditions on the sides due to the horizontal isotropy of the aspect ratio of the unstructured cells the mmt axes presented in section 2 2 are taken aligned to xyz axes for the same reason x axis and y axis being equivalent only two response surfaces are presented hereafter one for the horizontal exponent ω h ω x ω y and one for the vertical exponent ωv fig 11 the two axes of the response surfaces represent the horizontal cell sizes δxy taken as the mean of the cell sizes in x and y and the vertical cell sizes δz a smooth variation of ω is observed from 0 to 1 for ωh and from 1 to 1 for ωv the log of permeability is assumed to be correlated to point support porosity with a correlation coefficient of 0 8 which is possible using spectral turning bands porosity on the unstructured grid is obtained using the arithmetic mean fig 12 and two permeability h and v are simulated using the power averaging formula and ω properties generated previously fig 13 a although both kh and kv properties look similar the cross plot on fig 13b shows that kv is globally inferior to kh the similarity between these results will be discussed in the conclusion 3 2 tracer tests tracer simulations are performed accounting only for advection and neglecting diffusion and physical dispersion the tracer response computed using the unstructured grid presented above is compared to the response computed using a fine structured grid having the same extension the aim is to test if the permeability field obtained with the proposed method gives a coherent tracer response the fine grid has 600 600 80 cells of horizontal size 3 3 3 3 m and vertical size from 0 05m to 0 5m using spectral turning bands stb it is possible to obtain the same random field on the points placed in the structured and unstructured cells for the structured one a single point is taken per cell while the number of points in each unstructured cells depends on its volume then for unstructured cells the cell average value is obtained using arithmetic average for porosity and power averaging for permeability using the ω value given by the response surface twenty realizations of porosity and correlated permeability are generated on both grids one example is displayed on fig 14 for each realization a passive tracer is injected in a water saturated reservoir having one well injecting the tracer two wells injecting water and seven production wells fig 15 the water production rate per well is 120 m3 day and the water and tracer injection rate per well is 280 m3 day we observe the concentration of tracer at the producers for the twenty realizations fig 16 for individual realizations some local deviations are observed between the tracer curves of the fine structured reservoir fig 16a and the ones of the unstructured grid fig 16b however in terms of uncertainty assessment the set of tracer curves shows a very consistent behavior for both grids the curves for structured reservoir are slightly more scattered which is coherent with the better precision offered by this grid the q10 q50 and q90 quantile curves fig 16c are almost identical with some minor differences on q10 a 3d visualization of the tracer s concentration evolution shows similar results on structured and unstructured grids fig 17 this similarity is further demonstrated by the visualization of the mean of the twenty realizations of the tracer s concentration evolution at time thirteen years where concentration tendencies are well respected fig 18 as expected for a coarser grid these results show that the unstructured grid does not preserve the details of the propagation visible on the structured grid horizontally and vertically this highlights the importance of the choice of unstructured grid the errors are localized in areas between wells where the unstructured grid is too coarse overall this comparison demonstrates the consistency of the proposed method as compared to the results obtained with a structured grid however the computational times are very different the tracer test simulations on the structured grid takes 112 minutes in average while they only take 4 minutes on the unstructured grid 3 3 computation times the use of an unstructured grid while accounting for the support effect usually requires to generate the geostatistical simulations on a fine structured grid and to upscale numerically the permeability e g aavatsmark et al 1998 prévost et al 1996 for every realization one needs to redo the upscaling the methodology presented in this paper is different since it allows direct simulation of the permeability on the unstructured grid but it shows improved efficiency for multi realizations in particular the computation time for the proposed method is not proportional to the number of cells in the unstructured grid indeed the response surface computation is generally the most computationally demanding step so the main factor influencing the time is the range of cell sizes covered a grid presenting a larger range of cell sizes will require a broader response surface and therefore more experiments in addition the fine structured grid used to perform the experiments is defined from the minimum and maximum cell sizes a higher difference between the two will require a larger fine grid and hence longer upscaling times to evaluate the computation time different tests have been made the procedure has been applied on two grids with different characteristics a small example with 18 250 cells varying from 3 to 90 m horizontally and from 0 8 to 8 m vertically and a larger example with 2 031 995 cells varying from 6 to 2 653 m horizontally and from 3 to 60 m vertically in the following t 0 represents the time required to generate the response surfaces t 3 t 1 t 2 represents the time required to simulate the permeability values on points using stb t 1 and perform power averaging t 2 the total simulation time t is 10 t t 0 n t 3 with n the number of realizations for a response surface with fifty experiments using twenty intel cores on a linux machine the computation times for our java implementation are provided in table 1 this table shows that the time required to perform one realization on the large grid is only doubled compared to the time required for the small grid while the number of cells has been multiplied by a factor 100 showing the efficiency of the method for large grids the computation time is also compared with the classical method fine grid simulation followed by a pressure solver upscaling on a regular grid the experiment is conducted as follows the fine grid is the one presented in section 3 2 with 600x600x80 cells the coarse grid has 60x60x5 cells the upscaling ratios are 10x10x16 this coarse grid has 18 000 regular cells which is close to the 18 250 cells of the unstructured grid for one realization the proposed method takes three minutes more than the classical one table 2 however as soon as one needs to perform at least two realizations the proposed methodology is faster moreover the response surfaces being saved it is almost immediate to simulate permeability fields when parameters have not changed i e when the distribution variogram and grid are the same 4 discussion and conclusion this paper proposes a new workflow allowing to simulate directly permeability fields on unstructured grids accounting for support effects the main originality of the method is that it allows bypassing the use of a potentially memory and time consuming fine grid and the repeated use of local upscaling on every fine scale realization on horizontally isotropic simple cases the applications are encouraging with coarse flow simulations results close to a fine grid taken as reference the proposed method can be used as an extension to previous methods that allowed to generate geostatistical simulation of additive variables directly on an unstructured grid e g zaytsev et al 2015 deutsch et al 2002 emery and arroyo 2017 the methodology raises some questions that are detailed below the obtained results provide some clues to answer these questions and open interesting discussion items the first one relates to the numerical upscaling method used in the experiments as a reference numerical upscaling is more general than analytical solutions but it is strongly dependent on a few parameters such as the type of boundary conditions or the choice of the averaging technique used for transmissibility computation three main boundary conditions are used in general permeameter type linearly varying head and periodic in this paper we presented results that were obtained with permeameter type conditions however the same cases could be studied with linearly varying head conditions to select which method is the most adequate additional research should be conducted the general methodology would however not be affected the second one is whether the power averaging formula is sufficient to capture the details of the spatial complexity of the permeability fields previous numerical experiments e g renard et al 2000 have shown for example a broad dispersion of the equivalent permeabilities around power averages however and rather surprisingly the numerical experiments conducted in this paper show that the method is robust for the studied class of random fields in addition one can note that during the optimization step when the value of ω is estimated from a set of reference upscaled permeabilities we store the remaining error this means that even if we did not encounter this problem yet the methodology includes a step to identify situations in which the method could have difficulties in these situations one could apply a quantile to quantile correction of permeability replacing the permeability in cells flagged as bad by the corresponding reference numerically upscaled permeability the global consistency of the approach can be checked by using the same simulator at the finest and coarse scales it is well known from romeu and noetinger 1995 that any discretized model can yield strongly biased results as soon as the grid block size is on the same order as the underlying correlation scale this bias is due to the underlying numerical scheme that weights the conductivity between grid blocks by means of some averaging formula that may lead to underestimated values for the overall effective conductivity that is observed in the popular case of the harmonic averaging formula employed by most popular commercial simulators in the common practice the mesh of the working model is built by engineers in order to get the best compromise ensuring a global accuracy at the lowest numerical cost close to the wells very fine grid blocks are employed while coarse blocks are used far from the wells the bias issue may thus occur in the transition zone with grid block sizes that may be compared to the size of the heterogeneities such a zone may be expected to be of a rather small size compared to the overall characteristic sizes of the model distances between wells size of the reservoir similar issues were addressed by preux 2016 in order to check the location at which upscaling should be carried out a posteriori estimators may be used to postprocess the solutions in order to indicate zones to be refined see gratien jean marc et al 2016 and references therein regarding the boundary condition issue it can be observed that the effective conductivity of large blocks becomes rather independent on the boundary conditions see colecchio et al 2020 and references therein finally we want to note that the comparison of the computing time for the standard upscaling approach and the proposed one is probably in favor of the standard one indeed the standard approach used in this paper assumes that the upscaling is done on a regular grid computations are easier than if they were done for any possible geometry however we showed that the proposed method becomes faster when the number of realizations increases so we consider that the all cost of designing the experiment running them and interpolating the ω values is rapidly compensated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
