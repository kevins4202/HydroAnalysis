the external forces and moments that are applied in each method are shown table 3 in this case the forces are applied as a step function when the boat reach the steady condition in this instant the maneuver stars an algorithm in matlab was developed to solve the model equations the simulations were executed in personal computer with a processor intel i7 4510u the mathematical model algorithm is

order to evaluate the factors affecting the maneuverability of planing hulls considering tactical diameter and advance as response variables table 5 shows variable and fixed factors as well as the levels of the experiment the variable factors are displacement velocity deadrise angle rudder angle and cg position the fixed factors are boat length and propulsion type a central composite experiment 26 1 was used 46 experimental conditions were required table 6 shows the experimental conditions the runs of the numeric experiment were executed in two steps in the first step a towing tank test was simulated to evaluate the drag trim angle and elevation of cg at the test velocity the propulsion was dimensioned according to the drag force in each experimental run in the second step the turning circle maneuver was performed with the values of external forces found in the first step fig 11 shows the influence of the displacement deadrise angle velocity position of the cg and rudder angle the tactical diameter increases when increasing velocity deadrise angle vertical and horizontal position of cg and the tactical diameter decreases when increasing displacement and rudder angle the results are consistent with the experimental formula by denny and hubble 1991 where the steady diameter of the maneuver increases with the velocity and decreases with the displacement and rudder angle the heel angle of the maneuver increase with the vcg and a higher lateral force is required for the maneuver the yaw moment required in the maneuver increases with lcg and this amplifies the tactical diameter the dynamic trim heel angle and hydrodynamic yaw moment required for the maneuver increases with the deadrise angle of the boat and a consequently the tactical diameter grows up in some of the conditions shown in table 6 the boat presents dynamic instability this instability is represented by oscillatory and diverging boat motion fig 12 shows trajectory and time series for heave pitch

model to study the planing boat dynamic in six degrees of freedom was developed the mathematical two dimensional impact with three degrees of freedom model developed by algarín and bula 2020 was extended by the application of the slender body theory the model allows to evaluate the pressure forces and dynamic response of the boat in planing regime the zigzag and turning circle maneuvers were simulated with six degrees of freedom and the results were compared with cfd simulations and experimental data reported by plante et al 1998 the results presented good agreement in terms of the trajectory and dynamics response in the six degrees of freedom an experimental design based on response surface was carried out to study the turning circle test and the experiment factors were displacement deadrise angle velocity cg position and rudder angle the results were used to generate a regression model of the tactical diameter and the advance the tactical diameter increases when increasing velocity deadrise angle vertical and horizontal position of cg and the tactical diameter decreases when increasing displacement and rudder angle the results are consistent with the experimental formula by denny and hubble 1991 the model requires low computational resources and the computational cost is the 0 5 of a cfd simulation in different conditions of the experiment the boat is on dynamic instability on the vertical and transverse planes and this occurs more frequently for boats with lower deadrise angle credit authorship contribution statement roberto algarín

study the maneuverability of planing boats with six degrees of freedom and evaluate the influence of the main design parameters on the dynamic of planing hulls the model is validated by comparison with cfd simulations and experimental data by others authors the formulation considers that the six degrees of freedom of the boat are coupled and allows evaluating the pressure distribution at low computational cost compared to cfd simulations the model is also able to find conditions where the boat will be on dynamic instability furthermore a response surface is generated to evaluate the turning circle maneuver as function of the main design parameters these characteristics have not been previously reported by others at the authors best knowledge 2 mathematical model the model

multiphase mixture water air volume of fluids vof incompressible flow turbulent flow using k ε model the boat was modeled as rigid body and the effect of the gravity was considered the motions were modeled with 6 dof model in this formulation the whole domain move with the boat an additional term of grid velocity is required to solve the transport equations the grid velocity is applied at all cells of the domain fig 5 shows the computational domain and its size the units are in function of the boat beam the dimensions were selected in order to reduce the effect of the wave reflection the boundary conditions are wall in the hull pressure outlet in the back wall and velocity in the other boundaries fig 6 shows the computational domain mesh the mesh on the vertical horizontal and transverse planes are shown the computational domain mesh was obtained using hexahedral and prismatic elements around the hull to evaluate the viscous effects a mesh refinement was executed in the region close to hull and in the free surface furthermore a mesh refinement in angle was performed in order to capture the free surface when the boat is heeled table 2 shows the mesh size in the different regions the procedure by ittc 2017 was used for mesh independence analysis and the uncertainty analysis of the cfd simulations the ittc 2017 suggest a procedure based on three mesh to evaluate the convergence ratio r m the accuracy order of the solution p m and the corrected uncertainty u i c the procedure was applied in the prediction of the boat drag force the turning circle test was performed with 4 33 106 cells fig 7 shows the free surface and the wave elevation during the maneuver the wave and the boat trail has a low perturbation on the boundaries in the first step of the simulation the boat move with a constant forward velocity during a period of time t 0 in order to develop the flow in the second step the boat is free to have pitch and heave motion for a time t 1 until the boat find the equilibrium position in this step the trim angle elevation of the cg and the drag force are determined in the third step the boat is free to move in the six degrees of freedom and the external forces of the propulsion and rudder are applied the maneuver starts and the simulation continues until the heading reach to 380 the simulations were performed in a work station with 20 cores in parallel and the computational cost was 323 h 4 results eq 21 was used to study the planing hull dynamics with six degrees of freedom simulations of the turning circle test were performed to validate the model the conditions of the test are shown table 3 the thrust force of the propulsion was determined trough the current model cfd simulation and the method introduced by savitsky 1964 the external forces and moments that are applied in each method are shown table 3 in this case the forces are applied as a step function when the boat reach the steady condition in this instant the maneuver stars an algorithm in matlab was developed to solve the model equations the simulations were executed in personal computer with a processor intel i7 4510u the mathematical model algorithm is solved in the following steps in the first step the boat parameters beam position of cg deadrise angle displacement and the propulsion configuration initial conditions velocity trim angle and cg elevation respect to the water line and test conditions velocity and rudder angle are introduced in the second step the thrust and rudder forces are computed in the third step the immersion impact

each section are evaluated in the sixth step the global forces global inertias and accelerations on the boat are determined in the seventh step the velocities translations and rotations on the boat are evaluated steps 2 to 7 are evaluated in each time step until completing the total time of the maneuver the computational cost of the present model was lower than 2 h this represents less than 0 5 of the computational cost of the cfd simulations fig 8 shows the results of the turning circle test the values of the current model are compared with cfd simulations with good agreement the trajectory heading heel angle and trim angle are shown fig 8 the advance in test is 7 37 m and the tactical diameter 12 56 m the different respect to the cfd are 7 7 and 6 2 respectively the values of the heel angle and the trim angle in steady condition are similar to the cfd plante et al 1998 reported experimental data of a turning circle maneuver table 4 shows the main parameters of the model the boat used a waterjet propulsion system and the rudder angle during the test was set at 19 fig 9 shows the test boat trajectory and the results are compared with the experimental data by plante et al 1998 with good agreement the advance is 164 m with an error of 11 4 the tactical diameter is 151 m with an error of 5 1 respect to experimental data fig 9 shows the time series for heave roll and pitch motions the heel angle in steady state condition is 9 fig 10 shows the trajectory and the time series during the zigzag maneuver for table 4 conditions the 10 10 test was performed the rudder changes from 0 to 10 in 2 5s the propulsion force changed jet angle as shown fig 10b the first overshoot angle is 16 while the second and third overshoot angle are 19 the period of the test is 28 8s the value of the first overshoot angle exceed the 10 limit established by imo 2002 the maximum heel angle is 6 3 4 1 computational experimental design a computational experimental design was carried out in order to evaluate the factors affecting the maneuverability of planing hulls considering tactical diameter and advance as response variables table 5 shows variable and fixed factors as well as the levels of the experiment the variable factors are displacement velocity deadrise angle rudder angle and cg position the fixed factors are boat length and propulsion type a central composite experiment 26 1 was used 46 experimental conditions were required table 6 shows the experimental conditions the runs of the numeric experiment were executed in two steps in the first step a towing tank test was simulated to evaluate the drag trim angle and elevation of cg at the test velocity the propulsion was dimensioned according to the drag force in each experimental run in the second step the turning circle maneuver was performed with the values of external forces found in the first step fig 11 shows the influence of the displacement deadrise angle velocity position of the cg and rudder angle the tactical diameter increases when increasing velocity deadrise angle vertical and horizontal position of cg and the tactical diameter decreases when increasing displacement and rudder angle the results are consistent with the experimental formula by denny and hubble 1991 where the steady diameter of the maneuver increases with the velocity and decreases with the displacement and rudder angle the heel angle of the maneuver increase with the vcg and a higher lateral force is required for the maneuver the yaw moment required in the maneuver increases with lcg and this amplifies the tactical diameter the dynamic trim heel angle and hydrodynamic yaw moment required for the maneuver increases with the deadrise angle of the boat and a consequently the tactical diameter grows up in some of the conditions shown in table 6 the boat presents dynamic instability this instability is represented by oscillatory and diverging boat motion fig 12 shows trajectory and time series for heave pitch and roll motions for condition 29 in table 6 β 25 c δ 0 4 c v 3 0 δ 30 l c g b 1 5 and v c g b 0 3 fig 12b and 12c shows that heave and roll motion are oscillatory and diverging the simulation has problems to converge due to high asymmetry the experimental results were used to construct a response surface and regression models for the tactical diameter and the advance in the turning circle test eq 22 shows the regression model for the tactical diameter while table 7 shows the analysis of variance for that model the p value for each factor and the global model are lower than 0 05 showing they

model to study the planing boat dynamic in six degrees of freedom was developed the mathematical two dimensional impact with three degrees of freedom model developed by algarín and bula 2020 was extended by the application of the slender body theory the model allows to evaluate the pressure forces and dynamic response of the boat in planing regime the zigzag and turning circle maneuvers were simulated with six degrees of freedom and the results were compared with cfd simulations and experimental data reported by plante et al 1998 the results presented good agreement in terms of the trajectory and dynamics response in the six degrees of freedom an experimental design based on response surface was carried out to study the turning circle test and the experiment factors were displacement deadrise angle velocity cg position and rudder angle the results were used to generate a regression model of the tactical diameter and the advance the tactical diameter increases when increasing velocity deadrise angle vertical and horizontal position of cg and the tactical diameter decreases when increasing displacement and rudder angle the results are consistent with the experimental formula by denny and hubble 1991 the model requires low computational resources and the computational cost is the 0 5 of a cfd simulation in different conditions of the experiment the boat is on dynamic instability on the vertical and transverse planes and this occurs more frequently for boats with lower deadrise angle credit authorship contribution statement roberto algarín

21096,the present study introduces a framework for predicting nearshore waves using two machine learning techniques of group method of data handling gmdh and artificial neural network ann trained with three global wave datasets of japan meteorological agency jma national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf prior to our ultimate goal of forecasting nearshore waves up to one week in advance the current study challenges to hindcast nearshore wave heights and periods for a target year at the port of hitachinaka japan using the framework compounding gmdh and ann trained with the initially forecasted 0 h and reanalyzed two datasets it was found that the gmdh based wave model trained with noaa and ecmwf well predicted observed significant wave heights while a combination of jma and ecmwf for training gave the best performance for significant wave periods the same tendency was found when using ann since the present framework successfully transforms global waves into local nearshore waves it can be said that the framework for the nearshore wave prediction is able to support the one week ahead wave prediction and to be implemented at a particular location where the nearshore wave observations are available keywords wave prediction global wave nearshore wave group method of data handling gmdh artificial neural network ann 1 introduction wave forecasts predictions are used for shipping schedule planning offshore fishing marine construction work and maritime recreation activity also predictions aid in understanding the real time state of high waves during stormy weather these wave predictions are usually up to 3 days 72 h and are carried out by many organizations and researchers e g aono et al 1993 tom et al 2010 minguez et al 2013 chong and li 2015 vanem 2011 suzuki et al 2016 mase et al 2017 an approach to the wave forecast is to directly utilize wave models of wam wamdi group 1988 wavewatch iii tolman 2009 and swan booij et al 1999 all are based on solving the wave action balance equation under wind input non linear wave interactions white capping depth limited wave braking and bed frictional dissipation in space and time alternative wave prediction methods are data driven models using machine learning a typical machine learning method used in wave predictions is the artificial neural network ann model the ann was thought to be outdated in the 2000s since complex problems could not be solved using several hidden layers and many units however the ann is again being recognized in connection with the recent development of deep learning for image recognition the ann becomes a useful tool in various fields if the purpose is set up properly the first stage research in coastal engineering is a stability analysis of rubble mound breakwaters mase et al 1995 then prediction of the occurrence of wave impact forces van gent and van den boogaard 1998 mase and kitano 1999 prediction of tides deo and chaudhar 1998 wave forecasting deo and sridhar 1999 wave overtopping mase et al 2007 wave characteristics kumaram et al 2018 and storm surge forecasting kim et al 2016 2019 for instance a recent application of ann was carried out by tsai et al 2018 for forecasting wave heights along a ship s route during hurricanes james et al 2018 for spatially variable wave heights input from measured wave conditions ocean current nowcasts and reported winds and by tom et al 2018 for wave predictions along coasts of the sea of japan using atmospheric pressure and wind speeds yoon et al 2013 applied ann to the time dependent sediment suspension in the surf zone in particular makarynskyy et al 2005 used the ann to forecast waves with the lead times of 3 6 12 and 24 h ahead using the previous two days wave data as input londhe and panchang 2006 carried out a one day wave forecast using wave data of the last seven days both studies used ann for the time series analysis deo et al 2001 used wind velocity at the earlier time step as the input data of ann and zamani et al 2008 used the wind velocity and wave height at the last time step for forecasting waves suh and oh 2018 used previous wave heights previous and forecasted winds and sea level pressure obtained from wavelet analysis the lead time of wave predictions by these studies were 3 12 and 24 h ahead a wave prediction with longer lead times preferably one week in advance is required for large scale marine construction projects such as installations of caissons ocean windmills offshore fishing banks and other activities to ensure efficient and safe work currently there are three global wave forecast datasets that offer more than one week ahead these forecasts are available from the japan meteorological agency jma national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf jma noaa and ecmwf use wave models of mri iii wavewatch iii and wam respectively hara et al 2019 examined the accuracy of 3 day wave predictions in nearshore waters of japan forecasted by the wave model mri iii japan meteorological agency at 60 locations for five years in comparison with observations they introduced a hit rate by using a 1 m wave height and 10 s wave period threshold to judge whether or not marine construction can be carried out in the nearshore water of japan hara et al 2019 showed the forecast wave data of jma are able to be used for judging it in the range of 80 90 of the hit rate however the accuracy of waves forecasted one week in the future is uncertain tsuda et al 2017 proposed a wave prediction method that produces a one week forecast using a neural network with input data of several nearshore wave data and meteorological observations at nine sites accurate predictions were obtained for a target site port of hitachinaka but spike noises occasionally appeared another problem is the method requires many trial and error attempts to select suitable input data when applying it to a different target site in addition a prediction is not practical when the observed wave and wind data are missing due to instrumental disorder or communication interception our ultimate goal in this study is to provide reliable nearshore wave data up to one week ahead in real time by transforming global wave forecasts into nearshore ones within a framework for predicting nearshore waves the framework consists of two machine learning techniques of group method of data handling gmdh and artificial neural network ann trained with three global wave datasets forecasted up to one week in advance 168 h released by jma noaa and ecmwf however it is challenging to collect wave heights and periods forecasted and delivered in real time from three institutes therefore the goal of the present study as a first step of the project is to hindcast observed wave heights and periods using the framework compounding two techniques trained by three initial values of forecast and reanalyzed global wave data analysis for six years from january 1 2010 to december 31 2015 hence the purpose is likely that the machine learning model trained with the global wave data either hindcasts or improves the wave height and period first the accuracy of three global wave data is assessed in comparison with nearshore wave data observed by nationwide ocean wave information network for ports and harbours nowphas at the port of hitachinaka japan then the performance of the gmdh based ann based wave model is evaluated by comparing the predicted waves to the observed ones at the port of hitachinaka the essence of this study is to accurately transform the global wave height and period to the nearshore wave ones in addition the framework infers to support the decision making of marine construction by two techniques providing options in which wave information is reliable among global and nearshore waves the development of the framework for predicting nearshore waves as well as the global wave data are explained in section 2 results of comparisons between the estimations and observations are described in section 3 the discussion is given in section 4 the main findings of this study are summarized in section 5 2 methods 2 1 global wave data and nearshore wave data 2 1 1 global wave data three operational global wave forecasts by jma noaa and ecmwf are delivered every 6 or 12 h table 1 shows the three operational global wave forecasts abbreviated as jma gwm noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 for their grid interval calculation area spectral components forecast cycle forecast length forecast interval and surface forcing together with information of supporting documents these datasets provide a forecast of at least 180 h in summary spatial resolutions of ecmwf era5 are 0 36 higher than those of jma gwm and noaa ww3 which are 0 5 spectral components of noaa ww3 use 50 frequencies while those of jma gwm and ecmwf era5 roughly use 25 and 30 frequencies a significant difference in surface forcing is a coupling with an atmospheric model ecmwf era5 is a component of a coupled system while jma gwm and noaa ww3 are both stand alone models fig 1 denotes schematics how the machine learning technique in the framework transforms nearshore waves nowphas using the re analyzed global waves ecmwf and initial ones for forecasting jma and noaa fig 1 a shows the process for wave prediction in the framework fig 1 b describes the forecast cycle where the horizontal axis represents time with initial reanalyzed values surrounded by a blue ellipse and the vertical axis represents forecasts with a unit of an hour each circle indicates a forecast value the yellow box indicates a global wave forecast with the initial start time of 00 00 and forecast in increments of 3 h the blue ellipse along the real time cycle denotes initial and reanalysis data of the global wave model a final purpose of this project is to utilize global waves forecasted up to one week in advance in the yellow box for the prediction of nearshore waves however as the first stage of the project the present study takes an approach to only use the initial values of jma gwm and noaa ww3 forecasts and the reanalyzed ones of ecmwf era5 in the blue ellipse as input data to develop the gmdh based and ann based wave models and not using the global wave forecast data shown as real time cycles in the yellow box the resulting output is the downscaled nearshore wave data nowphas corresponding to the time of the global forecast initial reanalysis wave data at a target site of the port of hitachinaka see fig 2 the data of jma gwm noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 are h s t p h s t m02 hs t m01 respectively where h s is the significant wave heights obtained from total energy t p is the peak period of energy spectrum in a dominant wave direction t m02 and t m01 are the periods obtained from the second and first moment of the energy spectrum respectively we collected the 6 hourly wave for 6 years from january 1 2010 to december 31 2015 2 1 2 nearshore wave data the real time wave information system in japan is called nationwide ocean wave information network for ports and harbours nowphas and is operated by government supported organizations there are 78 sites as of april 2016 this study targets the port of hitachinaka 36 395 n 140 653 e for the following reasons 1 it is a location where long term observation data is available and 2 it is a location of high marine activity where predictive accuracy is important the employed data of significant wave heights and periods h s and t s defined by the zero up crossing method include a period of 6 years of data from january 1 2010 to december 31 2015 with a temporal resolution of 6 h the observation equipment is moored at the water depth of 30 3 m offshore as shown in fig 2 the grid positions of three global wave data jma gwm noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 are 36 5 n 141 0 e 36 5 n 141 0 e and 36 36 n 140 76 e respectively the water depths at the grids of the global wave models extracted in the study are approximately 50 m for ecmwf era5 and 120 m for both jma gwm and noaa ww3 in addition the distance between the nowphas location and each global wave value is roughly a distance of 10 4 km for ecmwf era5 and 33 3 km for both jma gwm and noaa ww3 even though the present study validates the wave prediction framework at one site we believe our framework could be applied to other nearshore waters where observations are available 2 2 group method of data handling gmdh 2 2 1 outline of gmdh the gmdh is a machine learning technique that uses computer based mathematical modeling of multi parametric regression characterized by fully automatic structural and parametric optimization first introduced by ivankhnenko 1971 the gmdh is used in data mining knowledge discovery prediction sophisticated systems modeling optimization and pattern recognition onwubolu 2009 a recent application of gmdh in coastal engineering was made for wave overtopping formulation on inclined seawalls by lee and suh 2019 the algorithm of gmdh can be characterized by a self selecting procedure deriving a multi order polynomial to predict an accurate output each element consisting of two input parameters in the gmdh network implements a nonlinear function of its inputs and is filtered out by the self selection threshold through the multiple layers in a layer unnecessary elements are removed and the effective ones are newly generated in the next layer after several layers the best performing model combining the useful components is established for the output since its procedure is similar to a feed forward transformation the algorithm is called a polynomial neural network onwubolu 2009 the outline of the procedure is shown in fig 3 a the complete expression of a system is written as 1 φ f x 1 x 2 x n where x 1 x 2 x n are inputs and is an output in general the relationship between the input and output can be represented by an infinite volterra kolmogorov gabor vkg polynomial of the form ivankhnenko 1971 2 φ a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a i j x i x j i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n a i j k x i x j x k where a 0 a i a i j and a i j k are constants eq 2 is constructed using the following intermediate variable expressed by a quadratic polynomial of two variable combinations x i and x j among all variables 3 y k b k 0 b k 1 x i b k 2 x j b k 3 x i x j b k 4 x i 2 b k 5 x j 2 k 1 2 n n 1 2 c 2 n where b k 0 b k 1 b k 5 are constants to be determined eq 3 is called a partial expression y k s become variables in the next step the gmdh algorism is as follows a step 1 determine the inputs x 1 x 2 x n and output b step 2 divide the data into training data n t validation data n c and test data n p c step 3 make new variables by combining two input variables as eq 3 and determine the constants b k 0 b k 1 b k 5 by the least square method as 4 e t r n n 1 n t φ n y k n 2 e t r n b k i 0 d step 4 select useful variables from y k s of which sum of square errors e c h k described below are under a certain level self selection threshold 5 e c h k n 1 n c φ n y k n 2 e step 5 repeat step 3 and 4 by setting x i y i and x j y j until the square error is not improved any more 2 2 2 gmdh based wave model in the present study since three types of global wave data jma gwm noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 are used eq 3 can be easily represented by three variables for nearshore wave output the gmdh procedure for the nearshore wave prediction is sketched as fig 3 b table 2 summarizes gmdh based wave models where the model nos 1 to 3 use a pair of two global wave data while the model no 4 uses a combination of three global wave data in the first layer of gmdh three eq 3 are established for the wave model of no 4 with three pairs of the global wave data and then are assessed by the minimum least squares error of eq 5 two of them which have smaller errors between three pairs are selected in the second layer in this stage each pair generates a predicted variable that is to say the two newly created variables are used to build new eq 3 for predicting the wave height period for the wave models of nos 1 to 3 the procedure of the gmdh based wave model seen in fig 3 is terminated in the first layer the input consisting of 6 years of data from january 1 2010 to december 31 2015 with a temporal resolution of 6 h is divided into the training data from 2010 through 2013 validation data of 2014 and testing data of 2015 the target site is the port of hitachinaka 2 3 artificial neural network ann 2 3 1 outline of ann the artificial neural network ann is an information processing system that models the structure of the human brain a neural network can deal with inputs and outputs whose interrelationship is ambiguous an artificial system of human neurons is called a unit a unit has many input signals and only one output signal the unit is connected by pathways that correspond to synaptic connections with signals transmitted in one direction input signals are multiplied by the weights of the pathways summed and fed into the unit with a bias the unit provides an output signal through a nonlinear transfer function 2 3 2 ann based wave model a three layered feed forward network was employed in this study an input layer one hidden layer and an output layer multilayer perceptron the transfer functions were as follows a tan sigmoid function in the hidden layer and a linear function in an output layer kim et al 2016 2019 the input data for each test used nowphas gauge data and the following global wave data 1 one type of global wave data type model nos 5 to 7 or 2 a combination of global wave data model nos 8 to 11 output data were significant wave height and period at the port of hitachinaka as listed in table 3 the back propagation training algorithms used here were 1 the scaled conjugate gradient scg algorithm together with the early stopping and 2 the levenberg marquardt lm method with the bayesian regulation that is over fitting is prevented by early stopping or bayesian regulation depending on training methods the ann architecture consisted of an input layer one hidden layer and an output layer where five and ten hidden units were used for each test case the layers nodes and types of transfer functions were selected from the result of tom et al 2018 the input data into the ann was similar to the gmdh testing and consisted of 6 years of data that was divided into the following datasets 1 training dataset for the period of 2010 through 2013 2 validation dataset for the year of 2014 and 3 test dataset for the year of 2015 the validation data was not used when using the bayesian regulation technique the schematic of the ann is shown in fig 4 the present ann structure used is small and at most only three inputs are needed therefore the ann parameters of weights and thresholds are expected to be obtained well furthermore the ann based wave model utilizing only one kind of global wave data can transform to a nearshore wave value on the other hand the gmdh based wave model needs at least two kinds of global wave data because the gmdh method in the present approach to the development of the gmdh based wave model needs more than two variables to satisfy eq 3 hence an advantage of the ann based wave model is that a smaller dataset can train it 3 results of comparisons 3 1 comparisons of global wave data table 4 figs 5 7 give global wave model skills for the target location at the port of hitachinaka which is measured by the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse between global wave data and observations we directly assessed the wave height and period of the global wave model with those of nowphas even though the global wave model wave parameters differs as summarized in table 4 the reason for the direct comparison is that the present study aims to transform the global wave data into the nearshore wave data using the machine learning technique of the global wave models used in this study the best skills of cc and rmse for both the significant wave height and period are obtained from ecmwf era5 on the other hand the skills of jma gwm and noaa ww3 show smaller ccs and larger rmses for both the wave height and period than those of ecmwf era5 as shown in figs 5 7 the ccs rmses of ecmwf era5 are 0 896 0 29 m and 0 748 1 69 s for the wave height and period respectively while those of jma gwm and noaa ww3 are 0 820 0 67 m and 0 570 2 21 s and 0 786 0 49 m and 0 375 3 27 s respectively for the wave height the predicted wave heights of jma gwm and noaa ww3 are generally larger than the observed wave height fig 5 a and 6 a while that of ecmwf era5 agrees well with the observed one fig 7 a for the wave period the wave periods predicted by jma gwm and noaa ww3 are overall larger than the observed period fig 5 b and 6 b while that of ecmwf era5 is smaller fig 7 b such a result could be explained from the grid position of the ecmwf era5 model extracted here being the closest to the nowphas station as shown in fig 2 the distance between the nowphas station and the ecmwf era5 s grid is approximately 10 4 km apart while those between the observation station and the grids of jma gwm and noaa ww3 are roughly 33 3 km hence it could be said that the global wave model s characteristics such as the spatial resolution may influence the accuracy of the global wave forecast also the grid where the wave information is extracted would be one of the crucial factors for collecting the global wave data to be used for input data in the machine learning technique it should be noted in the study that the grid positioned closest to the nowphas station for each global model was determined in advance to extracting wave data another factor can be thought that ecmwf era5 is operated within a coupled system of atmospheric and ocean models while jma gwm and noaa ww3 are both stand alone wave models such difference in physics may have led to the large error in the global wave data furthermore the wave data of ecmwf era5 used are the reanalysis by the model run with observed data on the other hand the data of jma gwm and noaa ww3 collected are the initial data for forecasting in the forecast cycle it should be noticed that in general the reanalysis has higher accuracies comparing to the forecast 3 2 results by gmdh based wave model the present study aims to successfully transform the wave and improve the accuracy of wave data estimated at the port of hitachinaka by using gmdh the gmdh based wave model is individually developed for the wave height and period it should be noted that training data is a total of 4 years from 2010 through 2013 and validating and testing data are that of 2014 and 2015 respectively the model performance was assessed by the results of testing table 5 summarizes the performance skill of the gmdh based wave models model nos 1 to 4 measured by the cc and rmse in the table the upper and lower values in each column are for the wave height and period respectively the gmdh based wave height model no 3 trained with noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 shows the best performance for the wave height with cc 0 90 and rmse 0 29 m while the gmdh based wave period model no 2 consisting of jma gwm and ecmwf era5 performs best for the wave period with cc 0 763 and rmse 1 02 s the best performing models for the wave height and period in general show an identical accuracy of the reanalyzed and initialized values of the global wave data concerning the wave period the model of no 2 apparently improves the rmse 1 02 s of the wave period in comparison to the rmse 1 69 s of ecmwf era5 which shows the best performance itself for the present target location at the port of hitachinaka interestingly even though the model no 4 uses three global wave data it was not the best performance for the wave height with cc 0 871 and rmse 0 32 m and for the wave period with cc 0 724 and rmse 1 29 s contrary to the expectation from the result indicating the best performance of the model trained with data of ecmwf era5 it was found that the location of the grid of global wave model may influence the accuracy of the gmdh based wave model and would be a key factor for selecting global wave data as input data as described in section 3 1 in addition the larger dataset for the input data of gmdh does no guarantee the higher accuracy in the output thus relatively less accurate global wave data may negatively affect the model accuracy of the gmdh based model comparisons between the best performance model and observation for the wave height are shown in fig 8 while for the wave period in fig 9 fig 8 a reveals time series of the gmdh based wave height model no 3 trained by the combination of noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 gives a good performance for the estimation of the significant wave height although the gmdh based wave model underestimates several higher wave heights appearing in july october november and december see fig 8 a time series of the gmdh based wave period model no 2 trained with a pair of jma gwm and ecmwf era5 are shown in fig 9 a showing a good agreement with the observation except for the lower wave period near 6 s the low accuracy of the gmdh base wave period model comes from the low accuracy of the global wave period data that are used to train it notice that the improvement of the estimation of wave height and period is more remarkable when comparing fig 8 b and 9 b with figs 5 b 7 b figs 10 and 11 show results of the wave height and period predicted by the gmdh based wave height and period models model no 4 trained with three global wave data comparing the results of the model no 4 figs 10 and 11 with those of the models no 3 fig 8 and no 2 fig 9 the gmdh based wave models model no 4 using three global wave data underestimate the wave height and period in addition it is shown that the wave height and period predicted by the model no 4 are widely scattered against the observation as seen in fig 10 b and 11 b and are underestimated in comparison to those estimated by the models no 3 and 2 the best performing gmdh based wave models of no 3 and no 2 for the wave height and period respectively are as follows 6 h s ww 3 wam 0 123 0 137 h s ww 3 1 285 h s wam 0 154 h s ww 3 h s wam 0 276 h s ww 3 2 0 401 h s wam 2 7 t s gwm wam 4 523 0 496 t p gwm 0 660 t m 01 wam 0 037 t m 02 gwm t m 01 wam 0 021 t m 02 gwm 2 0 008 t m 01 wam 2 where the subscript shows the global wave datum by using these equations we can transform the offshore wave height of the global wave height and period to the nearshore wave values at the port of hitachinaka one advantage of using gmdh is constructing the nonlinear regression equation easily as eqs 6 and 7 compared to other regression analyses 3 3 results by ann based wave model in this section the accuracy of the ann based wave model is examined for different input parameters as an example comparisons between the observations and predictions for the ann based wave height model trained with jma gwm and the 10 units model no 5 are shown in fig 12 firstly the model no 5 predicted h s was compared to the observations and it was found that cc is 0 810 and rmse is 0 40 m fig 12 a the resulting values show a considerable improvement in comparison to the original jma gwm wave data cc 0 820 and rmse 0 67 m see table 4 and fig 5 a secondly the model no 5 predicted t s was compared to observations and it was found that the values of cc and rmse are 0 571 and 1 29 s respectively the cc value is similar to that obtained from the direct comparison between the observation and jma gwm wave data cc 0 570 and rmse 2 21 s see table 4 and fig 5 b while the rmse is improved more than 0 9 s in tables 6 and 7 the significant wave heights h s and periods t s estimated by the ann based wave models trained with 5 and 10 hidden units are summarized in terms of cc and rmse according to the values of cc and rmse differences in the accuracy between the 5 and 10 hidden units are not significant both for h s and t s however it was found that using multiple inputs such as in the model nos 8 to 11 generally shows improved accuracy of h s in comparison to models trained with only a single type of wave forecast input models nos 5 6 and 7 for the wave height the cc and rmse values in model no 7 trained by ecmwf era5 with the 10 units show the best for single dataset input with scores of 0 895 and 0 29 m while those in model no 10 trained by noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 with 10 units is the best for multiple types of dataset input with the cc and rmse of 0 90 and 0 28 m respectively for the wave period the ann based wave period model trained with ecmwf ear5 and the 5 units model no 7 are best with the cc and rmse of 0 744 and 1 06 s for the single dataset input while that trained with jma gwm and ecmwf era5 and the 5 units model no 9 is the best model for the multiple dataset input as a result the models for the wave height and period when trained with ecmwf era5 are best among the models trained with a single dataset input in addition the models for the wave height and period when trained with multiple input datasets including ecmwf era5 could show the highest accuracy this result is in line with that of the gmdh based model in other words regardless of the type of the machine learning model it was found at the identical site that the input data govern the accuracy of the supervised machine learning method however it was seen that the ann based model is insensitive to the number of units used at the port of hitachinaka fig 13 a shows a plot of the time series between the observed and estimated h s from the ann based wave model trained with noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 and the 10 units model no 10 fig 13 b shows the one to one comparison between observations and estimations as seen from the figures it can be said that the ann based wave height model no 10 well estimates the observations for the wave period similar results can be seen from the ann based wave period model trained with jma gwm and ecmwf era5 and the 5 units model no 9 as shown in fig 14 two inputs combining noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 or jma gwm and ecmwf era5 showed a best performance for h s and t s respectively time series of the observed and estimated t s by the ann based wave period model trained with jma gwm and ecmwf era5 and the 5 hidden units model no 9 are given in fig 14 a and its one to one comparison is shown in fig 14 b as similar to h s the ann based wave period model no 9 shows a good correspondence to the observations of the wave period 4 discussion by utilizing the global forecast wave data of ecmwf era5 jmw gwm and noaa ww3 two kinds of wave estimation models for the wave height and period have been developed using the machine learning techniques of gmdh and ann at the port of hitachinaka it was found that training both the gmdh based and ann based wave height models with the combination of noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 was the best for hs in comparison to either training them with a single or three global wave datasets also the combination of jma gwm and ecmwf era5 was the best input dataset for ts in both the gmdh based and ann based wave period models interestingly the dataset of ecmwf era5 was commonly included as an input parameter for both the best performing gmdh and ann models the results imply that combining the ecmwf era5 dataset with other types of datasets into the input parameter set in the machine learning model leads to a good performance in training at the port of hitachinaka in the present study the wave data of ecmwf era5 promised a good performance at this location hence the study confirmed the dependence of the machine learning based model on a particular site so that when applying this method to the nearshore site the machine learning based wave model should be assessed with a variety of either pairs of or single global wave data furthermore we have trained the models in this study using data extracted from the dataset grid points nearest to the nowphas wave gauge at the port of hitachinaka however when considering increasing input data for training using grid points around the observation location may influence the accuracy of either gmdh or ann it is ideal to use an actual one week ahead forecast data as shown in fig 1 for predicting waves at nearshore regions but the present study instead only used the initial reanalysis global wave data for the first investigation the success of this study would lead to the possibility of transforming global wave data into nearshore wave data using forecasted global wave data since the estimation results by the gmdh and ann based wave models are sufficient it is expected that forecasted wave data can be transformed into nearshore waves for a specific nearshore site by gmdh and ann an advantage of using gmdh is a simple polynomial equation can represent wave estimations and the benefit of ann is only one kind of global wave forecast data is required to transform it well an important point is since site specific characteristics exist the global wave datasets used should be checked for instance wave transformation such as wave diffraction and reflection influences the relation between offshore waves forecasted by a global wave model and nearshore waves furthermore global wave model oriented features such as spatial resolutions and geographical shape reflected grids representing topography and bathymetry should be investigated for a distinct nearshore site when developing the machine learning based wave model that utilize global wave data then after proper training to learn the relation by gmdh or ann we can obtain wave estimations a week ahead at specific nearshore sites the current method using gmdh and ann relies on the quality of the global wave data forecasted for the location where are relatively plain also it needs observed wave data to train the models of gmdh and ann 5 conclusions this study introduces a framework for transforming global waves to nearshore ones utilizing global wave data for the estimation of nearshore waves using machine learning techniques of group method of data handling gmdh and artificial neural network ann gmdh and ann were trained to compensate for the coarse spatial resolution of global wave data initial forecasted and by japan meteorological agency jma national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and reanalyzed by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the estimations by the gmdh and ann based wave models trained with global wave data were compared with observed significant wave heights and periods at the port of hitachinaka using a year of test data after training by gmh and ann the main results are as follows it was found when global wave data from the noaa and ecmwf wave models were used together in the partial expression of gmdh the estimations of significant wave heights agreed well with observed ones for significant wave periods the data combination of both jma and ecmwf wave models produce good estimations this tendency was also in line with a tendency found when using ann since the present framework is to transform global wave data by gmdh or ann to nearshore waves it is expected that the wave prediction for up to one week can be carried out using global wave forecasts and a trained gmdh or ann the framework can be applied to any concerned location where the nearshore wave data are obtained credit authorship contribution statement sooyoul kim conceptualization

21096,the present study introduces a framework for predicting nearshore waves using two machine learning techniques of group method of data handling gmdh and artificial neural network ann trained with three global wave datasets of japan meteorological agency jma national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf prior to our ultimate goal of forecasting nearshore waves up to one week in advance the current study challenges to hindcast nearshore wave heights and periods for a target year at the port of hitachinaka japan using the framework compounding gmdh and ann trained with the initially forecasted 0 h and reanalyzed two datasets it was found that the gmdh based wave model trained with noaa and ecmwf well predicted observed significant wave heights while a combination of jma and ecmwf for training gave the best performance for significant wave periods the same tendency was found when using ann since the present framework successfully transforms global waves into local nearshore waves it can be said that the framework for the nearshore wave prediction is able to support the one week ahead wave prediction and to be implemented at a particular location where the nearshore wave observations are available keywords wave prediction global wave nearshore wave group method of data handling gmdh artificial neural network ann 1 introduction wave forecasts predictions are used for shipping schedule planning offshore fishing marine construction work and maritime recreation activity also predictions aid in understanding the real time state of high waves during stormy weather these wave predictions are usually up to 3 days 72 h and are carried out by many organizations and researchers e g aono et al 1993 tom et al 2010 minguez et al 2013 chong and li 2015 vanem 2011 suzuki et al 2016 mase et al 2017 an approach to the wave forecast is to directly utilize wave models of wam wamdi group 1988 wavewatch iii tolman 2009 and swan booij et al 1999 all are based on solving the wave action balance equation under wind input non linear wave interactions white capping depth limited wave braking and bed frictional dissipation in space and time alternative wave prediction methods are data driven models using machine learning a typical machine learning method used in wave predictions is the artificial neural network ann model the ann was thought to be outdated in the 2000s since complex problems could not be solved using several hidden layers and many units however the ann is again being recognized in connection with the recent development of deep learning for image recognition the ann becomes a useful tool in various fields if the purpose is set up properly the first stage research in coastal engineering is a stability analysis of rubble mound breakwaters mase et al 1995 then prediction of the occurrence of wave impact forces van gent and van den boogaard 1998 mase and kitano 1999 prediction of tides deo and chaudhar 1998 wave forecasting deo and sridhar 1999 wave overtopping mase et al 2007 wave characteristics kumaram et al 2018 and storm surge forecasting kim et al 2016 2019 for instance a recent application of ann was carried out by tsai et al 2018 for forecasting wave heights along a ship s route during hurricanes james et al 2018 for spatially variable wave heights input from measured wave conditions ocean current nowcasts and reported winds and by tom et al 2018 for wave predictions along coasts of the sea of japan using atmospheric pressure and wind speeds yoon et al 2013 applied ann to the time dependent sediment suspension in the surf zone in particular makarynskyy et al 2005 used the ann to forecast waves with the lead times of 3 6 12 and 24 h ahead using the previous two days wave data as input londhe and panchang 2006 carried out a one day wave forecast using wave data of the last seven days both studies used ann for the time series analysis deo et al 2001 used wind velocity at the earlier time step as the input data of ann and zamani et al 2008 used the wind velocity and wave height at the last time step for forecasting waves suh and oh 2018 used previous wave heights previous and forecasted winds and sea level pressure obtained from wavelet analysis the lead time of wave predictions by these studies were 3 12 and 24 h ahead a wave prediction with longer lead times preferably one week in advance is required for large scale marine construction projects such as installations of caissons ocean windmills offshore fishing banks and other activities to ensure efficient and safe work currently there are three global wave forecast datasets that offer more than one week ahead these forecasts are available from the japan meteorological agency jma national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf jma noaa and ecmwf use wave models of mri iii wavewatch iii and wam respectively hara et al 2019 examined the accuracy of 3 day wave predictions in nearshore waters of japan forecasted by the wave model mri iii japan meteorological agency at 60 locations for five years in comparison with observations they introduced a hit rate by using a 1 m wave height and 10 s wave period threshold to judge whether or not marine construction can be carried out in the nearshore water of japan hara et al 2019 showed the forecast wave data of jma are able to be used for judging it in the range of 80 90 of the hit rate however the accuracy of waves forecasted one week in the future is uncertain tsuda et al 2017 proposed a wave prediction method that produces a one week forecast using a neural network with input data of several nearshore wave data and meteorological observations at nine sites accurate predictions were obtained for a target site port of hitachinaka but spike noises occasionally appeared another problem is the method requires many trial and error attempts to select suitable input data when applying it to a different target site in addition a prediction is not practical when the observed wave and wind data are missing due to instrumental disorder or communication interception our ultimate goal in this study is to provide reliable nearshore wave data up to one week ahead in real time by transforming global wave forecasts into nearshore ones within a framework for predicting nearshore waves the framework consists of two machine learning techniques of group method of data handling gmdh and artificial neural network ann trained with three global wave datasets forecasted up to one week in advance 168 h released by jma noaa and ecmwf however it is challenging to collect wave heights and periods forecasted and delivered in real time from three institutes therefore the goal of the present study as a first step of the project is to hindcast observed wave heights and periods using the framework compounding two techniques trained by three initial values of forecast and reanalyzed global wave data analysis for six years from january 1 2010 to december 31 2015 hence the purpose is likely that the machine learning model trained with the global wave data either hindcasts or improves the wave height and period first the accuracy of three global wave data is assessed in comparison with nearshore wave data observed by nationwide ocean wave information network for ports and harbours nowphas at the port of hitachinaka japan then the performance of the gmdh based ann based wave model is evaluated by comparing the predicted waves to the observed ones at the port of hitachinaka the essence of this study is to accurately transform the global wave height and period to the nearshore wave ones in addition the framework infers to support the decision making of marine construction by two techniques providing options in which wave information is reliable among global and nearshore waves the development of the framework for predicting nearshore waves as well as the global wave data are explained in section 2 results of comparisons between the estimations and observations are described in section 3 the discussion is given in section 4 the main findings of this study are summarized in section 5 2 methods 2 1 global wave data and nearshore wave data 2 1 1 global wave data three operational global wave forecasts by jma noaa and ecmwf are delivered every 6 or 12 h table 1 shows the three operational global wave forecasts abbreviated as jma gwm noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 for their grid interval calculation area spectral components forecast cycle forecast length forecast interval and surface forcing together with information of supporting documents these datasets provide a forecast of at least 180 h in summary spatial resolutions of ecmwf era5 are 0 36 higher than those of jma gwm and noaa ww3 which are 0 5 spectral components of noaa ww3 use 50 frequencies while those of jma gwm and ecmwf era5 roughly use 25 and 30 frequencies a significant difference in surface forcing is a coupling with an atmospheric model ecmwf era5 is a component of a coupled system while jma gwm and noaa ww3 are both stand alone models fig 1 denotes schematics how the machine learning technique in the framework transforms nearshore waves nowphas using the re analyzed global waves ecmwf and initial ones for forecasting jma and noaa fig 1 a shows the process for wave prediction in the framework fig 1 b describes the forecast cycle where the horizontal axis represents time with initial reanalyzed values surrounded by a blue ellipse and the vertical axis represents forecasts with a unit of an hour each circle indicates a forecast value the yellow box indicates a global wave forecast with the initial start time of 00 00 and forecast in increments of 3 h the blue ellipse along the real time cycle denotes initial and reanalysis data of the global wave model a final purpose of this project is to utilize global waves forecasted up to one week in advance in the yellow box for the prediction of nearshore waves however as the first stage of the project the present study takes an approach to only use the initial values of jma gwm and noaa ww3 forecasts and the reanalyzed ones of ecmwf era5 in the blue ellipse as input data to develop the gmdh based and ann based wave models and not using the global wave forecast data shown as real time cycles in the yellow box the resulting output is the downscaled nearshore wave data nowphas corresponding to the time of the global forecast initial reanalysis wave data at a target site of the port of hitachinaka see fig 2 the data of jma gwm noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 are h s t p h s t m02 hs t m01 respectively where h s is the significant wave heights obtained from total energy t p is the peak period of energy spectrum in a dominant wave direction t m02 and t m01 are the periods obtained from the second and first moment of the energy spectrum respectively we collected the 6 hourly wave for 6 years from january 1 2010 to december 31 2015 2 1 2 nearshore wave data the real time wave information system in japan is called nationwide ocean wave information network for ports and harbours nowphas and is operated by government supported organizations there are 78 sites as of april 2016 this study targets the port of hitachinaka 36 395 n 140 653 e for the following reasons 1 it is a location where long term observation data is available and 2 it is a location of high marine activity where predictive accuracy is important the employed data of significant wave heights and periods h s and t s defined by the zero up crossing method include a period of 6 years of data from january 1 2010 to december 31 2015 with a temporal resolution of 6 h the observation equipment is moored at the water depth of 30 3 m offshore as shown in fig 2 the grid positions of three global wave data jma gwm noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 are 36 5 n 141 0 e 36 5 n 141 0 e and 36 36 n 140 76 e respectively the water depths at the grids of the global wave models extracted in the study are approximately 50 m for ecmwf era5 and 120 m for both jma gwm and noaa ww3 in addition the distance between the nowphas location and each global wave value is roughly a distance of 10 4 km for ecmwf era5 and 33 3 km for both jma gwm and noaa ww3 even though the present study validates the wave prediction framework at one site we believe our framework could be applied to other nearshore waters where observations are available 2 2 group method of data handling gmdh 2 2 1 outline of gmdh the gmdh is a machine learning technique that uses computer based mathematical modeling of multi parametric regression characterized by fully automatic structural and parametric optimization first introduced by ivankhnenko 1971 the gmdh is used in data mining knowledge discovery prediction sophisticated systems modeling optimization and pattern recognition onwubolu 2009 a recent application of gmdh in coastal engineering was made for wave overtopping formulation on inclined seawalls by lee and suh 2019 the algorithm of gmdh can be characterized by a self selecting procedure deriving a multi order polynomial to predict an accurate output each element consisting of two input parameters in the gmdh network implements a nonlinear function of its inputs and is filtered out by the self selection threshold through the multiple layers in a layer unnecessary elements are removed and the effective ones are newly generated in the next layer after several layers the best performing model combining the useful components is established for the output since its procedure is similar to a feed forward transformation the algorithm is called a polynomial neural network onwubolu 2009 the outline of the procedure is shown in fig 3 a the complete expression of a system is written as 1 φ f x 1 x 2 x n where x 1 x 2 x n are inputs and is an output in general the relationship between the input and output can be represented by an infinite volterra kolmogorov gabor vkg polynomial of the form ivankhnenko 1971 2 φ a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a i j x i x j i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n a i j k x i x j x k where a 0 a i a i j and a i j k are constants eq 2 is constructed using the following intermediate variable expressed by a quadratic polynomial of two variable combinations x i and x j among all variables 3 y k b k 0 b k 1 x i b k 2 x j b k 3 x i x j b k 4 x i 2 b k 5 x j 2 k 1 2 n n 1 2 c 2 n where b k 0 b k 1 b k 5 are constants to be determined eq 3 is called a partial expression y k s become variables in the next step the gmdh algorism is as follows a step 1 determine the inputs x 1 x 2 x n and output b step 2 divide the data into training data n t validation data n c and test data n p c step 3 make new variables by combining two input variables as eq 3 and determine the constants b k 0 b k 1 b k 5 by the least square method as 4 e t r n n 1 n t φ n y k n 2 e t r n b k i 0 d step 4 select useful variables from y k s of which sum of square errors e c h k described below are under a certain level self selection threshold 5 e c h k n 1 n c φ n y k n 2 e step 5 repeat step 3 and 4 by setting x i y i and x j y j until the square error is not improved any more 2 2 2 gmdh based wave model in the present study since three types of global wave data jma gwm noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 are used eq 3 can be easily represented by three variables for nearshore wave output the gmdh procedure for the nearshore wave prediction is sketched as fig 3 b table 2 summarizes gmdh based wave models where the model nos 1 to 3 use a pair of two global wave data while the model no 4 uses a combination of three global wave data in the first layer of gmdh three eq 3 are established for the wave model of no 4 with three pairs of the global wave data and then are assessed by the minimum least squares error of eq 5 two of them which have smaller errors between three pairs are selected in the second layer in this stage each pair generates a predicted variable that is to say the two newly created variables are used to build new eq 3 for predicting the wave height period for the wave models of nos 1 to 3 the procedure of the gmdh based wave model seen in fig 3 is terminated in the first layer the input consisting of 6 years of data from january 1 2010 to december 31 2015 with a temporal resolution of 6 h is divided into the training data from 2010 through 2013 validation data of 2014 and testing data of 2015 the target site is the port of hitachinaka 2 3 artificial neural network ann 2 3 1 outline of ann the artificial neural network ann is an information processing system that models the structure of the human brain a neural network can deal with inputs and outputs whose interrelationship is ambiguous an artificial system of human neurons is called a unit a unit has many input signals and only one output signal the unit is connected by pathways that correspond to synaptic connections with signals transmitted in one direction input signals are multiplied by the weights of the pathways summed and fed into the unit with a bias the unit provides an output signal through a nonlinear transfer function 2 3 2 ann based wave model a three layered feed forward network was employed in this study an input layer one hidden layer and an output layer multilayer perceptron the transfer functions were as follows a tan sigmoid function in the hidden layer and a linear function in an output layer kim et al 2016 2019 the input data for each test used nowphas gauge data and the following global wave data 1 one type of global wave data type model nos 5 to 7 or 2 a combination of global wave data model nos 8 to 11 output data were significant wave height and period at the port of hitachinaka as listed in table 3 the back propagation training algorithms used here were 1 the scaled conjugate gradient scg algorithm together with the early stopping and 2 the levenberg marquardt lm method with the bayesian regulation that is over fitting is prevented by early stopping or bayesian regulation depending on training methods the ann architecture consisted of an input layer one hidden layer and an output layer where five and ten hidden units were used for each test case the layers nodes and types of transfer functions were selected from the result of tom et al 2018 the input data into the ann was similar to the gmdh testing and consisted of 6 years of data that was divided into the following datasets 1 training dataset for the period of 2010 through 2013 2 validation dataset for the year of 2014 and 3 test dataset for the year of 2015 the validation data was not used when using the bayesian regulation technique the schematic of the ann is shown in fig 4 the present ann structure used is small and at most only three inputs are needed therefore the ann parameters of weights and thresholds are expected to be obtained well furthermore the ann based wave model utilizing only one kind of global wave data can transform to a nearshore wave value on the other hand the gmdh based wave model needs at least two kinds of global wave data because the gmdh method in the present approach to the development of the gmdh based wave model needs more than two variables to satisfy eq 3 hence an advantage of the ann based wave model is that a smaller dataset can train it 3 results of comparisons 3 1 comparisons of global wave data table 4 figs 5 7 give global wave model skills for the target location at the port of hitachinaka which is measured by the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse between global wave data and observations we directly assessed the wave height and period of the global wave model with those of nowphas even though the global wave model wave parameters differs as summarized in table 4 the reason for the direct comparison is that the present study aims to transform the global wave data into the nearshore wave data using the machine learning technique of the global wave models used in this study the best skills of cc and rmse for both the significant wave height and period are obtained from ecmwf era5 on the other hand the skills of jma gwm and noaa ww3 show smaller ccs and larger rmses for both the wave height and period than those of ecmwf era5 as shown in figs 5 7 the ccs rmses of ecmwf era5 are 0 896 0 29 m and 0 748 1 69 s for the wave height and period respectively while those of jma gwm and noaa ww3 are 0 820 0 67 m and 0 570 2 21 s and 0 786 0 49 m and 0 375 3 27 s respectively for the wave height the predicted wave heights of jma gwm and noaa ww3 are generally larger than the observed wave height fig 5 a and 6 a while that of ecmwf era5 agrees well with the observed one fig 7 a for the wave period the wave periods predicted by jma gwm and noaa ww3 are overall larger than the observed period fig 5 b and 6 b while that of ecmwf era5 is smaller fig 7 b such a result could be explained from the grid position of the ecmwf era5 model extracted here being the closest to the nowphas station as shown in fig 2 the distance between the nowphas station and the ecmwf era5 s grid is approximately 10 4 km apart while those between the observation station and the grids of jma gwm and noaa ww3 are roughly 33 3 km hence it could be said that the global wave model s characteristics such as the spatial resolution may influence the accuracy of the global wave forecast also the grid where the wave information is extracted would be one of the crucial factors for collecting the global wave data to be used for input data in the machine learning technique it should be noted in the study that the grid positioned closest to the nowphas station for each global model was determined in advance to extracting wave data another factor can be thought that ecmwf era5 is operated within a coupled system of atmospheric and ocean models while jma gwm and noaa ww3 are both stand alone wave models such difference in physics may have led to the large error in the global wave data furthermore the wave data of ecmwf era5 used are the reanalysis by the model run with observed data on the other hand the data of jma gwm and noaa ww3 collected are the initial data for forecasting in the forecast cycle it should be noticed that in general the reanalysis has higher accuracies comparing to the forecast 3 2 results by gmdh based wave model the present study aims to successfully transform the wave and improve the accuracy of wave data estimated at the port of hitachinaka by using gmdh the gmdh based wave model is individually developed for the wave height and period it should be noted that training data is a total of 4 years from 2010 through 2013 and validating and testing data are that of 2014 and 2015 respectively the model performance was assessed by the results of testing table 5 summarizes the performance skill of the gmdh based wave models model nos 1 to 4 measured by the cc and rmse in the table the upper and lower values in each column are for the wave height and period respectively the gmdh based wave height model no 3 trained with noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 shows the best performance for the wave height with cc 0 90 and rmse 0 29 m while the gmdh based wave period model no 2 consisting of jma gwm and ecmwf era5 performs best for the wave period with cc 0 763 and rmse 1 02 s the best performing models for the wave height and period in general show an identical accuracy of the reanalyzed and initialized values of the global wave data concerning the wave period the model of no 2 apparently improves the rmse 1 02 s of the wave period in comparison to the rmse 1 69 s of ecmwf era5 which shows the best performance itself for the present target location at the port of hitachinaka interestingly even though the model no 4 uses three global wave data it was not the best performance for the wave height with cc 0 871 and rmse 0 32 m and for the wave period with cc 0 724 and rmse 1 29 s contrary to the expectation from the result indicating the best performance of the model trained with data of ecmwf era5 it was found that the location of the grid of global wave model may influence the accuracy of the gmdh based wave model and would be a key factor for selecting global wave data as input data as described in section 3 1 in addition the larger dataset for the input data of gmdh does no guarantee the higher accuracy in the output thus relatively less accurate global wave data may negatively affect the model accuracy of the gmdh based model comparisons between the best performance model and observation for the wave height are shown in fig 8 while for the wave period in fig 9 fig 8 a reveals time series of the gmdh based wave height model no 3 trained by the combination of noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 gives a good performance for the estimation of the significant wave height although the gmdh based wave model underestimates several higher wave heights appearing in july october november and december see fig 8 a time series of the gmdh based wave period model no 2 trained with a pair of jma gwm and ecmwf era5 are shown in fig 9 a showing a good agreement with the observation except for the lower wave period near 6 s the low accuracy of the gmdh base wave period model comes from the low accuracy of the global wave period data that are used to train it notice that the improvement of the estimation of wave height and period is more remarkable when comparing fig 8 b and 9 b with figs 5 b 7 b figs 10 and 11 show results of the wave height and period predicted by the gmdh based wave height and period models model no 4 trained with three global wave data comparing the results of the model no 4 figs 10 and 11 with those of the models no 3 fig 8 and no 2 fig 9 the gmdh based wave models model no 4 using three global wave data underestimate the wave height and period in addition it is shown that the wave height and period predicted by the model no 4 are widely scattered against the observation as seen in fig 10 b and 11 b and are underestimated in comparison to those estimated by the models no 3 and 2 the best performing gmdh based wave models of no 3 and no 2 for the wave height and period respectively are as follows 6 h s ww 3 wam 0 123 0 137 h s ww 3 1 285 h s wam 0 154 h s ww 3 h s wam 0 276 h s ww 3 2 0 401 h s wam 2 7 t s gwm wam 4 523 0 496 t p gwm 0 660 t m 01 wam 0 037 t m 02 gwm t m 01 wam 0 021 t m 02 gwm 2 0 008 t m 01 wam 2 where the subscript shows the global wave datum by using these equations we can transform the offshore wave height of the global wave height and period to the nearshore wave values at the port of hitachinaka one advantage of using gmdh is constructing the nonlinear regression equation easily as eqs 6 and 7 compared to other regression analyses 3 3 results by ann based wave model in this section the accuracy of the ann based wave model is examined for different input parameters as an example comparisons between the observations and predictions for the ann based wave height model trained with jma gwm and the 10 units model no 5 are shown in fig 12 firstly the model no 5 predicted h s was compared to the observations and it was found that cc is 0 810 and rmse is 0 40 m fig 12 a the resulting values show a considerable improvement in comparison to the original jma gwm wave data cc 0 820 and rmse 0 67 m see table 4 and fig 5 a secondly the model no 5 predicted t s was compared to observations and it was found that the values of cc and rmse are 0 571 and 1 29 s respectively the cc value is similar to that obtained from the direct comparison between the observation and jma gwm wave data cc 0 570 and rmse 2 21 s see table 4 and fig 5 b while the rmse is improved more than 0 9 s in tables 6 and 7 the significant wave heights h s and periods t s estimated by the ann based wave models trained with 5 and 10 hidden units are summarized in terms of cc and rmse according to the values of cc and rmse differences in the accuracy between the 5 and 10 hidden units are not significant both for h s and t s however it was found that using multiple inputs such as in the model nos 8 to 11 generally shows improved accuracy of h s in comparison to models trained with only a single type of wave forecast input models nos 5 6 and 7 for the wave height the cc and rmse values in model no 7 trained by ecmwf era5 with the 10 units show the best for single dataset input with scores of 0 895 and 0 29 m while those in model no 10 trained by noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 with 10 units is the best for multiple types of dataset input with the cc and rmse of 0 90 and 0 28 m respectively for the wave period the ann based wave period model trained with ecmwf ear5 and the 5 units model no 7 are best with the cc and rmse of 0 744 and 1 06 s for the single dataset input while that trained with jma gwm and ecmwf era5 and the 5 units model no 9 is the best model for the multiple dataset input as a result the models for the wave height and period when trained with ecmwf era5 are best among the models trained with a single dataset input in addition the models for the wave height and period when trained with multiple input datasets including ecmwf era5 could show the highest accuracy this result is in line with that of the gmdh based model in other words regardless of the type of the machine learning model it was found at the identical site that the input data govern the accuracy of the supervised machine learning method however it was seen that the ann based model is insensitive to the number of units used at the port of hitachinaka fig 13 a shows a plot of the time series between the observed and estimated h s from the ann based wave model trained with noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 and the 10 units model no 10 fig 13 b shows the one to one comparison between observations and estimations as seen from the figures it can be said that the ann based wave height model no 10 well estimates the observations for the wave period similar results can be seen from the ann based wave period model trained with jma gwm and ecmwf era5 and the 5 units model no 9 as shown in fig 14 two inputs combining noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 or jma gwm and ecmwf era5 showed a best performance for h s and t s respectively time series of the observed and estimated t s by the ann based wave period model trained with jma gwm and ecmwf era5 and the 5 hidden units model no 9 are given in fig 14 a and its one to one comparison is shown in fig 14 b as similar to h s the ann based wave period model no 9 shows a good correspondence to the observations of the wave period 4 discussion by utilizing the global forecast wave data of ecmwf era5 jmw gwm and noaa ww3 two kinds of wave estimation models for the wave height and period have been developed using the machine learning techniques of gmdh and ann at the port of hitachinaka it was found that training both the gmdh based and ann based wave height models with the combination of noaa ww3 and ecmwf era5 was the best for hs in comparison to either training them with a single or three global wave datasets also the combination of jma gwm and ecmwf era5 was the best input dataset for ts in both the gmdh based and ann based wave period models interestingly the dataset of ecmwf era5 was commonly included as an input parameter for both the best performing gmdh and ann models the results imply that combining the ecmwf era5 dataset with other types of datasets into the input parameter set in the machine learning model leads to a good performance in training at the port of hitachinaka in the present study the wave data of ecmwf era5 promised a good performance at this location hence the study confirmed the dependence of the machine learning based model on a particular site so that when applying this method to the nearshore site the machine learning based wave model should be assessed with a variety of either pairs of or single global wave data furthermore we have trained the models in this study using data extracted from the dataset grid points nearest to the nowphas wave gauge at the port of hitachinaka however when considering increasing input data for training using grid points around the observation location may influence the accuracy of either gmdh or ann it is ideal to use an actual one week ahead forecast data as shown in fig 1 for predicting waves at nearshore regions but the present study instead only used the initial reanalysis global wave data for the first investigation the success of this study would lead to the possibility of transforming global wave data into nearshore wave data using forecasted global wave data since the estimation results by the gmdh and ann based wave models are sufficient it is expected that forecasted wave data can be transformed into nearshore waves for a specific nearshore site by gmdh and ann an advantage of using gmdh is a simple polynomial equation can represent wave estimations and the benefit of ann is only one kind of global wave forecast data is required to transform it well an important point is since site specific characteristics exist the global wave datasets used should be checked for instance wave transformation such as wave diffraction and reflection influences the relation between offshore waves forecasted by a global wave model and nearshore waves furthermore global wave model oriented features such as spatial resolutions and geographical shape reflected grids representing topography and bathymetry should be investigated for a distinct nearshore site when developing the machine learning based wave model that utilize global wave data then after proper training to learn the relation by gmdh or ann we can obtain wave estimations a week ahead at specific nearshore sites the current method using gmdh and ann relies on the quality of the global wave data forecasted for the location where are relatively plain also it needs observed wave data to train the models of gmdh and ann 5 conclusions this study introduces a framework for transforming global waves to nearshore ones utilizing global wave data for the estimation of nearshore waves using machine learning techniques of group method of data handling gmdh and artificial neural network ann gmdh and ann were trained to compensate for the coarse spatial resolution of global wave data initial forecasted and by japan meteorological agency jma national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and reanalyzed by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the estimations by the gmdh and ann based wave models trained with global wave data were compared with observed significant wave heights and periods at the port of hitachinaka using a year of test data after training by gmh and ann the main results are as follows it was found when global wave data from the noaa and ecmwf wave models were used together in the partial expression of gmdh the estimations of significant wave heights agreed well with observed ones for significant wave periods the data combination of both jma and ecmwf wave models produce good estimations this tendency was also in line with a tendency found when using ann since the present framework is to transform global wave data by gmdh or ann to nearshore waves it is expected that the wave prediction for up to one week can be carried out using global wave forecasts and a trained gmdh or ann the framework can be applied to any concerned location where the nearshore wave data are obtained credit authorship contribution statement sooyoul kim conceptualization

21097,the increasing demand for efficient safe and economic operation of ships has drawn attention to practical maneuvering behaviors for developing autonomous ships actual sailing conditions are reproduced to determine the relationship between environmental factors and ship steering records in rough seas first we generate realistic ocean environmental fields and analyze actual sea data then we derive a modular maneuvering model reflecting environmental disturbances for further simulations the correlation and multi regression analyses are performed based on measured data and environmental factors which illustrate that the abnormal rudder angles are caused by reduced steering effectiveness finally an attenuation function acting on the rudder normal forces is proposed to simulate this type of reduction the time histories of maneuvering difficulties are selected as verification datasets the maneuvers are simulated by adopting the attenuation function and the simulation results show fair agreement with the measured data the significant wave height wind speed mean wave period current speed wind apparent direction and wave encounter angles are found to be the most statistically significant factors of rudder attenuation in the studied cases the results and conclusions obtained from this study are of great significance for the further exploration of actual ship maneuvering behaviors in seas keywords rudder attenuation ship maneuvering ocean environment onboard measuring rough sea voyage 1 introduction with the development of the shipping industry shipbuilding companies and related research institutions are pursuing ship autonomy the concept of maritime autonomous surface ship mass was introduced at the 98th session of the maritime safety committee 2017 of the international maritime organization in addition this organization has recommended conducting theoretical and experimental studies related to mass and developing different levels of autonomy there are four nonhierarchical degrees of autonomy for a mass according to the maritime safety committee 2018 1 automated processes and decision support 2 remote control with seafarers on board 3 remote control without seafarers on board and 4 full autonomy in the last three years pioneering research has been conducted to develop different degrees of mass autonomy considering favorable fundamental conditions in near shore areas reddy et al 2019 these conditions include unimpeded network communications and a stable meteorological environment however ensuring safe mass navigation in the open sea remains challenging due to the complex and changing environment in addition ship route design is restricted by meteorological conditions and the environment which may increase fuel consumption and costs vettor and guedes soares 2016 moreover load shifting risks maneuvering difficulties and capsize may occur under disturbances caused by severe weather sahoo et al 2019 these potential risks greatly hinder navigation safety and may undermine the economic benefits of using a mass therefore the operational problems during actual sailing should be analyzed especially regarding rare events occurring under severe weather this analysis may reveal relations between the environment and ship navigation thereby fostering the development of mass the influence of the ocean environment on ship navigation has remained a research hotspot in marine engineering over time ittc maneuvering ittc manoeuvring committee 2017 although the maneuverability of ships under adverse weather has not been explicitly included in regulations it became necessary since the introduction of corresponding guidelines in the eedi regulations international maritime organization 2018 several studies have addressed the characteristics of ship navigation under different environmental disturbances ueno et al 2017 conducted tank tests to investigate different rudder and propeller control methods however they recognize that measurements in real scale may allow describing highly nonlinear maneuverability under adverse weather ruiz et al 2019 investigated maneuvering considering still water and regular waves through model tests they analyzed the effects of waves on the rudder and propeller based on experimental data the maneuvering modeling group mmg model is widely used to simulate 3 dof and 4 dof maneuvers under calm water or wind wave conditions yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 the hydrodynamic performances of propeller and rudder during maneuvers are analyzed by guo et al 2018 based on the mmg model and cfd method the propeller side force and asymmetric flow straightening effect are taken into account in their study sukas et al 2019 developed a feasible code to investigate the maneuverability of any low speed ship with single rudder single propeller or twin rudder twin propeller configurations based on the mmg model besides various methods could be applied to obtain the parameters in the mmg model liu et al 2017 assess the existing empirical methods relevant to the mmg models parameters and an integrated maneuvering model for inland vessels has been developed using suitable empirical methods and rans results the viscous cfd method with the overset grid is applied to identify all the necessary parameters for the mmg model by sakamoto et al 2019 a method was proposed by yasukawa et al 2019a for predicting steady sailing conditions under environmental disturbances which effectively captures the maneuvering limit of ships under wind and wave disturbances for instance a ship may lose its steering ability and drift when sailing in irregular beam waves inspired by the work of the former jing et al 2020a 2020b proposed a practical method to construct a hydrodynamic coefficients database based on the stereolithographic model to improve the maneuvering simulation with the constantly changing wave conditions acanfora and rizzuto 2019 investigated nonlinear effects when predicting motions of a ship in beam seas at zero speed and performed a comparative simulation analysis between different models considering idealized wave spectra paravisi et al 2019 developed a simulation environment to test control strategies of unmanned surface vehicles in the simulations wind and current fields were integrated to compute the overall environmental effect aung and umeda 2020 performed various maneuvering simulations considering not only the wind and waves but also the engine load limits of a ship the initial values in the time domain simulations showed notable effects on the ship trajectories but the conditions after reaching steady state converged moreover the ship trajectory was found to be more important than the equilibrium speed to determine the safety of a ship sailing in adverse conditions however these simulations were based on ideal conditions such as constant scale and direction of winds and waves and the ocean current was not included analyzing maneuvering behaviors in real situations might reflect unaccounted sailing effects for instance tang et al 2020 integrated steering and the effects of non uniform ﬂow fields obtained from a numerical model to investigate the maneuvering performance in restricted waters e g inland rivers besides simulations various onboard measurement systems have been developed in recent years to evaluate ship performance in actual sea in addition sea trial data or onboard measured data have been used to investigate ship performance chen et al 2015 analyzed the performance of ships under ocean currents and generated high resolution kuroshio currents from a numerical model lu et al 2017 estimated waves and winds for rough sea sailing in the southern hemisphere and compared the results with measurements from a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier tsujimoto and orihara 2018 2019 thoroughly reviewed performance prediction methods and validation results of full scale ships in the sea you et al 2020 estimated the actual sea margin of a liquefied natural gas carrier using maneuvering equations although realistic winds and waves were obtained from the european center for medium range weather forecasts the environmental conditions were fixed according to the time and position of a simulated ship overall most available methods to evaluate ship maneuvering and performance are based on model tests in water basins and numerical simulations research on maneuvering in actual sea is scarce despite model ships failing to reflect full scale ship maneuverability moreover generating winds currents and waves for full scaled ships resembling the actual sea is difficult thus a fixed maneuver scheme such as turning zigzag and emergency maneuvering is adopted in many numerical simulations jing et al 2020a 2020b in practice however the rudder angle is controlled by a human operator in a discrete form on the other hand wind is assumed to be steady in simulations and short crested irregular waves are commonly generated considering idealized wave spectra and spreading functions these simplifications are adopted because the exact directions of wind and waves are difficult to estimate especially when they are not aligned consequently actual maneuvering may substantially differ from the ideal simulation results in actual sailing ships encounter following seas or bow stern quartering seas however most physical experiments and numerical simulations are limited to head seas furthermore few studies have considered the surface current effect whereas most studies have been focused on wind and waves both regular and irregular consequently actual sailing cannot be analyzed comprehensively due to insufficient reliable sensor data under realistic environmental conditions especially when sailing under severe weather sasa et al 2015 conducted long term onboard measurements from a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier from 2010 for the optimization of ship routing despite mechanical problems that impeded measurements in some periods the measured data include waves ship motion navigation and engine parameters during many severe weather events in both the southern and northern hemispheres as speed loss is the key indicator for optimal ship routing it was thoroughly investigated using data acquired in rough seas sasa et al 2017 from these studies the authors found that maneuvering in rough sea differs from that in calm sea for instance according to its deck log a ship encountered remarkable maneuvering difficulties in june 2013 due to severe weather which caused problems to maintain the ship course the corresponding onboard measurements show that the ship was frequently steered with large rudder angles during this period however the reasons underlying this maneuvering behavior remain unclear in this study we investigated the abnormal maneuvering of a ship under severe weather first the onboard measured data are analyzed then the environmental fields and maneuvering motions were reproduced based on numerical models and measured data further a rudder attenuation function is proposed based on a statistical analysis of simulation results more simulations are performed with the attenuation function the results were compared with the measured data which reveal the relations between environmental factors and maneuvering motion following this introduction section 2 describes the onboard measurements used in this study section 3 details the methods to reproduce ocean environment and ship maneuvering in simulations section 4 reports the results of the reproduced winds currents waves and maneuvering behaviors in addition results from statistical analyses based on the reproduced environment and measured data are presented finally we summarize the major findings from this study in section 5 2 ship maneuvering analysis based on onboard measurements the data measured using an actual ship s sensors provide detailed information about the navigation status and the causes of maneuvering problems can be determined by tracing back these data this section presents the measurement system configuration and then introduces information on the two study cases finally the measured data and the ranges of environmental conditions are provided intuitively 2 1 measurement system variations in ship performance were monitored by installing an onboard measuring system for the 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier the ship was built at the beginning of june 2010 and after sea trials it was put into operation by the end of june 2010 this bulk carrier is a tramper that does not have regular voyage routes the ship was managed by the japanese ship owner until the summer of 2012 following which its management shifted to a different shipping company onboard measurements were conducted three times from june 2010 to july 2011 14 months december 2012 to november 2013 12 months and july 2015 to august 2016 14 months the total period these of onboard measurements was around 40 months the measurement system comprises the nautical instrument part and the motion sensor part as shown in fig 1 the measurement system is installed in the ship bridge the nautical instrument part comprises a voyage data recorder vdr and a data logger for the ship engine the installation of a vdr is mandatory for outbound vessels such as the 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier further the ship owner installed the engine data logger to monitor the engine performance these systems are connected with nautical and engine instruments in the ship the measured information of navigation and engine parameters is sent through the ship land communication device to the shipping company every 20 min this information is recorded to the laptop pc 1 that is connected with the ship land communication device by a lan cable the main output information is the ship position ship speed ship heading rudder angle autopilot wind direction and speed engine revolutions engine power shaft thrust and fuel consumption these data are recorded on pc 1 every 1 s as raw data using a communication software the motion sensor part consists of the inertial measurement unit nav440 that can measure the rotation angles i e roll pitch and yaw rotation angle velocity and accelerations along the horizontal and vertical axes with a sampling interval of 0 1 s the laptop pc 2 is also connected to nav440 through a cable to the rs 232 port the measurement data were stored on ssd drives in these two laptop pcs and the authors collected them annually by visiting the ship in various ports or shipyards further details of the onboard measurement system can be referred elsewhere sasa et al 2015 2017 as the ship is a tramper it sailed along various routes during the three periods mentioned above these are shown in fig 2 in the first period 2010 2011 the main sailing route is the north pacific ocean and the south atlantic ocean in the second period 2012 2013 and the third period 2015 2016 the primary routes are asia oceania asia latin america across the indian ocean the south atlantic ocean and the tasman sea in the southern hemisphere although the sailing speed of the bulk carrier is designed to be 14 knots it was reduced to 12 knots for reducing fuel consumption since the shift to the new ship management in 2012 in these three periods of onboard measurements eight rough sea voyages with larger ship motions occurred chen et al 2020 the loading conditions varied in each case from a ballasted condition d 4 5 m to a full loaded condition d 9 82 m the performance of a ship such as its maneuvering or seakeeping performance is strongly influenced by the loading condition the seakeeping performance has been validated for each case using the wave estimation and seakeeping theory chen et al 2020 and the estimation accuracy is shown under different loading conditions in the voyage between china and uruguay across the indian ocean and the south atlantic ocean from may 11 2013 to june 18 2013 the ship encountered rough seas twice off the coasts of south africa and latin america this is the only voyage for which the deck log book notes difficulties in maintaining the ship s course during these two rough sea voyages overall the measured data are suitable for evaluating the maneuvering difficulty which is focused on in this study table 1 lists the main dimensions of the ship the loading condition was the half loaded condition d 8 16 m during the voyage and was relatively close to the full loaded condition 2 2 study cases the geographic location and corresponding period of the two study cases considered in this study are listed in table 2 and the voyage track line is shown in fig 3 in case 1 the bulk carrier navigated from china to uruguay crossing the indian ocean and the south atlantic ocean through the coast of south africa in early june of 2013 in case 2 the bulk carrier navigated from south africa to uruguay crossing the south atlantic ocean in mid june of 2013 the bulk carrier was half loaded mean draft of 8 16 m in both cases in table 2 the events correspond to maneuvering difficulties reported in the deck log for the two cases the bulk carrier faced adverse weather for approximately 10 h in case 1 and 6 h in case 2 2 3 variations in measured parameters the measured parameters on june 2 7 2013 case 1 and june 13 18 2013 case 2 are depicted in fig 4 these are periods for which difficulties in maintaining the course were noted the roll and pitch angles are expressed as significant values obtained by zero up crossing for a 10 min window every 0 1 s as the rudder angles always vary around zero zero up crossing is also applied to the raw rudder data obtaining significant values δ s the observed engine revolutions ship speed and heading are shown as average values over 10 min every 1 s the periods corresponding to maneuvering difficulties in the two cases are marked by rectangles in the graphs very large and frequently changing rudder maneuvers above 20 are observed in each case 1 3 days for case 1 and 2 3 days for case 2 over long periods the ship speed and engine revolutions were reduced during these rudder maneuvers moreover the ship heading changed considerably by approximately 45 around the period of maneuvering difficulties in each case furthermore large roll and pitch angles were measured in each case especially during the frequent rudder maneuvers 2 4 estimation of environmental factors the environmental conditions must be known to analyze the ship s performances in actual seas in the onboard measurement the wind information wind speed and wind direction is available during the measured periods however the wave information is not available even though it is evidently crucial for estimating the ship performance the authors estimated the ocean wave information using reanalysis weather data and a third generation wave model to compute the wave directional spectrum at each grid point the ship motions can be estimated by using the computed wave directional spectrum and the frequency response functions in each wave direction if the estimated ship motions agree with the measured ones it would indicate that the estimated wave information can reliably reflect the external conditions as mentioned above the authors have validated the numerical estimation of waves using ncep fnl kalnay et al 1996 and era interim dee et al 2011 for various sea regions cases 1 and 2 are included and loading conditions lu et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the sea conditions in the southern hemisphere tend to be rougher owing to the fewer landmasses in this region lu et al 2017 during this period ships were unable to maintain their course in rough seas correspondingly large and frequently changing rudder angles were measured on june 1 4 and 14 17 however the underlying factors explaining such angles remain unclear therefore we analyze the maneuvering behaviors as two cases by using the corresponding measurements and environmental data 3 reproduction of cases via simulation the maneuvering issues that occurred in the cases are closely related to the disturbances of the ocean environment therefore we attempt to reproduce the ocean environment and maneuvering behavior through simulations to explore the reasons for the issues this section presents the simulation mechanisms of both the ocean environment and the maneuvering motion 3 1 reproduction of ocean environment this section explains the numerical model adopted in the ocean simulation and introduces the procedures for integrating the spatiotemporal ocean fields into time domain maneuvering simulations 3 1 1 winds currents and waves the ocean surface wind current and wave fields are the most important parameters to reproduce a realistic ocean environment the third generation wave numerical model wavewatch iii is applied to reproduce wave fields tolman 2014 this model solves the random phase spectral action density balance equation for the wave directional spectrum the solution is detailed in eq 1 where n s is the wave directional spectrum c g is the wave group velocity v c is the current velocity s is the coordinate in the direction of θ m is the coordinate perpendicular to s s is the net source term for the spectrum and σ is the intrinsic wave angular frequency we determine s as the sum of linear input s ln wind input s in wave dissipation s ds nonlinear wave wave interaction s nl and wave bottom interaction s bot 1 n t x c g v c n s k k ˆ n θ θ ˆ n s σ k ˆ σ d d s k u s θ ˆ 1 k σ d d m k u s s s l n s i n s n l s d s s b o t as ocean waves are forced by wind fields the wind input is the most typical source of errors in wave models the spatiotemporally varying fields of wind speed and direction are inputs that contribute to accurate wave reproduction for the wave model the wind fields are defined based on the gpv databases whose ncep fnl and era interim datasets are reliable for reproducing ocean surface winds when compared with the measured wind data for cases 1 and 2 lu et al 2017 the wave directional spectrum n s is obtained for each grid point by solving eq 1 it includes the information of the wave direction wave frequency and wave height the directional spectra of pitch and heave motions d p ω e χ e v and d h ω e χ e v respectively are obtained using the equations below where x p ω e χ e v and x h ω e χ e v are the frequency response functions of pitch and heave motions respectively obtained using a seakeeping theory like eut kashiwagi 1995 χ e is the relative wave direction ω e is the angular encounter frequency ω 0 is the angular frequency of the incident wave and v is the ship speed 2 d p ω e χ e v x p ω e χ e v 2 d w ω 0 χ e 1 2 ω 0 v g cos χ e d h ω e χ e v x h ω e χ e v 2 d w ω 0 χ e 1 2 ω 0 v g cos χ e the significant amplitudes of pitch and heave motions pa 1 3 and ha 1 3 respectively are obtained as follows 3 p a 1 3 4 00 0 2 π 0 d p ω e χ e v d ω d χ h a 1 3 4 00 0 2 π 0 d h ω e χ e v d ω d χ the authors have validated the estimated values of pa 1 3 and ha 1 3 with those measured during the voyages shown in fig 3 for cases 1 and 2 lu et al 2017 they were also validated for other rough sea cases under full loaded and ballasted conditions chen et al 2020 the estimated results satisfactorily comply with the measured ones thus the estimated wave information is used as the input of external forces in this study however it is still necessary to reproduce the ship maneuvering motions and to compare their accuracies with each other and with the measured results in this study the wavewatch iii model has been developed to consider the reflection of waves or the shallow water effect tolman et al 2002 tolman 2014 the wave fields can be estimated for sea areas near the land area especially in case 2 latin america furthermore the ocean current fields are defined by using the ocean surface current analysis real time oscar project to calculate the wave current interaction bonjean and lagerloef 2002 the computational domain in wavewatch iii is set from 5 0 e 10 0 s to 55 0 e 60 0 s for case 1 and from 25 0 w 20 0 s to 85 0 w 60 0 s for case 2 as shown in fig 5 a 1 month spin up before the study period allows to start the model from a resting condition the spatial resolution in longitude and latitude is 0 1 and the time resolution is 10 min for the wind current and wave fields and 1 h for the wave spectra in the two cases the wave spectra have a directional resolution of 10 from 0 to 360 the calculated wave frequencies are set from 0 0345 hz with a logarithmic frequency factor of 1 1 over 38 steps fig 6 shows the environmental conditions for the two cases these values are obtained from realistic simulations of the environment data indicating the evolution of winds currents and waves the detailed mechanism of the realistic simulation is illustrated in the next section as the period of the two cases is five days i e 120 h the factors are shown jointly for both cases the apparent wind speed u a and direction ψ ra are used to display the relative speed and direction respectively instead of the true wind the true current speed u c is directly adopted and the relative current direction ψ rc is given by the difference between the true direction from the north and the ship heading the significant wave height h s mean wave period t m and wave encounter angle χ e are used to describe the wave status the ranges of apparent wind direction relative current direction and wave encounter angles for cases 1 and 2 are intuitively shown in fig 7 the ranges of these directions or angles are from 180 to 180 with the starboard side being positive further 0 corresponds to following seas 90 corresponds to beam seas and 180 corresponds to head seas table 3 lists the maximum and minimum values of each factor note that the wave encounter angles are between 2 3 and 106 8 in case 1 and between 3 4 and 152 7 in case 2 as depicted by the red sectors in fig 7 indicating that the ship was always encountering beam seas stern quartering seas or following seas the maximum wind speeds were 17 38 m s for case 1 and 14 25 m s for case 2 corresponding to level 8 gale and level 7 near gale on the beaufort scale respectively the maximum values of the significant wave height were 6 34 m for case 1 and 5 74 m for case 2 respectively corresponding to the same levels on the beaufort scale as mentioned above 3 1 2 actual sea data the ocean environmental fields vary spatially and temporally therefore several fields in the period of the cases should be calculated before the reproduction via simulation actual sea databases store information of winds currents and waves and hence the spatiotemporal characteristics of environmental fields are available for time domain reproduction we estimate the vectors of winds currents and waves by linear interpolation first data from the appropriate period is determined by the querying time then the required vectors are calculated by two dimensional linear interpolation on the target position and its neighboring area as illustrated in fig 8 we use the measured ship position of case 1 to verify the actual sea databases and perform interpolation given the average values over 10 min at a position then we obtain the wind speed wind direction current speed current direction wave direction and significant wave height according to the varying ship position over time the interpolated results are compared with the corresponding ncep fnl data fig 9 shows that the interpolation results suitably agree with the ncep fnl data thus suggesting the realistic reproduction of spatiotemporally varying ocean environments for time domain analysis in the onboard measurement system waves and ocean currents are not directly measured instead of the direct validation estimated results of waves are validated as the ship motions pitch motion ship motions are computed from simulated wave spectrum with ship response functions of the eut and are compared with measured results the validation is already conducted by using this method lu et al 2017 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2015 showed the evaluation method of ship maneuvering motion in kuroshio current and the similar method is used here and the reproduced ship motions are finally validated with measured motions 3 2 reproduction of maneuvers this section presents the numerical model utilized in the maneuvering simulations the workflow for performing maneuvering simulation based on the measured rudder angles and engine revolutions is first explained then the maneuvering model adopted in the simulations is illustrated and validation results of the model are provided 3 2 1 reproduction of cases ship maneuvering behaviors have been widely investigated and evaluated using various fixed maneuver schemes such as turning and zigzag tests in addition as ship maneuvering should comply with the requirements of applicable standards during design maneuvers can be only simulated or predicted within relatively short periods e g periods in the order of minutes whereas actual voyages usually take several days moreover maneuvers during sailing are not a set of constant rudder angles thus long term simulations of maneuvers are necessary to realistically reproduce sailing as different initial values lead to considerable deviations in the simulation results by the accumulation of effects simulations over periods of hours or days are not only time consuming but they also may be misleading due to large accumulated errors therefore we focused on ship maneuvering related to difficulties in rough sea sailing as a result we set the simulation range to approximately 1 h to balance the tradeoff between accuracy and computation time the proposed reproduction method is described in fig 10 the maneuvering records are reproduced using a model that includes all the environmental disturbances three aspects are carefully considered to guarantee the consistency between the real and simulated ships and environments 1 the measured engine revolutions and rudder angles are fed into the model to ensure a consistent control input in addition sliding window smoothing is applied to the raw data of the revolutions to mitigate noise 2 the hydrodynamic coefficients and added resistances are computed in the frequency domain by the enhanced uniﬁed theory kashiwagi 1992 which provides practical and accurate seakeeping models as validated in the rios project kashiwagi et al 2004 the viscous maneuvering coefficients are obtained by model tests and a built in hydrodynamic database is constructed for time domain simulations 3 actual sea databases are used to reproduce the spatiotemporally varying vector fields of winds currents and waves 3 2 2 coordinate systems the coordinate systems adopted in this study are shown in fig 11 the fixed global coordinate system is represented by o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 where the x 0 axis points to the north the y 0 axis to the east and the z 0 axis downward and perpendicularly to the earth s surface the coordinate system fixed to the ship body is represented by o xyz where the x axis points to the bow the y axis to the starboard and the z axis vertically downward ship heading ψ is defined as the angle between the x 0 and x axes while ψ a is the true direction of the ocean surface wind ψ w is the main direction of the irregular wave and ψ c is the true direction of the ocean current all with respect to the x 0 axis in addition φ is the roll angle δ is the rudder angle and u u v m r and p are the state variables of the resultant speed linear velocity components along the x and y axes rotation velocity of yaw and rotation velocity of roll respectively 3 2 3 equations of motion the time domain simulation of ship motion considering actual sea conditions is a research frontier in marine engineering many studies have been focused on practical methods for predicting 6 dof degree of freedom motions in seaways especially considering waves as we focus on the effects of environmental conditions on maneuvers we derive a 4 dof maneuvering model coupled with environmental disturbances based on the modular concept proposed by yasukawa et al 2019b the maneuvers are described by surge sway yaw and roll and their motion equations are shown in eq 4 where m is the ship mass m x m y i x i z j x and j z are the added masses for surge and sway moments of inertia for roll and yaw and added moments of inertia for roll and yaw respectively these parameters can be estimated by motora 1959 1960a 1960b subscripts x y n and k represent the surge force lateral force yaw moment and roll moment respectively and subscripts h r p a and w indicate the hull rudder propeller winds and waves respectively 4 m m x u m m y v m r x g m r 2 x h x r x p x a x w m m y v m m m x u r x g m r y h y r y a y

is the mean draft the surge force of the hull is the sum of still water resistance r t and a polynomial function of non dimensional hydrodynamic derivatives and state variables all of the hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained by captive model tests the lateral force and yaw moment of the hull are expressed analogously 5 x h 1 2 ρ l p p d u 2 x v v v m 2 x v r v m r x r r r 2 x v v v v v m 4 r t y h

disturbances ocean surface winds non uniform ocean currents and irregular short crested waves produce the major environmental disturbances that affect navigation safety in the open sea the forces moments acting on ships due to random winds contribute to both planar and rotating ship motions the wind loads are commonly estimated based on wind load coefficients as described in eq 9 where ρ a is the air density u a is the apparent wind speed a l and a f are the lateral and front projected areas of the ship respectively l oa is ship length overall and c x c y c n and c k represent wind load coefficients many studies have relied on wind tunnel tests to obtain the coefficients and derive estimation methods the wind load coefficients using estimation method from kitamura et al 2017 are adopted for simulation in practice the wind moments on heave and pitch motions can be neglected 9 x a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 c x a f y a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 c y a l n a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 c n a l l o a k a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 c k a l 2 l o a the forces moments due to ocean currents cause drift on the ship planar motion consequently a ship generally navigates with a small drift angle to maintain its course like the wind load the current load on ships can be estimated by load coefficients hwang et al 2016 however this drift is reflected in the nonlinear viscous forces moments in eq 5 therefore we consider the drift due to ocean currents as a pure translation to avoid duplicating the current effects the relative velocity vector is calculated using eq 10 where u c and ψ c are the true velocity and true direction of the current respectively and u r and v r are relative velocity components 10 u c u c cos ψ c ψ u r u u c v c u c sin ψ c ψ v r v v c the wave induced forces x w and y w and moment n w can be superposed in practice using coefficients of discrete frequency ship speed and wave directions based on the linear hypothesis as described in eq 11 yasukawa et al 2019a where h s is the significant wave height χ e is the wave encounter angle ω k is the discrete wave frequency and θ n is the discrete wave spreading angle c is the second order wave drift coefficient in irregular sea sate and c x c y and c n are the longitudinal lateral and rotational components of the coefficient c in addition c is the second order wave drift coefficient computed using the enhanced uniﬁed theory as mention in 3

wave conditions furthermore s w is the directional wave spectrum and x w y w and n w are the corresponding wave induced forces and moments 11 c u χ e 2 k 1 k n 1 n c u ω k χ e s w ω k θ n h s 2 δ ω δ

maintain its course as reported in the deck logs under severe weather strong winds currents waves or all these factors combined can cause course deviations however the main factors causing such deviations remain unclear therefore we evaluate single and combined environmental factors in the reproduction analysis as detailed in table 4 the influence of each environmental factor can be determined from comparisons with the measurements furthermore the contributions of winds currents and waves can be obtained from simulations in contrast such evaluations cannot be performed in real experiments which would be unfeasible given the scale and complexity 3 2 6 numerical method and validation the ship maneuvering model is numerically solved by the 4th order runge kutta method by using a constant time step of 0 1 s in all of the simulations all input parameters of the maneuvering model are listed in appendix 2 the measured data are fed into the model for simulations note that the rudder angles and engine revolutions are measured at a constant frequency of 1 hz and there is a time difference between the iterative calculation and the measured data therefore the discrete measured data are utilized to change the rudder angles and engine revolutions in the state variables every 10 time steps of the iteration for each 1 h simulation the measured navigation status at the beginning point of the 1 h data is applied for initializing the state variables in the model after initialization the state variables are iteratively solved by only inputting the measured rudder angles engine revolutions and environmental information the turning and zig zag simulations in still water are performed to validate the maneuvering model the normal ship speed 14 knots and normal revolution 122 r min are used for simulations the sea trial test data are compared with the simulations the turning simulations and test results using 35 rudder angles are given in fig 12 the zig zag simulations and test results using 20 20 and 10 10 rudder angles are shown in figs 13 and 14 furthermore the comparison of turning indices including advance distance ad and tactical diameter dt are given in table 5 the comparison of overshoot angles osas are provided in table 6 the simulated results show good agreement with the sea trial data which indicate satisfied accuracy of the model 4 reproduction results and statistical analysis in this section the reproduced ocean environmental fields are first discussed the maneuvering simulations are performed based on the simulated environmental fields and measured rudder angles and engine revolutions furthermore we conduct statistical analyses to determine the relations between the abnormal maneuvers and the environmental disturbances in the study cases finally a rudder attenuation function is proposed based on the analyzed results 4 1 spatiotemporally varying ocean environment the reproduced ocean environmental fields within 1 day are shown in left columns of figs 15 and 16 where the wind current and wave vector fields are denoted by different colors and the color map represents the significant wave height field in case 1 the wave crest moves from northwest to east and the bulk carrier encounters rough waves on june 3 being consistent with the periods of large roll and pitch motions shown in fig 4 the ship remains under following seas or stern quartering seas before june 5 and alters its course temporarily on june 5 when the situation changes to beam seas likewise in case 2 a similar wave crest moves from south to northeast and the bulk carrier encounters rough waves on june 15 being also consistent with the periods of large roll and pitch motions the ship remains under stern quartering seas before june 16 and its course is temporarily altered on this date the estimated ship motions almost agreed with the measured ones implying that the estimated waves are reliable around the ship track furthermore another validation is conducted with the reanalysis data of the significant wave height distribution obtained from noaa in cases 1 and 2 as shown in right columns of figs 15 and 16 these reanalysis data are blended between the measured information and the simulations and can be considered the most reliable in the current situation the wave height distributions are extremely similar to those in the reproduction and the estimated waves almost agree spatially as well 4 2 preliminary maneuvering simulations the ship encountered rough seas and large rudder angles were applied to maintain the course in the evaluated cases we selected the first 2 h of measured data in rough seas for preliminary simulations the measured rudder and heading angles in the first 2 h are shown in fig 17 where the initial heading values are adjusted to zero for improved visualization note that the environmental vector fields will change from space and time the drawn direction can conveniently show the spatiotemporal varying characteristics of the environmental vectors where the green blue and red arrows indicate the true directions of wind current and wave respectively from the preliminary simulations we obtained the simulated trajectories shown in fig 18 where the environmental conditions correspond to those listed in table 4 the average significant wave height wave period wind speed and current speed are 5 14 m 7 60 s 10 11 m s and 0 11 m s respectively for the first hour and 4 89 m 7 69 s 10 34 m s and 0 09 m s respectively for the second hour in the preliminary simulations the reproduced trajectories show large deviations from the measured positions nevertheless some useful information can be extracted from these simulations initially the winds currents and waves make the ship drift along different directions in addition the drift effect of the current is not strong as suggested by the small differences between conditions neglecting currents i e conditions 1 2 4 and 6 in table 4 and those including currents i e conditions 3 5 7 and 8 in table 4 finally the inconsistency between reproduced trajectories and measurements indicates that the rudder effect does not agree with the environmental disturbances obtained from the simulations to unveil the reasons for such deviations we conducted various statistical analyses considering both the measurements and reproduced ocean environment 4 3 relations between rudder and environmental factors this section presents the correlation as well as the multi regression analysis between the abnormal rudder series and each environmental factor a rudder attenuation function comprising vital factors is derived from the regression results further the maneuvering records of the study cases are simulated based on the attenuation function 4 3 1 correlation analysis in this section a correlation analysis is described to reveal the relationship between the rudder angles and the seven environmental factors first the time series of the significant rudder angles δs and the time series of the seven factors that were adopted for a comparison figs 19 and 20 compare the rudder angles to the values of each environmental factor because rudder angles and environmental factors have different units these values were normalized by the maximum values of the rudder angle wave height wave period wave direction wind speed wind direction current speed and current direction it should be noted that the significant rudder angles change almost synchronously with wind speed u a significant wave height hs and mean wave period t m second the corresponding pearson and spearman correlation coefficients were computed based on the normalized values these are shown in figs 21 and 22 the two correlation coefficients were calculated to reveal the linear but monotonic relations between the rudder angles and environmental factors briefly the correlation coefficients range from 1 0 to 1 0 values of 0 7 1 0 indicate strong positive correlation 0 4 0 7 indicate moderate positive correlation and 0 0 0 4 indicate low positive correlation the same ranges for negative values indicate the corresponding negative correlations the spearman correlation coefficients are more adaptive than the pearson correlation coefficients because the latter assume gaussian distributions of the data the following conclusions could be drawn from the correlation analysis 1 the rudder angles have a strong positive correlation with both the wave height and wave period in two cases which implies that a large rudder angle will be employed in waves with a large hs and a long t m 2 a moderate negative correlation with the wave encountered angle in two cases indicates increased difficulty in maintaining the ship s course in following seas than in head seas 3 a significant rudder angle has a strong positive correlation with the wind speed which implies that large rudders will be used in strong winds 4 a moderate negative correlation between the rudder angle and the current speed can be observed in both cases 5 however both the apparent wind direction and the relative current direction show a weak correlation with the rudder angles indicating no obvious linear or monotonic relations to summarize the wave height wave period wind speed current speed and wave encounter angle may be the most significant factors that lead to abnormal large rudder angles in the two cases 4 3 2 multi regression analysis in the previous section we determined the five critical factors hs t m u a u c χ e leading to abnormal rudder angles in the two cases however we cannot determine the order of their importance only by a correlation analysis therefore we perform a multilinear regression analysis based on different combinations of the factors in order to reveal the order of importance of these factors initially we began with regression model i considering all the factors as shown in eq 12 the significant rudder angle was defined as a linear function consisting of all the factors with their coefficients a i i 1 7 and a constant c 1 the time series values of all factors and the significant rudder angles in the two cases were made into an entire dataset for multi regression the dataset consists of 10 min average values of factors and rudder angles correspondingly each case with a total length of 5 days contains 720 data points i e the total size of the data set matrix is 1440 rows and 8 columns where the first column is the rudder angle and the other seven columns are environmental factors the estimated coefficients with a 95 confidence level and the p values of each coefficient of model ⅰ are given in table 7 briefly the p value is used to describe the level of statistical significance the smaller the p value the stronger the evidence that we should reject the null hypothesis additionally the null hypothesis states that there is no relationship between the two variables being studied furthermore r squared r 2 represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable δ s that is explained by variables environmental factors in a regression model the sign of the coefficients would reflect the positive or negative correlation between δ s and factors and these signs are consistent with the results in the previous correlation analysis note that the coefficient a 4 is 0 12193 while a p value higher than 0 05 is not statistically significant and indicates strong evidence for the null hypothesis in addition a large coefficient a 4 indicates that the relationship between the relative current direction and the significant rudder angle is not statistically significant which is consistent with the small correlation coefficients of the relative current direction in contrast other p values of the coefficients are considerably less than 0 05 providing strong evidence against the null hypothesis these p values could also reflect the order of importance of the factors the coefficient a 5 with a p value of 1 1322 10 119 implies that the significant wave height may be the most important factor among the seven factors an interesting fact is that the coefficient a 2 is very small we also could not find large correlation coefficients of the apparent wind direction in the previous section 12 i f δ s c 1 a 1 u a a 2 ψ r a a 3 u c a 4 ψ r c a 5 h s a 6 t m a 7 χ e more regression analyses are performed based on different regression models to finally determine the order of importance of the factors the relative current direction is excluded from the dataset as it is not statistically significant models ⅱ ⅶ are defined as shown in eq 13 the r 2 values of the models are shown in fig 23 by excluding a 4 model ⅱ r 2 0 737 has a slightly increased r squared value model ⅲ r 2 0 321 consists of only wind factors and model ⅳ r 2 0 102 consists of only current factors both models ⅲ and ⅳ cannot explain the variance of δs however model ⅴ r 2 0 679 consists of only wave factors indicating their importance moreover model ⅵ r 2 0 710 consists of only magnitudes of the wind current and wave and model ⅶ r 2 0 279 consists of only the directions of the factors models ⅵ and ⅶ simply indicate that the magnitudes are more important than the directions these findings are consistent with the p values in table 7 and the order of importance of the factors is a 5 a 1 a 6 a 3 a 2 and a 7 according to model ⅰ 13 i i f δ s c 1 a 1 u a a 2 ψ r a a 3 u c a 5 h s a 6 t m a 7 χ e i i i f δ s c 1 a 1 u a a 2 ψ r a v i f δ s c 1 a 3 u c a 4 ψ r c v f δ s c 1 a 5 h s a 6 t m a 7 χ e v

environmental factors and the significance of each factor through the analysis in section 4 3 this provided a basis for us to discuss the disagreement between rudder effects and environmental factors in section 4 2 according to nautical experiences a ship commonly sets the autopilot threshold to be approximately 15 under severe weather conditions in the studied cases the large and frequently changing rudder angles seem to be abnormal the evolution of environmental factors in fig 6 reveals that the ship has been encountering strong winds and waves moreover the ranges of directions in fig 7 show that the ship mostly corresponds to following waves stern quartering waves and beam waves in the two cases a more steer effective design would reduce the tendency of the vessel to broach in a following and stern quartering sea bonci m et al 2019 implying that the ship may experience reduced steering effectiveness in such wave conditions the significant rudder angles appear to have a strong positive correlation with the wave height wave period wind speed and current speed according to figs 21 and 22 furthermore the significant rudder angles also show a moderate negative correlation with the wave encounter angles thus the disagreement in the preliminary simulations may be caused by overestimating the rudder effect considering the above analyses consequently the ship could experience reduced steering effectiveness in the environmental conditions given in table 3 which is not reflected in eq 6 therefore an attenuation factor f a is added to modify the rudder normal force f n as defined in eq 14 where f na represents the attenuated rudder normal force this factor f a describes the attenuation of rudder effectiveness in the studied cases it is considered as a polynomial function of six environmental factors the relative current direction ψ rc is excluded from f a as discussed in the previous section moreover the f a function is established based on model ⅱ and the square of wind speed and the wave height are adopted considering eqs 9 and 11 14 f n a f n f a u a ψ r a u c h s t m χ e f a e 1 b 1 u a 2 b 2 ψ r a b 3 u c b 4 h a 2 b 5 t m b 6 χ e then simulations with different values of f a are performed and multi regression analysis is adopted to estimate the coefficients of the function a 10 min time series every 3 h from the measured data and actual sea data of the two cases 120 h is used to establish a simulation dataset on the one hand this approach ensures that the simulation dataset contains most environmental conditions on the other hand it avoids overfitting the original measurement data therefore the simulation data set contains 80 sets of data two cases and we use 10 discrete f a values from 0 1 to 1 0 to simulate each set of data subsequently the simulation results are compared with the measured data to calculate the rmses of the position and heading each group of data has 10 rmses corresponding to 10 f a values the optimal f a is obtained through the non linear fitting of the rmses the f a value with the minimum rmse is defined as the optimal attenuation factor of the corresponding environmental conditions the 80 optimal f a values with the corresponding environmental factors are indicated in fig 24 finally the coefficients e 1 b i 1 6 of the function of f a are estimated by multi regression on the 80 optimal f a values with the corresponding environmental factors as shown in table 8 it can be observed that the f a values have a negative correlation with the wind speed wave height and wave period moreover f a values of approximately 0 5 0 8 are concentrated in the 0 0 2 m s range of current speed and 0 50 range of wave encounter angle the f a values appear to have no obvious correlation with the apparent wind direction on one hand these phenomena agree with the conclusion drawn in section 4 4 on the other hand they indicate that the attenuation of rudder effectiveness increases with an increase in the wind speed wave height and wave period in addition the attenuation of rudder effectiveness is larger when the ship is under following and stern quartering waves furthermore the signs of the coefficients e 1 b i 1 6 of the five factors u a u c hs t m χ e in table 8 are opposite to the signs in table 7 which further illustrates that an increase in the rudder angle of the two cases was caused by the attenuation of the rudder effectiveness in rough seas 4 5 reproduced maneuvers the maneuvers in the event of the maneuvering difficulties as shown in table 2 were reproduced to validate the rudder attenuation function to construct the validation dataset selected the measurement data of the time period when the maneuvering difficulties discussed in section 2 3 occurred there were 10 h of data in case 1 06 05 2013 03 00 13 00 and 5 h of data in case 2 06 16 2013 00 00 06 00 the simulations were performed hour by hour and the measured rudder angles were directly input into the ship motion model the attenuation factor function f a was applied to calculate the rudder normal forces the reproduced trajectories for cases 1 and 2 are shown in figs 25 and 26 respectively where the environmental conditions 5 to 7 in table 4 are omitted for better visualization the detailed hourly reproduced data trajectory and heading including all environmental conditions are shown in appendix 3 the root mean square errors rmses of the reproduced trajectories and heading angles with respect to the measurements are shown in figs 27 and 28 the hourly rmse for case 1 was divided into 5 h graphs for improved visualization the average rmses for the two cases are listed in table 9 considering all environmental factors to the reproduced trajectories agree well with the measurements the first 2 h simulations under condition 8 are consistent with the measured data after applying the rudder attenuation factor the disagreement in the preliminary simulations are because of reduced rudder effectiveness the remaining simulation results further verify this inference and they also show that the attenuation factor f a obtained by our regression analysis can effectively reflect the relationship between the reduced rudder normal force and the different environmental factors the rmses for the combinations of wind wave and all the environmental factors are smaller than those for the other environmental conditions as shown in figs 27 and 28 this result is consistent with the inferences discussed in section 4 4 however the rmses under all environmental factors have minimum values which indicate that the ocean current effect cannot be negligible 5 discussions this section presents certain limitations of the study we use both measurement and simulation data to explore the specific relationship between the abnormal rudder angles and the environmental factors in severe weather finally we propose a rudder effect attenuation function to explain the abnormal rudder angle sequence in severe weather owing to technical failures with wave observations in severe weather we used the simulated environment information to calculate the environmental disturbances however the measured rudder angle and engine revolutions drive the maneuvering motion model to ensure consistent control behavior with the original record judging from the analysis results of section 4 1 the ocean environment simulation is credible implying that it is also feasible to use this method for maneuvering simulations in real seas it is worth noting that the ship studied in this article is a bulk carrier with a single propeller and a single rudder table 1 lists the specific parameters of this ship further the environmental factors in the study cases have certain ranges as explained in detail in section 2 4 the specific types of ships and the range of environmental factors indicate that the proposed rudder attenuation function may not be applicable to other types of ships and conditions outside the weather ranges this is because different types of ships will show different maneuverability in and responses to different ocean environmental disturbances moreover we focused on the difficulty of maneuvering in beam and following waves even in similar severe weather the change in rudder efficiency under other wave encounter angles still needs more measurement data for further analysis and verification finally although this article uses numerous simulation analysis results the ultimate goal is still to explore the possible explanation of abnormal rudder angles in the study cases based on the analysis results of sections 4 3 and 4 4 the relations between the rudder and the environmental factors of the original data exhibit the same trend as the simulation data after the rudder attenuation function is applied it indicates that the simulation method used in this study is effective and verifies that the rudder effect attenuation is a feasible explanation for abnormal rudder angles in the study cases ensuring navigation safety in severe weather is an important part of mass development therefore a large number of simulation verifications will need to be performed before an actual ship test and the influence of weather in real seas on the maneuvering should be accurately reflected in the simulations in this study the rudder effect attenuation based on measurement data and simulation data provides insights into ships sailing in severe weather in actual seas which can benefit the simulation analysis in mass development 6 conclusions this study investigated the maneuvering difficulties of a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier in rough seas the goal was to explain the abnormal rudder angles that occurred in the study cases firstly the spatiotemporal variation of the actual sea was considered based on realistic environmental fields in addition a ship maneuvering model considering environmental disturbances was built to reproduce the time histories of maneuvers under different environmental conditions secondly the maneuvering simulations were performed based on the measured rudder angles engine revolutions and reproduced ocean environments the preliminary simulations demonstrated poor consistency with the onboard measurement thirdly correlation analysis and multiregression analysis were conducted between rudder angles and each environmental factor to further investigate this inconsistency based on the correlation and multiregression analyses we infer that the unusual rudder angles were caused by reduced rudder efficiency finally an attenuation function for rudder effectiveness was proposed and validated by using measured data the conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 an attenuation function was proposed to simulate the reduction in the steering effectiveness in the study cases by multiplying the normal forces of the rudder with an attenuation coefficient f a a verification dataset was built from the measured data the simulation results were consistent with the verification dataset after applying the rudder attenuation function which further explained the disagreement in the preliminary simulations this function could feasibly explain the abnormal maneuvers that occurred in severe weather in the study cases and could serve as a practical method to realize better accuracy of full scale ship maneuvering simulations in actual sea 2 the rmses of the verification dataset showed that the simulations for individual factors have large deviations although the impact of wind and waves is extremely significant the effects of currents on the maneuvering difficulty cannot be ignored 3 both simulation tests and sea trials are necessary for the development of mass in this study we explored abnormal maneuvers that occurred in real voyages and derived a rudder attenuation function to improve the simulation consistency of real ships in severe weather the onboard measured data and the findings derived from these data are considered as practical guidance to assist the development of mass credit authorship contribution statement qianfeng jing writing original draft

21097,the increasing demand for efficient safe and economic operation of ships has drawn attention to practical maneuvering behaviors for developing autonomous ships actual sailing conditions are reproduced to determine the relationship between environmental factors and ship steering records in rough seas first we generate realistic ocean environmental fields and analyze actual sea data then we derive a modular maneuvering model reflecting environmental disturbances for further simulations the correlation and multi regression analyses are performed based on measured data and environmental factors which illustrate that the abnormal rudder angles are caused by reduced steering effectiveness finally an attenuation function acting on the rudder normal forces is proposed to simulate this type of reduction the time histories of maneuvering difficulties are selected as verification datasets the maneuvers are simulated by adopting the attenuation function and the simulation results show fair agreement with the measured data the significant wave height wind speed mean wave period current speed wind apparent direction and wave encounter angles are found to be the most statistically significant factors of rudder attenuation in the studied cases the results and conclusions obtained from this study are of great significance for the further exploration of actual ship maneuvering behaviors in seas keywords rudder attenuation ship maneuvering ocean environment onboard measuring rough sea voyage 1 introduction with the development of the shipping industry shipbuilding companies and related research institutions are pursuing ship autonomy the concept of maritime autonomous surface ship mass was introduced at the 98th session of the maritime safety committee 2017 of the international maritime organization in addition this organization has recommended conducting theoretical and experimental studies related to mass and developing different levels of autonomy there are four nonhierarchical degrees of autonomy for a mass according to the maritime safety committee 2018 1 automated processes and decision support 2 remote control with seafarers on board 3 remote control without seafarers on board and 4 full autonomy in the last three years pioneering research has been conducted to develop different degrees of mass autonomy considering favorable fundamental conditions in near shore areas reddy et al 2019 these conditions include unimpeded network communications and a stable meteorological environment however ensuring safe mass navigation in the open sea remains challenging due to the complex and changing environment in addition ship route design is restricted by meteorological conditions and the environment which may increase fuel consumption and costs vettor and guedes soares 2016 moreover load shifting risks maneuvering difficulties and capsize may occur under disturbances caused by severe weather sahoo et al 2019 these potential risks greatly hinder navigation safety and may undermine the economic benefits of using a mass therefore the operational problems during actual sailing should be analyzed especially regarding rare events occurring under severe weather this analysis may reveal relations between the environment and ship navigation thereby fostering the development of mass the influence of the ocean environment on ship navigation has remained a research hotspot in marine engineering over time ittc maneuvering ittc manoeuvring committee 2017 although the maneuverability of ships under adverse weather has not been explicitly included in regulations it became necessary since the introduction of corresponding guidelines in the eedi regulations international maritime organization 2018 several studies have addressed the characteristics of ship navigation under different environmental disturbances ueno et al 2017 conducted tank tests to investigate different rudder and propeller control methods however they recognize that measurements in real scale may allow describing highly nonlinear maneuverability under adverse weather ruiz et al 2019 investigated maneuvering considering still water and regular waves through model tests they analyzed the effects of waves on the rudder and propeller based on experimental data the maneuvering modeling group mmg model is widely used to simulate 3 dof and 4 dof maneuvers under calm water or wind wave conditions yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 the hydrodynamic performances of propeller and rudder during maneuvers are analyzed by guo et al 2018 based on the mmg model and cfd method the propeller side force and asymmetric flow straightening effect are taken into account in their study sukas et al 2019 developed a feasible code to investigate the maneuverability of any low speed ship with single rudder single propeller or twin rudder twin propeller configurations based on the mmg model besides various methods could be applied to obtain the parameters in the mmg model liu et al 2017 assess the existing empirical methods relevant to the mmg models parameters and an integrated maneuvering model for inland vessels has been developed using suitable empirical methods and rans results the viscous cfd method with the overset grid is applied to identify all the necessary parameters for the mmg model by sakamoto et al 2019 a method was proposed by yasukawa et al 2019a for predicting steady sailing conditions under environmental disturbances which effectively captures the maneuvering limit of ships under wind and wave disturbances for instance a ship may lose its steering ability and drift when sailing in irregular beam waves inspired by the work of the former jing et al 2020a 2020b proposed a practical method to construct a hydrodynamic coefficients database based on the stereolithographic model to improve the maneuvering simulation with the constantly changing wave conditions acanfora and rizzuto 2019 investigated nonlinear effects when predicting motions of a ship in beam seas at zero speed and performed a comparative simulation analysis between different models considering idealized wave spectra paravisi et al 2019 developed a simulation environment to test control strategies of unmanned surface vehicles in the simulations wind and current fields were integrated to compute the overall environmental effect aung and umeda 2020 performed various maneuvering simulations considering not only the wind and waves but also the engine load limits of a ship the initial values in the time domain simulations showed notable effects on the ship trajectories but the conditions after reaching steady state converged moreover the ship trajectory was found to be more important than the equilibrium speed to determine the safety of a ship sailing in adverse conditions however these simulations were based on ideal conditions such as constant scale and direction of winds and waves and the ocean current was not included analyzing maneuvering behaviors in real situations might reflect unaccounted sailing effects for instance tang et al 2020 integrated steering and the effects of non uniform ﬂow fields obtained from a numerical model to investigate the maneuvering performance in restricted waters e g inland rivers besides simulations various onboard measurement systems have been developed in recent years to evaluate ship performance in actual sea in addition sea trial data or onboard measured data have been used to investigate ship performance chen et al 2015 analyzed the performance of ships under ocean currents and generated high resolution kuroshio currents from a numerical model lu et al 2017 estimated waves and winds for rough sea sailing in the southern hemisphere and compared the results with measurements from a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier tsujimoto and orihara 2018 2019 thoroughly reviewed performance prediction methods and validation results of full scale ships in the sea you et al 2020 estimated the actual sea margin of a liquefied natural gas carrier using maneuvering equations although realistic winds and waves were obtained from the european center for medium range weather forecasts the environmental conditions were fixed according to the time and position of a simulated ship overall most available methods to evaluate ship maneuvering and performance are based on model tests in water basins and numerical simulations research on maneuvering in actual sea is scarce despite model ships failing to reflect full scale ship maneuverability moreover generating winds currents and waves for full scaled ships resembling the actual sea is difficult thus a fixed maneuver scheme such as turning zigzag and emergency maneuvering is adopted in many numerical simulations jing et al 2020a 2020b in practice however the rudder angle is controlled by a human operator in a discrete form on the other hand wind is assumed to be steady in simulations and short crested irregular waves are commonly generated considering idealized wave spectra and spreading functions these simplifications are adopted because the exact directions of wind and waves are difficult to estimate especially when they are not aligned consequently actual maneuvering may substantially differ from the ideal simulation results in actual sailing ships encounter following seas or bow stern quartering seas however most physical experiments and numerical simulations are limited to head seas furthermore few studies have considered the surface current effect whereas most studies have been focused on wind and waves both regular and irregular consequently actual sailing cannot be analyzed comprehensively due to insufficient reliable sensor data under realistic environmental conditions especially when sailing under severe weather sasa et al 2015 conducted long term onboard measurements from a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier from 2010 for the optimization of ship routing despite mechanical problems that impeded measurements in some periods the measured data include waves ship motion navigation and engine parameters during many severe weather events in both the southern and northern hemispheres as speed loss is the key indicator for optimal ship routing it was thoroughly investigated using data acquired in rough seas sasa et al 2017 from these studies the authors found that maneuvering in rough sea differs from that in calm sea for instance according to its deck log a ship encountered remarkable maneuvering difficulties in june 2013 due to severe weather which caused problems to maintain the ship course the corresponding onboard measurements show that the ship was frequently steered with large rudder angles during this period however the reasons underlying this maneuvering behavior remain unclear in this study we investigated the abnormal maneuvering of a ship under severe weather first the onboard measured data are analyzed then the environmental fields and maneuvering motions were reproduced based on numerical models and measured data further a rudder attenuation function is proposed based on a statistical analysis of simulation results more simulations are performed with the attenuation function the results were compared with the measured data which reveal the relations between environmental factors and maneuvering motion following this introduction section 2 describes the onboard measurements used in this study section 3 details the methods to reproduce ocean environment and ship maneuvering in simulations section 4 reports the results of the reproduced winds currents waves and maneuvering behaviors in addition results from statistical analyses based on the reproduced environment and measured data are presented finally we summarize the major findings from this study in section 5 2 ship maneuvering analysis based on onboard measurements the data measured using an actual ship s sensors provide detailed information about the navigation status and the causes of maneuvering problems can be determined by tracing back these data this section presents the measurement system configuration and then introduces information on the two study cases finally the measured data and the ranges of environmental conditions are provided intuitively 2 1 measurement system variations in ship performance were monitored by installing an onboard measuring system for the 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier the ship was built at the beginning of june 2010 and after sea trials it was put into operation by the end of june 2010 this bulk carrier is a tramper that does not have regular voyage routes the ship was managed by the japanese ship owner until the summer of 2012 following which its management shifted to a different shipping company onboard measurements were conducted three times from june 2010 to july 2011 14 months december 2012 to november 2013 12 months and july 2015 to august 2016 14 months the total period these of onboard measurements was around 40 months the measurement system comprises the nautical instrument part and the motion sensor part as shown in fig 1 the measurement system is installed in the ship bridge the nautical instrument part comprises a voyage data recorder vdr and a data logger for the ship engine the installation of a vdr is mandatory for outbound vessels such as the 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier further the ship owner installed the engine data logger to monitor the engine performance these systems are connected with nautical and engine instruments in the ship the measured information of navigation and engine parameters is sent through the ship land communication device to the shipping company every 20 min this information is recorded to the laptop pc 1 that is connected with the ship land communication device by a lan cable the main output information is the ship position ship speed ship heading rudder angle autopilot wind direction and speed engine revolutions engine power shaft thrust and fuel consumption these data are recorded on pc 1 every 1 s as raw data using a communication software the motion sensor part consists of the inertial measurement unit nav440 that can measure the rotation angles i e roll pitch and yaw rotation angle velocity and accelerations along the horizontal and vertical axes with a sampling interval of 0 1 s the laptop pc 2 is also connected to nav440 through a cable to the rs 232 port the measurement data were stored on ssd drives in these two laptop pcs and the authors collected them annually by visiting the ship in various ports or shipyards further details of the onboard measurement system can be referred elsewhere sasa et al 2015 2017 as the ship is a tramper it sailed along various routes during the three periods mentioned above these are shown in fig 2 in the first period 2010 2011 the main sailing route is the north pacific ocean and the south atlantic ocean in the second period 2012 2013 and the third period 2015 2016 the primary routes are asia oceania asia latin america across the indian ocean the south atlantic ocean and the tasman sea in the southern hemisphere although the sailing speed of the bulk carrier is designed to be 14 knots it was reduced to 12 knots for reducing fuel consumption since the shift to the new ship management in 2012 in these three periods of onboard measurements eight rough sea voyages with larger ship motions occurred chen et al 2020 the loading conditions varied in each case from a ballasted condition d 4 5 m to a full loaded condition d 9 82 m the performance of a ship such as its maneuvering or seakeeping performance is strongly influenced by the loading condition the seakeeping performance has been validated for each case using the wave estimation and seakeeping theory chen et al 2020 and the estimation accuracy is shown under different loading conditions in the voyage between china and uruguay across the indian ocean and the south atlantic ocean from may 11 2013 to june 18 2013 the ship encountered rough seas twice off the coasts of south africa and latin america this is the only voyage for which the deck log book notes difficulties in maintaining the ship s course during these two rough sea voyages overall the measured data are suitable for evaluating the maneuvering difficulty which is focused on in this study table 1 lists the main dimensions of the ship the loading condition was the half loaded condition d 8 16 m during the voyage and was relatively close to the full loaded condition 2 2 study cases the geographic location and corresponding period of the two study cases considered in this study are listed in table 2 and the voyage track line is shown in fig 3 in case 1 the bulk carrier navigated from china to uruguay crossing the indian ocean and the south atlantic ocean through the coast of south africa in early june of 2013 in case 2 the bulk carrier navigated from south africa to uruguay crossing the south atlantic ocean in mid june of 2013 the bulk carrier was half loaded mean draft of 8 16 m in both cases in table 2 the events correspond to maneuvering difficulties reported in the deck log for the two cases the bulk carrier faced adverse weather for approximately 10 h in case 1 and 6 h in case 2 2 3 variations in measured parameters the measured parameters on june 2 7 2013 case 1 and june 13 18 2013 case 2 are depicted in fig 4 these are periods for which difficulties in maintaining the course were noted the roll and pitch angles are expressed as significant values obtained by zero up crossing for a 10 min window every 0 1 s as the rudder angles always vary around zero zero up crossing is also applied to the raw rudder data obtaining significant values δ s the observed engine revolutions ship speed and heading are shown as average values over 10 min every 1 s the periods corresponding to maneuvering difficulties in the two cases are marked by rectangles in the graphs very large and frequently changing rudder maneuvers above 20 are observed in each case 1 3 days for case 1 and 2 3 days for case 2 over long periods the ship speed and engine revolutions were reduced during these rudder maneuvers moreover the ship heading changed considerably by approximately 45 around the period of maneuvering difficulties in each case furthermore large roll and pitch angles were measured in each case especially during the frequent rudder maneuvers 2 4 estimation of environmental factors the environmental conditions must be known to analyze the ship s performances in actual seas in the onboard measurement the wind information wind speed and wind direction is available during the measured periods however the wave information is not available even though it is evidently crucial for estimating the ship performance the authors estimated the ocean wave information using reanalysis weather data and a third generation wave model to compute the wave directional spectrum at each grid point the ship motions can be estimated by using the computed wave directional spectrum and the frequency response functions in each wave direction if the estimated ship motions agree with the measured ones it would indicate that the estimated wave information can reliably reflect the external conditions as mentioned above the authors have validated the numerical estimation of waves using ncep fnl kalnay et al 1996 and era interim dee et al 2011 for various sea regions cases 1 and 2 are included and loading conditions lu et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the sea conditions in the southern hemisphere tend to be rougher owing to the fewer landmasses in this region lu et al 2017 during this period ships were unable to maintain their course in rough seas correspondingly large and frequently changing rudder angles were measured on june 1 4 and 14 17 however the underlying factors explaining such angles remain unclear therefore we analyze the maneuvering behaviors as two cases by using the corresponding measurements and environmental data 3 reproduction of cases via simulation the maneuvering issues that occurred in the cases are closely related to the disturbances of the ocean environment therefore we attempt to reproduce the ocean environment and maneuvering behavior through simulations to explore the reasons for the issues this section presents the simulation mechanisms of both the ocean environment and the maneuvering motion 3 1 reproduction of ocean environment this section explains the numerical model adopted in the ocean simulation and introduces the procedures for integrating the spatiotemporal ocean fields into time domain maneuvering simulations 3 1 1 winds currents and waves the ocean surface wind current and wave fields are the most important parameters to reproduce a realistic ocean environment the third generation wave numerical model wavewatch iii is applied to reproduce wave fields tolman 2014 this model solves the random phase spectral action density balance equation for the wave directional spectrum the solution is detailed in eq 1 where n s is the wave directional spectrum c g is the wave group velocity v c is the current velocity s is the coordinate in the direction of θ m is the coordinate perpendicular to s s is the net source term for the spectrum and σ is the intrinsic wave angular frequency we determine s as the sum of linear input s ln wind input s in wave dissipation s ds nonlinear wave wave interaction s nl and wave bottom interaction s bot 1 n t x c g v c n s k k ˆ n θ θ ˆ n s σ k ˆ σ d d s k u s θ ˆ 1 k σ d d m k u s s s l n s i n s n l s d s s b o t as ocean waves are forced by wind fields the wind input is the most typical source of errors in wave models the spatiotemporally varying fields of wind speed and direction are inputs that contribute to accurate wave reproduction for the wave model the wind fields are defined based on the gpv databases whose ncep fnl and era interim datasets are reliable for reproducing ocean surface winds when compared with the measured wind data for cases 1 and 2 lu et al 2017 the wave directional spectrum n s is obtained for each grid point by solving eq 1 it includes the information of the wave direction wave frequency and wave height the directional spectra of pitch and heave motions d p ω e χ e v and d h ω e χ e v respectively are obtained using the equations below where x p ω e χ e v and x h ω e χ e v are the frequency response functions of pitch and heave motions respectively obtained using a seakeeping theory like eut kashiwagi 1995 χ e is the relative wave direction ω e is the angular encounter frequency ω 0 is the angular frequency of the incident wave and v is the ship speed 2 d p ω e χ e v x p ω e χ e v 2 d w ω 0 χ e 1 2 ω 0 v g cos χ e d h ω e χ e v x h ω e χ e v 2 d w ω 0 χ e 1 2 ω 0 v g cos χ e the significant amplitudes of pitch and heave motions pa 1 3 and ha 1 3 respectively are obtained as follows 3 p a 1 3 4 00 0 2 π 0 d p ω e χ e v d ω d χ h a 1 3 4 00 0 2 π 0 d h ω e χ e v d ω d χ the authors have validated the estimated values of pa 1 3 and ha 1 3 with those measured during the voyages shown in fig 3 for cases 1 and 2 lu et al 2017 they were also validated for other rough sea cases under full loaded and ballasted conditions chen et al 2020 the estimated results satisfactorily comply with the measured ones thus the estimated wave information is used as the input of external forces in this study however it is still necessary to reproduce the ship maneuvering motions and to compare their accuracies with each other and with the measured results in this study the wavewatch iii model has been developed to consider the reflection of waves or the shallow water effect tolman et al 2002 tolman 2014 the wave fields can be estimated for sea areas near the land area especially in case 2 latin america furthermore the ocean current fields are defined by using the ocean surface current analysis real time oscar project to calculate the wave current interaction bonjean and lagerloef 2002 the computational domain in wavewatch iii is set from 5 0 e 10 0 s to 55 0 e 60 0 s for case 1 and from 25 0 w 20 0 s to 85 0 w 60 0 s for case 2 as shown in fig 5 a 1 month spin up before the study period allows to start the model from a resting condition the spatial resolution in longitude and latitude is 0 1 and the time resolution is 10 min for the wind current and wave fields and 1 h for the wave spectra in the two cases the wave spectra have a directional resolution of 10 from 0 to 360 the calculated wave frequencies are set from 0 0345 hz with a logarithmic frequency factor of 1 1 over 38 steps fig 6 shows the environmental conditions for the two cases these values are obtained from realistic simulations of the environment data indicating the evolution of winds currents and waves the detailed mechanism of the realistic simulation is illustrated in the next section as the period of the two cases is five days i e 120 h the factors are shown jointly for both cases the apparent wind speed u a and direction ψ ra are used to display the relative speed and direction respectively instead of the true wind the true current speed u c is directly adopted and the relative current direction ψ rc is given by the difference between the true direction from the north and the ship heading the significant wave height h s mean wave period t m and wave encounter angle χ e are used to describe the wave status the ranges of apparent wind direction relative current direction and wave encounter angles for cases 1 and 2 are intuitively shown in fig 7 the ranges of these directions or angles are from 180 to 180 with the starboard side being positive further 0 corresponds to following seas 90 corresponds to beam seas and 180 corresponds to head seas table 3 lists the maximum and minimum values of each factor note that the wave encounter angles are between 2 3 and 106 8 in case 1 and between 3 4 and 152 7 in case 2 as depicted by the red sectors in fig 7 indicating that the ship was always encountering beam seas stern quartering seas or following seas the maximum wind speeds were 17 38 m s for case 1 and 14 25 m s for case 2 corresponding to level 8 gale and level 7 near gale on the beaufort scale respectively the maximum values of the significant wave height were 6 34 m for case 1 and 5 74 m for case 2 respectively corresponding to the same levels on the beaufort scale as mentioned above 3 1 2 actual sea data the ocean environmental fields vary spatially and temporally therefore several fields in the period of the cases should be calculated before the reproduction via simulation actual sea databases store information of winds currents and waves and hence the spatiotemporal characteristics of environmental fields are available for time domain reproduction we estimate the vectors of winds currents and waves by linear interpolation first data from the appropriate period is determined by the querying time then the required vectors are calculated by two dimensional linear interpolation on the target position and its neighboring area as illustrated in fig 8 we use the measured ship position of case 1 to verify the actual sea databases and perform interpolation given the average values over 10 min at a position then we obtain the wind speed wind direction current speed current direction wave direction and significant wave height according to the varying ship position over time the interpolated results are compared with the corresponding ncep fnl data fig 9 shows that the interpolation results suitably agree with the ncep fnl data thus suggesting the realistic reproduction of spatiotemporally varying ocean environments for time domain analysis in the onboard measurement system waves and ocean currents are not directly measured instead of the direct validation estimated results of waves are validated as the ship motions pitch motion ship motions are computed from simulated wave spectrum with ship response functions of the eut and are compared with measured results the validation is already conducted by using this method lu et al 2017 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2015 showed the evaluation method of ship maneuvering motion in kuroshio current and the similar method is used here and the reproduced ship motions are finally validated with measured motions 3 2 reproduction of maneuvers this section presents the numerical model utilized in the maneuvering simulations the workflow for performing maneuvering simulation based on the measured rudder angles and engine revolutions is first explained then the maneuvering model adopted in the simulations is illustrated and validation results of the model are provided 3 2 1 reproduction of cases ship maneuvering behaviors have been widely investigated and evaluated using various fixed maneuver schemes such as turning and zigzag tests in addition as ship maneuvering should comply with the requirements of applicable standards during design maneuvers can be only simulated or predicted within relatively short periods e g periods in the order of minutes whereas actual voyages usually take several days moreover maneuvers during sailing are not a set of constant rudder angles thus long term simulations of maneuvers are necessary to realistically reproduce sailing as different initial values lead to considerable deviations in the simulation results by the accumulation of effects simulations over periods of hours or days are not only time consuming but they also may be misleading due to large accumulated errors therefore we focused on ship maneuvering related to difficulties in rough sea sailing as a result we set the simulation range to approximately 1 h to balance the tradeoff between accuracy and computation time the proposed reproduction method is described in fig 10 the maneuvering records are reproduced using a model that includes all the environmental disturbances three aspects are carefully considered to guarantee the consistency between the real and simulated ships and environments 1 the measured engine revolutions and rudder angles are fed into the model to ensure a consistent control input in addition sliding window smoothing is applied to the raw data of the revolutions to mitigate noise 2 the hydrodynamic coefficients and added resistances are computed in the frequency domain by the enhanced uniﬁed theory kashiwagi 1992 which provides practical and accurate seakeeping models as validated in the rios project kashiwagi et al 2004 the viscous maneuvering coefficients are obtained by model tests and a built in hydrodynamic database is constructed for time domain simulations 3 actual sea databases are used to reproduce the spatiotemporally varying vector fields of winds currents and waves 3 2 2 coordinate systems the coordinate systems adopted in this study are shown in fig 11 the fixed global coordinate system is represented by o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 where the x 0 axis points to the north the y 0 axis to the east and the z 0 axis downward and perpendicularly to the earth s surface the coordinate system fixed to the ship body is represented by o xyz where the x axis points to the bow the y axis to the starboard and the z axis vertically downward ship heading ψ is defined as the angle between the x 0 and x axes while ψ a is the true direction of the ocean surface wind ψ w is the main direction of the irregular wave and ψ c is the true direction of the ocean current all with respect to the x 0 axis in addition φ is the roll angle δ is the rudder angle and u u v m r and p are the state variables of the resultant speed linear velocity components along the x and y axes rotation velocity of yaw and rotation velocity of roll respectively 3 2 3 equations of motion the time domain simulation of ship motion considering actual sea conditions is a research frontier in marine engineering many studies have been focused on practical methods for predicting 6 dof degree of freedom motions in seaways especially considering waves as we focus on the effects of environmental conditions on maneuvers we derive a 4 dof maneuvering model coupled with environmental disturbances based on the modular concept proposed by yasukawa et al 2019b the maneuvers are described by surge sway yaw and roll and their motion equations are shown in eq 4 where m is the ship mass m x m y i x i z j x and j z are the added masses for surge and sway moments of inertia for roll and yaw and added moments of inertia for roll and yaw respectively these parameters can be estimated by motora 1959 1960a 1960b subscripts x y n and k represent the surge force lateral force yaw moment and roll moment respectively and subscripts h r p a and w indicate the hull rudder propeller winds and waves respectively 4 m m x u m m y v m r x g m r 2 x h x r x p x a x w m m y v m m m x u r x g m r y h y r y a y

is the mean draft the surge force of the hull is the sum of still water resistance r t and a polynomial function of non dimensional hydrodynamic derivatives and state variables all of the hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained by captive model tests the lateral force and yaw moment of the hull are expressed analogously 5 x h 1 2 ρ l p p d u 2 x v v v m 2 x v r v m r x r r r 2 x v v v v v m 4 r t y h

disturbances ocean surface winds non uniform ocean currents and irregular short crested waves produce the major environmental disturbances that affect navigation safety in the open sea the forces moments acting on ships due to random winds contribute to both planar and rotating ship motions the wind loads are commonly estimated based on wind load coefficients as described in eq 9 where ρ a is the air density u a is the apparent wind speed a l and a f are the lateral and front projected areas of the ship respectively l oa is ship length overall and c x c y c n and c k represent wind load coefficients many studies have relied on wind tunnel tests to obtain the coefficients and derive estimation methods the wind load coefficients using estimation method from kitamura et al 2017 are adopted for simulation in practice the wind moments on heave and pitch motions can be neglected 9 x a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 c x a f y a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 c y a l n a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 c n a l l o a k a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 c k a l 2 l o a the forces moments due to ocean currents cause drift on the ship planar motion consequently a ship generally navigates with a small drift angle to maintain its course like the wind load the current load on ships can be estimated by load coefficients hwang et al 2016 however this drift is reflected in the nonlinear viscous forces moments in eq 5 therefore we consider the drift due to ocean currents as a pure translation to avoid duplicating the current effects the relative velocity vector is calculated using eq 10 where u c and ψ c are the true velocity and true direction of the current respectively and u r and v r are relative velocity components 10 u c u c cos ψ c ψ u r u u c v c u c sin ψ c ψ v r v v c the wave induced forces x w and y w and moment n w can be superposed in practice using coefficients of discrete frequency ship speed and wave directions based on the linear hypothesis as described in eq 11 yasukawa et al 2019a where h s is the significant wave height χ e is the wave encounter angle ω k is the discrete wave frequency and θ n is the discrete wave spreading angle c is the second order wave drift coefficient in irregular sea sate and c x c y and c n are the longitudinal lateral and rotational components of the coefficient c in addition c is the second order wave drift coefficient computed using the enhanced uniﬁed theory as mention in 3 2 1 the wave drift coefficients are varying for the wave encounter angle wave frequency and ship speed therefore a build in coefficients database is utilized to obtain the coefficients in different wave conditions furthermore s w is the directional wave spectrum and x w y w and n w are the corresponding wave induced forces and moments 11 c u χ e 2 k 1 k n 1 n c u ω k χ e s w ω k θ n h s 2 δ ω δ

maintain its course as reported in the deck logs under severe weather strong winds currents waves or all these factors combined can cause course deviations however the main factors causing such deviations remain unclear therefore we evaluate single and combined environmental factors in the reproduction analysis as detailed in table 4 the influence of each environmental factor can be determined from comparisons with the measurements furthermore the contributions of winds currents and waves can be obtained from simulations in contrast such evaluations cannot be performed in real experiments which would be unfeasible given the scale and complexity 3 2 6 numerical method and validation the ship maneuvering model is numerically solved by the 4th order runge kutta method by using a constant time step of 0 1 s in all of the simulations all input parameters of the maneuvering model are listed in appendix 2 the measured data are fed into the model for simulations note that the rudder angles and engine revolutions are measured at a constant frequency of 1 hz and there is a time difference between the iterative calculation and the measured data therefore the discrete measured data are utilized to change the rudder angles and engine revolutions in the state variables every 10 time steps of the iteration for each 1 h simulation the measured navigation status at the beginning point of the 1 h data is applied for initializing the state variables in the model after initialization the state variables are iteratively solved by only inputting the measured rudder angles engine revolutions and environmental information the turning and zig zag simulations in still water are performed to validate the maneuvering model the normal ship speed 14 knots and normal revolution 122 r min are used for simulations the sea trial test data are compared with the simulations the turning simulations and test results using 35 rudder angles are given in fig 12 the zig zag simulations and test results using 20 20 and 10 10 rudder angles are shown in figs 13 and 14 furthermore the comparison of turning indices including advance distance ad and tactical diameter dt are given in table 5 the comparison of overshoot angles osas are provided in table 6 the simulated results show good agreement with the sea trial data which indicate satisfied accuracy of the model 4 reproduction results and statistical analysis in this section the reproduced ocean environmental fields are first discussed the maneuvering simulations are performed based on the simulated environmental fields and measured rudder angles and engine revolutions furthermore we conduct statistical analyses to determine the relations between the abnormal maneuvers and the environmental disturbances in the study cases finally a rudder attenuation function is proposed based on the analyzed results 4 1 spatiotemporally varying ocean environment the reproduced ocean environmental fields within 1 day are shown in left columns of figs 15 and 16 where the wind current and wave vector fields are denoted by different colors and the color map represents the significant wave height field in case 1 the wave crest moves from northwest to east and the bulk carrier encounters rough waves on june 3 being consistent with the periods of large roll and pitch motions shown in fig 4 the ship remains under following seas or stern quartering seas before june 5 and alters its course temporarily on june 5 when the situation changes to beam seas likewise in case 2 a similar wave crest moves from south to northeast and the bulk carrier encounters rough waves on june 15 being also consistent with the periods of large roll and pitch motions the ship remains under stern quartering seas before june 16 and its course is temporarily altered on this date the estimated ship motions almost agreed with the measured ones implying that the estimated waves are reliable around the ship track furthermore another validation is conducted with the reanalysis data of the significant wave height distribution obtained from noaa in cases 1 and 2 as shown in right columns of figs 15 and 16 these reanalysis data are blended between the measured information and the simulations and can be considered the most reliable in the current situation the wave height distributions are extremely similar to those in the reproduction and the estimated waves almost agree spatially as well 4 2 preliminary maneuvering simulations the ship encountered rough seas and large rudder angles were applied to maintain the course in the evaluated cases we selected the first 2 h of measured data in rough seas for preliminary simulations the measured rudder and heading angles in the first 2 h are shown in fig 17 where the initial heading values are adjusted to zero for improved visualization note that the environmental vector fields will change from space and time the drawn direction can conveniently show the spatiotemporal varying characteristics of the environmental vectors where the green blue and red arrows indicate the true directions of wind current and wave respectively from the preliminary simulations we obtained the simulated trajectories shown in fig 18 where the environmental conditions correspond to those listed in table 4 the average significant wave height wave period wind speed and current speed are 5 14 m 7 60 s 10 11 m s and 0 11 m s respectively for the first hour and 4 89 m 7 69 s 10 34 m s and 0 09 m s respectively for the second hour in the preliminary simulations the reproduced trajectories show large deviations from the measured positions nevertheless some useful information can be extracted from these simulations initially the winds currents and waves make the ship drift along different directions in addition the drift effect of the current is not strong as suggested by the small differences between conditions neglecting currents i e conditions 1 2 4 and 6 in table 4 and those including currents i e conditions 3 5 7 and 8 in table 4 finally the inconsistency between reproduced trajectories and measurements indicates that the rudder effect does not agree with the environmental disturbances obtained from the simulations to unveil the reasons for such deviations we conducted various statistical analyses considering both the measurements and reproduced ocean environment 4 3 relations between rudder and environmental factors this section presents the correlation as well as the multi regression analysis between the abnormal rudder series and each environmental factor a rudder attenuation function comprising vital factors is derived from the regression results further the maneuvering records of the study cases are simulated based on the attenuation function 4 3 1 correlation analysis in this section a correlation analysis is described to reveal the relationship between the rudder angles and the seven environmental factors first the time series of the significant rudder angles δs and the time series of the seven factors that were adopted for a comparison figs 19 and 20 compare the rudder angles to the values of each environmental factor because rudder angles and environmental factors have different units these values were normalized by the maximum values of the rudder angle wave height wave period wave direction wind speed wind direction current speed and current direction it should be noted that the significant rudder angles change almost synchronously with wind speed u a significant wave height hs and mean wave period t m second the corresponding pearson and spearman correlation coefficients were computed based on the normalized values these are shown in figs 21 and 22 the two correlation coefficients were calculated to reveal the linear but monotonic relations between the rudder angles and environmental factors briefly the correlation coefficients range from 1 0 to 1 0 values of 0 7 1 0 indicate strong positive correlation 0 4 0 7 indicate moderate positive correlation and 0 0 0 4 indicate low positive correlation the same ranges for negative values indicate the corresponding negative correlations the spearman correlation coefficients are more adaptive than the pearson correlation coefficients because the latter assume gaussian distributions of the data the following conclusions could be drawn from the correlation analysis 1 the rudder angles have a strong positive correlation with both the wave height and wave period in two cases which implies that a large rudder angle will be employed in waves with a large hs and a long t m 2 a moderate negative correlation with the wave encountered angle in two cases indicates increased difficulty in maintaining the ship s course in following seas than in head seas 3 a significant rudder angle has a strong positive correlation with the wind speed which implies that large rudders will be used in strong winds 4 a moderate negative correlation between the rudder angle and the current speed can be observed in both cases 5 however both the apparent wind direction and the relative current direction show a weak correlation with the rudder angles indicating no obvious linear or monotonic relations to summarize the wave height wave period wind speed current speed and wave encounter angle may be the most significant factors that lead to abnormal large rudder angles in the two cases 4 3 2 multi regression analysis in the previous section we determined the five critical factors hs t m u a u c χ e leading to abnormal rudder angles in the two cases however we cannot determine the order of their importance only by a correlation analysis therefore we perform a multilinear regression analysis based on different combinations of the factors in order to reveal the order of importance of these factors initially we began with regression model i considering all the factors as shown in eq 12 the significant rudder angle was defined as a linear function consisting of all the factors with their coefficients a i i 1 7 and a constant c 1 the time series values of all factors and the significant rudder angles in the two cases were made into an entire dataset for multi regression the dataset consists of 10 min average values of factors and rudder angles correspondingly each case with a total length of 5 days contains 720 data points i e the total size of the data set matrix is 1440 rows and 8 columns where the first column is the rudder angle and the other seven columns are environmental factors the estimated coefficients with a 95 confidence level and the p values of each coefficient of model ⅰ are given in table 7 briefly the p value is used to describe the level of statistical significance the smaller the p value the stronger the evidence that we should reject the null hypothesis additionally the null hypothesis states that there is no relationship between the two variables being studied furthermore r squared r 2 represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable δ s that is explained by variables environmental factors in a regression model the sign of the coefficients would reflect the positive or negative correlation between δ s and factors and these signs are consistent with the results in the previous correlation analysis note that the coefficient a 4 is 0 12193 while a p value higher than 0 05 is not statistically significant and indicates strong evidence for the null hypothesis in addition a large coefficient a 4 indicates that the relationship between the relative current direction and the significant rudder angle is not statistically significant which is consistent with the small correlation coefficients of the relative current direction in contrast other p values of the coefficients are considerably less than 0 05 providing strong evidence against the null hypothesis these p values could also reflect the order of importance of the factors the coefficient a 5 with a p value of 1 1322 10 119 implies that the significant wave height may be the most important factor among the seven factors an interesting fact is that the coefficient a 2 is very small we also could not find large correlation coefficients of the apparent wind direction in the previous section 12 i f δ s c 1 a 1 u a a 2 ψ r a a 3 u c a 4 ψ r c a 5 h s a 6 t m a 7 χ e more regression analyses are

consists of only wind factors and model ⅳ r 2 0 102 consists of only current factors both models ⅲ and ⅳ cannot explain the variance of δs however model ⅴ r 2 0 679 consists of only wave factors indicating their importance moreover model ⅵ r 2 0 710 consists of only magnitudes of the wind current and wave and model ⅶ r 2 0 279 consists of only the directions of the factors models ⅵ and ⅶ simply indicate that the magnitudes are more important than the directions these findings are consistent with the p values in table 7 and the order of importance of the factors is a 5 a 1 a 6 a 3 a 2

environmental factors and the significance of each factor through the analysis in section 4 3 this provided a basis for us to discuss the disagreement between rudder effects and environmental factors in section 4 2 according to nautical experiences a ship commonly sets the autopilot threshold to be approximately 15 under severe weather conditions in the studied cases the large and frequently changing rudder angles seem to be abnormal the evolution of environmental factors in fig 6 reveals that the ship has been encountering strong winds and waves moreover the ranges of directions in fig 7 show that the ship mostly corresponds to following waves stern quartering waves and beam waves in the two cases a more steer effective design would reduce the tendency of the vessel to broach in a following and stern quartering sea bonci m et al 2019 implying that the ship may experience reduced steering effectiveness in such wave conditions the significant rudder angles appear to have a strong positive correlation with the wave height wave period wind speed and current speed according to figs 21 and 22 furthermore the significant rudder angles also show a moderate negative correlation with the wave encounter angles thus the disagreement in the preliminary simulations may be caused by overestimating the rudder effect considering the above analyses consequently the ship could experience reduced steering effectiveness in the environmental conditions given in table 3 which is not reflected in eq 6 therefore an attenuation factor f a is added to modify the rudder normal force f n as defined in eq 14 where f na represents the attenuated rudder normal force this factor f a describes the attenuation of rudder effectiveness in the studied cases it is considered as a polynomial function of six environmental factors the relative current direction ψ rc is excluded from f a as discussed in the previous section moreover the f a function is established based on model ⅱ and the square of wind speed and the wave height are adopted considering eqs 9 and 11 14 f n a f n f a u a ψ r a u c h s t m χ e f a e 1 b 1 u a 2 b 2 ψ r a b 3 u c b 4 h a 2 b 5 t m b 6 χ e then simulations with different values of f a are performed and multi regression analysis is adopted to estimate the coefficients of the function a 10 min time series every 3 h from the measured data and actual sea data of the two cases 120 h is used to establish a simulation dataset on the one hand this approach ensures that the simulation dataset contains most environmental conditions on the other hand it avoids overfitting the original measurement data therefore the simulation data set contains 80 sets of data two cases and we use 10 discrete f a values from 0 1 to 1 0 to simulate each set of data subsequently the simulation results are compared with the measured data to calculate the rmses of the position and heading each group of data has 10 rmses corresponding to 10 f a values the optimal f a is obtained through the non linear fitting of the rmses the f a value with the minimum rmse is defined as the optimal attenuation factor of the corresponding environmental conditions the 80 optimal f a values with the corresponding environmental factors are indicated in fig 24 finally the coefficients e 1 b i 1 6 of the function of f a are estimated by multi regression on the 80 optimal f a values with the corresponding environmental factors as shown in table 8 it can be observed that the f a values have a negative correlation with the wind speed wave height and wave period moreover f a values of approximately 0 5 0 8 are concentrated in the 0 0 2 m s range of current speed and 0 50 range of wave encounter angle the f a values appear to have no obvious correlation with the apparent wind direction on one hand these phenomena agree with the conclusion drawn in section 4 4 on the other hand they indicate that the attenuation of rudder effectiveness increases with an increase in the wind speed wave height and wave period in addition the attenuation of rudder effectiveness is larger when the ship is under following and stern quartering waves furthermore the signs of the coefficients e 1 b i 1 6 of the five factors u a u c hs t m χ e in table 8 are opposite to the signs in table 7 which further illustrates that an increase in the rudder angle of the two cases was caused by the attenuation of the rudder effectiveness in rough seas 4 5 reproduced maneuvers the maneuvers in the event of the maneuvering difficulties as shown in table 2 were reproduced to validate the rudder attenuation function to construct the validation dataset selected the measurement data of the time period when the maneuvering difficulties discussed in section 2 3 occurred there were 10 h of data in case 1 06 05 2013 03 00 13 00 and 5 h of data in case 2 06 16 2013 00 00 06 00 the simulations were performed hour by hour and the measured rudder angles were directly input into the ship motion model the attenuation factor function f a was applied to calculate the rudder normal forces the reproduced trajectories for cases 1 and 2 are shown in figs 25 and 26 respectively where the environmental conditions 5 to 7 in table 4 are omitted for better visualization the detailed hourly reproduced data trajectory and heading including all environmental conditions are shown in appendix 3 the root mean square errors rmses of the reproduced trajectories and heading angles with respect to the measurements are shown in figs 27 and 28 the hourly rmse for case 1 was divided into 5 h graphs for improved visualization the average rmses for the two cases are listed in table 9 considering all environmental factors to the reproduced trajectories agree well with the measurements the first 2 h simulations under condition 8 are consistent with the measured data after applying the rudder attenuation factor the disagreement in the preliminary simulations are because of reduced rudder effectiveness the remaining simulation results further verify this inference and they also show that the attenuation factor f a obtained by our regression analysis can effectively reflect the relationship between the reduced rudder normal force and the different environmental factors the rmses for the combinations of wind wave and all the environmental factors are smaller than those for the other environmental conditions as shown in figs 27 and 28 this result is consistent with the inferences discussed in section 4 4 however the rmses under all environmental factors have minimum values which indicate that the ocean current effect cannot be negligible 5 discussions this section presents certain limitations of the study we use both measurement and simulation data to explore the specific relationship between the abnormal rudder angles and the environmental factors in severe weather finally we propose a rudder effect attenuation function to explain the abnormal rudder angle sequence in severe weather owing to technical failures with wave observations in severe weather we used the simulated environment information to calculate the environmental disturbances however the measured rudder angle and engine revolutions drive the maneuvering motion model to ensure consistent control behavior with the original record judging from the analysis results of section 4 1 the ocean environment simulation is credible implying that it is also feasible to use this method for maneuvering simulations in real seas it is worth noting that the ship studied in this article is a bulk carrier with a single propeller and a single rudder table 1 lists the specific parameters of this ship further the environmental factors in the study cases have certain ranges as explained in detail in section 2 4 the specific types of ships and the range of environmental factors indicate that the proposed rudder attenuation function may not be applicable to other types of ships and conditions outside the weather ranges this is because different types of ships will show different maneuverability in and responses to different ocean environmental disturbances moreover we focused on the difficulty of maneuvering in beam and following waves even in similar severe weather the change in rudder efficiency under other wave encounter angles still needs more measurement data for further analysis and verification finally although this article uses numerous simulation analysis results the ultimate goal is still to explore the possible explanation of abnormal rudder angles in the study cases based on the analysis results of sections 4 3 and 4 4 the relations between the rudder and the environmental factors of the original data exhibit the same trend as the simulation data after the rudder attenuation function is applied it indicates that the simulation method used in this study is effective and verifies that the rudder effect attenuation is a feasible explanation for abnormal rudder angles in the study cases ensuring navigation safety in severe weather is an important part of mass development therefore a large number of simulation verifications will need to be performed before an actual ship test and the influence of weather in real seas on the maneuvering should be accurately reflected in the simulations in this study the rudder effect attenuation based on measurement data and simulation data provides insights into ships sailing in severe weather in actual seas which can benefit the simulation analysis in mass development 6 conclusions this study investigated the maneuvering difficulties of a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier in rough seas the goal was to explain the abnormal rudder angles that occurred in the study cases firstly the spatiotemporal variation of the actual sea was considered based on realistic environmental fields in addition a ship maneuvering model considering environmental disturbances was built to reproduce the time histories of maneuvers under different environmental conditions secondly the maneuvering simulations were performed based on the measured rudder angles engine revolutions and reproduced ocean environments the preliminary simulations demonstrated poor consistency with the onboard measurement thirdly correlation analysis and multiregression analysis were conducted between rudder angles and each environmental factor to further investigate this inconsistency based on the correlation and multiregression analyses we infer that the unusual rudder angles were caused by reduced rudder efficiency finally an attenuation function for rudder effectiveness was proposed and validated by using measured data the conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 an attenuation function was proposed to simulate the reduction in the steering effectiveness in the study cases by multiplying the normal forces of the rudder with an attenuation coefficient f a a verification dataset was built from the measured data the simulation results were consistent with the verification dataset after applying the rudder attenuation function which further explained the disagreement in the preliminary simulations this function could feasibly explain the abnormal maneuvers that occurred in severe weather in the study cases and could serve as a practical method to realize better accuracy of full scale ship maneuvering simulations in actual sea 2 the rmses of the verification dataset showed that the simulations for individual factors have large deviations although the impact of wind and waves is extremely significant the effects of currents on the maneuvering difficulty cannot be ignored 3 both simulation tests and sea trials are necessary for the development of mass in this study we explored abnormal maneuvers that occurred in real voyages and derived a rudder attenuation function to improve the simulation consistency of real ships in severe weather the onboard measured data and the findings derived from these data are considered as practical guidance to assist the development of mass credit authorship contribution statement qianfeng jing writing original draft

transportation wuhan university of technology wuhan china corresponding author hull waterjet interaction is a key point in the research of waterjet propelled crafts the previous researches on hull waterjet interaction mainly aim at displacement ships and planing monohulls and mostly focus on speeds of frl 1 5 which has not included maximum speed of waterjet propelled crafts in current engineering practice based on numerical and experimental research this paper studies the hull waterjet interaction of a high speed planing trimaran in the speed range of 0 68 fr 6 16 0 32 frl 2 87 including analysis of thrust deduction and interaction efficiency the numerical simulation is based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation with the sst k ω turbulence model as for semi planing and planing state of this planing trimaran the local effect of waterjet suction and jet is helpful to reduce the resistance while the global hull attitude change will cause the increment on resistance of self propelled hull compared with monohulls the negative resistance increment fraction of this trimaran occurs at higher speed the jet system thrust deduction fraction is always negative at high speeds and increases almost linearly with speed growth the interaction efficiency is larger than 1 0 when fr 2 0 indicating that the hull waterjet interaction of this trimaran has positive effects on propulsion performance at semi planing and planing state keywords planing trimaran waterjet propulsion thrust deduction interaction efficiency computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction compared with conventional propellers waterjet propulsion has the advantages of higher propulsion efficiency better anti cavitation performance at high speeds superior maneuverability and suitability for shallow water navigation it has been widely used in high speed and high performance ships furthermore as there are great differences between waterjet and propeller in both working principle and mechanical structure it is improper to simply apply the theory of conventional propeller ships to the design and evaluation of waterjet crafts the interaction between warterjet and hull is obvious and the thrust deduction of waterjet crafts can even be negative at some speeds therefore the research on the interaction mechanism between hull and waterjet is helpful to the design and performance evaluation of waterjet ships which is also the research focus and hot points as early as 1987 the high speed vehicle committee of international towing tank conference ittc 20th 1987 provided a rough procedure for waterjet propulsion tests coop 1995 conducted experimental test and theoretical analysis of the hull waterjet interaction for a prismatic planing hull at both full scale and model scale he proposed three possible mechanisms causing the interaction between hull and waterjet including momentum flux forces caused by waterjet loss of planing area at the intake and lift loss in the wake in his thesis empirical and theoretical models were put forward to analyze the hydrodynamics of waterjet crafts which was based on the savitsky equations and mechanisms of overall interactions the negative thrust deduction fractions measured in his tests were up to 8 in the hump region for certain towing positions van terwisga 1996 made a lot of contributions on the research of waterjet propulsion he presented a consistent set of definitions for the overall hull waterjet system based on the collection and analysis of waterjet propulsion tests he found that for waterjet crafts there was a distinct variation of the thrust deduction fraction in a wide speed range moreover the variation of thrust deduction were also found to be relevant with the length breadth ratio of hull the shorter l b hulls may have the higher values of thrust deduction fraction he proposed and explained the difference between gross thrust and net thrust and stated that the resistance increment caused by the induced flow of waterjet can be measured by the difference between the gross thrust of waterjet and the resistance of bare hull through the analysis of waterjet propulsion test procedure he suggested that for power conversion the best estimate for the intake area is using a semi ellipsoid with a width of approximate 1 5 times the geometrical width he divided the effects of hull waterjet interaction into global effect caused by sinkage and trim variation between self propelled hull and bare hull and local effect caused by waterjet ingested flow based on the analysis of a single waterjet unit he pointed out that the hull trim is the most significant impact in the analysis of resistance increment of self propelled hull and the sharp peak in the curve of thrust deduction fraction is mainly caused by the water clearing of the transom their work is mainly carried out through model test as the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd tools was limited at that time it was hard to do more detailed analysis of the flow field of hull waterjet system the self propelled test method and analysis approach of waterjet propelled ship also received great attention at that time then the ittc organized a special committee on waterjet propulsion which had been working for a couple of years on the research of waterjet propulsion such as test procedure performance analysis hull waterjet interaction and so on ittc 21st 1996 ittc 22nd 1998 ittc 23rd 2002 ittc 24th 2005 ittc 25th 2008 through the efforts and cooperations of many research institutions at the 23rd ittc the scheme of waterjet test procedures was proposed and was further improved in the report of 24th and 25th ittc the procedures provided details on the overall definitions of waterjet system relevant parameters and the velocity distributions of the capture area of waterjet ingested flow in detail cfd method was believed as a feasible approach to get the geometry of the capture area of ingested flow the ittc has continued to pay attention to the research on the overall performance evaluation and full scale prediction method of waterjet system ittc 26th 2011 ittc 28th 2017 in recent years with the rapid development of cfd technology remarkable achievements have been made in numerical prediction of hydrodynamic performance of waterjet propulsion based on numerical simulation and model test bulten 2006 conducted a detailed analysis of a waterjet system in his doctoral thesis he found that there was a certain difference in the axial thrust of the waterjet unit calculated by the surface integration method and the momentum balance equation which is even larger in higher speeds through his research he supposed that the method based on the momentum balance to describe warterjet installations is not accurate which may be partly caused by the neglect of the influence of the hull in the vicinity of the waterjet inlet and partly caused by the neglect of the contributions of pressure distribution acting on the streamtube focusing on the overall process of the analysis and design of waterjet propulsion ding 2009a 2009b carried out the theoretical and numerical research on the performance of the waterjet system he programmed a user defined function to identify the waterjet ingested flow and non ingested flow to obtain the accurate shape of inlet streamtube he supposed that the inlet duct loss is the energy difference between the nozzle of jet flow and the capture area of inlet flow and thus the flow loss coefficient of the inlet duct can be calculated huang et al 2020 and luo et al 2020 investigate the mechanism of the energy loss and pressure fluctuations caused by the non uniform inflow for a waterjet pump they found that at the cruising speed of 45 knot the flows inside the duct are strongly affected by the impeller rotation and present a periodic prewhirl motion with the dominant frequency of the impeller rotating frequency the numerical research on the hydrodynamic of overall hull waterjet system is also increasing rapidly eslamdoost et al 2014 2015 2016 2018 carried out a detailed numerical research on the hydrodynamics of a monohull planing craft and discussed the mechanism of the hull waterjet interaction which mainly focused on the speed range of 0 2 frl 1 4 in their research a body force model is employed instead of modeling the actual geometry of the waterjet pump based on the potential flow theory he developed the pressure jump method to replace the waterjet pump this method is used to balance the hull resistance by the thrust generated by the increase of fluid head energy through the pump then in order to analyze the global effect and local effect of overall system he introduced an intermediate model which is a bare hull having the same sinkage and trim as the self propelled hull through the change of the stern wave and flow at various speeds he discovered the match between the stern wetting surface and the thrust reduction at low speeds moreover he also supposed that the negative thrust deduction fraction in the intermediate speed range 0 47 frl 1 0 is not due to reduced hull resistance the waterjet propelled hull resistance remains rather unaffected compared to the bare hull resistance he proposed that the major reason for negative thrust deduction is the jet system thrust deduction fraction which reflects the difference between the net thrust and the gross thrust gong et al 2017 2019 measured the inlet duct velocity distribution in a self propulsion test of a four waterjet ship model by using piv device based on experimental and numerical research they also analyzed the different effects on the propulsion performance of the outer and inner waterjets on a four waterjet prepelled ship their work is helpful to explore the flow field characteristics of multi waterjet propulsion system guo et al 2020 conducted numerical simulations on the hydrodynamic performance of a waterjet propelled trimaran in a speed range of 0 196 frl 0 707 their results reflected that for their displacement trimaran the resistance increment fraction and thrust deduction fraction were always positive to summarize the related researches on the hull waterjet interaction of waterjet propelled crafts mainly focus on the mechanism of thrust deduction as it is significantly different from the conventional propeller ships and play a more important role on the hull waterjet interaction on the other hand the previous researches mostly discussed the speed range of frl 1 5 which has not included the maximum speed of waterjet propelled ships in current engineering practice especially for high speed planing crafts in fact there are two tough difficulties for this one is that the momentum flux of the waterjet units is not easy to be measured accurately in the self propelled test at high speeds on the other hand it is also not easy to use cfd tools to simulate the hydrodynamics of the bare hull and self propelled hull at very high speeds however in practical application the design speed of the waterjet planing crafts is constantly increasing so it is of great practical significance to explore the mechanism of the hull waterjet interaction in a wider range of speed especially the prediction of thrust deduction fraction which can provide references for ship design and match of ship waterjet and engine furthermore a variety of new ship types have been applied to high speed and high performance ships among which planing trimaran has attracted more and more attention due to its small wave low resistance and good seakeeping at high speeds however there are still few researches on the hull waterjet interaction of waterjet propelled planing trimaran thus taking a two wterjet propelled planing trimaran as research objective this paper has done related works to explore the mechanism of hull waterjet interaction of planing trimaran mainly focusing on the speed range of 0 68 fr 6 16 0 32 frl 2 87 2 research theory objective 2 1 basic theory for a large number of displacement ships and semi planing crafts the speed conditions are always represented as the length froude number frl which is nondimensional and defined as eq 1 1 f r l v g l w l where v is the ship speed lwl is the length of hull waterline and g is the gravitational acceleration for regular displacement ship their navigation is mostly in the displacement state however for high speed ships such as planing crafts the hull navigation states are various with the increase of sailing speeds thus the speed conditions of planing crafts are usually represented as the volume froude number fr which is defined as eq 2 2 f r v g 1 3 where is the ship displacement volume at the static floating condition as the previous researches on the hull waterjet interaction is mainly focused on the displacement state and semi planing state fr 3 0 this paper will use both frl and fr to show the research results in order to better compare with the previous studies and reflect the navigation states of the planing trimaran under different speeds at the same time for the analysis procedures of waterjet system the ittc specialist committee on waterjets has proposed proven procedures for the determination of hydrodynamic performance of waterjet propelled vessels which had been modified for years and was basically finalized in 2005 ittc 24th 2005 although the direct thrust measurement method of waterjet is achievable this approach is pretty expensive and cumbersome for actual operation thus the experimental and theoretical analysis procedure concluded by ittc is based on momentum flux method the momentum flux method is used to measure the flow rate of the waterjet and then the waterjet thrust can be obtained indirectly according to the momentum theorem fig 1 shows the waterjet control volume which is defined in 21st ittc 1996 in detail surface 1 is a virtual cross section of the streamtube and this capture area is generally positioned far enough in front of the intake ramp tangency point before inlet losses occur ittc 21st 1996 surface 2 is the boundary of inlet streamtube which separates the internal ingested flow of control volume from the external flow field fig 2 shows a three dimensional sketch of the inlet streamtube surface 3 is the material boundary of waterjet system surface 4 is the surface between the stagnation lines and merge lines of hull and duct the part 5 represents the waterjet pump moreover surface 6 is the nozzle section and surface 7 is the vena contract of jet flow where pressure is atmospheric for measurements in model tests it is difficult to find the exact position of surface 7 the mass flow rate of waterjet pump is generally obtained indirectly by measuring the pressure distribution of surface 6 at nozzle section particularly if outgoing streamlines are all parallel leaving the nozzle discharge the pressure at the nozzle should also be atmospheric otherwise the pressure on surface 6 will not be atmospheric and the outlet drag will also occur at surface 6 based on the recommended procedures and guidelines for propulsive performance predictions ittc 2005 the volume control equation of the waterjet control unit can be represented as eq 3 where the einstein notation is used and i j k range over 1 2 and 3 3 a 1 a 6 ρ u i u k n k d a a 1 a 2 a 3 a 6 σ i j n j d a v 5 ρ f p i d v v 1 6 ρ f i d v where ρ is water density u is the velocity vector n is the normal vector on the surface σij is the tensor representing surface shear and pressure forces fpi is the force of waterjet pump and fi is the external body force acting on the control volume in the self propulsion tests the gross thrust is the definition of the term on the left side of eq 1 which is abbreviated as tg and defined as eq 4 4 t g a 1 a 6 ρ u x u k n k d a the net thrust is defined as the force vector acting upon the internal material boundary of waterjet which acts directly on the hull to balance the resistance instead of body force model the real geometry of waterjet has been used in this paper thus the net thrust in x direction is abbreviated as tnet and defined as eq 5 5 t n e t a 3 a 4 a 5 σ 1 j n j d a it is difficult to measure the net thrust of waterjet in experiments and thus the gross thrust of waterjet is used to define the thrust deduction in waterjet propulsion system which is quietly different from propulsion theory of conventional propeller ships thus in the performance analysis of waterjet system the total thrust deduction fraction t can be calculated by eq 6 6 t 1 r b h f d t g where rbh is the resistance of bare hull in model scale fd is the external tow force for the difference of the frictional resistance coefficient between the model and full scale and it is defined as follows 7 f d r b h ρ m ρ s r b h s λ 3 where rbh and rbh s is the total resistance of model ship and full scale ship separately λ is the scale ratio ρm and ρs respectively denote the density of water in model tests and sea conditions although it is hard to measure the net thrust of waterjet in the model test it is feasible to obtain the tnet in the numerical simulations in the theory of waterjet propulsion the resistance increment fraction tr is used to express the relationship between the net thrust of waterjet the resistance of bare hull and external tow force as shown in eq 8 8 t r 1 r b h f d t n e t the difference between the total thrust tg and the net thrust tnet can be expressed in the jet system thrust deduction fraction tj which is defined as eq 9 eslamdoost 2014 9 t j 1 t n e t t g thus the relationship among thrust deduction fraction the resistance increment fraction and the jet system thrust deduction fraction is as eq 10 10 1 t 1 t r 1 t j the thrust deduction fraction reflects the effect of waterjet actions on the hull resistance conversely the waterjet ingested flow will also be influenced by the hull which can be divided into interaction on momentum flux and energy flux separately based on the ittc regulations ittc 24th 2005 the momentum interaction efficiency η m i and the energy interaction efficiency η e i is defined as eq 11 the following terms with subscript 0 are corresponding parameters in the free stream condition 11 1 η m i p t e p t e 0 t g r o s s t g r o s s 0 1 1 c m 1 n v r 1 where cm1 is the momentum velocity coefficient at surface 1 nvr is the nozzle velocity ratio and their definitions are given as follows 12 c m 1 1 1 c p 2 q j v 0 a 1 u x 2 d a 13 n v r u 6 v 0 where cp is the static pressure coefficient qj is the flow rate of waterjet v0 is the ship velocity and u 6 is the average flow velocity at surface 6 the energy interaction efficiency is defined as follows 14 η e i p j s e 0 p j s e e 6 e 0 e 6 e 1 where en is the total axial energy flux through a cross sectional area an the effect of hull waterjet interaction on overall efficiency is defined as interaction efficiency η i n t calculated by eq 15 15 η i n t 1 t η e i η m i moreover the overall efficiency of the waterjet hull system is defined as shown in eq 16 16 η d η 0 η i n t η i η d u c t η p u m p 1 t η e i η m i where η 0 represents the free stream efficiency of waterjet η i is the ideal jet efficiency η d u c t is the ducting efficiency and η p u m p is the pump efficiency 2 2 hull and waterjet geometry a high speed planing trimaran with two sets of waterjets is chosen for this research as shown in fig 3 the hull and waterjet geometries are all at the model scale two waterjet systems are the conventional ones with flush intakes the numbers of rotor blades is 3 while the number of stator blades is 7 the scale ratio of this model ship is 2 8 and the main parameters of the ship and waterjet models are presented in table 1 3 computation methodology 3 1 computations of bare hull the simulations are conducted with the code star ccm 14 04 based on the finite volume method fvm the rans equations and the continuity equation in integral form the s s t k ω turbulence model with wall functions is applied the second order upwind scheme is used to discrete the governing equations to reduce the transaction errors the volume of fluid vof method and the high resolution interface capturing hric format is used to trace the free surface considering the symmetry of the hull only half domain of the flow field on the side of the symmetric plane is adopted all y wall treatments were selected where intelligently the viscous sublayer was directly resolved if y 1 and wall functions are used to obtain the boundary conditions for the continuum equations if y 30 siemens 2019 otherwise a blending function is then used if 1 y 30 the convective and temporal discretization schemes were second order upwind schemes the implicit unsteady solver based on the separated flow model was used the motion of hull is simulated based on the method of overset mesh in detail the overset domain which activate the motion function of sinkage and trim including the hulls and the surrounding rectangular domain while the background region was stationary the length of overset domain is 1 3 time of the hull length while the width is 0 85 time of the hull beam fig 4 shows the whole field domain and its boundary conditions of the computations of bare hull with sailing speed growing the thickness of hull boundary layer at the same position is getting thinner and the velocity gradient in hull boundary layer changes larger thus at high speeds the velocity gradient in the hull boundary layer is rather large and the turbulence flow is strong in the planing state the turbulent flow in the hull boundary layer needs to be simulated by more detailed grids but the number of grids can be reduced appropriately at low and medium speed based on the rans method and the overset mesh technique ding and jiang et al 2019 has done a series of numerical studies on the resistance characteristics of a high speed planing craft they analyzes the mesh factors such as mesh type mesh arrangement inside the hull boundary layer mesh size of the hull surface mesh refinement in the background domain the range of speed conditions studied in this paper is pretty wide on the premise of ensuring the simulation accuracy different boundary layer mesh arrangements should be adopted under different sailing states to improve the computational efficiency therefore the hull boundary layer growth rate is set to 1 25 and fourteen layers of prism layer meshes are used for the simulation of turbulent flow in boundary layer for speed conditions of fr 3 0 while the speed of 1 0 fr 3 0 has ten layers of prism layer meshes and the speed of fr 1 0 has 8 layers separately on the other hand as the simulation of turbulent flow in the boundary layer have a great influence on the convergence and accuracy of the numerical results each scheme ensures high refinement and the same boundary layer grid settings in the mesh dependence study to ensure that other physical quantities are compared in a reasonable solution as for the mesh refinement of free surface the area within the range of the stern kelvin wedge has been refined by three sectors fig 5 shows the mesh distribution for the detailed mesh distribution the overset domain around the hull uses the polyhedral mesh while the trimmed mesh is used in the background domain compared with the trimmed mesh each grid of polyhedral mesh has more adjacent elements which can calculate the velocity and pressure gradient more accurately and capture the local flow better adopting polyhedral mesh in the overset domain can simulate the air water distribution at hull bottom and the hydrodynamics of planing craft better especially at high planing states on the other hand as the trimmed mesh is easier to control the total number of meshes and the flow change in the far field domain is not so strong moreover the trimmed mesh is used in the background domain the mesh dependence study of bare hull was carried out at fr 6 01 which is the design speed of the planing trimaran particularly the weight of water filled in pump and duct of self propelled hull should be taken into account ittc 26th 2011 in this way the displacement weight of the bare hull and the self propelled hull are identical by varying the basic size of the mesh parameters seven sets of mesh schemes were generated the data of seven mesh schemes is shown in table 2 the mesh size variation is the only different parameter among the seven mesh schemes the transient calculation is carried out by gradually reducing the time step until the calculation results meet the time step dependence in detail each adjustment of time step takes a half of the previous time step when the values of hydrodynamic parameters are stable in the current time step the adjustment of time step should be stopped until the values of hydrodynamic parameters remain basically unchanged meeting the dependence of time step in numerical simulations eça and hoekstra 2014 proposed a procedure for the estimation of the numerical uncertainty of grid refinement studies based on the least squares root method referring to this procedure the mesh dependence study for the numerical uncertainty of bare hull was performed the non uniform refinement ratio is defined as follows 17 h i h 1 n 1 3 n i 3 where hi and ni are the typical mesh size and the total mesh number of mesh scheme i in addition h1 and n1 correspond to the finest mesh scheme the convergence fit curve of bare hull resistance is shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 mesh no 4 can obtain good numerical accuracy and may also cost reasonable cpu hours black solid dots in the figure which was selected for the simulations of bare hull the total mesh numbers of this scheme is 2 84 million where the overset domain including the hull has 2 48 million cells the numerical uncertainty for this mesh is 1 19 in the meanwhile the towing model test of bare hull resistance are also done in the speed range of 1 37 fr 6 01 the model towing tests for calm water resistance were conducted in towing tank of hydrodynamic research centre jingmen hubei china whose tank dimensions is 392 m 6 m 4 m and maximum carriage speed is 24 m s the schematic diagram of the towing test is presented in fig 7 the numerical simulations of bare hull hydrodynamics are carried out in a speed range of 0 68 fr 6 16 which has free sinkage and trim the results of numerical simulation and model test of bare hull are shown in fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 it can be seen that the deviation between numerical and experimental results of bare hull resistance becomes relatively larger with the increase of the ship speed which reaches 12 6 at fr 6 16 with the speed growth the spray resistance continuously becomes larger and its proportion to total resistance is also growing as shown in fig 11 there is obvious water spray around hull at fr 6 01 however the vof method can not accurately capture the fluid spray well in the numerical simulation which makes relatively large differences between the numerical and experimental resistances savitsky et al 2007 found that spray resistance can constitute over 15 of the total resistance at planing speeds based on the empirical formula of spray resistance the relative relationship between cfd results and real values of thrust reduction will be discussed in the section 4 4 1 3 2 computations of self propelled hull as for the numerical simulation of self propelled hull the related simulation setting mesh size and distribution and so on are basically the same as the bare hull simulations particularly the self propelled hull is equipped with two waterjet units and the real geometry of waterjet pump is used to simulate the self propelled motion of the planing trimaran in detail the rotation of waterjet rotor are simulated by the model of multi reference frame mrf to reduce the computation costs based on mrf model the simulation of waterjet flow is to use steady calculation in rotor domain and it also avoids the small time step required by the real rotation method at the same time so as to reduce the computation costs and improve the computing efficiency on the other hand there is only a small difference between the waterjet thrust obtained by mrf model and real rotation method separately as the thrust simulated by mrf model corresponds to the thrust of impeller waterjet rotor at a certain angle phase the influence of this small difference on the simulation results of propulsion performance is limited moreover the mrf model has been widely used in numerical simulation of self propelled motion of waterjet crafts whose reliability has been verified guo et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 in order to ensure the simulation accuracy of the complex flow field of the self propelled motion the mesh refinement is done for the zones such as waterjet ducting flow and wave at stern mesh refinement of waterjet ingested flow and jet flow is shown in fig 12 and the mesh of waterjet pump is shown in fig 13 same as simulations of bare hull the overset domain around the hull uses the polyhedral mesh and background domain uses the trimmed mesh moreover the domains of rotor and stator of waterjet pump are meshed by software turbogrid 16 0 to ensure the mesh quality of tip clearance between rotor blade and rotor shroud where structured grid is adopted as shown in fig 13 the balance point of self propelled motion is obtained by modifying the rotational speeds of waterjet rotor until the resistance of self propelled is equal to the sum of the net thrust of waterjet and the tow force fd the mesh dependence study of self propelled was also carried out at fr 6 01 by varying the basic size of the mesh parameters seven sets of mesh schemes were generated the data of seven mesh schemes of self propelled hull is shown in table 3 the transient calculation is also carried out by gradually reducing the time step until the calculation results meet the time step dependence furthermore the rotor thrust coefficient kt rotor and mass flow coefficient q are defined as eq 18 18 k t r o t o r t r o t o r ρ n 2 d p u m p 4 q q p u m p ρ n d p u m p 3 where trotor is the thrust of rotor blade and rotor hub in the x direction qpump is the mass flow rate of the waterjet pump the mesh dependence study for the self propelled hull was also done by the least squares root method the convergence fit curves of self propelled hull resistance rotor thrust coefficient kt rotor and mass flow coefficient q are shown in fig 14 mesh no 4 is selected for the simulations of self propelled hull as it can obtain good numerical accuracy and may also cost reasonable cpu hours black solid dots in the figure the total mesh numbers of no 4 scheme is 7 88 million where the waterjet rotor has 1 15 million cells the waterjet stator has 1 53 million cells and the overset domain including the hull has 4 81 million cells the numerical uncertainty of self propelled resistance for this mesh is 2 54 while the numerical uncertainty of kt and q is 0 43 and 0 23 separately the numerical simulations of self propelled hull are carried out in a speed range of 0 68 fr 6 16 the numerical results of self propelled hull are shown in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 compared with bare hull as for planing crafts besides static buoyancy the dynamic lift also provides part of the hull lift at semi planing and planing states the waterjet suction at intake leads to a larger trim angle of self propelled hull this larger trim angle mainly leads to the increment on dynamic lift acted on the stern accounting for the decreased sinkage of self propelled hull in comparison with bare hull moreover at low speeds the waterjet suction of this planing trimaran still leads to a deeper sinkage of self propelled hull 3 3 streamtube and capture area of ingested flow as shown in eq 6 the gross thrust of waterjet in self propelled motion is needed in the analysis of thrust deduction which is calculated by the momentum flux method thus the approach to obtain the capture area of waterjet ingested flow is particularly important guo et al 2020 developed a mathematical tool to obtain the capture area by tracking the streamlines upstream which is based on the data processing of the numerical results this method is unable to get the accurate geometry of streamtube as for bulten 2006 ding 2009a and eslamdoost 2014 they obtain the geometry of inlet capture area and streamtube by solving a scalar and convection equation in the solved reversed velocity field of waterjet system inspired by their research this paper also carried out the research on obtaining the accurate geometry of capture area and streamtube of ingested flow under various speeds as for the planing trimaran in this paper its streamtubes and capture areas of ingested flow under various speeds are shown in fig 18 and fig 19 as shown in fig 19 it can be found that the maximum axial velocity at capture area can be slightly larger than the ship speed especially at speed conditions of fr 1 03 and fr 1 37 4 analysis of thrust deduction 4 1 analysis approach in the theory of waterjet propulsion the thrust deduction is divided into the resistance increment and the jet system thrust deduction where resistance increment are caused by the local effect and the global effect the local effect refers to the flow field change caused by the waterjet ingested flows and jet flows which leads to the change of hull resistance on the other hand the global effect refers to the different sinkage and trim between the bare hull and the self propelled hull which also cause the variation of hull resistance moreover the jet system thrust deduction reflects the difference between gross thrust and net thrust the general analysis idea of eslamdoost 2014 is significant reference when carrying out the specific discussions in this paper except the conventional bare hull and self propelled hull eslamdoost introduced a bare hull which has the same sinkage and trim with the self propelled hull at the same speed as the installation of waterjet units the first difference between bare hull and self propelled hull is the hull geometry after that the effect of waterjet action will also change the flow field around the hull leading to the force imbalance acted on the hull if the ship maintains the navigation attitude as the bare hull then the force imbalance will cause the change of hull sinkage and trim making the navigation attitude of the self propelled hull reach a new balance according to the force balance change between bare hull and waterjet propelled hull three hull states are introduced in this paper including one bare hull and two self propelled hulls as shown in fig 20 the specific definition of each hull state is as follows 1 bh the bare hull with free sinkage and trim 2 shb the self propelled hull with actual waterjet which is fixed and has the same sinkage and trim with the bare hull bh and its pump rotational speed of waterjet is consistent with that of sh at the same speed 3 sh the self propelled hull with waterjet pump and inlet duct which has free sinkage and trim sailing at the self propelled balance point as for the discussion of the hull waterjet interaction the following works has been done 1 resistance increment it can be divided into the local effect comparative study of bh shb and global effect comparative study of shb sh combined with total effect of comparison between bh and sh their separate influence on the resistance increment can be analyzed in a wide speed range in this paper the local resistance increment fraction and global resistance increment fraction will be introduced for detail discussions 2 jet system thrust deduction based on the analysis of self propelled hull sh the jet system thrust deduction fraction can be calculated through the gross thrust and the net thrust in the meanwhile compared with shb and sh the effect of hull attitude change on gross thrust and net thrust can also be analyzed 3 thrust deduction the thrust deduction fraction can be directly calculated by comparing bare hull bh and self propelled hull sh otherwise the thrust deduction fraction can also be obtained through the resistance increment fraction and jet system thrust deduction fraction indirectly the resistance increment tr the jet system thrust deduction fraction tj and the thrust deduction fraction t is plotted in fig 21 fig 22 and fig 23 separately compared with the collected research values done by van tervisga 1996 eslamdoost 2014 and guo et al 2020 for various ship types particularly all the research data completed by others researchers correspond to the abscissa of frl while the computed values of this paper can be compared with frl and fr at the same time as for the resistance increment tr and the jet system thrust deduction fraction tj although the specific values corresponding to different ship types are different the basic characteristics and laws have certain similarity as for the thrust deduction fraction because it is a combination of tr and tj and different ship types and different waterjets have their own hydrodynamic characteristics the trend of thrust deduction fraction is relatively varying from ship to ship at low speed the value of resistance increment fraction is relatively large and the jet system thrust deduction fraction is mainly positive the combined effect of the above two factors leads to a larger thrust deduction fraction of the planing trimaran at low speeds compared with others researches 4 2 resistance increment as shown in fig 3 the planing craft is divided into 4 parts including main hull mh side piece channel spc transom ts and deck dc where the word hull includes all the above 4 parts for the monohull planing craft the hull resistance increases monotonously with the increase of speed at high speed planing state however for the planing trimaran there will be a straight section of hull resistance in the high speed planing state as shown in fig 7 which is mainly caused by the quickly change of water air distribution in the zone of side piece channel the resistance change of the main hull of planing trimaran is still basically consistent with that of the planing monohull while the resistance change of the side piece channel decreases rapidly with the reduction of its wet area at high speeds thus causing the total resistance of planing trimaran to remain basically unchanged within a certain speed range at high speed planing states therefore in the research of hydrodynamic of planing trimaran it is pretty necessary to separate the part of side piece channel from the hull the total resistance is also divided into the 4 corresponding parts in the following discussions particularly as shown in fig 24 the main hull of bare hull has the intake surface iks while the self propelled hull has not the above hull parts would be all named by the abbreviations if mentioned in the following discussions referring to eq 8 for the definition of resistance increment fraction tr the local resistance increment fraction trl and the global resistance increment fraction trg can be defined as follows 19 t r l 1 r b h f d r s h b h f d 20 t r g 1 r s h b h f d t n e t thus through the local resistance increment fraction trl and the global resistance increment fraction trg the resistance increment fraction tr can also be calculated as eq 21 21 t r 1 1 t r l 1 t r g t r l t r g t r l t r g according to the resistances of the hull bh shb and sh as shown in fig 25 the local resistance increment fraction trl and the global resistance increment fraction trg can be calculated the results is shown in fig 26 4 2 1 local resistance increment fraction trl in order to analyze the reasons causing the change of the local resistance increment fraction trl the separate resistances of different parts of the hull bh and shb are presented in fig 27 it can be found that the difference between resistance of bh and shb local effect is mainly due to the variation of main hull mh and side piece channel spc in the main speed range while in relatively low speed the transom clearance may also account for the large positive trl as the trend of trl curve changes with various speeds the following discussion will be carried out for three speed ranges 4 2 1 1 0 68 fr 1 37 in this range of speed displacement state mainly there is a sharp decrease in the trl curve while the value is mainly positive the geometry lack of the intake surface plays a minor role at low speeds for local effect in resistance increment in general the difference of transom resistance between bh and shb is the main reason for the rapid change of trl at low speeds firstly as for the installation of waterjets a disc area is excavated from the transom making the transom area of shb smaller than bh at low speeds the transom is partially submerged in water the pressure of water acted on transom points to the bow and there is less frictional resistance acted on transom resulting in a negative resistance of transom positive resistance pointing to the stern thus the installation of waterjet pump will lead to the loss of the transom area of shb resulting in the increase the hull resistance obviously as the total resistance is relatively small at low speeds then resulting in a large positive trl at first with the increase of speed the total resistance increased rapidly and the proportion of resistance increment caused by transom geometric loss decreased significantly which leads to the sharp decrease of trl as shown in fig 28 it can be found that there is a big difference of stern wave patterns of bh and shb at fr 1 03 which reflects that the waterjet action will change the stern wave and the critical speed of transom clearlance as for bh and shb the differences between these two hulls are the geometry loss of a disc area at transom and the effects of waterjet action at low speeds when the transom is wet there is a dead water zone behind the transom of bh for waterjet propelled hull the high speed jet flow will disperse the dead water zone behind stern and thus reduce the height of stern wave secondly as the installation of waterjets the complete hull boundary layer is cut off by the duct intake the stern hull behind the intake is a separate hull boundary layer as shown in fig 29 the hull boundary layer of waterjet propelled hull developing behind the intake is thinner compared with the same area of bare hull and the velocity changes more sharply in the boundary layer of stern hull the flow for waterjet propelled hull leaves the hull stern with higher axial velocity compared with bare hull the stern flow of waterjet propelled hull has a higher momentum making the stern wake break harder and wake cavity form earlier making the critical speed of shb transom clearance is earlier than bh the similar phenomenon and conclusion have also been presented by eslamdoost et al 2015 4 2 1 2 1 37 fr 2 74 in this range of speed semi planing state mainly the local resistance increment fraction trl is mainly negative and becomes largest at fr 1 78 the transoms of bare hull bh and self propelled hull shb are both dry and have little resistance in this speed range according to fig 27 the variation of local resistance increment fraction trl in this speed range is mainly influenced by the resistance of mh as the main hull resistance of shb is always smaller than bh causing the trl is negative in this speed range one reason for the resistance reduction of mh of shb is the geometry loss of intake surface at hull bottom of shb which mainly reduces the frictional resistance of mh to a small extent at semi planing states as shown in fig 30 and fig 31 the another reason is that the waterjet suction at the opening intake will lead to a high pressure area just behind the opening intake which is due to the stagnation area caused by the impact of the outflow on the stern behind the opening intake the reduction of pressure difference between the hull bow and stern leads to the decrease of mh pressure resistance of shb in comparison to bh as shown in fig 32 4 2 1 3 2 74 fr 6 16 in this speed range planing state mainly the local resistance increment fraction trl is negative the general trend of trl changes slightly at first and then has a sharp decrease since fr 5 79 as shown in figs 27 and 32 the difference of mh pressure resistance between shb and bh also mainly accounting for the negative value of trl in this speed range and the mechanism of smaller mh pressure resistance of shb is similar with the ones discussed in the section 4 2 1 2 in the meanwhile frictional resistance plays a major role in the total resistance at planing state the geometry loss of intake may lead to the reduction on mh frictional resistance of shb and the value mainly becomes larger with speed growth in the speed range of fr 3 moreover as for planing crafts the peak position of the bow wave continuously moves to the middle and evev stern of the ship with the increase of speed in the meanwhile as for the planing trimaran the peak of the bow wave will slam with the top of the channel and side piece therefore with the growth of speed the wet area of channel top decreases and moves backward resulting in the decrease on resistance of spc as shown in fig 32 when fr 5 79 the wet area of the channel top of bh is approximately parallel to the position of opening intake on self propelled hull specially as shown in fig 33 it can be found that with the same speed and hull attitudes there is an obvious difference of the wave in channel between bh and shb resulting in the big variation of wet area of spc between the two hulls as ittc suggested the acceleration effect of waterjet suction on the flow becomes negligible one intake diameter ahead of the inlet tangency point where the acceleration mainly reflects the flow velocity in the x direction at stern this acceleration effect may even be less obvious at very high planning speed fig 34 shows the velocity distribution of cross section at various position of bh and shb separately it can be found that at fr 5 79 the waterjet suction has small acceleration effect on the flow velocity in x direction at capture area of waterjet inlet however due to the water snatching effect of waterjet suction there is a significant decrease in the transverse velocity y direction of the flow at hull bottom as shown in the right section of fig 34 the closer it is to the opening intake the more obvious the deceleration effect on the transverse velocity y direction is this is one of the possible reasons for the sudden change of wave making including the wave height and peak position in the channel of shb compared with bh as the shb and bh has the same sinkage and trim the sudden change of wave making caused by the waterjet suction may mainly account for the sudden change of trl at very high speeds as for this phenomenon more detailed model tests will be conducted in the next in general the geometry loss of disc area on shb transom and waterjet jet flow play the main role on the large positive value of trl at low speeds as for the semi planing and planing state the local waterjet effect will make the hull resistance become smaller 4 2 2 global resistance increment fraction trl similar with the above analysis approach the separate resistances of different parts of sh and shb are presented in fig 35 the difference of resistance between sh and shb global effect is also mainly due to the variation of main hull mh and side piece channel spc in the whole speed range the fig 35 shows that the resistances of transom and deck of sh are almost same with those of shb and all of these resistance components play a minor role in the total resistance of both sh and shb thus the following discussions on global resistance increment fraction trg will focus on the mh and spc resistance while the transom and deck will not be discussed in detail in this section in the whole speed range the mh and spc resistance of sh are basically larger than shb except the lowest speed which is quite different in the comparison between bh and shb local effect the following discussions are also carried out for three speed ranges 4 2 2 1 0 68 fr 1 37 in this speed range there is a significant change in global resistance increment fraction trg which should be analyzed specifically for each working condition as for the speed of fr 0 68 the total resistance of sh is smaller than shb which is mainly due to variation of pressure resistance between sh and shb caused by the change of hull sinkage which have the main influence on the hydrostatic pressure resistance as shown in fig 36 and fig 37 secondly as for the speed of fr 1 03 the lift of the hull is mainly provided by static buoyancy due to the obvious effect of waterjet suction the hull of sh is more submerged compared with shb the hull attitudes of bh thus the larger stern trim angle and deeper sinkage cause an obvious increment on the mh and spc pressure resistance of sh especially the mh hydrostatic pressure resistance which leads to the sharp increase of trg and the value of trg becomes positive the fig 38 shows the pressure distribution of sh and shb at fr 1 03 therefore the global effect mainly change the hydrostatic pressure resistance at low speeds as for this planing trimaran the larger increment on mh hydrostatic pressure resistance of sh is the main reason for the large value of trg at displacement states 4 2 2 2 1 37 fr 2 74 in this speed range semi planing states the global resistance increment fraction trg is mainly positive and has a slight decrease which is mainly caused by the smaller difference between the mh resistance of sh and shb as for the speed of fr 1 37 besides static buoyancy the dynamic lift also provides part of the hull lift at this speed semi planing state sailing at fr 1 37 the larger trim angle of sh leads to the increment on dynamic lift acted on the stern accounting the slight sinkage of sh compared with the speed condition of fr 1 03 then in comparison with shb the larger trim angle of sh mainly increases the mh hydrostatic pressure resistance of sh however as the difference between mh hydrostatic pressure resistance of sh and shb is smaller and the total resistance of both rises rapidly the value of trg keeps positive but experiences a sharp decreases at this speed the fig 39 shows that the wet area of shb is slight larger than that of sh at fr 2 05 in detail the shallower sinkage and larger trim angle of sh leads to the smaller wet surface which makes the mh and spc frictional resistance of sh is smaller than shb as shown in fig 35 in the meanwhile the larger stern trim angle has caused an obvious increment on mh and spc pressure resistance of sh in total the fig 37 shows that in this speed range semi planing state the differences of hydrodynamic pressure resistance between sh and shb gradually becomes larger in converse with the change of differences of hydrostatic pressure resistance between them this is mainly due to the fact that with the increase of speed the dynamic lift play a more and more important role than static buoyancy on lifting the hull thus the dynamic lift is more sensitive to the change of trim angle while the variation of static buoyancy with change of hull attitude becomes relatively small as for this planing trimaran at the semi planing states the suction effect of waterjet inlet leads to a larger trim angle of self propelled hull sh then the larger trim angle increases the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of hull accounting for the positive trg in this speed range 4 2 2 3 2 74 fr 6 16 at high speeds planing state mainly the trg is always positive and there is an sharp increase at fr 5 79 as shown in figs 36 and 37 the global resistance increment fraction is mainly influenced by the variation of mh and spc hydrodynamic resistance between sh and shb at this speed range in the meanwhile the ratio of hydrostatic pressure resistance to total resistance decreases rapidly with the increase of velocity as for the hull of shb the effect of waterjet action changes the flow around the hull leading to the force imbalance acted on the hull as shb maintains the navigation attitude of bare hull at first as mentioned above the waterjet suction will lead to a larger trim angle of self propelled hull and a slighter sinkage due to the increase of dynamic lift on the stern however as for the very high speed range of planing states fr 5 79 as discussed in section 4 2 1 3 the waterjet suction decreases the wave height and change peak position of the bow wave in the channel of self propelled hull causing the smaller wet area of shb the smaller wet area of shb will result in the loss of hull lift so for the self propelled hull sh at very high speed range fr 5 79 compared with the hull attitudes of bh shb apart from the larger trim angle of sh the sinkage of sh is the same as that of bh or submerged a little deeper to obtain more lift to maintain the vertical force balance of the hull moreover the larger trim angle combined with the same or deeper sinkage accounts for the larger spc resistance of sh in comparison with shb at very high speed range fr 5 79 which mainly accounts for the sudden changes of trg at fr 5 79 in general the global resistance increment fraction trg is mainly influenced by the variation of mh and spc pressure resistance between sh and shb where the change of hydrostatic pressure resistance dominates at displacement basically while at semi planing and planing states the hydrodynamic pressure resistance dominates in particular as for various hull attitudes the wave making in the side channel is quietly different between shb and sh 4 2 3 total effect of resistance increment for this planing trimaran the local effect and global effect both have significant influences on the change of resistance increment fraction tr at whole speed range in detail at low speed the resistance increment fraction tr is relatively large and positive the geometry loss of the transom area and waterjet action lead to the smaller wet area of transom of self propelled hull causing the increment on hydrostatic pressure moreover the variation of hull attitude between sh and bh also leads to the resistance increment at low speeds on the other hand it can be found that the absolute value of local resistance increment fraction and global resistance increment fraction is similar but the values are opposite at semi planing and planing states compared to planing monohulls the characteristics of flow and wave making in channel both of bare hull and self propelled hull should be raised more attention for the relevant researches of planing trimaran 4 3 jet system thrust deduction the jet system thrust deduction tj reflect the difference between the net thrust and gross thrust in the measurement based on momentum flux method the pressure distribution on the capture area a1 the streamtube interface a2 and the nozzle outlet area a6 and force acted on the duct lip a4 as shown in fig 40 is all ignored which also contributes force to the waterjet thrust combined eq 4 and eq 5 the difference between gross thrust and net thrust can be obtained by eq 22 22 t g t n e t a 1 a 2 a 6 σ x d a a 4 σ x d a moreover the force on a1 a2 a4 is related with the waterjet ingested flow which can be defined as the inlet drag din while the force on a6 is caused by the waterjet jet flow which can be defined as the outlet drag dout the separate definition of inlet drag din and outlet drag dout is shown in eq 23 and eq 24 eslamdoost et al 2016 23 d i n a 1 a 2 σ x d a a 4 σ x d a 24 d o u t a 6 σ x d a the inlet drag din and outlet drag dout are closely related to ship type sailing speed waterjet working condition and the intake geometry 4 3 1 effect of hull attitude variation on tj the pump rotational speeds of sh and shb are the same and the only difference between sh and shb is their hull attitudes the results of various jet system thrust deduction tj computed on sh and shb are shown in fig 41 moreover in order to track the variation source of jet system thrust deduction the forces of a1 a2 a4 and a5 is presented in fig 42 including both sh and shb according to fig 41 it can be found that the change of hull attitude at a certain range only has small influence on the tj however the hull attitude change still has certain effects on the force of a1 and a2 while a4 and a5 is less influenced as shown in fig 42 in general although the various hull attitude only cause a small difference on tj the various hull attitudes will change the force acted on a1 and a2 to a certain extent where hydrostatic pressure play the main role at low speeds while hydrodynamic pressure is dominant at semi planing and planing state fig 43 show the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic drag on a1 of sh and shb separately 4 3 2 inlet drag din and outlet drag dout based on the computations of self propelled hydrodynamics the inlet drag din and outlet drag dout of sh is shown in fig 44 at low speed the obvious increment of the inlet drag din is mainly caused by the large trim angle which leads to the growth on hydrostatic pressure drag mainly as for the planing state the hydrodynamic pressure drag is dominant and the change trend of a1 area decrease slowly which together lead to the continuous decrease of din and keeps negative the trend of a1 area with speed growth is shown in fig 45 on the other hand the outlet drag dout caused by the non atmospheric pressure acted on nozzle outlet at the whole speed range the outlet drag dout is always negative and decreases linearly with speed the jet system thrust deduction fraction reflects the difference between the gross thrust and net thrust as shown in fig 44 the value of tj din dout tg first experiences a period of increase at low speed which is caused by the increment of inlet drag din mainly then the tj reach the peak at fr 1 03 which is just the transom clearance speed of the self propelled hull then the value of tj changes from positive to negative and then its absolute value increases with the growth of sailing speed 4 4 thrust deduction 4 4 1 discussion on spray drag high speed planing crafts have obvious water spray at semi planing and planing states which causes the spray drag moreover the spray will leads to the water flow separation vortex and other phenomena making the two phase fluid water and air at the free surface in a violent mixing state the vof method is hard to capture such strongly nonlinear flow of water spray well in the numerical simulation savitsky et al 2007 put forward a method to calculate quantitatively the whisker spray resistance of high speed planing craft which can be expressed as a function related to the trim angle the stern deadrise angle and the speed which has been widely used the function for calculating the spray drag fs as shown in eq 25 and eq 26 25 f s 1 2 ρ v 2 b 2 4 sin 2 α cos β c f s 26 tan α π tan τ 2 tan β where b is the beam of planing hull measured between the chines τ is the trim angle β is the deadrise of stern α is the angle between keel and stagnation line of spray in horizontal plane cf s represents the viscous friction coefficient of spray drag according to eq 25 and eq 26 the difference of spray drag between bh and sh is related to the trim angle mainly assuming that the cf s of them are approximately equal at the same speed thus the ratio of various spray drag between sh and bh can be calculated according to their separate trim angle based on the numerical results and the above discussion the fraction tr tj and t considering the spray drag can be analyzed as follows 27 r b h r b h a b h f s b h 1 t r t n e t f d a b h f s b h 28 t n e t t n e t a s h f s s h where r b h is the bare hull resistance in model test t n e t is the net thrust of waterjet in self propelled motion considering spray drags r b h tr and tnet are the initial results of numerical simulation and analysis fs bh and fs sh are the spray drag of bh and sh a b h and a s h are the proportions of the spray resistance that were not captured in numerical simulations respectively fd is calculated based on the results of bare hull model test then the fraction tr tj and t can be calculated by eq 29 to eq 31 29 t r 1 r b h f d t n e t 1 1 t r t n e t f d a b h f s b h f d t n e t a s h f s s h 1 1 t r t n e t a b h f s b h t n e t a s h d f s b h 30 t j 1 t n e t t g 1 t n e t a s h f s s h t g 31 t 1 1 t r 1 t j where d equals fs sh fs bh t g is the gross thrust after considering the spray drag the fig 46 shows the distribution of wall shear stress on bare hull at fr 6 01 according to the observation of stagnation lines marked in fig 46 it can be found that only a small part of spray flow is captured by using vof method this is because it is difficult to capture the atomized spray and whisker spray when vof method is used to track the free surface for most of the current engineering design and research of waterjet propelled ships numerical simulation and prediction is usually carried out only on the basis of model test of bare hull rather than further conducting the self propelled tests in this paper the purpose of this section is to evaluate the influences of spray drag on thrust deduction fraction prospectively based on the model test of bare hull and numerical simulations of bare hull and self propelled hull not expecting to predict the spray resistance accurately in practical analysis of this section it is assumed that the spray flow is less captured in the numerical simulations therefore the a b h and a s h both equals 1 and the fraction tr tj should be calculated as following 32 t r 1 1 t r t n e t f s b h t n e t d f s b h 33 t j 1 t n e t t g 1 t n e t d f s b h t g in detail the deviation between the numerical and experimental results of bh resistance is assumed as the spray drag fs bh at the corresponding speed the ratio d of various spray drag between sh and bh can be calculated according to their separate trim angle specially t g should be obtained in the added numerical simulations where the rotating speed of waterjet pump increases to make the increment of net thrust is equal to the spray resistance fs sh d fs bh at corresponding speed the results of tr tj and t is shown in fig 47 it can be found that the spray drag of sh is slightly smaller than bh at planing state while there is only a little difference between the spray drag of sh and bh at semi planing state after considering the spray drag the change of resistance increment is downward at high speeds while the jet system thrust deduction fraction remains basically the same as a result there is only a slightly larger negative thrust deduction at planing state therefore the thrust deduction fraction and resistance increment fraction obtained from numerical simulation and analysis can be effectively applied to the design and performance prediction of high speed crafts propelled by waterjet 4 4 2 the relative role of tr and tj on thrust deduction as for the thrust deduction fraction of this planing trimaran the resistance increment fraction tr and the jet system thrust deduction fraction tj are both important at low speed as the value of tj is relatively small the t is positive and it is mainly affected by tr then at the semi planing state the tr keeps decreasing and will falls to the bottom as negative value in the meanwhile the jet system thrust deduction fraction is also decreasing and falls to be negative as a result the thrust deduction fraction experience a sharp reduction in this speed range as for the planing state the tr gradually increases and grows to be positive while tj is always negative and keeps decreasing almost linearly at high speeds the thrust deduction fraction stills keeps negative but the growth trend slowed down obviously moreover as for this planing trimaran the large negative thrust deduction fraction at semi planing and planing state is mainly caused by the negative tj as the change of mh and spc resistance with speed growth is quiet various between sh and bh the negative tr mainly occurs at planing state which is different with the monohull ships 5 analysis of interaction efficiency as for the interaction on momentum and energy the effect of hull distorted flow will also influence the performance of waterjet which is defined as the momentum interaction efficiency η m i and the energy interaction efficiency η e i separately the thrust deduction fraction discussed above reflects the effect of waterjet actions on the hydrodynamic performance of hull the above two effects are synchronous which is called hull waterjet interaction based on the numerical results the interaction efficiency η i n t of has been analyzed based on the theory in section 2 1 the results of hull waterjet interaction efficiency and its components are shown in fig 48 as for the η m i and η e i their trends were basically the same which both gradually decreased with the increase of speed in detail as for this waterjet propelled planing trimaran the η m i is almost negative at semi planing and planing state while the η e i is negative only when fr 4 79 on the other hand it can be found that the value of 1 t play the more important role on deciding the trend of η i n t moreover the η i n t is larger than 1 0 when fr 2 0 which indicates that the hull waterjet interaction of this planing trimaran has positive effects on the propulsion performance at semi planing and planing state 6 conclusion prospect 1 the resistance increment fraction is pretty large at low speeds mainly due to the geometry loss of disc area on transom and waterjet jet flow which changes the hydrostatic resistance of main hull and transom the negative resistance increment fraction of this trimaran occurs at planing state thus making the negative resistance increment fraction appears at design speed and normal sailing speed is worth trying in ship design 2 as for semi planing and planing states the local waterjet actions of this planing trimaran is mostly helpful to reduce the resistance while the global hull attitude change always causes the resistance increment therefore the adjustment of navigation hull attitude can be emphasized to improve the propulsion performance of this planing trimaran 3 the jet system thrust deduction fraction of this planing trimaran is always negative at semi planing and planing states in the meanwhile the negative jet system thrust deduction fraction mainly causes the negative thrust deduction fraction at the main speed range the hull attitude change within a certain range has not obviously influenced the gross thrust net thrust and jet system thrust deduction fraction 4 based on model test of bare hull and numerical analysis of bare hull and self propelled hull this paper explores the change of thrust deduction fraction after considering water spray with empirical formulas after considering the spray drag the jet system thrust deduction fraction remains basically the same while there will be a slightly larger negative thrust deduction at high speed due to the downward movement of resistance increment fraction 5 the hull waterjet interaction of this planing trimaran mainly has positive effects on the propulsion performance at semi planing and planing state the thrust deduction fraction play a more important role on deciding the trend of interaction efficiency thus in the design and research of waterjet propelled ships more attention should be paid to the mechanism of thrust deduction credit authorship

transportation wuhan university of technology wuhan china corresponding author hull waterjet interaction is a key point in the research of waterjet propelled crafts the previous researches on hull waterjet interaction mainly aim at displacement ships and planing monohulls and mostly focus on speeds of frl 1 5 which has not included maximum speed of waterjet propelled crafts in current engineering practice based on numerical and experimental research this paper studies the hull waterjet interaction of a high speed planing trimaran in the speed range of 0 68 fr 6 16 0 32 frl 2 87 including analysis of thrust deduction and interaction efficiency the numerical simulation is based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation with the sst k ω turbulence model as for semi planing and planing state of this planing trimaran the local effect of waterjet suction and jet is helpful to reduce the resistance while the global hull attitude change will cause the increment on resistance of self propelled hull compared with monohulls the negative resistance increment fraction of this trimaran occurs at higher speed the jet system thrust deduction fraction is always negative at high speeds and increases almost linearly with speed growth the interaction efficiency is larger than 1 0 when fr 2 0 indicating that the hull waterjet interaction of this trimaran has positive effects on propulsion performance at semi planing and planing state keywords planing trimaran waterjet propulsion thrust deduction interaction efficiency computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction compared with conventional propellers waterjet propulsion has the advantages of higher propulsion efficiency better anti cavitation performance at high speeds superior maneuverability and suitability for shallow water navigation it has been widely used in high speed and high performance ships furthermore as there are great differences between waterjet and propeller in both working principle and mechanical structure it is improper to simply apply the theory of conventional propeller ships to the design and evaluation of waterjet crafts the interaction between warterjet and hull is obvious and the thrust deduction of waterjet crafts can even be negative at some speeds therefore the research on the interaction mechanism between hull and waterjet is helpful to the design and performance evaluation of waterjet ships which is also the research focus and hot points as early as 1987 the high speed vehicle committee of international towing tank conference ittc 20th 1987 provided a rough procedure for waterjet propulsion tests coop 1995 conducted experimental test and theoretical analysis of the hull waterjet interaction for a prismatic planing hull at both full scale and model scale he proposed three possible mechanisms causing the interaction between hull and waterjet including momentum flux forces caused by waterjet loss of planing area at the intake and lift loss in the wake in his thesis empirical and theoretical models were put forward to analyze the hydrodynamics of waterjet crafts which was based on the savitsky equations and mechanisms of overall interactions the negative thrust deduction fractions measured in his tests were up to 8 in the hump region for certain towing positions van terwisga 1996 made a lot of contributions on the research of waterjet propulsion he presented a consistent set of definitions for the overall hull waterjet system based on the collection and analysis of waterjet propulsion tests he found that for waterjet crafts there was a distinct variation of the thrust deduction fraction in a wide speed range moreover the variation of thrust deduction were also found to be relevant with the length breadth ratio of hull the shorter l b hulls may have the higher values of thrust deduction fraction he proposed and explained the difference between gross thrust and net thrust and stated that the resistance increment caused by the induced flow of waterjet can be measured by the difference between the gross thrust of waterjet and the resistance of bare hull through the analysis of waterjet propulsion test procedure he suggested that for power conversion the best estimate for the intake area is using a semi ellipsoid with a width of approximate 1 5 times the geometrical width he divided the effects of hull waterjet interaction into global effect caused by sinkage and trim variation between self propelled hull and bare hull and local effect caused by waterjet ingested flow based on the analysis of a single waterjet unit he pointed out that the hull trim is the most significant impact in the analysis of resistance increment of self propelled hull and the sharp peak in the curve of thrust deduction fraction is mainly caused by the water clearing of the transom their work is mainly carried out through model test as the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd tools was limited at that time it was hard to do more detailed analysis of the flow field of hull waterjet system the self propelled test method and analysis approach of waterjet propelled ship also received great attention at that time then the ittc organized a special committee on waterjet propulsion which had been working for a couple of years on the research of waterjet propulsion such as test procedure performance analysis hull waterjet interaction and so on ittc 21st 1996 ittc 22nd 1998 ittc 23rd 2002 ittc 24th 2005 ittc 25th 2008 through the efforts and cooperations of many research institutions at the 23rd ittc the scheme of waterjet test procedures was proposed and was further improved in the report of 24th and 25th ittc the procedures provided details on the overall definitions of waterjet system relevant parameters and the velocity distributions of the capture area of waterjet ingested flow in detail cfd method was believed as a feasible approach to get the geometry of the capture area of ingested flow the ittc has continued to pay attention to the research on the overall performance evaluation and full scale prediction method of waterjet system ittc 26th 2011 ittc 28th 2017 in recent years with the rapid development of cfd technology remarkable achievements have been made in numerical prediction of hydrodynamic performance of waterjet propulsion based on numerical simulation and model test bulten 2006 conducted a detailed analysis of a waterjet system in his doctoral thesis he found that there was a certain difference in the axial thrust of the waterjet unit calculated by the surface integration method and the momentum balance equation which is even larger in higher speeds through his research he supposed that the method based on the momentum balance to describe warterjet installations is not accurate which may be partly caused by the neglect of the influence of the hull in the vicinity of the waterjet inlet and partly caused by the neglect of the contributions of pressure distribution acting on the streamtube focusing on the overall process of the analysis and design of waterjet propulsion ding 2009a 2009b carried out the theoretical and numerical research on the performance of the waterjet system he programmed a user defined function to identify the waterjet ingested flow and non ingested flow to obtain the accurate shape of inlet streamtube he supposed that the inlet duct loss is the energy difference between the nozzle of jet flow and the capture area of inlet flow and thus the flow loss coefficient of the inlet duct can be calculated huang et al 2020 and luo et al 2020 investigate the mechanism of the energy loss and pressure fluctuations caused by the non uniform inflow for a waterjet pump they found that at the cruising speed of 45 knot the flows inside the duct are strongly affected by the impeller rotation and present a periodic prewhirl motion with the dominant frequency of the impeller rotating frequency the numerical research on the hydrodynamic of overall hull waterjet system is also increasing rapidly eslamdoost et al 2014 2015 2016 2018 carried out a detailed numerical research on the hydrodynamics of a monohull planing craft and discussed the mechanism of the hull waterjet interaction which mainly focused on the speed range of 0 2 frl 1 4 in their research a body force model is employed instead of modeling the actual geometry of the waterjet pump based on the potential flow theory he developed the pressure jump method to replace the waterjet pump this method is used to balance the hull resistance by the thrust generated by the increase of fluid head energy through the pump then in order to analyze the global effect and local effect of overall system he introduced an intermediate model which is a bare hull having the same sinkage and trim as the self propelled hull through the change of the stern wave and flow at various speeds he discovered the match between the stern wetting surface and the thrust reduction at low speeds moreover he also supposed that the negative thrust deduction fraction in the intermediate speed range 0 47 frl 1 0 is not due to reduced hull resistance the waterjet propelled hull resistance remains rather unaffected compared to the bare hull resistance he proposed that the major reason for negative thrust deduction is the jet system thrust deduction fraction which reflects the difference between the net thrust and the gross thrust gong et al 2017 2019 measured the inlet duct velocity distribution in a self propulsion test of a four waterjet ship model by using piv device based on experimental and numerical research they also analyzed the different effects on the propulsion performance of the outer and inner waterjets on a four waterjet prepelled ship their work is helpful to explore the flow field characteristics of multi waterjet propulsion system guo et al 2020 conducted numerical simulations on the hydrodynamic performance of a waterjet propelled trimaran in a speed range of 0 196 frl 0 707 their results reflected that for their displacement trimaran the resistance increment fraction and thrust deduction fraction were always positive to summarize the related researches on the hull waterjet interaction of waterjet propelled crafts mainly focus on the mechanism of thrust deduction as it is significantly different from the conventional propeller ships and play a more important role on the hull waterjet interaction on the other hand the previous researches mostly discussed the speed range of frl 1 5 which has not included the maximum speed of waterjet propelled ships in current engineering practice especially for high speed planing crafts in fact there are two tough difficulties for this one is that the momentum flux of the waterjet units is not easy to be measured accurately in the self propelled test at high speeds on the other hand it is also not easy to use cfd tools to simulate the hydrodynamics of the bare hull and self propelled hull at very high speeds however in practical application the design speed of the waterjet planing crafts is constantly increasing so it is of great practical significance to explore the mechanism of the hull waterjet interaction in a wider range of speed especially the prediction of thrust deduction fraction which can provide references for ship design and match of ship waterjet and engine furthermore a variety of new ship types have been applied to high speed and high performance ships among which planing trimaran has attracted more and more attention due to its small wave low resistance and good seakeeping at high speeds however there are still few researches on the hull waterjet interaction of waterjet propelled planing trimaran thus taking a two wterjet propelled planing trimaran as research objective this paper has done related works to explore the mechanism of hull waterjet interaction of planing trimaran mainly focusing on the speed range of 0 68 fr 6 16 0 32 frl 2 87 2 research theory objective 2 1 basic theory for a large number of displacement ships and semi planing crafts the speed conditions are always represented as the length froude number frl which is nondimensional and defined as eq 1 1 f r l v g l w l where v is the ship speed lwl is the length of hull waterline and g is the gravitational acceleration for regular displacement ship their navigation is mostly in the displacement state however for high speed ships such as planing crafts the hull navigation states are various with the increase of sailing speeds thus the speed conditions of planing crafts are usually represented as the volume froude number fr which is defined as eq 2 2 f r v g 1 3 where is the ship displacement volume at the static floating condition as the previous researches on the hull waterjet interaction is mainly focused on the displacement state and semi planing state fr 3 0 this paper will use both frl and fr to show the research results in order to better compare with the previous studies and reflect the navigation states of the planing trimaran under different speeds at the same time for the analysis procedures of waterjet system the ittc specialist committee on waterjets has proposed proven procedures for the determination of hydrodynamic performance of waterjet propelled vessels which had been modified for years and was basically finalized in 2005 ittc 24th 2005 although the direct thrust measurement method of waterjet is achievable this approach is pretty expensive and cumbersome for actual operation thus the experimental and theoretical analysis procedure concluded by ittc is based on momentum flux method the momentum flux method is used to measure the flow rate of the waterjet and then the waterjet thrust can be obtained indirectly according to the momentum theorem fig 1 shows the waterjet control volume which is defined in 21st ittc 1996 in detail surface 1 is a virtual cross section of the streamtube and this capture area is generally positioned far enough in front of the intake ramp tangency point before inlet losses occur ittc 21st 1996 surface 2 is the boundary of inlet streamtube which separates the internal ingested flow of control volume from the external flow field fig 2 shows a three dimensional sketch of the inlet streamtube surface 3 is the material boundary of waterjet system surface 4 is the surface between the stagnation lines and merge lines of hull and duct the part 5 represents the waterjet pump moreover surface 6 is the nozzle section and surface 7 is the vena contract of jet flow where pressure is atmospheric for measurements in model tests it is difficult to find the exact position of surface 7 the mass flow rate of waterjet pump is generally obtained indirectly by measuring the pressure distribution of surface 6 at nozzle section particularly if outgoing streamlines are all parallel leaving the nozzle discharge the pressure at the nozzle should also be atmospheric otherwise the pressure on surface 6 will not be atmospheric and the outlet drag will also occur at surface 6 based on the recommended procedures and guidelines for propulsive performance predictions ittc 2005 the volume control equation of the waterjet control unit can be represented as eq 3 where the einstein notation is used and i j k range over 1 2 and 3 3 a 1 a 6 ρ u i u k n k d a a 1 a 2 a 3 a 6 σ i j n j d a v 5 ρ f p i d v v 1 6 ρ f i d v where ρ is water density u is the velocity vector n is the normal vector on the surface σij is the tensor representing surface shear and pressure forces fpi is the force of waterjet pump and fi is the external body force acting on the control volume in the self propulsion tests the gross thrust is the definition of the term on the left side of eq 1 which is abbreviated as tg and defined as eq 4 4 t g a 1 a 6 ρ u x u k n k d a the net thrust is defined as the force vector acting upon the internal material boundary of waterjet which acts directly on the hull to balance the resistance instead of body force model the real geometry of waterjet has been used in this paper thus the net thrust in x direction is abbreviated as tnet and defined as eq 5 5 t n e t a 3 a 4 a 5 σ 1 j n j d a it is difficult to measure the net thrust of waterjet in experiments and thus the gross thrust of waterjet is used to define the thrust deduction in waterjet propulsion system which is quietly different from propulsion theory of conventional propeller ships thus in the performance analysis of waterjet system the total thrust deduction fraction t can be calculated by eq 6 6 t 1 r b h f d t g where rbh is the resistance of bare hull in model scale fd is the external tow force for the difference of the frictional resistance coefficient between the model and full scale and it is defined as follows 7 f d r b h ρ m ρ s r b h s λ 3 where rbh and rbh s is the total resistance of model ship and full scale ship separately λ is the scale ratio ρm and ρs respectively denote the density of water in model tests and sea conditions although it is hard to measure the net thrust of waterjet in the model test it is feasible to obtain the tnet in the numerical simulations in the theory of waterjet propulsion the resistance increment fraction tr is used to express the relationship between the net thrust of waterjet the resistance of bare hull and external tow force as shown in eq 8 8 t r 1 r b h f d t n e t the difference between the total thrust tg and the net thrust tnet can be expressed in the jet system thrust deduction fraction tj which is defined as eq 9 eslamdoost 2014 9 t j 1 t n e t t g thus the relationship among thrust deduction fraction the resistance increment fraction and the jet system thrust deduction fraction is as eq 10 10 1 t 1 t r 1 t j the thrust deduction fraction reflects the effect of waterjet actions on the hull resistance conversely the waterjet ingested flow will also be influenced by the hull which can be divided into interaction on momentum flux and energy flux separately based on the ittc regulations ittc 24th 2005 the momentum interaction efficiency η m i and the energy interaction efficiency η e i is defined as eq 11 the following terms with subscript 0 are corresponding parameters in the free stream condition 11 1 η m i p t e p t e 0 t g r o s s t g r o s s 0 1 1 c m 1 n v r 1 where cm1 is the momentum velocity coefficient at surface 1 nvr is the nozzle velocity ratio and their definitions are given as follows 12 c m 1 1 1 c p 2 q j v 0 a 1 u x 2 d a 13 n v r u 6 v 0 where cp is the static pressure coefficient qj is the flow rate of waterjet v0 is the ship velocity and u 6 is the average flow velocity at surface 6 the energy interaction efficiency is defined as follows 14 η e i p j s e 0 p j s e e 6 e 0 e 6 e 1 where en is the total axial energy flux through a cross sectional area an the effect of hull waterjet interaction on overall efficiency is defined as interaction efficiency η i n t calculated by eq 15 15 η i n t 1 t η e i η m i moreover the overall efficiency of the waterjet hull system is defined as shown in eq 16 16 η d η 0 η i n t η i η d u c t η p u m p 1 t η e i η m i where η 0 represents the free stream efficiency of waterjet η i is the ideal jet efficiency η d u c t is the ducting efficiency and η p u m p is the pump efficiency 2 2 hull and waterjet geometry a high speed planing trimaran with two sets of waterjets is chosen for this research as shown in fig 3 the hull and waterjet geometries are all at the model scale two waterjet systems are the conventional ones with flush intakes the numbers of rotor blades is 3 while the number of stator blades is 7 the scale ratio of this model ship is 2 8 and the main parameters of the ship and waterjet models are presented in table 1 3 computation methodology 3 1 computations of bare hull the simulations are conducted with the code star ccm 14 04 based on the finite volume method fvm the rans equations and the continuity equation in integral form the s s t k ω turbulence model with wall functions is applied the second order upwind scheme is used to discrete the governing equations to reduce the transaction errors the volume of fluid vof method and the high resolution interface capturing hric format is used to trace the free surface considering the symmetry of the hull only half domain of the flow field on the side of the symmetric plane is adopted all y wall treatments were selected where intelligently the viscous sublayer was directly resolved if y 1 and wall functions are used to obtain the boundary conditions for the continuum equations if y 30 siemens 2019 otherwise a blending function is then used if 1 y 30 the convective and temporal discretization schemes were second order upwind schemes the implicit unsteady solver based on the separated flow model was used the motion of hull is simulated based on the method of overset mesh in detail the overset domain which activate the motion function of sinkage and trim including the hulls and the surrounding rectangular domain while the background region was stationary the length of overset domain is 1 3 time of the hull length while the width is 0 85 time of the hull beam fig 4 shows the whole field domain and its boundary conditions of the computations of bare hull with sailing speed growing the thickness of hull boundary layer at the same position is getting thinner and the velocity gradient in hull boundary layer changes larger thus at high speeds the velocity gradient in the hull boundary layer is rather large and the turbulence flow is strong in the planing state the turbulent flow in the hull boundary layer needs to be simulated by more detailed grids but the number of grids can be reduced appropriately at low and medium speed based on the rans method and the overset mesh technique ding and jiang et al 2019 has done a series of numerical studies on the resistance characteristics of a high speed planing craft they analyzes the mesh factors such as mesh type mesh arrangement inside the hull boundary layer mesh size of the hull surface mesh refinement in the background domain the range of speed conditions studied in this paper is pretty wide on the premise of ensuring the simulation accuracy different boundary layer mesh arrangements should be adopted under different sailing states to improve the computational efficiency therefore the hull boundary layer growth rate is set to 1 25 and fourteen layers of prism layer meshes are used for the simulation of turbulent flow in boundary layer for speed conditions of fr 3 0 while the speed of 1 0 fr 3 0 has ten layers of prism layer meshes and the speed of fr 1 0 has 8 layers separately on the other hand as the simulation of turbulent flow in the boundary layer have a great influence on the convergence and accuracy of the numerical results each scheme ensures high refinement and the same boundary layer grid settings in the mesh dependence study to ensure that other physical quantities are compared in a reasonable solution as for the mesh refinement of free surface the area within the range of the stern kelvin wedge has been refined by three sectors fig 5 shows the mesh distribution for the detailed mesh distribution the overset domain around the hull uses the polyhedral mesh while the trimmed mesh is used in the background domain compared with the trimmed mesh each grid of polyhedral mesh has more adjacent elements which can calculate the velocity and pressure gradient more accurately and capture the local flow better adopting polyhedral mesh in the overset domain can simulate the air water distribution at hull bottom and the hydrodynamics of planing craft better especially at high planing states on the other hand as the trimmed mesh is easier to control the total number of meshes and the flow change in the far field domain is not so strong moreover the trimmed mesh is used in the background domain the mesh dependence study of bare hull was carried out at fr 6 01 which is the design speed of the planing trimaran particularly the weight of water filled in pump and duct of self propelled hull should be taken into account ittc 26th 2011 in this way the displacement weight of the bare hull and the self propelled hull are identical by varying the basic size of the mesh parameters seven sets of mesh schemes were generated the data of seven mesh schemes is shown in table 2 the mesh size variation is the only different parameter among the seven mesh schemes the transient calculation is carried out by gradually reducing the time step until the calculation results meet the time step dependence in detail each adjustment of time step takes a half of the previous time step when the values of hydrodynamic parameters are stable in the current time step the adjustment of time step should be stopped until the values of hydrodynamic parameters remain basically unchanged meeting the dependence of time step in numerical simulations eça and hoekstra 2014 proposed a procedure for the estimation of the numerical uncertainty of grid refinement studies based on the least squares root method referring to this procedure the mesh dependence study for the numerical uncertainty of bare hull was performed the non uniform refinement ratio is defined as follows 17 h i h 1 n 1 3 n i 3 where hi and ni are the typical mesh size and the total mesh number of mesh scheme i in addition h1 and n1 correspond to the finest mesh scheme the convergence fit curve of bare hull resistance is shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 mesh no 4 can obtain good numerical accuracy and may also cost reasonable cpu hours black solid dots in the figure which was selected for the simulations of bare hull the total mesh numbers of this scheme is 2 84 million where the overset domain including the hull has 2 48 million cells the numerical uncertainty for this mesh is 1 19 in the meanwhile the towing model test of bare hull resistance are also done in the speed range of 1 37 fr 6 01 the model towing tests for calm water resistance were conducted in towing tank of hydrodynamic research centre jingmen hubei china whose tank dimensions is 392 m 6 m 4 m and maximum carriage speed is 24 m s the schematic diagram of the towing test is presented in fig 7 the numerical simulations of bare hull hydrodynamics are carried out in a speed range of 0 68 fr 6 16 which has free sinkage and trim the results of numerical simulation and model test of bare hull are shown in fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 it can be seen that the deviation between numerical and experimental results of bare hull resistance becomes relatively larger with the increase of the ship speed which reaches 12 6 at fr 6 16 with the speed growth the spray resistance continuously becomes larger and its proportion to total resistance is also growing as shown in fig 11 there is obvious water spray around hull at fr 6 01 however the vof method can not accurately capture the fluid spray well in the numerical simulation which makes relatively large differences between the numerical and experimental resistances savitsky et al 2007 found that spray resistance can constitute over 15 of the total resistance at planing speeds based on the empirical formula of spray resistance the relative relationship between cfd results and real values of thrust reduction will be discussed in the section 4 4 1 3 2 computations of self propelled hull as for the numerical simulation of self propelled hull the related simulation setting mesh size and distribution and so on are basically the same as the bare hull simulations particularly the self propelled hull is equipped with two waterjet units and the real geometry of waterjet pump is used to simulate the self propelled motion of the planing trimaran in detail the rotation of waterjet rotor are simulated by the model of multi reference frame mrf to reduce the computation costs based on mrf model the simulation of waterjet flow is to use steady calculation in rotor domain and it also avoids the small time step required by the real rotation method at the same time so as to reduce the computation costs and improve the computing efficiency on the other hand there is only a small difference between the waterjet thrust obtained by mrf model and real rotation method separately as the thrust simulated by mrf model corresponds to the thrust of impeller waterjet rotor at a certain angle phase the influence of this small difference on the simulation results of propulsion performance is limited moreover the mrf model has been widely used in numerical simulation of self propelled motion of waterjet crafts whose reliability has been verified guo et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 in order to ensure the simulation accuracy of the complex flow field of the self propelled motion the mesh refinement is done for the zones such as waterjet ducting flow and wave at stern mesh refinement of waterjet ingested flow and jet flow is shown in fig 12 and the mesh of waterjet pump is shown in fig 13 same as simulations of bare hull the overset domain around the hull uses the polyhedral mesh and background domain uses the trimmed mesh moreover the domains of rotor and stator of waterjet pump are meshed by software turbogrid 16 0 to ensure the mesh quality of tip clearance between rotor blade and rotor shroud where structured grid is adopted as shown in fig 13 the balance point of self propelled motion is obtained by modifying the rotational speeds of waterjet rotor until the resistance of self propelled is equal to the sum of the net thrust of waterjet and the tow force fd the mesh dependence study of self propelled was also carried out at fr 6 01 by varying the basic size of the mesh parameters seven sets of mesh schemes were generated the data of seven mesh schemes of self propelled hull is shown in table 3 the transient calculation is also carried out by gradually reducing the time step until the calculation results meet the time step dependence furthermore the rotor thrust coefficient kt rotor and mass flow coefficient q are defined as eq 18 18 k t r o t o r t r o t o r ρ n 2 d p u m p 4 q q p u m p ρ n d p u m p 3 where trotor is the thrust of rotor blade and rotor hub in the x direction qpump is the mass flow rate of the waterjet pump the mesh dependence study for the self propelled hull was also done by the least squares root method the convergence fit curves of self propelled hull resistance rotor thrust coefficient kt rotor and mass flow coefficient q are shown in fig 14 mesh no 4 is selected for the simulations of self propelled hull as it can obtain good numerical accuracy and may also cost reasonable cpu hours black solid dots in the figure the total mesh numbers of no 4 scheme is 7 88 million where the waterjet rotor has 1 15 million cells the waterjet stator has 1 53 million cells and the overset domain including the hull has 4 81 million cells the numerical uncertainty of self propelled resistance for this mesh is 2 54 while the numerical uncertainty of kt and q is 0 43 and 0 23 separately the numerical simulations of self propelled hull are carried out in a speed range of 0 68 fr 6 16 the numerical results of self propelled hull are shown in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 compared with bare hull as for planing crafts besides static buoyancy the dynamic lift also provides part of the hull lift at semi planing and planing states the waterjet suction at intake leads to a larger trim angle of self propelled hull this larger trim angle mainly leads to the increment on dynamic lift acted on the stern accounting for the decreased sinkage of self propelled hull in comparison with bare hull moreover at low speeds the waterjet suction of this planing trimaran still leads to a deeper sinkage of self propelled hull 3 3 streamtube and capture area of ingested flow as shown in eq 6 the gross thrust of waterjet in self propelled motion is needed in the analysis of thrust deduction which is calculated by the momentum flux method thus the approach to obtain the capture area of waterjet ingested flow is particularly important guo et al 2020 developed a mathematical tool to obtain the capture area by tracking the streamlines upstream which is based on the data processing of the numerical results this method is unable to get the accurate geometry of streamtube as for bulten 2006 ding 2009a and eslamdoost 2014 they obtain the geometry of inlet capture area and streamtube by solving a scalar and convection equation in the solved reversed velocity field of waterjet system inspired by their research this paper also carried out the research on obtaining the accurate geometry of capture area and streamtube of ingested flow under various speeds as for the planing trimaran in this paper its streamtubes and capture areas of ingested flow under various speeds are shown in fig 18 and fig 19 as shown in fig 19 it can be found that the maximum axial velocity at capture area can be slightly larger than the ship speed especially at speed conditions of fr 1 03 and fr 1 37 4 analysis of thrust deduction 4 1 analysis approach in the theory of waterjet propulsion the thrust deduction is divided into the resistance increment and the jet system thrust deduction where resistance increment are caused by the local effect and the global effect the local effect refers to the flow field change caused by the waterjet ingested flows and jet flows which leads to the change of hull resistance on the other hand the global effect refers to the different sinkage and trim between the bare hull and the self propelled hull which also cause the variation of hull resistance moreover the jet system thrust deduction reflects the difference between gross thrust and net thrust the general analysis idea of eslamdoost 2014 is significant reference when carrying out the specific discussions in this paper except the conventional bare hull and self propelled hull eslamdoost introduced a bare hull which has the same sinkage and trim with the self propelled hull at the same speed as the installation of waterjet units the first difference between bare hull and self propelled hull is the hull geometry after that the effect of waterjet action will also change the flow field around the hull leading to the force imbalance acted on the hull if the ship maintains the navigation attitude as the bare hull then the force imbalance will cause the change of hull sinkage and trim making the navigation attitude of the self propelled hull reach a new balance according to the force balance change between bare hull and waterjet propelled hull three hull states are introduced in this paper including one bare hull and two self propelled hulls as shown in fig 20 the specific definition of each hull state is as follows 1 bh the bare hull with free sinkage and trim 2 shb the self propelled hull with actual waterjet which is fixed and has the same sinkage and trim with the bare hull bh and its pump rotational speed of waterjet is consistent with that of sh at the same speed 3 sh the self propelled hull with waterjet pump and inlet duct which has free sinkage and trim sailing at the self propelled balance point as for the discussion of the hull waterjet interaction the following works has been done 1 resistance increment it can be divided into the local effect comparative study of bh shb and global effect comparative study of shb sh combined with total effect of comparison between bh and sh their separate influence on the resistance increment can be analyzed in a wide speed range in this paper the local resistance increment fraction and global resistance increment fraction will be introduced for detail discussions 2 jet system thrust deduction based on the analysis of self propelled hull sh the jet system thrust deduction fraction can be calculated through the gross thrust and the net thrust in the meanwhile compared with shb and sh the effect of hull attitude change on gross thrust and net thrust can also be analyzed 3 thrust deduction the thrust deduction fraction can be directly calculated by comparing bare hull bh and self propelled hull sh otherwise the thrust deduction fraction can also be obtained through the resistance increment fraction and jet system thrust deduction fraction indirectly the resistance increment tr the jet system thrust deduction fraction tj and the thrust deduction fraction t is plotted in fig 21 fig 22 and fig 23 separately compared with the collected research values done by van tervisga 1996 eslamdoost 2014 and guo et al 2020 for various ship types particularly all the research data completed by others researchers correspond to the abscissa of frl while the computed values of this paper can be compared with frl and fr at the same time as for the resistance increment tr and the jet system thrust deduction fraction tj although the specific values corresponding to different ship types are different the basic characteristics and laws have certain similarity as for the thrust deduction fraction because it is a combination of tr and tj and different ship types and different waterjets have their own hydrodynamic characteristics the trend of thrust deduction fraction is relatively varying from ship to ship at low speed the value of resistance increment fraction is relatively large and the jet system thrust deduction fraction is mainly positive the combined effect of the above two factors leads to a larger thrust deduction fraction of the planing trimaran at low speeds compared with others researches 4 2 resistance increment as shown in fig 3 the planing craft is divided into 4 parts including main hull mh side piece channel spc transom ts and deck dc where the word hull includes all the above 4 parts for the monohull planing craft the hull resistance increases monotonously with the increase of speed at high speed planing state however for the planing trimaran there will be a straight section of hull resistance in the high speed planing state as shown in fig 7 which is mainly caused by the quickly change of water air distribution in the zone of side piece channel the resistance change of the main hull of planing trimaran is still basically consistent with that of the planing monohull while the resistance change of the side piece channel decreases rapidly with the reduction of its wet area at high speeds thus causing the total resistance of planing trimaran to remain basically unchanged within a certain speed range at high speed planing states therefore in the research of hydrodynamic of planing trimaran it is pretty necessary to separate the part of side piece channel from the hull the total resistance is also divided into the 4 corresponding parts in the following discussions particularly as shown in fig 24 the main hull of bare hull has the intake surface iks while the self propelled hull has not the above hull parts would be all named by the abbreviations if mentioned in the following discussions referring to eq 8 for the definition of resistance increment fraction tr the local resistance increment fraction trl and the global resistance increment fraction trg can be defined as follows 19 t r l 1 r b h f d r s h b h f d 20 t r g 1 r s h b h f d t n e t thus through the local resistance increment fraction trl and the global resistance increment fraction trg the resistance increment fraction tr can also be calculated as eq 21 21 t r 1 1 t r l 1 t r g t r l t r g t r l t r g according to the resistances of the hull bh shb and sh as shown in fig 25 the local resistance increment fraction trl and the global resistance increment fraction trg can be calculated the results is shown in fig 26 4 2 1 local resistance increment fraction trl in order to analyze the reasons causing the change of the local resistance increment fraction trl the separate resistances of different parts of the hull bh and shb are presented in fig 27 it can be found that the difference between resistance of bh and shb local effect is mainly due to the variation of main hull mh and side piece channel spc in the main speed range while in relatively low speed the transom clearance may also account for the large positive trl as the trend of trl curve changes with various speeds the following discussion will be carried out for three speed ranges 4 2 1 1 0 68 fr 1 37 in this range of speed displacement state mainly there is a sharp decrease in the trl curve while the value is mainly positive the geometry lack of the intake surface plays a minor role at low speeds for local effect in resistance increment in general the difference of transom resistance between bh and shb is the main reason for the rapid change of trl at low speeds firstly as for the installation of waterjets a disc area is excavated from the transom making the transom area of shb smaller than bh at low speeds the transom is partially submerged in water the pressure of water acted on transom points to the bow and there is less frictional resistance acted on transom resulting in a negative resistance of transom positive resistance pointing to the stern thus the installation of waterjet pump will lead to the loss of the transom area of shb resulting in the increase the hull resistance obviously as the total resistance is relatively small at low speeds then resulting in a large positive trl at first with the increase of speed the total resistance increased rapidly and the proportion of resistance increment caused by transom geometric loss decreased significantly which leads to the sharp decrease of trl as shown in fig 28 it can be found that there is a big difference of stern wave patterns of bh and shb at fr 1 03 which reflects that the waterjet action will change the stern wave and the critical speed of transom clearlance as for bh and shb the differences between these two hulls are the geometry loss of a disc area at transom and the effects of waterjet action at low speeds when the transom is wet there is a dead water zone behind the transom of bh for waterjet propelled hull the high speed jet flow will disperse the dead water zone behind stern and thus reduce the height of stern wave secondly as the installation of waterjets the complete hull boundary layer is cut off by the duct intake the stern hull behind the intake is a separate hull boundary layer as shown in fig 29 the hull boundary layer of waterjet propelled hull developing behind the intake is thinner compared with the same area of bare hull and the velocity changes more sharply in the boundary layer of stern hull the flow for waterjet propelled hull leaves the hull stern with higher axial velocity compared with bare hull the stern flow of waterjet propelled hull has a higher momentum making the stern wake break harder and wake cavity form earlier making the critical speed of shb transom clearance is earlier than bh the similar phenomenon and conclusion have also been presented by eslamdoost et al 2015 4 2 1 2 1 37 fr 2 74 in this range of speed semi planing state mainly the local resistance increment fraction trl is mainly negative and becomes largest at fr 1 78 the transoms of bare hull bh and self propelled hull shb are both dry and have little resistance in this speed range according to fig 27 the variation of local resistance increment fraction trl in this speed range is mainly influenced by the resistance of mh as the main hull resistance of shb is always smaller than bh causing the trl is negative in this speed range one reason for the resistance reduction of mh of shb is the geometry loss of intake surface at hull bottom of shb which mainly reduces the frictional resistance of mh to a small extent at semi planing states as shown in fig 30 and fig 31 the another reason is that the waterjet suction at the opening intake will lead to a high pressure area just behind the opening intake which is due to the stagnation area caused by the impact of the outflow on the stern behind the opening intake the reduction of pressure difference between the hull bow and stern leads to the decrease of mh pressure resistance of shb in comparison to bh as shown in fig 32 4 2 1 3 2 74 fr 6 16 in this speed range planing state mainly the local resistance increment fraction trl is negative the general trend of trl changes slightly at first and then has a sharp decrease since fr 5 79 as shown in figs 27 and 32 the difference of mh pressure resistance between shb and bh also mainly accounting for the negative value of trl in this speed range and the mechanism of smaller mh pressure resistance of shb is similar with the ones discussed in the section 4 2 1 2 in the meanwhile frictional resistance plays a major role in the total resistance at planing state the geometry loss of intake may lead to the reduction on mh frictional resistance of shb and the value mainly becomes larger with speed growth in the speed range of fr 3 moreover as for planing crafts the peak position of the bow wave continuously moves to the middle and evev stern of the ship with the increase of speed in the meanwhile as for the planing trimaran the peak of the bow wave will slam with the top of the channel and side piece therefore with the growth of speed the wet area of channel top decreases and moves backward resulting in the decrease on resistance of spc as shown in fig 32 when fr 5 79 the wet area of the channel top of bh is approximately parallel to the position of opening intake on self propelled hull specially as shown in fig 33 it can be found that with the same speed and hull attitudes there is an obvious difference of the wave in channel between bh and shb resulting in the big variation of wet area of spc between the two hulls as ittc suggested the acceleration effect of waterjet suction on the flow becomes negligible one intake diameter ahead of the inlet tangency point where the acceleration mainly reflects the flow velocity in the x direction at stern this acceleration effect may even be less obvious at very high planning speed fig 34 shows the velocity distribution of cross section at various position of bh and shb separately it can be found that at fr 5 79 the waterjet suction has small acceleration effect on the flow velocity in x direction at capture area of waterjet inlet however due to the water snatching effect of waterjet suction there is a significant decrease in the transverse velocity y direction of the flow at hull bottom as shown in the right section of fig 34 the closer it is to the opening intake the more obvious the deceleration effect on the transverse velocity y direction is this is one of the possible reasons for the sudden change of wave making including the wave height and peak position in the channel of shb compared with bh as the shb and bh has the same sinkage and trim the sudden change of wave making caused by the waterjet suction may mainly account for the sudden change of trl at very high speeds as for this phenomenon more detailed model tests will be conducted in the next in general the geometry loss of disc area on shb transom and waterjet jet flow play the main role on the large positive value of trl at low speeds as for the semi planing and planing state the local waterjet effect will make the hull resistance become smaller 4 2 2 global resistance increment fraction trl similar with the above analysis approach the separate resistances of different parts of sh and shb are presented in fig 35 the difference of resistance between sh and shb global effect is also mainly due to the variation of main hull mh and side piece channel spc in the whole speed range the fig 35 shows that the resistances of transom and deck of sh are almost same with those of shb and all of these resistance components play a minor role in the total resistance of both sh and shb thus the following discussions on global resistance increment fraction trg will focus on the mh and spc resistance while the transom and deck will not be discussed in detail in this section in the whole speed range the mh and spc resistance of sh are basically larger than shb except the lowest speed which is quite different in the comparison between bh and shb local effect the following discussions are also carried out for three speed ranges 4 2 2 1 0 68 fr 1 37 in this speed range there is a significant change in global resistance increment fraction trg which should be analyzed specifically for each working condition as for the speed of fr 0 68 the total resistance of sh is smaller than shb which is mainly due to variation of pressure resistance between sh and shb caused by the change of hull sinkage which have the main influence on the hydrostatic pressure resistance as shown in fig 36 and fig 37 secondly as for the speed of fr 1 03 the lift of the hull is mainly provided by static buoyancy due to the obvious effect of waterjet suction the hull of sh is more submerged compared with shb the hull attitudes of bh thus the larger stern trim angle and deeper sinkage cause an obvious increment on the mh and spc pressure resistance of sh especially the mh hydrostatic pressure resistance which leads to the sharp increase of trg and the value of trg becomes positive the fig 38 shows the pressure distribution of sh and shb at fr 1 03 therefore the global effect mainly change the hydrostatic pressure resistance at low speeds as for this planing trimaran the larger increment on mh hydrostatic pressure resistance of sh is the main reason for the large value of trg at displacement states 4 2 2 2 1 37 fr 2 74 in this speed range semi planing states the global resistance increment fraction trg is mainly positive and has a slight decrease which is mainly caused by the smaller difference between the mh resistance of sh and shb as for the speed of fr 1 37 besides static buoyancy the dynamic lift also provides part of the hull lift at this speed semi planing state sailing at fr 1 37 the larger trim angle of sh leads to the increment on dynamic lift acted on the stern accounting the slight sinkage of sh compared with the speed condition of fr 1 03 then in comparison with shb the larger trim angle of sh mainly increases the mh hydrostatic pressure resistance of sh however as the difference between mh hydrostatic pressure resistance of sh and shb is smaller and the total resistance of both rises rapidly the value of trg keeps positive but experiences a sharp decreases at this speed the fig 39 shows that the wet area of shb is slight larger than that of sh at fr 2 05 in detail the shallower sinkage and larger trim angle of sh leads to the smaller wet surface which makes the mh and spc frictional resistance of sh is smaller than shb as shown in fig 35 in the meanwhile the larger stern trim angle has caused an obvious increment on mh and spc pressure resistance of sh in total the fig 37 shows that in this speed range semi planing state the differences of hydrodynamic pressure resistance between sh and shb gradually becomes larger in converse with the change of differences of hydrostatic pressure resistance between them this is mainly due to the fact that with the increase of speed the dynamic lift play a more and more important role than static buoyancy on lifting the hull thus the dynamic lift is more sensitive to the change of trim angle while the variation of static buoyancy with change of hull attitude becomes relatively small as for this planing trimaran at the semi planing states the suction effect of waterjet inlet leads to a larger trim angle of self propelled hull sh then the larger trim angle increases the hydrodynamic pressure resistance of hull accounting for the positive trg in this speed range 4 2 2 3 2 74 fr 6 16 at high speeds planing state mainly the trg is always positive and there is an sharp increase at fr 5 79 as shown in figs 36 and 37 the global resistance increment fraction is mainly influenced by the variation of mh and spc hydrodynamic resistance between sh and shb at this speed range in the meanwhile the ratio of hydrostatic pressure resistance to total resistance decreases rapidly with the increase of velocity as for the hull of shb the effect of waterjet action changes the flow around the hull leading to the force imbalance acted on the hull as shb maintains the navigation attitude of bare hull at first as mentioned above the waterjet suction will lead to a larger trim angle of self propelled hull and a slighter sinkage due to the increase of dynamic lift on the stern however as for the very high speed range of planing states fr 5 79 as discussed in section 4 2 1 3 the waterjet suction decreases the wave height and change peak position of the bow wave in the channel of self propelled hull causing the smaller wet area of shb the smaller wet area of shb will result in the loss of hull lift so for the self propelled hull sh at very high speed range fr 5 79 compared with the hull attitudes of bh shb apart from the larger trim angle of sh the sinkage of sh is the same as that of bh or submerged a little deeper to obtain more lift to maintain the vertical force balance of the hull moreover the larger trim angle combined with the same or deeper sinkage accounts for the larger spc resistance of sh in comparison with shb at very high speed range fr 5 79 which mainly accounts for the sudden changes of trg at fr 5 79 in general the global resistance increment fraction trg is mainly influenced by the variation of mh and spc pressure resistance between sh and shb where the change of hydrostatic pressure resistance dominates at displacement basically while at semi planing and planing states the hydrodynamic pressure resistance dominates in particular as for various hull attitudes the wave making in the side channel is quietly different between shb and sh 4 2 3 total effect of resistance increment for this planing trimaran the local effect and global effect both have significant influences on the change of resistance increment fraction tr at whole speed range in detail at low speed the resistance increment fraction tr is relatively large and positive the geometry loss of the transom area and waterjet action lead to the smaller wet area of transom of self propelled hull causing the increment on hydrostatic pressure moreover the variation of hull attitude between sh and bh also leads to the resistance increment at low speeds on the other hand it can be found that the absolute value of local resistance increment fraction and global resistance increment fraction is similar but the values are opposite at semi planing and planing states compared to planing monohulls the characteristics of flow and wave making in channel both of bare hull and self propelled hull should be raised more attention for the relevant researches of planing trimaran 4 3 jet system thrust deduction the jet system thrust deduction tj reflect the difference between the net thrust and gross thrust in the measurement based on momentum flux method the pressure distribution on the capture area a1 the streamtube interface a2 and the nozzle outlet area a6 and force acted on the duct lip a4 as shown in fig 40 is all ignored which also contributes force to the waterjet thrust combined eq 4 and eq 5 the difference between gross thrust and net thrust can be obtained by eq 22 22 t g t n e t a 1 a 2 a 6 σ x d a a 4 σ x d a moreover the force on a1 a2 a4 is related with the waterjet ingested flow which can be defined as the inlet drag din while the force on a6 is caused by the waterjet jet flow which can be defined as the outlet drag dout the separate definition of inlet drag din and outlet drag dout is shown in eq 23 and eq 24 eslamdoost et al 2016 23 d i n a 1 a 2 σ x d a a 4 σ x d a 24 d o u t a 6 σ x d a the inlet drag din and outlet drag dout are closely related to ship type sailing speed waterjet working condition and the intake geometry 4 3 1 effect of hull attitude variation on tj the pump rotational speeds of sh and shb are the same and the only difference between sh and shb is their hull attitudes the results of various jet system thrust deduction tj computed on sh and shb are shown in fig 41 moreover in order to track the variation source of jet system thrust deduction the forces of a1 a2 a4 and a5 is presented in fig 42 including both sh and shb according to fig 41 it can be found that the change of hull attitude at a certain range only has small influence on the tj however the hull attitude change still has certain effects on the force of a1 and a2 while a4 and a5 is less influenced as shown in fig 42 in general although the various hull attitude only cause a small difference on tj the various hull attitudes will change the force acted on a1 and a2 to a certain extent where hydrostatic pressure play the main role at low speeds while hydrodynamic pressure is dominant at semi planing and planing state fig 43 show the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic drag on a1 of sh and shb separately 4 3 2 inlet drag din and outlet drag dout based on the computations of self propelled hydrodynamics the inlet drag din and outlet drag dout of sh is shown in fig 44 at low speed the obvious increment of the inlet drag din is mainly caused by the large trim angle which leads to the growth on hydrostatic pressure drag mainly as for the planing state the hydrodynamic pressure drag is dominant and the change trend of a1 area decrease slowly which together lead to the continuous decrease of din and keeps negative the trend of a1 area with speed growth is shown in fig 45 on the other hand the outlet drag dout caused by the non atmospheric pressure acted on nozzle outlet at the whole speed range the outlet drag dout is always negative and decreases linearly with speed the jet system thrust deduction fraction reflects the difference between the gross thrust and net thrust as shown in fig 44 the value of tj din dout tg first experiences a period of increase at low speed which is caused by the increment of inlet drag din mainly then the tj reach the peak at fr 1 03 which is just the transom clearance speed of the self propelled hull then the value of tj changes from positive to negative and then its absolute value increases with the growth of sailing speed 4 4 thrust deduction 4 4 1 discussion on spray drag high speed planing crafts have obvious water spray at semi planing and planing states which causes the spray drag moreover the spray will leads to the water flow separation vortex and other phenomena making the two phase fluid water and air at the free surface in a violent mixing state the vof method is hard to capture such strongly nonlinear flow of water spray well in the numerical simulation savitsky et al 2007 put forward a method to calculate quantitatively the whisker spray resistance of high speed planing craft which can be expressed as a function related to the trim angle the stern deadrise angle and the speed which has been widely used the function for calculating the spray drag fs as shown in eq 25 and eq 26 25 f s 1 2 ρ v 2 b 2 4 sin 2 α cos β c f s 26 tan α π tan τ 2 tan β where b is the beam of planing hull measured between the chines τ is the trim angle β is the deadrise of stern α is the angle between keel and stagnation line of spray in horizontal plane cf s represents the viscous friction coefficient of spray drag according to eq 25 and eq 26 the difference of spray drag between bh and sh is related to the trim angle mainly assuming that the cf s of them are approximately equal at the same speed thus the ratio of various spray drag between sh and bh can be calculated according to their separate trim angle based on the numerical results and the above discussion the fraction tr tj and t considering the spray drag can be analyzed as follows 27 r b h r b h a b h f s b h 1 t r t n e t f d a b h f s b h 28 t n e t t n e t a s h f s s h where r b h is the bare hull resistance in model test t n e t is the net thrust of waterjet in self propelled motion considering spray drags r b h tr and tnet are the initial results of numerical simulation and analysis fs bh and fs sh are the spray drag of bh and sh a b h and a s h are the proportions of the spray resistance that were not captured in numerical simulations respectively fd is calculated based on the results of bare hull model test then the fraction tr tj and t can be calculated by eq 29 to eq 31 29 t r 1 r b h f d t n e t 1 1 t r t n e t f d a b h f s b h f d t n e t a s h f s s h 1 1 t r t n e t a b h f s b h t n e t a s h d f s b h 30 t j 1 t n e t t g 1 t n e t a s h f s s h t g 31 t 1 1 t r 1 t j where d equals fs sh fs bh t g is the gross thrust after considering the spray drag the fig 46 shows the distribution of wall shear stress on bare hull at fr 6 01 according to the observation of stagnation lines marked in fig 46 it can be found that only a small part of spray flow is captured by using vof method this is because it is difficult to capture the atomized spray and whisker spray when vof method is used to track the free surface for most of the current engineering design and research of waterjet propelled ships numerical simulation and prediction is usually carried out only on the basis of model test of bare hull rather than further conducting the self propelled tests in this paper the purpose of this section is to evaluate the influences of spray drag on thrust deduction fraction prospectively based on the model test of bare hull and numerical simulations of bare hull and self propelled hull not expecting to predict the spray resistance accurately in practical analysis of this section it is assumed that the spray flow is less captured in the numerical simulations therefore the a b h and a s h both equals 1 and the fraction tr tj should be calculated as following 32 t r 1 1 t r t n e t f s b h t n e t d f s b h 33 t j 1 t n e t t g 1 t n e t d f s b h t g in detail the deviation between the numerical and experimental results of bh resistance is assumed as the spray drag fs bh at the corresponding speed the ratio d of various spray drag between sh and bh can be calculated according to their separate trim angle specially t g should be obtained in the added numerical simulations where the rotating speed of waterjet pump increases to make the increment of net thrust is equal to the spray resistance fs sh d fs bh at corresponding speed the results of tr tj and t is shown in fig 47 it can be found that the spray drag of sh is slightly smaller than bh at planing state while there is only a little difference between the spray drag of sh and bh at semi planing state after considering the spray drag the change of resistance increment is downward at high speeds while the jet system thrust deduction fraction remains basically the same as a result there is only a slightly larger negative thrust deduction at planing state therefore the thrust deduction fraction and resistance increment fraction obtained from numerical simulation and analysis can be effectively applied to the design and performance prediction of high speed crafts propelled by waterjet 4 4 2 the relative role of tr and tj on thrust deduction as for the thrust deduction fraction of this planing trimaran the resistance increment fraction tr and the jet system thrust deduction fraction tj are both important at low speed as the value of tj is relatively small the t is positive and it is mainly affected by tr then at the semi planing state the tr keeps decreasing and will falls to the bottom as negative value in the meanwhile the jet system thrust deduction fraction is also decreasing and falls to be negative as a result the thrust deduction fraction experience a sharp reduction in this speed range as for the planing state the tr gradually increases and grows to be positive while tj is always negative and keeps decreasing almost linearly at high speeds the thrust deduction fraction stills keeps negative but the growth trend slowed down obviously moreover as for this planing trimaran the large negative thrust deduction fraction at semi planing and planing state is mainly caused by the negative tj as the change of mh and spc resistance with speed growth is quiet various between sh and bh the negative tr mainly occurs at planing state which is different with the monohull ships 5 analysis of interaction efficiency as for the interaction on momentum and energy the effect of hull distorted flow will also influence the performance of waterjet which is defined as the momentum interaction efficiency η m i and the energy interaction efficiency η e i separately the thrust deduction fraction discussed above reflects the effect of waterjet actions on the hydrodynamic performance of hull the above two effects are synchronous which is called hull waterjet interaction based on the numerical results the interaction efficiency η i n t of has been analyzed based on the theory in section 2 1 the results of hull waterjet interaction efficiency and its components are shown in fig 48 as for the η m i and η e i their trends were basically the same which both gradually decreased with the increase of speed in detail as for this waterjet propelled planing trimaran the η m i is almost negative at semi planing and planing state while the η e i is negative only when fr 4 79 on the other hand it can be found that the value of 1 t play the more important role on deciding the trend of η i n t moreover the η i n t is larger than 1 0 when fr 2 0 which indicates that the hull waterjet interaction of this planing trimaran has positive effects on the propulsion performance at semi planing and planing state 6 conclusion prospect 1 the resistance increment fraction is pretty large at low speeds mainly due to the geometry loss of disc area on transom and waterjet jet flow which changes the hydrostatic resistance of main hull and transom the negative resistance increment fraction of this trimaran occurs at planing state thus making the negative resistance increment fraction appears at design speed and normal sailing speed is worth trying in ship design 2 as for semi planing and planing states the local waterjet actions of this planing trimaran is mostly helpful to reduce the resistance while the global hull attitude change always causes the resistance increment therefore the adjustment of navigation hull attitude can be emphasized to improve the propulsion performance of this planing trimaran 3 the jet system thrust deduction fraction of this planing trimaran is always negative at semi planing and planing states in the meanwhile the negative jet system thrust deduction fraction mainly causes the negative thrust deduction fraction at the main speed range the hull attitude change within a certain range has not obviously influenced the gross thrust net thrust and jet system thrust deduction fraction 4 based on model test of bare hull and numerical analysis of bare hull and self propelled hull this paper explores the change of thrust deduction fraction after considering water spray with empirical formulas after considering the spray drag the jet system thrust deduction fraction remains basically the same while there will be a slightly larger negative thrust deduction at high speed due to the downward movement of resistance increment fraction 5 the hull waterjet interaction of this planing trimaran mainly has positive effects on the propulsion performance at semi planing and planing state the thrust deduction fraction play a more important role on deciding the trend of interaction efficiency thus in the design and research of waterjet propelled ships more attention should be paid to the mechanism of thrust deduction credit authorship

21099,in the last years predictive maintenance has gained a central position in condition based maintenance tasks planning machine learning approaches have been very successful in simplifying the construction of prognostic models for health assessment based on available historical labeled data issued from similar systems or specific physical models however if the collected samples suffer from lack of labels small labeled dataset or not enough samples the process of generalization of the learning model on the dataset as well as on the newly arrived samples application can be very difficult in an attempt to overcome such drawbacks a new deep supervised learning approach is introduced in this paper the proposed approach aims at extracting and learning important patterns even from a small amount of data in order to produce more general health estimator the algorithm is trained online based on local receptive field theories of extreme learning machines using data issued from a propulsion system simulator compared to extreme learning machine variants the new algorithm shows a higher level of accuracy in terms of approximation and generalization under several training paradigms keywords predictive maintenance decay detection extreme learning machine deep learning prognostic and health management naval propulsion systems nomenclature ann artificial neural network c

concept strongly related to the computer assisted maintenance management field it consists in anticipating maintenance requirements in order to prevent alteration or secession of such a system earlier by following damages propagation cipollini et al 2018a tan et al 2019 this prediction approach needs an accurate prognostic system through which failure conditions can be analyzed to directly address associated causes cipollini et al 2018b xiang et al 2020 predictive maintenance makes it possible to predict technical incidents rather than suffer them coraddu et al 2014 thanks to this strategy it is thus possible to plan interventions in advance and thus avoid an unexpected immobilization of equipment or a machine it therefore pushes things a step further than preventive maintenance many modeling approaches can be involved to determine the operating behavior such as physical numerical and mathematical modeling coraddu et al 2014 however the complexity and flexibility of recent systems which are due to the massive evolution in industrial technologies have resulted in difficult manipulation besides the lack of precision at the level of the aforementioned modeling tools hence these shortcomings may lead to reduced reliability for health monitoring systems tan et al 2020 motivated by both the remarkable advances in sensor technologies and the low implementation cost machine learning ml tools are becoming more relevant for the generation of more reliable training models in comparison to conventional strategies xiang et al 2020 chen et al 2020 xiong et al 2018 in the literature several ml tools with different training paradigms and architectures have been investigated these studies are involved in the analysis of the faults of many industrial systems in particular the most critical ones such as propulsion systems in fact a small defect or failure in any of the sub components of these systems can lead to probable catastrophes for instance ensemble algorithms wen et al 2019 deep learning chen et al 2020 helbing and ritter 2018 wang et al 2020 and hybrid architectures kong 2019 garcía nieto et al 2015 dragomir et al 2007 were studied as part of the analysis of deterioration and propagation of damage for different operating systems including propulsion systems associated to marine vessels in this regard coraddu et al 2014 constructed the numerical model of a combined diesel electric and gas propulsion plant codlag to generate data corresponding to fatigue growth of the propulsion system two different ml tools namely support vector machine svm and recursive least squares rls have been used to model data behavior under several sub sampling methods jointly with different data fractioning paradigms in this study it has been proven that svm was able to achieve more accurate results cipollini et al 2018b performed a comparative study to investigate the use of several supervised learning methods to determine the most suitable model for decay detection using the same training data of the previous work moreover the use of hybrid models that combines two paths for both unsupervised and supervised learning with the aim of providing more reliable learners under the lack of data have been presented by cipollini et al 2018a tan et al 2019 used one class svm based approach for a dataset classification attempting to keep the prediction accuracy as lower as possible even under the use of a small amount of samples during the training process furthermore tan et al 2020 proposed to study the same topic using a new ml approach based on the combination of a hybrid svm and an isolation forest in the context of ml modeling the availability of labeled training data allows obtaining well generalized universal approximators nevertheless these universal approximators suffer from insufficient precision when the recorded data representing the history of the operating systems suffer for the lack of labels according to the theories of deep learning lecun et al 2015 in addition a multitude of time varying data collected from various and varied sensors that change over time and distribution makes dynamic adaptation really important to maintain the stability of training models yin et al 2019 the emergence of deep learning algorithms in ml has gained an excellent reputation as it can handle both generalization and approximation based on an unsupervised training process moreover a fine tuning can be performed based on a small set of training samples hinton 2012 helbing and ritter 2018 deutsch and he 2016 gollapudi 2019 however supervised training or fine tuning of deep networks based gradient descent algorithms such as backpropagation or contrastive divergence or unsupervised learning approaches could make the training process more difficult and not precise enough because of the following issues zhu et al 2019 feng et al 2016 heimes 2008 chen and li 2017 liao et al 2016 these training algorithms can easily be trapped within local minima and suffer from stopping criteria numerous components including iterative tuning repeating learning sequences for recurrent neural networks rnn multiple layers of convolutional mapping and pooling for convolutional neural networks cnns forward and backward propagation for autoencoders and restricted boltzmann machines entail a huge amount of computational costs and training time especially under big data environments the learning rate the dropout regularization based l1 and l2 norms minimization the overlapping step the size of the local receptive field and many other hyperparameters should be adjusted in each iterative settings this issue does not address the biological learning of the human brain and leads to more human intervention or some other combined random search algorithms data from the actual process are required to be divided by experts into training and test sets as familiar in well known benchmarks otherwise another problem of randomized validation or k fold cross validation investigations should be achieved attempting to find the most suitable training samples avoiding the empirical risks or other ill posed problems the training tool known as extreme learning machine elm has brought many enhancements to the realm of artificial neural networks ann huang 2015 the elm has been proposed in an attempt to eliminate the barriers between human thinking and the ann by discarding the employment of both iterative adjustment of the hidden nodes parameters during training besides the learning rate huang et al 2004 as a matter of fact elm aims to design a well generalized universal approximators by considering only the hyperparameters of the output layer huang et al 2006 the elm was first unleashed for the training of single hidden layer feedforward neural networks slfn huang et al 2004 then it spreads so as to adapt to all the paradigms of anns for different domains such as the current health assessment and predictive maintenance field zhang et al 2020 ranging from multilayer to deep and hierarchical architectures under both online or offline learning attitudes huang 2015 in addition elm provides easy integration of adaptive learning which deals with environmental variables as well as fast robust extractors of features such as denoising autoencoders like those that have been investigated in previous work in berghout et al 2020 in this work the main objective is the design of an accurate learning and prediction tool based on elm theories for the analysis of the damages propagation in naval propulsion plants the main contributions of the present work as regarding the naval propulsion systems maintenance scheduling are as follows the use of elm theories to train a deep belief neural network dbn for both unsupervised learning and supervised fine tuning stages this allows taking advantage of both deep architecture of the dbn precision under the lack of labeled data and the reduction in computational time the integration of locally connected combinatorial neural sub networks into the hidden nodes based on elm local receptive fields theories elm lrf hence the hidden layers take advantage of the convolutional mapping of cnns huang et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 the introduction of a regularized online learning based on online sequential elm os elm to address adaptive training which prevents from structural risks huang et al 2005 the novelty of the proposed algorithms lies in the combination of all these characteristics in a very fast adaptive learning with both a convolutional mapping and a deep reconstruction of features with a stack of autoencoders in a single framework of a multilayer neural network the proposed combinatorial deep belief neural network c dbn is evaluated as part of the prediction of the decay of the frigate using the same data taken from a simulation model of codlag coraddu et al 2014 the results of the evaluation are compared with basic variants of the proposed algorithm namely os elm and elm the comparative study proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the elm and os elm learning rules the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the materials used in this work section 3 presents the proposed methodology as well as the adopted algorithms section 4 is dedicated to experimental results analysis and discussions finally section 5 concludes this paper and gives some directions for future works in this field 2 system and dataset description codlag system is a hybrid naval propulsion system with a double shaft arrangement that employs electric motors powered by diesel engines as illustrated by fig 1 a the gas turbine gt depicted by the diagram of fig 1 b powers the shafts via an interconnected gearbox as an alternative drive source tan et al 2020 the gt consists of a single compressor c and a high pressure turbine hp designed for the production of exhaust gas in which it drives the low pressure lp turbine for the production of enough thrust power to move the vessel coraddu et al 2014 the numerical model of the engine has been previously simulated by coraddu et al 2014 using matlab simulink library and the recovered data were released for the public at the data repository of the university of california at irvine achine learning rep more description about the modeling process and the vessel propulsion system can be found in coraddu et al 2014 the dataset describes both gtc and gt decay variation d g t c d g t as defined by equations 1 and 2 with 16 different sensors measurements gathered in 11934 samples all parameters which are organized in a dataset are obtained from gollapudi 2019 and their computed statistical characteristics are presented in table 1 collected samples are recorded sequentially with a higher level of dynamic disturbance which may drive any approximation function towards structural risks if the loss function is not optimally minimized without considering regularization 1 d g t c 1 i 0 001 i 0 1 2 51 2 d g t 1 i 0 001 i 0 1 2 26 according to cipollini et al 2018a gtc and gt are not decaying if the decay coefficients of gtc and gt belong to the intervals 0 98 1 and 0 99 1 respectively contrariwise they can be considered as decaying if their decay coefficient belongs to 0 95 0 98 and 0 975 0 99 respectively as indicated in coraddu et al 2014 the decay variation for both gtc and gt is defined according to equations 1 and 2 respectively fig 2 illustrates the dataset issued from different sensors and the corresponding decay variations in both gtc and gt as delivered by the simulation model it depicts the normalized data versus observation and sensors indices table 1 this figure shows the huge amount of the collected data and the difficulty to analyze such a database in order to get any information about the operating and health state of both sub systems namely gtc and gt as it is known from deep learning theories in such a big data problem the well designed deep learning model has more meaningful feature representations than ordinary feature mapping hence the reduction of the complexity of data and the extraction of meaningful patterns was one of the main reasons that led to combine two well known deep learning techniques convolutional mapping feature reconstruction at the same time within one algorithm with a very fast learning scheme of os elm 3 methodology the flowchart in fig 3 depicts the proposed methodology for training model construction it can be noticed from this figure that the training stage is composed of four distinctive parts dataset preparing model training results post processing and model validation these consecutive stages are further described in the following sub sections 3 1 dataset preparing raw data from the current dataset cannot be directly exploited by the prediction model for training or prediction purposes due to the incompatibility between the measurement scales of the sensors and their unknown degree of correlation therefore simple standardization and some correlation investigations must be performed to ensure the accuracy and the effectiveness of the training process in the current study and according to the elm learning constraints the input learning samples x i are scaled to fit within the range 0 1 using the min max normalization formula shown in equation 3 after that the correlation matrix is used to decide which parameters are critical for the elaboration of the decay prediction model 3 x x i x m i n x m a x x m i n the heat map in fig 4 a shows the correlation density between dataset features before and after selection it shows for example that sensors t1 and p1 corresponding to the inlet air temperatures and inlet air pressure of the gt compressor respectively can probably lead the model to an overfitting or to other ill posed problems due to the non correlation between them under the same criteria of decay variation consequently these measurements must be eliminated to increase the correlation of the data as it can be seen in the fig 4 b labels of each observation are defined according to the equations 1 and 2 regarding the current study the dataset is divided randomly into training and testing sets according to different ratios 3 2 training algorithm the new training rules of the proposed deep neural network are inspired from basic os elm huang et al 2005 this is one of the elm variants that have been developed attempting to address online learning as a feedback of environmental data accumulation of real world problems os elm with the single hidden layer architecture is presented in fig 5 it can be trained for any dataset of n mini batches x k t k k 1 n with the size of s k k 1 n based on elm theories in two main phases which are the initialization phase and the recursive phase where x k t k represent the training inputs and outputs respectively in the initialization phase hidden nodes parameters namely weights and biases a b are randomly and independently generated from the training data and must be scaled within the range 1 1 after that the hidden layer h can be mapped and activated according to any chosen activation function g as shown in equation 4 4 h k g a x k b the initial training weights β 1 of the output layer can be analytically determined using the moore penrose pseudo inverse of the matrix as shown in equation 5 using the covariance matrix m 1 in 6 5 β 1 m 1 h 1 t 1 6 m 1 h 1 t h 1 in the recursive phase the output weights β are updated using formula 9 depending on the updated covariance matrix m k 1 and estimation error e k 1 in equations 7 and 8 where i denotes the identity matrix 7 m k 1 m k m k h k 1 h k 1 t m k i h k 1 t m k h k 1 8 e k 1 t k 1 h k 1 t β k 9 β k 1 β k m k 1 e k 1 the proposed algorithm given by fig 6 is a result of a combination of two deep learning models the local receptive fields lrf and deep belief neural networks the deep network is trained for unsupervised learning with l number of serially connected autoencoders and then fine tuned for supervised learning using os elm theories the hidden nodes in each autoencoder could be locally connected to sub networks that address both convolutional mapping and pooling in a simple mapping theories based on elm lrf huang et al 2015 each sub network of the hidden layer is either fully connected or locally connected the decision regarding the types of hidden nodes is chosen randomly by following elm theories of randomness in parameters selection the locally connected hidden nodes are designed to analyze local fields of random size from each sequence of training data inside each combinatorial node the resulting feature maps are followed by a pooling process involving a fully connected layer with a single output and random weights to fill in the gaps in full rank mapping and to satisfy the learning constraints of the least squares method in deep belief neural networks feature mapping resulted in unsupervised reconstruction of inputs and the next stack of hidden layers can help the multilayer neural network to get the best approximation during the fine tuning process feng et al 2016 therefore in the designed network the feature mapping of the training inputs which is resulted by convolutional filtering of each autoencoder will be the input of the next autoencoder the transpose matrix of the tuned weights will be used as the encoding key for the new coming samples after the unsupervised learning tuned weights of the encoders will be used to the multilayer neural network for supervised learning thus a process of fine tuning at the last output layer is necessary the convolutional filtering under deep architecture will allow scanning multiple possibilities of representations of the features space which will allow the neural network to be aware of any variation of data and to guarantee its adequate approximation according to regularized elm r elm theories deng et al 2009 and forgetting mechanism of os elm guo et al 2018 regularization and forgetting parameters c λ can be added to reduce the amount of structural risk of os elm training as well as to adapt the training weights towards data variations as a result equations 5 and 7 must be changed into 10 and 11 to fit the new training process besides the target in equations 5 and 8 needs to be equal to the input in order to satisfy the unsupervised training process 10 β 1 i c h 1 t h 1 h t t 1 11 m k 1 m k λ m k h k 1 h k 1 t m k λ i h k 1 t m k h k 1 where λ ε 0 1 and c ε 0 according to elm learning theories of autoencoders as in zhou et al 2015 there is no need after the initial phase to use the random feature mapping with local receptive fields instead of that the transpose of the determined output weights will be used for the mapping process as shown in equation 12 12 a a k 1 β k 1 t k 1 the proposed c dbn approach is summarized in algorithm 1 algorithm 1 c dbn based os elm image 1 3 3 model validation the training algorithms in this case are evaluated using the error rate formula presented in equation 13 which is proposed by coraddu et al 2014 for studying this benchmark 13 l 1 n i 1 n t i t i t i where n denotes the number of training or testing samples t represents the estimated target t describes the desired target and l refers to the error metric function 4 experiments results and discussions in current experiments two main targets are considered which are gtc and gt decay coefficients therefore two training paradigms have been studied in the case of a single output and multiple outputs for trained neural networks in each experiment we use different manually tuned hyperparameters based on a simple grid search mechanism to enhance the accuracy of results experimental dataset processing has been performed by running the proposed algorithms in a personal computer with an intel r core tm i5 3427u cpu 1 80 ghz 2 80 ghz with 4 00 gb of ram since elm depends on moore penrose pseudo inverse method which in general suffers from the interpolation problem caused by the least squares method miche et al 2011 the best suggestion of results adjustment is rescaling according to initial condition from the targets values in the current experiment we have adjusted the targets using min max normalization depending on the original values of the decay coefficients to fit into a range of meanings and ensure that their statistical inferences make sense relatively to the original ones tables 2 and 3 give the results of the comparative study by considering all of the three cases of predictions gtc gt gtc gt the training ratio was tuned according to coraddu et al 2014 in order to avoid complicating validation problem and to keep the originality of the prediction problem in the proposed approach of coraddu et al in coraddu et al 2014 the authors used different sub sampling approaches uniform distribution bimodal distribution and monomodal distribution with different prediction cases single output and multiple outputs different training sets of different sizes were made in each case in our training scheme we followed a simple random sampling process because it is easier to implement and leads to less algorithmic complexity however the dataset partitioning is defined the same way by taking only the largest training set in each case which is shown in tables 2 and 3 on one hand it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that the proposed algorithm outperforms offline training paradigms improvements in the prediction accuracy of the online learning attitude are the result of the dynamic adaptation with a forgetting mechanism unlike the basic elm which is based on the offline least squares method the sequence learning forgetting factor of os elm acts as a temporal memory that allows the learning weights to decide which samples are much important to remember in addition the setting of new multi feature maps based on the feature space resulting from both random convolutional filtering and pooling techniques which are integrated inside the hidden units as sub networks can push the hidden layers towards robust feature extraction and allow expressing more meaningful representations moreover these tables also shows that elm variants can handle single output better than multiple outputs under the current decay prediction problem besides even in the current deep complex architecture of the algorithm the computational time during training stage is less than 3 s this is almost a negligible amount of time compared to the computational burden of the ordinary gradient descent dbns and other old deep learning architectures the current learning speed is the result of simplified learning rules driven by both non iterative adjustments and fewer hyperparameters that allow less human intervention on the other hand by sub sampling the training and test sets randomly from the original dataset with the proviso that the test samples encompass samples of sequences similar to the training set the results of curve fitting can be viewed as an indicator of performances that visually explains the magnitude of variation in predicted samples figs 7 and 8 illustrate the proposed network behavior in case of a single target results of the curve fitting in training and testing are much closer to the original samples than those in fig 8 which slightly deviated this therefore leads to the same conclusion that recursive least squares methods can handle a single output better than multi outputs it is known that in elm theories more nodes in the hidden layer leads to more accurate tuning of the output weights by the pseudo inverse method on this basis a new comparative study is carried out in an attempt to prove the stability of the deep architecture even under random feature mapping by increasing the number of hidden nodes iteratively the main goal is to ensure that the network always achieves the best results over the others figs 9 and 10 describe the studied networks error behavior during increasing the number of hidden nodes both figures highlight the network stability responses during model validation phases by showing less fluctuations and dynamic disturbances in the error rate behavior in addition under different incremental learning circumstances c dbn is still stable and has higher performance accuracy than elm and os elm the new training scheme seems clearly more resistant against empirical risk indeed as shown by fig 9 testing with single output gtc it can achieve better results than the other ones under less than 100 neurons this leads to the conclusion that the new network allows hidden layer in deep architecture to be more extended to give better a representation leading to an increased accuracy without suffering from overfitting compared to old paradigms when feeding each mini batch entering the training model a certain correlation between the last training model and the new driven data must be observed because this will prove that the model is generalized on the two sequences the current and the last ones therefore in order to prove the effectiveness of the adaptive learning of the c dbn on the generalization process towards the newly arrived samples additional experiments were investigated during the training process the root mean squared error rmse of the prediction error equation 8 using the latest output weights is recorded in each single iteration and the results are shown in fig 11 in these experiments the training data were divided into small mini batches 20 samples to study the behavior of the rmse during sequential training these results prove that the uniform gradual degradation of rmse linked to c dbn in the three cases gtc gt gtc gt is more stable and show the generalization ability of the proposed approach indeed unlike c dbn ordinary os elm shows less generalization ability and learning stability to new samples by showing more fluctuations towards multiple sequences these results show the effectiveness of the combination between convolutional mapping and deep learning under the recursive learning of os elm in basic algorithms that have been previously discussed such as svm coraddu et al 2014 svm with isolation forest tan et al 2020 and one class svm combined with global k nearest neighbor cipollini et al 2018a training algorithms have been developed attempting to solve the aforementioned condition based maintenance problem by studying either a regression or a classification compared to the proposed algorithm svm is an offline learning method that is not able to address dynamic programming during adaptive learning with time varying data additionally hybridization with svm will produce more algorithmic complexity which will ultimately result in higher computational costs moreover unlike the os elm iterative gradient descent algorithms suffer from convergence problems when trying to find an optimal local minimum of the loss function however and due to the need for least squares methods of os elm for full rank feature mapping the flow of the mapping process to hidden layers in a deeper hierarchical architecture will cause important descriptive patterns to disappear therefore careful selection of architecture is of a paramount importance 5 conclusion this paper dealt with a new data driven approach for predicting the decay of a combined diesel electric and gas propulsion plant for naval propulsion systems the proposed approach is a type of deep belief neural network dbn based on online sequential extreme learning machine os elm rules which has the capacity to perform convolutional mapping as well as the pooling in each single sub network from its hidden layers according to elm with local receptive fields theories the introduced framework has been evaluated under time varying data obtained from the system numerical model and compared with its original variants elm os elm the results have shown that combinatorial dbn c dbn is more efficient in terms of prediction capability especially under single output this makes it very promising for real world implementation of scheduled maintenance operations this efficiency lies on the dynamic adaptation with the forgetting mechanism and

21099,in the last years predictive maintenance has gained a central position in condition based maintenance tasks planning machine learning approaches have been very successful in simplifying the construction of prognostic models for health assessment based on available historical labeled data issued from similar systems or specific physical models however if the collected samples suffer from lack of labels small labeled dataset or not enough samples the process of generalization of the learning model on the dataset as well as on the newly arrived samples application can be very difficult in an attempt to overcome such drawbacks a new deep supervised learning approach is introduced in this paper the proposed approach aims at extracting and learning important patterns even from a small amount of data in order to produce more general health estimator the algorithm is trained online based on local receptive field theories of extreme learning machines using data issued from a propulsion system simulator compared to extreme learning machine variants the new algorithm shows a higher level of accuracy in terms of approximation and generalization under several training paradigms keywords predictive maintenance decay detection extreme learning machine deep learning prognostic and health management naval propulsion systems nomenclature ann artificial neural network c

concept strongly related to the computer assisted maintenance management field it consists in anticipating maintenance requirements in order to prevent alteration or secession of such a system earlier by following damages propagation cipollini et al 2018a tan et al 2019 this prediction approach needs an accurate prognostic system through which failure conditions can be analyzed to directly address associated causes cipollini et al 2018b xiang et al 2020 predictive maintenance makes it possible to predict technical incidents rather than suffer them coraddu et al 2014 thanks to this strategy it is thus possible to plan interventions in advance and thus avoid an unexpected immobilization of equipment or a machine it therefore pushes things a step further than preventive maintenance many modeling approaches can be involved to determine the operating behavior such as physical numerical and mathematical modeling coraddu et al 2014 however the complexity and flexibility of recent systems which are due to the massive evolution in industrial technologies have resulted in difficult manipulation besides the lack of precision at the level of the aforementioned modeling tools hence these shortcomings may lead to reduced reliability for health monitoring systems tan et al 2020 motivated by both the remarkable advances in sensor technologies and the low implementation cost machine learning ml tools are becoming more relevant for the generation of more reliable training models in comparison to conventional strategies xiang et al 2020 chen et al 2020 xiong et al 2018 in the literature several ml tools with different training paradigms and architectures have been investigated these studies are involved in the analysis of the faults of many industrial systems in particular the most critical ones such as propulsion systems in fact a small defect or failure in any of the sub components of these systems can lead to probable catastrophes for instance ensemble algorithms wen et al 2019 deep learning chen et al 2020 helbing and ritter 2018 wang et al 2020 and hybrid architectures kong 2019 garcía nieto et al 2015 dragomir et al 2007 were studied as part of the analysis of deterioration and propagation of damage for different operating systems including propulsion systems associated to marine vessels in this regard coraddu et al 2014 constructed the numerical model of a combined diesel electric and gas propulsion plant codlag to generate data corresponding to fatigue growth of the propulsion system two different ml tools namely support vector machine svm and recursive least squares rls have been used to model data behavior under several sub sampling methods jointly with different data fractioning paradigms in this study it has been proven that svm was able to achieve more accurate results cipollini et al 2018b performed a comparative study to investigate the use of several supervised learning methods to determine the most suitable model for decay detection using the same training data of the previous work moreover the use of hybrid models that combines two paths for both unsupervised and supervised learning with the aim of providing more reliable learners under the lack of data have been presented by cipollini et al 2018a tan et al 2019 used one class svm based approach for a dataset classification attempting to keep the prediction accuracy as lower as possible even under the use of a small amount of samples during the training process furthermore tan et al 2020 proposed to study the same topic using a new ml approach based on the combination of a hybrid svm and an isolation forest in the context of ml modeling the availability of labeled training data allows obtaining well generalized universal approximators nevertheless these universal approximators suffer from insufficient precision when the recorded data representing the history of the operating systems suffer for the lack of labels according to the theories of deep learning lecun et al 2015 in addition a multitude of time varying data collected from various and varied sensors that change over time and distribution makes dynamic adaptation really important to maintain the stability of training models yin et al 2019 the emergence of deep learning algorithms in ml has gained an excellent reputation as it can handle both generalization and approximation based on an unsupervised training process moreover a fine tuning can be performed based on a small set of training samples hinton 2012 helbing and ritter 2018 deutsch and he 2016 gollapudi 2019 however supervised training or fine tuning of deep networks based gradient descent algorithms such as backpropagation or contrastive divergence or unsupervised learning approaches could make the training process more difficult and not precise enough because of the following issues zhu et al 2019 feng et al 2016 heimes 2008 chen and li 2017 liao et al 2016 these training algorithms can easily be trapped within local minima and suffer from stopping criteria numerous components including iterative tuning repeating learning sequences for recurrent neural networks rnn multiple layers of convolutional mapping and pooling for convolutional neural networks cnns forward and backward propagation for autoencoders and restricted boltzmann machines entail a huge amount of computational costs and training time especially under big data environments the learning rate the dropout regularization based l1 and l2 norms minimization the overlapping step the size of the local receptive field and many other hyperparameters should be adjusted in each iterative settings this issue does not address the biological learning of the human brain and leads to more human intervention or some other combined random search algorithms data from the actual process are required to be divided by experts into training and test sets as familiar in well known benchmarks otherwise another problem of randomized validation or k fold cross validation investigations should be achieved attempting to find the most suitable training samples avoiding the empirical risks or other ill posed problems the training tool known as extreme learning machine elm has brought many enhancements to the realm of artificial neural networks ann huang 2015 the elm has been proposed in an attempt to eliminate the barriers between human thinking and the ann by discarding the employment of both iterative adjustment of the hidden nodes parameters during training besides the learning rate huang et al 2004 as a matter of fact elm aims to design a well generalized universal approximators by considering only the hyperparameters of the output layer huang et al 2006 the elm was first unleashed for the training of single hidden layer feedforward neural networks slfn huang et al 2004 then it spreads so as to adapt to all the paradigms of anns for different domains such as the current health assessment and predictive maintenance field zhang et al 2020 ranging from multilayer to deep and hierarchical architectures under both online or offline learning attitudes huang 2015 in addition elm provides easy integration of adaptive learning which deals with environmental variables as well as fast robust extractors of features such as denoising autoencoders like those that have been investigated in previous work in berghout et al 2020 in this work the main objective is the design of an accurate learning and prediction tool based on elm theories for the analysis of the damages propagation in naval propulsion plants the main contributions of the present work as regarding the naval propulsion systems maintenance scheduling are as follows the use of elm theories to train a deep belief neural network dbn for both unsupervised learning and supervised fine tuning stages this allows taking advantage of both deep architecture of the dbn precision under the lack of labeled data and the reduction in computational time the integration of locally connected combinatorial neural sub networks into the hidden nodes based on elm local receptive fields theories elm lrf hence the hidden layers take advantage of the convolutional mapping of cnns huang et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 the introduction of a regularized online learning based on online sequential elm os elm to address adaptive training which prevents from structural risks huang et al 2005 the novelty of the proposed algorithms lies in the combination of all these characteristics in a very fast adaptive learning with both a convolutional mapping and a deep reconstruction of features with a stack of autoencoders in a single framework of a multilayer neural network the proposed combinatorial deep belief neural network c dbn is evaluated as part of the prediction of the decay of the frigate using the same data taken from a simulation model of codlag coraddu et al 2014 the results of the evaluation are compared with basic variants of the proposed algorithm namely os elm and elm the comparative study proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the elm and os elm learning rules the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the materials used in this work section 3 presents the proposed methodology as well as the adopted algorithms section 4 is dedicated to experimental results analysis and discussions finally section 5 concludes this paper and gives some directions for future works in this field 2 system and dataset description codlag system is a hybrid naval propulsion system with a double shaft arrangement that employs electric motors powered by diesel engines as illustrated by fig 1 a the gas turbine gt depicted by the diagram of fig 1 b powers the shafts via an interconnected gearbox as an alternative drive source tan et al 2020 the gt consists of a single compressor c and a high pressure turbine hp designed for the production of exhaust gas in which it drives the low pressure lp turbine for the production of enough thrust power to move the vessel coraddu et al 2014 the numerical model of the engine has been previously simulated by coraddu et al 2014 using matlab simulink library and the recovered data were released for the public at the data repository of the university of california at irvine achine learning rep more description about the modeling process and the vessel propulsion system can be found in coraddu et al 2014 the dataset describes both gtc and gt decay variation d g t c d g t as defined by equations 1 and 2 with 16 different sensors measurements gathered in 11934 samples all parameters which are organized in a dataset are obtained from gollapudi 2019 and their computed statistical characteristics are presented in table 1 collected samples are recorded sequentially with a higher level of dynamic disturbance which may drive any approximation function towards structural risks if the loss function is not optimally minimized without considering regularization 1 d g t c 1 i 0 001 i 0 1 2 51 2 d g t 1 i 0 001 i 0 1 2 26 according to cipollini et al 2018a gtc and gt are not decaying if the decay coefficients of gtc and gt belong to the intervals 0 98 1 and 0 99 1 respectively contrariwise they can be considered as decaying if their decay coefficient belongs to 0 95 0 98 and 0 975 0 99 respectively as indicated in coraddu et al 2014 the decay variation for both gtc and gt is defined according to equations 1 and 2 respectively fig 2 illustrates the dataset issued from different sensors and the corresponding decay variations in both gtc and gt as delivered by the simulation model it depicts the normalized data versus observation and sensors indices table 1 this figure shows the huge amount of the collected data and the difficulty to analyze such a database in order to get any information about the operating and health state of both sub systems namely gtc and gt as it is known from deep learning theories in such a big data problem the well designed deep learning model has more meaningful feature representations than ordinary feature mapping hence the reduction of the complexity of data and the extraction of meaningful patterns was one of the main reasons that led to combine two well known deep learning techniques convolutional mapping feature reconstruction at the same time within one algorithm with a very fast learning scheme of os elm 3 methodology the flowchart in fig 3 depicts the proposed methodology for training model construction it can be noticed from this figure that the training stage is composed of four distinctive parts dataset preparing model training results post processing and model validation these consecutive stages are further described in the following sub sections 3 1 dataset preparing raw data from the current dataset cannot be directly exploited by the prediction model for training or prediction purposes due to the incompatibility between the measurement scales of the sensors and their unknown degree of correlation therefore simple standardization and some correlation investigations must be performed to ensure the accuracy and the effectiveness of the training process in the current study and according to the elm learning constraints the input learning samples x i are scaled to fit within the range 0 1 using the min max normalization formula shown in equation 3 after that the correlation matrix is used to decide which parameters are critical for the elaboration of the decay prediction model 3 x x i x m i n x m a x x m i n the heat map in fig 4 a shows the correlation density between dataset features before and after selection it shows for example that sensors t1 and p1 corresponding to the inlet air temperatures and inlet air pressure of the gt compressor respectively can probably lead the model to an overfitting or to other ill posed problems due to the non correlation between them under the same criteria of decay variation consequently these measurements must be eliminated to increase the correlation of the data as it can be seen in the fig 4 b labels of each observation are defined according to the equations 1 and 2 regarding the current study the dataset is divided randomly into training and testing sets according to different ratios 3 2 training algorithm the new training rules of the proposed deep neural network are inspired from basic os elm huang et al 2005 this is one of the elm variants that have been developed attempting to address online learning as a feedback of environmental data accumulation of real world problems os elm with the single hidden layer architecture is presented in fig 5 it can be trained for any dataset of n mini batches x k t k k 1 n with the size of s k k 1 n based on elm theories in two main phases which are the initialization phase and the recursive phase where x k t k represent the training inputs and outputs respectively in the initialization phase hidden nodes parameters namely weights and biases a b are randomly and independently generated from the training data and must be scaled within the range 1 1 after that the hidden layer h can be mapped and activated according to any chosen activation function g as shown in equation 4 4 h k g a x k b the initial training weights β 1 of the output layer can be analytically determined using the moore penrose pseudo inverse of the matrix as shown in equation 5 using the covariance matrix m 1 in 6 5 β 1 m 1 h 1 t 1 6 m 1 h 1 t h 1 in the recursive phase the output weights β are updated using formula 9 depending on the updated covariance matrix m k 1 and estimation error e k 1 in equations 7 and 8 where i denotes the identity matrix 7 m k 1 m k m k h k 1 h k 1 t m k i h k 1 t m k h k 1 8 e k 1 t k 1 h k 1 t β k 9 β k 1 β k m k 1 e k 1 the proposed algorithm given by fig 6 is a result of a combination of two deep learning models the local receptive fields lrf and deep belief neural networks the deep network is trained for unsupervised learning with l number of serially connected autoencoders and then fine tuned for supervised learning using os elm theories the hidden nodes in each autoencoder could be locally connected to sub networks that address both convolutional mapping and pooling in a simple mapping theories based on elm lrf huang et al 2015 each sub network of the hidden layer is either fully connected or locally connected the decision regarding the types of hidden nodes is chosen randomly by following elm theories of randomness in parameters selection the locally connected hidden nodes are designed to analyze local fields of random size from each sequence of training data inside each combinatorial node the resulting feature maps are followed by a pooling process involving a fully connected layer with a single output and random weights to fill in the gaps in full rank mapping and to satisfy the learning constraints of the least squares method in deep belief neural networks feature mapping resulted in unsupervised reconstruction of inputs and the next stack of hidden layers can help the multilayer neural network to get the best approximation during the fine tuning process feng et al 2016 therefore in the designed network the feature mapping of the training inputs which is resulted by convolutional filtering of each autoencoder will be the input of the next autoencoder the transpose matrix of the tuned weights will be used as the encoding key for the new coming samples after the unsupervised learning tuned weights of the encoders will be used to the multilayer neural network for supervised learning thus a process of fine tuning at the last output layer is necessary the convolutional filtering under deep architecture will allow scanning multiple possibilities of representations of the features space which will allow the neural network to be aware of any variation of data and to guarantee its adequate approximation according to regularized elm r elm theories deng et al 2009 and forgetting mechanism of os elm guo et al 2018 regularization and forgetting parameters c λ can be added to reduce the amount of structural risk of os elm training as well as to adapt the training weights towards data variations as a result equations 5 and 7 must be changed into 10 and 11 to fit the new training process besides the target in equations 5 and 8 needs to be equal to the input in order to satisfy the unsupervised training process 10 β 1 i c h 1 t h 1 h t t 1 11 m k 1 m k λ m k h k 1 h k 1 t m k λ i h k 1 t m k h k 1 where λ ε 0 1 and c ε 0 according to elm learning theories of autoencoders as in zhou et al 2015 there is no need after the initial phase to use the random feature mapping with local receptive fields instead of that the transpose of the determined output weights will be used for the mapping process as shown in equation 12 12 a a k 1 β k 1 t k 1 the proposed c dbn approach is summarized in algorithm 1 algorithm 1 c dbn based os elm image 1 3 3 model validation the training algorithms in this case are evaluated using the error rate formula presented in equation 13 which is proposed by coraddu et al 2014 for studying this benchmark 13 l 1 n i 1 n t i t i t i where n denotes the number of training or testing samples t represents the estimated target t describes the desired target and l refers to the error metric function 4 experiments results and discussions in current experiments two main targets are considered which are gtc and gt decay coefficients therefore two training paradigms have been studied in the case of a single output and multiple outputs for trained neural networks in each experiment we use different manually tuned hyperparameters based on a simple grid search mechanism to enhance the accuracy of results experimental dataset processing has been performed by running the proposed algorithms in a personal computer with an intel r core tm i5 3427u cpu 1 80 ghz 2 80 ghz with 4 00 gb of ram since elm depends on moore penrose pseudo inverse method which in general suffers from the interpolation problem caused by the least squares method miche et al 2011 the best suggestion of results adjustment is rescaling according to initial condition from the targets values in the current experiment we have adjusted the targets using min max normalization depending on the original values of the decay coefficients to fit into a range of meanings and ensure that their statistical inferences make sense relatively to the original ones tables 2 and 3 give the results of the comparative study by considering all of the three cases of predictions gtc gt gtc gt the training ratio was tuned according to coraddu et al 2014 in order to avoid complicating validation problem and to keep the originality of the prediction problem in the proposed approach of coraddu et al in coraddu et al 2014 the authors used different sub sampling approaches uniform distribution bimodal distribution and monomodal distribution with different prediction cases single output and multiple outputs different training sets of different sizes were made in each case in our training scheme we followed a simple random sampling process because it is easier to implement and leads to less algorithmic complexity however the dataset partitioning is defined the same way by taking only the largest training set in each case which is shown in tables 2 and 3 on one hand it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that the proposed algorithm outperforms offline training paradigms improvements in the prediction accuracy of the online learning attitude are the result of the dynamic adaptation with a forgetting mechanism unlike the basic elm which is based on the offline least squares method the sequence learning forgetting factor of os elm acts as a temporal memory that allows the learning weights to decide which samples are much important to remember in addition the setting of new multi feature maps based on the feature space resulting from both random convolutional filtering and pooling techniques which are integrated inside the hidden units as sub networks can push the hidden layers towards robust feature extraction and allow expressing more meaningful representations moreover these tables also shows that elm variants can handle single output better than multiple outputs under the current decay prediction problem besides even in the current deep complex architecture of the algorithm the computational time during training stage is less than 3 s this is almost a negligible amount of time compared to the computational burden of the ordinary gradient descent dbns and other old deep learning architectures the current learning speed is the result of simplified learning rules driven by both non iterative adjustments and fewer hyperparameters that allow less human intervention on the other hand by sub sampling the training and test sets randomly from the original dataset with the proviso that the test samples encompass samples of sequences similar to the training set the results of curve fitting can be viewed as an indicator of performances that visually explains the magnitude of variation in predicted samples figs 7 and 8 illustrate the proposed network behavior in case of a single target results of the curve fitting in training and testing are much closer to the original samples than those in fig 8 which slightly deviated this therefore leads to the same conclusion that recursive least squares methods can handle a single output better than multi outputs it is known that in elm theories more nodes in the hidden layer leads to more accurate tuning of the output weights by the pseudo inverse method on this basis a new comparative study is carried out in an attempt to prove the stability of the deep architecture even under random feature mapping by increasing the number of hidden nodes iteratively the main goal is to ensure that the network always achieves the best results over the others figs 9 and 10 describe the studied networks error behavior during increasing the number of hidden nodes both figures
