8700,small scale irrigation ssi technologies can be useful not only to increase crop productivity and income but also as a viable adaptation practice to climate variability a farm simulation model farmsim and data from selected ssi technologies piloted in northern ghana under the feed the future innovation lab for small scale irrigation ilssi project were used to assess the economic feasibility of the ssi technologies and their potential to improve income and nutrition of smallholder farm households three dry season irrigated crops onion corchorus amaranthus grown under three agricultural water management regimes were analysed results show that adoption of the ssi technologies could increase the net farm profit by 154 608 against the baseline depending on the crop type ssi technology combination nutrition levels also improved significantly as a result of the improvements in crop yields due to irrigation and use of complementary inputs however the results further reveal that the options that utilize capital intensive ssi technologies such as solar powered water pumps to grow high value cash crops are constrained by the high investment cost currently farmers tend to choose low cost ssi technologies such as a traditional watering cans which generate low economic returns improving access to credit or alternative financing schemes could mitigate the capital constraints and enable smallholders to gain more benefits from participating in market oriented high value irrigated production keywords economic feasibility farm income ghana nutrition smallholders small scale irrigation 1 introduction limited or no access to appropriate agricultural technologies has led to low productivity and persistent food insecurity in developing countries 1 national governments and several development organizations have attempted to make agriculture more productive and profitable by introducing agricultural technologies but with modest results 2 several factors such as lack of credit access farmers risk behaviour lack of technical know how high investment and operational costs and supply chain constraints e g high transaction costs have contributed to low rate or lack of adoption of new agricultural technologies in developing countries 3 8 even where these technologies have been adopted at pilot communities the dissemination to a larger segment of the population has failed in many cases 3 the ministry of food and agriculture mofa of ghana promotes irrigation as a climate variability adaptation measure in response to the declining rainfall and increasing intermittent dry spells during the rainy season cropping period 9 informal irrigation includes small scale irrigation ssi within one of three principal irrigation systems recognized in the national irrigation development policy 2 2 www mofa gov gh site wp 07 ghana irrigation development policy1 pdf the other two irrigation categories comprise of formal irrigation one that is reliant on some form of permanent irrigation infrastructure funded by the public sector and large scale commercial irrigation system in ghana according to this policy ssi is practised by individuals who cultivate a land area of up to about 0 5 ha or more using simple structures and irrigation equipment such as buckets fuel powered motorized pumps hose pipes and watering cans water sources can include small reservoirs shallow groundwater rivers and wastewater often referred to as farmer led irrigation ssi is an irrigation system practiced on small plots using a level of technology that an individual farmer can effectively control operate and maintain 10 11 ssi continues to expand despite limited technical support or extension services to farmers in ghana 8 11 12 it employs 45 times more people and covers 20 times more land area than large scale public irrigation schemes as of 2010 an estimated 185 000 ha were under ssi benefiting 500 000 smallholder farmers 13 14 projected that the use of motorized pumps in ssi could benefit from 564 000 to 730 000 households and irrigate up to 584 000 ha in the country similar projections suggest that the use of small reservoirs could benefit up to 163 000 households and irrigate from 74 000 to 163 000 ha the main ssi technologies currently in use include watering cans handheld hose pipes and diesel or petrol powered motorized pumps drip and sprinkler irrigation are also being adopted albeit very slowly 15 16 potential also exists for the use of shallow groundwater using various water lifting conveyance and application technologies in addition to improved utilization of multi purpose small reservoirs 8 17 the rate of adoption of ssi is likely to increase demand for vegetables and fruits is growing with increases in income and changing diets of the growing middle income consumers in urban areas 18 this could provide business opportunities for producers and others engaged in small scale irrigation various out grower models are feasible for more small scale irrigators to get involved in market oriented production however sustainable adoption and scaling of various ssi technologies depend on the biophysical conditions and economic feasibility along the value chains among other factors at present there is lack of evidence on socio economic and technical factors that could promote or impede adoption of ssi in northern ghana understanding these factors could provide decision support evidence to improve the scaling pathway for ssi and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers these factors include i identification of ways to improve water use and management for farmers adopting ssi technologies ii provision of evidence for informed investment decisions by farmers and other actors in irrigated value chains iii identification of promising technologies and crop types with high financial returns that improve livelihoods and food security for smallholder farmers and iv understanding household economic and other benefits of scaling up of the ssi technologies to understand these factors in ghana the innovation laboratory for small scale irrigation ilssi 3 3 ilssi is an action oriented farmer centered research project supported by the feed the future ftf program through usaid and implemented in ghana ethiopia and tanzania it aims to investigate and understand the technical and socio economic factors constraints and opportunities of ssi technologies towards achieving sustainability and efficiency in resource utilization water land and other resources and enhance the livelihoods of smallholder farmers project field tested selected ssi technologies in a few communities in northern ghana this paper seeks to contribute to filling the knowledge gap on the economic return on investment food security effects and potential risk factors of ssi technology adoption by smallholder farm households the study aims to assess profitable and economically feasible crop type ssi technology combinations in northern ghana primary farm level data on selected ssi technologies piloted in the study communities and secondary data from government agencies were used in the analysis a farm simulation model farmsim was applied to assess the economic potential and nutritional effects of farmer investments in ssi technologies this paper is structured as follows section 2 briefly presents a review of previous studies on water resources climate change and the income and food security effects of ssi in the study area the methods including descriptions of the farm simulation farmsim modelling approach and ssi technology scenarios are then presented in sections 3 and 4 results are presented in section 5 while the last two sections contain discussions conclusion and recommendations 2 previous studies in the study area 2 1 water sources for ssi in northern ghana northern ghana is drained by the volta river system that consists of the white and black volta rivers and the oti and darka rivers in the volta basin water for irrigation is sourced from rivers groundwater and stored water in natural and built infrastructure or reservoirs 19 20 in northern ghana there are large and medium reservoirs for public sector managed irrigation schemes at tono vea golinga bontanga and libga with storage capacities ranging from 5 9 to 93 cubic megametre mm3 additionally there are more than 500 small reservoirs and over 6280 boreholes managed by communities and smallholder farmers 19 water is also stored on farm in ponds and wetlands 21 in many areas in northern ghana shallow groundwater is the farmers preferred water source 22 23 permanent shallow wells are widespread in several communities 20 though many more are re constructed each year in the dry season small reservoirs and dugouts are in high demand because they support multiple livelihood strategies including irrigation livestock production fisheries and brick fabrication 24 25 a number of multi purpose small reservoirs have been constructed in northern ghana over the past few decades appendix a though could be better managed and utilized for small scale irrigation 13 14 several studies assessed the potential for shallow groundwater development for ssi in northern ghana 17 26 drechsel and keraita 2014 8 some of these studies showed high groundwater potential in northern ghana 70 of the area was found to have moderate to high groundwater availability and 83 has medium to high groundwater accessibility 26 27 the volta river system furthermore provides a perennial source of water that could be used for year round irrigated agricultural production by smallholder farmers large floodplains created by the volta river and several of its tributaries provides a good opportunity for flood recession agriculture 4 4 this is an agricultural practice that uses residual soil moisture and nutrients left by receding flood water with or without supplementary irrigations to grow crops in the floodplains these floodplains are suitable for cultivation of high value crops such as tomatoes onions pepper and cowpea 28 63 29 2 2 effects of climate change on water availability using the soil and water assessment tool swat williams et al 18 5 5 the first author of this paper led field works data analysis draft writing and co author in ref 18 report cited here assessed the impacts of climate change on water resources and water availability for irrigation in the three regions of northern ghana the climate change scenarios were generated using global circulation model and downscaled to regional scales for the swat model simulations water yield in two time snap shots 2030 and 2050 were used the baseline simulation 1990 2010 showed that annual water yield in study area was about 29 079 mm3 while at the sub watershed level water yield ranged from less than 100 mm3 to more than 1450 mm3 simulations were conducted to estimate the spatial distribution of water yield in 2030 and 2050 fig 1 shows the water yield for the study area under four representative concentration pathways rcps simulation 6 6 simulations a and b use the projected climatic data of the canadian center for climate modelling and analysis cccma canrcm4 for rcp4 5 for 2030 and 2050 respectively while simulation c and d used the projections derived through the same regional climate model rcm for rcp8 5 for the same two time snap shots under various climate change scenarios williams et al 18 all the four rcps show annual fluctuations in water yield during the simulation period simulation results under various climate change scenarios show less than 5 changes 5 to 5 in water yields compared to baseline simulation in the region that means the overall water availability for northern ghana does not drastically change compared to the baseline under various scenarios however it should be noted that the study referred to here selected only two climate change downscaled projections which may have biased the results in a large scale study including the volta river basin lacombe et al 30 found no statistically significant trend in annual rainfall but a reduction in the amount of light rainfall 20 mm day and a delay in the onset of rainy seasons studies on the effects of climate change on hydrology of the basin 31 34 found that river flows are sensitive to rainfall variability but the studies focused on future developments of large numbers of reservoirs and did not investigate the effects of climate change on small scale irrigation a study by ref 35 on the climatic and biophysical context of the study area provides an overview of the context for agricultural water management interventions the results show no significant change in rainfall trends the present paper mainly focuses on the effects of ssi technology adoption on household economics over a short to intermediate time period moreover the relationship between climate change and water availability for small scale irrigation has not been established in a robust manner in the existing literature in the study region thus climate change scenarios and their effects on water resources for ssi were not explicitly modelled in our analysis 2 3 the effects of ssi on household income and food security studies indicate that adoption of irrigation technologies can play an important role on poverty reduction food and nutrition security and household income 3 36 irrigation can enable smallholders to engage in year round production increase yield and improve food and nutrition security smith et al 37 found that in many rural areas of the dry tropics households face chronic shortages of vegetables and fruits during the dry season and this has a direct effect on household s nutrition security access to irrigation could enable smallholder farmers produce high value crops and tailor crop types and output supply in response to local demand 38 the use of ssi technologies can help promote diversification and significantly increase returns to land and labour and reduce risk 3 more current research identifies specific pathways that link irrigation and positive nutritional outcomes 39 40 the study focused on northern ghana generally and included the northern region particularly because it has the largest number of poor people in ghana being around 1 3 million people as well as some of the greatest challenges on undernutrition 41 the north also has the highest levels of inequality therefore analyzing the potential for ssi in terms of income and nutrition is particularly important in the northern region of ghana in addition a recent study in northern ghana has shown that adoption of ssi has good potential to increase agricultural productivity and enhance food security 27 42 in most cases crops benefiting from irrigation expansion are high value vegetables grown during the dry season and their income and nutritional benefits are important for improving household livelihoods 43 a study in floodplains of the white volta river in northern ghana indicates that 60 smallholders practice dry season irrigated farming and grow leafy vegetables such as cabbage brassica oleracea var capitata okra abelmoschus esculentus corchorus corchorus olitorius amaranthus amaranthus candatus and kenaf hibiscus cannabinus 42 most of the crops grown in that area are produced by women farmers on small plots of land 0 1 ha and used for home consumption in terms of household income balana et al 42 showed that with gross margins ranging from about usd 1250 to usd 2625 per ha irrigated onion allium cepa tomato solanum lycopersicum and pepper capsicum annuum are the major cash crops and source of income for smallholder irrigators in northern ghana as the production of these crops is labour intensive over 50 the cost of production of these crops is accounted for by cost of labour ssi could provide employment opportunities for the youth and women and income for smallholder farmers to meet their cash demands including direct purchase of household staples 42 3 materials and methods 3 1 description of study areas the study was conducted in two field sites under the ilssi project in northern ghana fig 2 shows the two ilssi field intervention sites bihinaayili and zanlerigu zanlerigu and bihinaayili are located in upper east region and northern region of ghana respectively 7 7 the northern area of ghana was recently rezoned into additional administrative regions northern northeast savannah upper east and upper west however the case study sites remain within the regions noted in the paper while both field sites are located in the guinea savannah agro ecological zone zanlerigu upper east is relatively closer to the sudan and sahel agro ecological zones than bihinaayili northern region and the former receives less rainfall than the latter the ssi technologies and crop types piloted in selected farmers fields in the two communities are summarized in table 1 northern ghana is largely located within the white volta basin throughout northern ghana small water storage structures are commonly constructed to access water during the long dry season rainfed crops such as maize rice millet and sorghum and groundnut dominate agricultural production in the study area as noted above the crops produced under irrigation are mainly vegetables including tomato onion pepper okra and leafy vegetables such as lettuce hibiscus kenaf bean leaves and cabbage the two major types of land use in study sites are agricultural land 56 and forestland 43 the average annual rainfall is approximately 1 000 mm and the watershed received 75 90 of annual rainfall between may and september these weather patterns restrict rain fed cropping to a single cropping season therefore irrigation may improve agricultural production 3 2 data data for farmsim called input data describe farm assets liabilities production costs yields out prices and use of crops and livestock products for each input data the user must provide information for the current baseline and for the alternative farming systems scenarios household survey data were used to define the baseline scenario and field data collected on field site farms were used to define the inputs for the alternative farming technologies the main datasets used in this study are listed below i two household surveys on 400 farm households conducted in 2014 and 2015 by the international food policy research institute ifpri the first survey was carried under the ghana africa rising baseline evaluation survey arbes 44 8 8 https dataverse harvard edu dataset xhtml persistentid doi 10 7910 dvn qub9ut while the second was collected under the ilssi project these data were used to define the baseline scenario against which ssi technologies were evaluated ii plot level production inputs and outputs data for ilssi pilot crops corchorus onion amaranth and cowpea collected by the local project partner university of development studies over a dry cropping season in 2016 17 iii farm level inputs and outputs data collected by international water management institute iwmi researchers through direct interviews of ilssi pilot farmers in march 2017 information on prices was obtained from local agricultural inputs dealers and commodity markets 3 3 farmsim model description the farm simulation model farmsim is a monte carlo simulation model that simultaneously evaluates a baseline and alternative technologies for a farm the model is programmed in microsoft excel and utilizes the simetar add in program to estimate parameters for price and yield distributions simulate random variables estimate probability distributions for key output variables kovs and rank technologies 45 9 9 farmsim is a micro computer excel simetar driven enhanced version of flipsim designed to simulate smallholder farms in developing countries flipsim has been used extensively for policy analysis and technology assessment for farms in the united states 62 farmsim is programmed to recursively simulate a five year planning horizon for a diversified crop and livestock farm and repeats the five year planning horizon for 500 iterations 10 10 extensive testing with the latin hypercube sampling procedure in simetar has shown that a sample size of 500 iterations is more than adequate to estimate a probability distribution for kovs in a business model with more than 100 random variables a new sample of random values is drawn to simulate each iteration after simulation the resulting 500 values for each of the kovs defines the empirical probability distributions for comparing the base and alternative farming technologies or interventions by comparing the probability distributions for the base and alternative technologies decision makers can quantitatively analyse the probable consequences of introducing alternative technologies the farmsim model has four major components crop livestock nutritional and financial the organizational and operational structure flow chart of farmsim is presented in appendix c farmsim is programmed to simulate up to 15 crops as well as livestock cattle dairy sheep goats chickens and swine annually for five years the farm household is modelled as the first claimant for crop and livestock production with deficit food production met through food purchases using net cash income from selling surplus crops and livestock production standard accounting procedures are used to calculate receipts expenses net cash income and annual cash flows the kovs for the model can include all endogenous variables in the model but most attention is focused on annual net cash income annual ending cash reserves net present value npv benefit cost ratio bcr internal rate of return irr and annual household nutrient consumption of protein calories fat calcium iron and vitamin a a detailed description of the farmsim model is presented in refs 6 46 3 4 economic feasibility assessment the net present value npv internal rate of return irr and the benefit cost ratio bcr are the key criteria used to assess the profitability of ssi technologies that involve capital investment in terms of water storage facility and pumping machines 47 48 npv is defined as the difference between the total sum of the present value of benefit streams and that of cost streams over the life of the project projects with positive npv are accepted while projects with negative npv are rejected the irr is the discount rate that generates a zero npv value if its irr exceeds the cost of capital i e the return from the capital if invested elsewhere a project is accepted and if the irr is less than the cost of capital the project is not recommended the bcr is the ratio of the present value of the benefits to the present value of the costs if this ratio is greater than one the project is recommended in addition to the economic variables farmsim simulates nutrition variables in terms of daily minimum requirements per adult equivalent to determine excess or deficiency in nutrient intake in the nutrition simulation the total kilograms of each raised crop consumed by the family plus the kilograms of purchased foodstuffs are multiplied by their respective nutrient scores to calculate total calories protein fat calcium iron and vitamin a total nutrients consumed by the family from all sources including donated food are summed across plant and animal food stocks and compared with minimum daily recommended amounts for adults based on the fao minimum requirements standards 49 51 3 5 stochastic simulation process simulation of the stochastic variables enables us to determine the level of risk and its mitigation using price and yield risk information 6 52 53 stochastic annual output prices for crops and livestock are simulated using multivariate empirical mve probability distributions estimated from historical data in the absence of historical data a grks probability distribution developed by gray richardson klose schuman that uses three parameters minimum a mid point and a maximum is elicited through expert consultation stochastic annual crop yields are simulated from mve probability distributions estimated using 32 years of crop yields generated by apex agricultural policy environmental extender williams et al 1998 selected ssi technologies piloted in the ilssi project are simulated by apex using the same historical weather data and plant growth parameters consistent with the assumed technologies so the only difference between the yield distributions is the technology package the baseline and alternative technology scenarios are simulated using the same equations so the only difference in the economic and nutrition outcomes are due to the technology differences the random crop yields are simulated using the same stochastic uniform standard deviates to ensure that the weather risk for a crop under the base and alternative technology scenarios are identical the same stochastic prices for crops are used for both scenarios unless the alternative scenarios call for a different marketing program 4 scenarios and technology ranking 4 1 baseline and alternative farming scenarios in farmsim modelling the user must provide information for each input variable for the baseline and alternative farming scenario appendix c two case study sites communities in northern ghana bihinaayili and zanlerigu are discussed in this study the major rain fed crops grown in bihinaayili include maize yam rice soybean and sorghum while in zanlerigu maize millet rice and groundnuts are the major rain fed crops vegetables such as corchorus amaranth and onion table 1 are grown on small plots either in a rain fed system or with minimal irrigation agricultural inputs fertilizer irrigation improved seeds were used at a minimal level in both bihinaayili and zanlerigu most farm households use their own seeds from the previous harvest use of hired agricultural labor was also low family members perform most of the agricultural tasks however cost of family labor was considered to take into account the opportunity cost of labor to capture the effects of ssi technologies the model input data yields input costs consumption cropping area for the rain fed crops were kept constant for the baseline and alternative scenarios in alternative scenarios farmer made to draw irrigation water from shallow wells ponds and rivers and use different water lifting and application methods watering can hose pipes and diesel petrol powered motorized pumps to grow three types of vegetables corchorus amaranth and onion during the dry season irrigated cropping twice per dry season on the same piece of land data on crop yields area planted and costs of inputs for the study communities are summarized in appendix d1 and appendix d2 three scenarios a baseline and two alternative scenarios are considered for both the bihinaayili and zanlerigu sites table 1 in bihinaayili irrigation water was drawn from stream while the water source for zanlerigu site is shallow ground water two important assumptions underly the alternative farming scenarios first to show the full potential economic and nutrition effects of adopting new technologies we assumed full adoption of the two scenarios described in table 1 although the data used for alternative scenarios were collected from farm households that participated in the ssi field studies we assume adoption will spread across the entire village as a result of demonstration effect second markets were assumed to be accessible to the smallholders accessibility to markets and competitive market prices depend mainly on the existence of road and market infrastructure survey data in bihinaayili show that it takes on average about 30 min walking to get to a main local market center this is a reasonably accessible market access point compared to most african rural villages only 34 of rural africa has such road access 54 the zanlerigu community is located close ca 20 min drive to the main regional marketing center of bolgatanga town 4 2 technology scenario ranking a utility based approach is used to rank the different alternative scenarios this is a preferred approach to compare alternative farming scenarios that help the decision maker in selecting among alternative farming systems based on producer risk preferences 6 55 about four utility based ranking functions are included in simetar they comprise of the stochastic dominance with respect to a function sdrf certainty equivalent ce stochastic efficiency with respect to a function serf and risk premiums rp in this study we used serf to rank the risky alternatives hardaker et al 55 merged the use of ce and meyer s range of risk aversion coefficients to create the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function method for ranking risky alternatives serf assumes a utility function in this case a negative exponential utility function with absolute risk aversion range and evaluates the ces over a range of absolute risk aversion coefficients rac between a lower rac and an upper rac the range can go from a lower rac equals zero risk neutral to an upper rac greater than zero 1 wealth for a risk averse the serf approach compares the ce of all risky alternative scenarios for all racs over the range and chooses the scenario with the highest ce at the decision maker s rac as the most preferred and summarizes the ce results in a chart any key output variable npv ncfi and ec distribution can be selected to rank alternative farming systems such as alternative irrigation technologies 5 results a baseline and two alternative scenarios were simulated and forecasted for a five year period in farmsim to evaluate ssi technologies in the two study communities cumulative distribution function cdf and probability density function pdf are presented to compare the scenarios in terms of their income and nutrition effects 5 1 economic returns the simulation results show positive average net present values npv for all the scenarios over the 5 year forecast period for the both study areas overall the npv results as illustrated by the npv cumulative distribution function cdf graph of npv appendix e and f indicate that investing in ssi technologies is economically profitable in both study sites alt 2 associated with the use of a diesel pump has the highest npv value followed by alt 1 that involves the use of a watering can tables 2 and 3 notice that the two alternative scenarios have a higher npv values than the baseline scenario the annual net cash farm income ncfi which represents the farm net profit shows similar results as that of the npv where the average profit under alt 2 is five times higher than the profit under the baseline scenario in bihinaayili and seven times higher in zanlerigu sites tables 2 and 3 the probability distribution of the ncfi illustrated by the cdf also shows the superior performance of alt 2 associated with the use of a diesel powered motor pumps in both sites figs 3 and 4 in bihinaayili site adoption of ssi increases profit by 154 under alt 1 and by 395 under alt 2 against the baseline respectively the distribution of ncfi in bihinaayili shows a 3 probability that the baseline scenario will have a negative net income loss in zanlerigu site however the scenario associated with the use of a watering can has a higher net profit than the diesel pump scenario at the 50 probability mark fig 4 in short while use of diesel pump can generate higher revenues and profit than use of a watering can and the baseline scenario this is achieved if one is ready to take a relatively high level of risk the benefit cost ratio bcr of the two alternative scenarios compared to the baseline show that both alt 1 and alt 2 have positive and greater than one for example in bihinaayili site an average bcr of 2 7 alt 1 and 2 6 alt 2 table 2 and fig 5 similarly as depicted in table 3 and fig 6 on average the bcr for the two technology scenarios in zanlerigu site is greater than one these ratios confirm the profitability and feasibility of the alternative scenarios moreover in bihinayili site the full distribution of bcr values from the cdf shows that all the values for both alternative scenarios lie to the right side of the break even line confirming a zero probability of having a bcr less than one from the 500 simulated values fig 5 however in zanlerigu site although on average alt 2 has a bcr value of greater than 1 it has a 23 probability of having a bcr less than 1 fig 6 notice that even though the profit from the diesel powered pump alt 2 is greater than twice that of the watering can irrigation alt 1 the bcr value of watering can is slightly higher than the bcr of diesel pump technology due to higher investment cost of the diesel powered motorized pump technology a similar outcome as for the bcr is observed for the irr the average irr values for alt 1 watering can and alt 2 diesel pump are respectively 0 48 and 0 46 and greater than the discount rate of 0 1 capital cost considered for this study 5 2 household food consumption and nutrition in general the adoption of agricultural technologies when properly used leads to an increase in quantity and variety of crops produced the implications on the household food consumption and nutrition however vary according to the type of crops grown and consumed moreover the surplus food can be sold and generate revenue to buy food items needed to complement the nutrition requirements the types of crops grown and consumed by the study communities comprised of mainly maize rice corchorus and soybean to which were added moderate purchases of pinto beans yam sorghum beef and milk as indicated by a household survey table 4 presents nutrition simulation results for the bihinaayili site it shows an improvement in terms of quantity intake from the baseline to the alternative scenarios for all nutrition variables calories proteins fat calcium iron and vitamin a particularly the caloric intake available for the household is relatively high 2 times higher than the average required due to large contribution in calories by the soybean consumption in addition to the cereals such as maize it is worth mentioning that maize provided the largest contribution in available quantity intake for all nutrients except vitamin a most of vitamin a nutrients came from the consumption of corchorus and milk as indicated in the baseline household survey although definitive nutrition assessment cannot be achieved based on the crops considered in the model there is a possibility of using the profit from irrigated crops to purchase complementary food needed for the household this is an income nutrition pathway as identified by ref 39 particularly in zanlerigu the calcium intake available for the household has significantly increased 5 7 times in the alternative scenarios as compared to the baseline due to large contribution in calcium intake by amaranth consumption table 5 in the past nutrition studies in developing countries using the farmsim model minimum calcium requirements have often been difficult to meet 46 one of the possible reasons for calcium deficiency in developing countries could be linked to the low consumption of animal source products such as milk meat eggs and cheese 5 3 risk analysis and technology ranking the risk levels associated with each of the alternative irrigation technologies considered in the study were ranked based stochastic efficiency with respect to a function serf values for profit at different levels of risk aversion see section 4 2 this approach further considers all levels of risk aversion for a typical decision maker from risk neutral to extremely risk averse with risk factor included in the analysis the two alternative technology scenarios perform differently in the two study sites in bihinaayili the alternative scenario associated with the diesel pump alt 2 is the most preferred scenario at all levels of risk aversion fig 7 however there is a noticeable decreasing trend of alt 2 curve as the risk aversion level increases which indicates that the decision maker is willing to take less profit to shield against the increase in risk the next most preferred scenario in bihinaayili is the watering can alt 1 its curve shows a lower decreasing rate as the risk aversion increases fig 7 this may be due to the higher investment cost for the diesel pump compared to the watering can in zanlerigu site however the alternative scenario associated with the watering can alt 1 appears to be more preferred than alt 2 associated with diesel pump at all levels of risk aversion fig 8 we notice a sharp decrease of alt 2 curve in ce values profit to zero as the level of risk aversion increases which means that extremely risk averse decision makers would opt out of using a diesel pump given its high risk of loss and high investment cost under extreme risk aversion level a typical decision maker would prefer the baseline option with a low profit to alt 2 the most preferred scenario is alt 1 which shows a smooth decline in ce values profit as the level of risk aversion increases this is a commonly expected behaviour among most smallholder farm households which are willing to take less profit in order to shield against potential risk 47 56 6 discussion and policy implications the simulation results provide decision support evidence for promoting the adoption and upscaling of the ssi technologies comparison of the economic results on watering can and motorized pump technologies shows that the former ssi technology yields a relatively higher return per unit of money invested though the latter technology performs better in terms of higher overall net profit watering can is a traditional and highly labour intensive technology households are restricted to areas they water by hand using family labor and are also limited to crops with lower crop water requirements this ultimately constrains expansion of irrigated area and could restrict the ability to meet food requirements in the market on the other hand the cost of fuel and upfront capital investment required to purchase fuel powered motorized pumps constrain widespread adoption of this technology first in general the high cost of borrowing in ghana makes the upfront investment in irrigation technologies very expensive 57 this is supported by other studies that show smallholder farmers are credit constrained in northern ghana 42 for example the inclusion in the simulation model of technology loan aimed at purchasing water lifting equipment such as a diesel powered motorized pump at 10 interest rate payable between two and five years revealed to be a feasible and profitable option however the actual interest rate on agricultural loans can be 30 or above which significantly hinders smallholder s access to credit thus innovative financing options and targeted assistance may be needed to ensure that smallholders at lower levels of economic status can access financing mechanisms 58 59 11 11 the majority of farmers that adopt ssi technologies on their own are usually wealthier upper quintile and male see 59 secondly to mitigate the impediment to ssi technology adoption that arises from high energy costs alternative energy options notably solar pumps could be a promising option this would simultaneously reduce labor cost and the operating costs associated with fossil fuel based water pumps studies have shown that agriculture labor cost in ghana is high as is the opportunity cost of labor employed in agriculture in absolute terms particularly as rural households increasingly depend on non farm activities to boost income 60 again the upfront cost of solar pumps is relatively expensive in ghana compared to fossil fuel pumps so affordable credit or innovative loan schemes need to be made available to enhance adoption another interesting result that may help in the decision making process of ssi adoption relates to higher risk in ssi technologies investment that was observed more in zanlerigu than bihinaayili community the results on ncfi scenario ranking and bcr see figs 6 8 show an extremely risky situation in zanlerigu with high variability in income and profit a close look at the simulation results show that the source of risk in zanlerigu comes mainly from the production costs of irrigated crops in particular onion production the production cost is about four times higher in zanlerigu than in bihinaayili and onion production alone represents 84 of the total cost of producing all other irrigated crops in zanlerigu irrigation labour digging wells and water application and fertilizers costs seem to be the main factors of increased onion production costs in zanlerigu farmers in bihinaayili who produced and sold corchorus as their irrigated crop experienced less risk and variability in income due to lower production costs producing crops with higher production costs such as onion may not be the best option for certain categories of farmers with limited capital investment and that need to reduce their risks such as in zanlerigu opting for growing traditional and low production cost vegetable crops such as amaranth and corchorus may be a better option for some groups of farmers diversifying production through inter cropping may also be an option to explore as for the nutrition results the production and consumption of traditional and low production cost vegetables such as amaranth resulted in significant improvements in the nutrition status especially in providing and increasing the intake of calcium past studies using the farmsim model has showed consistently calcium intake deficiency especially in ethiopia 46 a study carried out in benin reports that the deficiency of calcium intake especially for pregnant and reproductive age women is common in developing countries 61 only 5 4 of pregnant women from that study sample had adequate calcium intake we noticed a consistent deficiency in vitamin a as well although the simulation results show a modest improvement in vitamin a intake through the consumption of corchorus in bihinaayili the income pathway from irrigation to improved nutrition may become prominent to meet certain nutrient needs especially animal based food products that increase the daily intake of calcium and vitamin a 7 conclusions and recommendations the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of adopting small scale irrigation technologies on farm profitability and household nutrition in northern ghana a baseline scenario with current fertilizer application rates and no or minimal irrigation was compared to two alternative scenarios where recommended fertilizers rates and various ssi technologies were used to grow vegetable crops in selected communities in northern ghana the preferred scenario consisting of the application of recommended fertilizers in combination with the use of watering can or diesel powered motorized pumps to irrigate corchorus onions and amaranth generated high income and profits for the farm households in the study communities although in all the case studies the diesel powered pump generated the highest net income the cost benefit analysis showed the watering can provides more return on investment per unit money invested and at a lower risk level the baseline scenario was the least preferred of all three scenarios analysed increasing risk and income variability were observed more in one study community zanlerigu due to high production costs the use of a diesel powered pump in zanlerigu coupled with high fertilizer and irrigation costs revealed to be a risky option as an alternative farming scenario that can lead to the risk of profit and income losses household food consumption nutrition levels improved significantly in the two alternative scenarios compared to the baseline scenario as a result of the improvements in crop yields noticeably the calcium intake available for household increased substantially due to direct consumption of irrigated vegetables however deficiencies in fat calcium and vitamin a were observed in the two study communities the results further reveal that capital and financial constraints related to initial investment and operational costs particularly fuel cost are the key limiting factors to farmers the choice to grow low production cost vegetables using a simple watering can is less risky to farmers but at the same time generates low economic return farmers are likely to be less resilient and withstand shocks at these marginal levels however the options of using more capital intensive ssi technologies such as solar powered pumps to grow high value cash crops such as onions present a high risk due to high cost of capital enhanced access of smallholders to credit or irrigation equipment leasing arrangements may help ease this constraint and allow farmers to move from the current low input low output production to a more profitable dry season farming system to build on the findings of this study we suggest larger studies in additional communities and across a broader range of ssi technology options such as drip sprinkler gravity based system and small reservoirs in combination with various water lifting and conveyance options including solar powered pumps there is also lack of evidence on the effects of small scale irrigation using low technology tools and high labor methods on resilience including the effects of climate change and variability the impact of climate change on surface and groundwater resources and food security were not addressed in this paper but should be linked to future studies to better understand ssi as a resilience measure in addition to its potential for income effects and nutrition acknowledgements this paper was supported by the feed the future

8700,small scale irrigation ssi technologies can be useful not only to increase crop productivity and income but also as a viable adaptation practice to climate variability a farm simulation model farmsim and data from selected ssi technologies piloted in northern ghana under the feed the future innovation lab for small scale irrigation ilssi project were used to assess the economic feasibility of the ssi technologies and their potential to improve income and nutrition of smallholder farm households three dry season irrigated crops onion corchorus amaranthus grown under three agricultural water management regimes were analysed results show that adoption of the ssi technologies could increase the net farm profit by 154 608 against the baseline depending on the crop type ssi technology combination nutrition levels also improved significantly as a result of the improvements in crop yields due to irrigation and use of complementary inputs however the results further reveal that the options that utilize capital intensive ssi technologies such as solar powered water pumps to grow high value cash crops are constrained by the high investment cost currently farmers tend to choose low cost ssi technologies such as a traditional watering cans which generate low economic returns improving access to credit or alternative financing schemes could mitigate the capital constraints and enable smallholders to gain more benefits from participating in market oriented high value irrigated production keywords economic feasibility farm income ghana nutrition smallholders small scale irrigation 1 introduction limited or no access to appropriate agricultural technologies has led to low productivity and persistent food insecurity in developing countries 1 national governments and several development organizations have attempted to make agriculture more productive and profitable by introducing agricultural technologies but with modest results 2 several factors such as lack of credit access farmers risk behaviour lack of technical know how high investment and operational costs and supply chain constraints e g high transaction costs have contributed to low rate or lack of adoption of new agricultural technologies in developing countries 3 8 even where these technologies have been adopted at pilot communities the dissemination to a larger segment of the population has failed in many cases 3 the ministry of food and agriculture mofa of ghana promotes irrigation as a climate variability adaptation measure in response to the declining rainfall and increasing intermittent dry spells during the rainy season cropping period 9 informal irrigation includes small scale irrigation ssi within one of three principal irrigation systems recognized in the national irrigation development policy 2 2 www mofa gov gh site wp 07 ghana irrigation development policy1 pdf the other two irrigation categories comprise of formal irrigation one that is reliant on some form of permanent irrigation infrastructure funded by the public sector and large scale commercial irrigation system in ghana according to this policy ssi is practised by individuals who cultivate a land area of up to about 0 5 ha or more using simple structures and irrigation equipment such as buckets fuel powered motorized pumps hose pipes and watering cans water sources can include small reservoirs shallow groundwater rivers and wastewater often referred to as farmer led irrigation ssi is an irrigation system practiced on small plots using a level of technology that an individual farmer can effectively control operate and maintain 10 11 ssi continues to expand despite limited technical support or extension services to farmers in ghana 8 11 12 it employs 45 times more people and covers 20 times more land area than large scale public irrigation schemes as of 2010 an estimated 185 000 ha were under ssi benefiting 500 000 smallholder farmers 13 14 projected that the use of motorized pumps in ssi could benefit from 564 000 to 730 000 households and irrigate up to 584 000 ha in the country similar projections suggest that the use of small reservoirs could benefit up to 163 000 households and irrigate from 74 000 to 163 000 ha the main ssi technologies currently in use include watering cans handheld hose pipes and diesel or petrol powered motorized pumps drip and sprinkler irrigation are also being adopted albeit very slowly 15 16 potential also exists for the use of shallow groundwater using various water lifting conveyance and application technologies in addition to improved utilization of multi purpose small reservoirs 8 17 the rate of adoption of ssi is likely to increase demand for vegetables and fruits is growing with increases in income and changing diets of the growing middle income consumers in urban areas 18 this could provide business opportunities for producers and others engaged in small scale irrigation various out grower models are feasible for more small scale irrigators to get involved in market oriented production however sustainable adoption and scaling of various ssi technologies depend on the biophysical conditions and economic feasibility along the value chains among other factors at present there is lack of evidence on socio economic and technical factors that could promote or impede adoption of ssi in northern ghana understanding these factors could provide decision support evidence to improve the scaling pathway for ssi and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers these factors include i identification of ways to improve water use and management for farmers adopting ssi technologies ii provision of evidence for informed investment decisions by farmers and other actors in irrigated value chains iii identification of promising technologies and crop types with high financial returns that improve livelihoods and food security for smallholder farmers and iv understanding household economic and other benefits of scaling up of the ssi technologies to understand these factors in ghana the innovation laboratory for small scale irrigation ilssi 3 3 ilssi is an action oriented farmer centered research project supported by the feed the future ftf program through usaid and implemented in ghana ethiopia and tanzania it aims to investigate and understand the technical and socio economic factors constraints and opportunities of ssi technologies towards achieving sustainability and efficiency in resource utilization water land and other resources and enhance the livelihoods of smallholder farmers project field tested selected ssi technologies in a few communities in northern ghana this paper seeks to contribute to filling the knowledge gap on the economic return on investment food security effects and potential risk factors of ssi technology adoption by smallholder farm households the study aims to assess profitable and economically feasible crop type ssi technology combinations in northern ghana primary farm level data on selected ssi technologies piloted in the study communities and secondary data from government agencies were used in the analysis a farm simulation model farmsim was applied to assess the economic potential and nutritional effects of farmer investments in ssi technologies this paper is structured as follows section 2 briefly presents a review of previous studies on water resources climate change and the income and food security effects of ssi in the study area the methods including descriptions of the farm simulation farmsim modelling approach and ssi technology scenarios are then presented in sections 3 and 4 results are presented in section 5 while the last two sections contain discussions conclusion and recommendations 2 previous studies in the study area 2 1 water sources for ssi in northern ghana northern ghana is drained by the volta river system that consists of the white and black volta rivers and the oti and darka rivers in the volta basin water for irrigation is sourced from rivers groundwater and stored water in natural and built infrastructure or reservoirs 19 20 in northern ghana there are large and medium reservoirs for public sector managed irrigation schemes at tono vea golinga bontanga and libga with storage capacities ranging from 5 9 to 93 cubic megametre mm3 additionally there are more than 500 small reservoirs and over 6280 boreholes managed by communities and smallholder farmers 19 water is also stored on farm in ponds and wetlands 21 in many areas in northern ghana shallow groundwater is the farmers preferred water source 22 23 permanent shallow wells are widespread in several communities 20 though many more are re constructed each year in the dry season small reservoirs and dugouts are in high demand because they support multiple livelihood strategies including irrigation livestock production fisheries and brick fabrication 24 25 a number of multi purpose small reservoirs have been constructed in northern ghana over the past few decades appendix a though could be better managed and utilized for small scale irrigation 13 14 several studies assessed the potential for shallow groundwater development for ssi in northern ghana 17 26 drechsel and keraita 2014 8 some of these studies showed high groundwater potential in northern ghana 70 of the area was found to have moderate to high groundwater availability and 83 has medium to high groundwater accessibility 26 27 the volta river system furthermore provides a perennial source of water that could be used for year round irrigated agricultural production by smallholder farmers large floodplains created by the volta river and several of its tributaries provides a good opportunity for flood recession agriculture 4 4 this is an agricultural practice that uses residual soil moisture and nutrients left by receding flood water with or without supplementary irrigations to grow crops in the floodplains these floodplains are suitable for cultivation of high value crops such as tomatoes onions pepper and cowpea 28 63 29 2 2 effects of climate change on water availability using the soil and water assessment tool swat williams et al 18 5 5 the first author of this paper led field works data analysis draft writing and co author in ref 18 report cited here assessed the impacts of climate change on water resources and water availability for irrigation in the three regions of northern ghana the climate change scenarios were generated using global circulation model and downscaled to regional scales for the swat model simulations water yield in two time snap shots 2030 and 2050 were used the baseline simulation 1990 2010 showed that annual water yield in study area was about 29 079 mm3 while at the sub watershed level water yield ranged from less than 100 mm3 to more than 1450 mm3 simulations were conducted to estimate the spatial distribution of water yield in 2030 and 2050 fig 1 shows the water yield for the study area under four representative concentration pathways rcps simulation 6 6 simulations a and b use the projected climatic data of the canadian center for climate modelling and analysis cccma canrcm4 for rcp4 5 for 2030 and 2050 respectively while simulation c and d used the projections derived through the same regional climate model rcm for rcp8 5 for the same two time snap shots under various climate change scenarios williams et al 18 all the four rcps show annual fluctuations in water yield during the simulation period simulation results under various climate change scenarios show less than 5 changes 5 to 5 in water yields compared to baseline simulation in the region that means the overall water availability for northern ghana does not drastically change compared to the baseline under various scenarios however it should be noted that the study referred to here selected only two climate change downscaled projections which may have biased the results in a large scale study including the volta river basin lacombe et al 30 found no statistically significant trend in annual rainfall but a reduction in the amount of light rainfall 20 mm day and a delay in the onset of rainy seasons studies on the effects of climate change on hydrology of the basin 31 34 found that river flows are sensitive to rainfall variability but the studies focused on future developments of large numbers of reservoirs and did not investigate the effects of climate change on small scale irrigation a study by ref 35 on the climatic and biophysical context of the study area provides an overview of the context for agricultural water management interventions the results show no significant change in rainfall trends the present paper mainly focuses on the effects of ssi technology adoption on household economics over a short to intermediate time period moreover the relationship between climate change and water availability for small scale irrigation has not been established in a robust manner in the existing literature in the study region thus climate change scenarios and their effects on water resources for ssi were not explicitly modelled in our analysis 2 3 the effects of ssi on household income and food security studies indicate that adoption of irrigation technologies can play an important role on poverty reduction food and nutrition security and household income 3 36 irrigation can enable smallholders to engage in year round production increase yield and improve food and nutrition security smith et al 37 found that in many rural areas of the dry tropics households face chronic shortages of vegetables and fruits during the dry season and this has a direct effect on household s nutrition security access to irrigation could enable smallholder farmers produce high value crops and tailor crop types and output supply in response to local demand 38 the use of ssi technologies can help promote diversification and significantly increase returns to land and labour and reduce risk 3 more current research identifies specific pathways that link irrigation and positive nutritional outcomes 39 40 the study focused on northern ghana generally and included the northern region particularly because it has the largest number of poor people in ghana being around 1 3 million people as well as some of the greatest challenges on undernutrition 41 the north also has the highest levels of inequality therefore analyzing the potential for ssi in terms of income and nutrition is particularly important in the northern region of ghana in addition a recent study in northern ghana has shown that adoption of ssi has good potential to increase agricultural productivity and enhance food security 27 42 in most cases crops benefiting from irrigation expansion are high value vegetables grown during the dry season and their income and nutritional benefits are important for improving household livelihoods 43 a study in floodplains of the white volta river in northern ghana indicates that 60 smallholders practice dry season irrigated farming and grow leafy vegetables such as cabbage brassica oleracea var capitata okra abelmoschus esculentus corchorus corchorus olitorius amaranthus amaranthus candatus and kenaf hibiscus cannabinus 42 most of the crops grown in that area are produced by women farmers on small plots of land 0 1 ha and used for home consumption in terms of household income balana et al 42 showed that with gross margins ranging from about usd 1250 to usd 2625 per ha irrigated onion allium cepa tomato solanum lycopersicum and pepper capsicum annuum are the major cash crops and source of income for smallholder irrigators in northern ghana as the production of these crops is labour intensive over 50 the cost of production of these crops is accounted for by cost of labour ssi could provide employment opportunities for the youth and women and income for smallholder farmers to meet their cash demands including direct purchase of household staples 42 3 materials and methods 3 1 description of study areas the study was conducted in two field sites under the ilssi project in northern ghana fig 2 shows the two ilssi field intervention sites bihinaayili and zanlerigu zanlerigu and bihinaayili are located in upper east region and northern region of ghana respectively 7 7 the northern area of ghana was recently rezoned into additional administrative regions northern northeast savannah upper east and upper west however the case study sites remain within the regions noted in the paper while both field sites are located in the guinea savannah agro ecological zone zanlerigu upper east is relatively closer to the sudan and sahel agro ecological zones than bihinaayili northern region and the former receives less rainfall than the latter the ssi technologies and crop types piloted in selected farmers fields in the two communities are summarized in table 1 northern ghana is largely located within the white volta basin throughout northern ghana small water storage structures are commonly constructed to access water during the long dry season rainfed crops such as maize rice millet and sorghum and groundnut dominate agricultural production in the study area as noted above the crops produced under irrigation are mainly vegetables including tomato onion pepper okra and leafy vegetables such as lettuce hibiscus kenaf bean leaves and cabbage the two major types of land use in study sites are agricultural land 56 and forestland 43 the average annual rainfall is approximately 1 000 mm and the watershed received 75 90 of annual rainfall between may and september these weather patterns restrict rain fed cropping to a single cropping season therefore irrigation may improve agricultural production 3 2 data data for farmsim called input data describe farm assets liabilities production costs yields out prices and use of crops and livestock products for each input data the user must provide information for the current baseline and for the alternative farming systems scenarios household survey data were used to define the baseline scenario and field data collected on field site farms were used to define the inputs for the alternative farming technologies the main datasets used in this study are listed below i two household surveys on 400 farm households conducted in 2014 and 2015 by the international food policy research institute ifpri the first survey was carried under the ghana africa rising baseline evaluation survey arbes 44 8 8 https dataverse harvard edu dataset xhtml persistentid doi 10 7910 dvn qub9ut while the second was collected under the ilssi project these data were used to define the baseline scenario against which ssi technologies were evaluated ii plot level production inputs and outputs data for ilssi pilot crops corchorus onion amaranth and cowpea collected by the local project partner university of development studies over a dry cropping season in 2016 17 iii farm level inputs and outputs data collected by international water management institute iwmi researchers through direct interviews of ilssi pilot farmers in march 2017 information on prices was obtained from local agricultural inputs dealers and commodity markets 3 3 farmsim model description the farm simulation model farmsim is a monte carlo simulation model that simultaneously evaluates a baseline and alternative technologies for a farm the model is programmed in microsoft excel and utilizes the simetar add in program to estimate parameters for price and yield distributions simulate random variables estimate probability distributions for key output variables kovs and rank technologies 45 9 9 farmsim is a micro computer excel simetar driven enhanced version of flipsim designed to simulate smallholder farms in developing countries flipsim has been used extensively for policy analysis and technology assessment for farms in the united states 62 farmsim is programmed to recursively simulate a five year planning horizon for a diversified crop and livestock farm and repeats the five year planning horizon for 500 iterations 10 10 extensive testing with the latin hypercube sampling procedure in simetar has shown that a sample size of 500 iterations is more than adequate to estimate a probability distribution for kovs in a business model with more than 100 random variables a new sample of random values is drawn to simulate each iteration after simulation the resulting 500 values for each of the kovs defines the empirical probability distributions for comparing the base and alternative farming technologies or interventions by comparing the probability distributions for the base and alternative technologies decision makers can quantitatively analyse the probable consequences of introducing alternative technologies the farmsim model has four major components crop livestock nutritional and financial the organizational and operational structure flow chart of farmsim is presented in appendix c farmsim is programmed to simulate up to 15 crops as well as livestock cattle dairy sheep goats chickens and swine annually for five years the farm household is modelled as the first claimant for crop and livestock production with deficit food production met through food purchases using net cash income from selling surplus crops and livestock production standard accounting procedures are used to calculate receipts expenses net cash income and annual cash flows the kovs for the model can include all endogenous variables in the model but most attention is focused on annual net cash income annual ending cash reserves net present value npv benefit cost ratio bcr internal rate of return irr and annual household nutrient consumption of protein calories fat calcium iron and vitamin a a detailed description of the farmsim model is presented in refs 6 46 3 4 economic feasibility assessment the net present value npv internal rate of return irr and the benefit cost ratio bcr are the key criteria used to assess the profitability of ssi technologies that involve capital investment in terms of water storage facility and pumping machines 47 48 npv is defined as the difference between the total sum of the present value of benefit streams and that of cost streams over the life of the project projects with positive npv are accepted while projects with negative npv are rejected the irr is the discount rate that generates a zero npv value if its irr exceeds the cost of capital i e the return from the capital if invested elsewhere a project is accepted and if the irr is less than the cost of capital the project is not recommended the bcr is the ratio of the present value of the benefits to the present value of the costs if this ratio is greater than one the project is recommended in addition to the economic variables farmsim simulates nutrition variables in terms of daily minimum requirements per adult equivalent to determine excess or deficiency in nutrient intake in the nutrition simulation the total kilograms of each raised crop consumed by the family plus the kilograms of purchased foodstuffs are multiplied by their respective nutrient scores to calculate total calories protein fat calcium iron and vitamin a total nutrients consumed by the family from all sources including donated food are summed across plant and animal food stocks and compared with minimum daily recommended amounts for adults based on the fao minimum requirements standards 49 51 3 5 stochastic simulation process simulation of the stochastic variables enables us to determine the level of risk and its mitigation using price and yield risk information 6 52 53 stochastic annual output prices for crops and livestock are simulated using multivariate empirical mve probability distributions estimated from historical data in the absence of historical data a grks probability distribution developed by gray richardson klose schuman that uses three parameters minimum a mid point and a maximum is elicited through expert consultation stochastic annual crop yields are simulated from mve probability distributions estimated using 32 years of crop yields generated by apex agricultural policy environmental extender williams et al 1998 selected ssi technologies piloted in the ilssi project are simulated by apex using the same historical weather data and plant growth parameters consistent with the assumed technologies so the only difference between the yield distributions is the technology package the baseline and alternative technology scenarios are simulated using the same equations so the only difference in the economic and nutrition outcomes are due to the technology differences the random crop yields are simulated using the same stochastic uniform standard deviates to ensure that the weather risk for a crop under the base and alternative technology scenarios are identical the same stochastic prices for crops are used for both scenarios unless the alternative scenarios call for a different marketing program 4 scenarios and technology ranking 4 1 baseline and alternative farming scenarios in farmsim modelling the user must provide information for each input variable for the baseline and alternative farming scenario appendix c two case study sites communities in northern ghana bihinaayili and zanlerigu are discussed in this study the major rain fed crops grown in bihinaayili include maize yam rice soybean and sorghum while in zanlerigu maize millet rice and groundnuts are the major rain fed crops vegetables such as corchorus amaranth and onion table 1 are grown on small plots either in a rain fed system or with minimal irrigation agricultural inputs fertilizer irrigation improved seeds were used at a minimal level in both bihinaayili and zanlerigu most farm households use their own seeds from the previous harvest use of hired agricultural labor was also low family members perform most of the agricultural tasks however cost of family labor was considered to take into account the opportunity cost of labor to capture the effects of ssi technologies the model input data yields input costs consumption cropping area for the rain fed crops were kept constant for the baseline and alternative scenarios in alternative scenarios farmer made to draw irrigation water from shallow wells ponds and rivers and use different water lifting and application methods watering can hose pipes and diesel petrol powered motorized pumps to grow three types of vegetables corchorus amaranth and onion during the dry season irrigated cropping twice per dry season on the same piece of land data on crop yields area planted and costs of inputs for the study communities are summarized in appendix d1 and appendix d2 three scenarios a baseline and two alternative scenarios are considered for both the bihinaayili and zanlerigu sites table 1 in bihinaayili irrigation water was drawn from stream while the water source for zanlerigu site is shallow ground water two important assumptions underly the alternative farming scenarios first to show the full potential economic and nutrition effects of adopting new technologies we assumed full adoption of the two scenarios described in table 1 although the data used for alternative scenarios were collected from farm households that participated in the ssi field studies we assume adoption will spread across the entire village as a result of demonstration effect second markets were assumed to be accessible to the smallholders accessibility to markets and competitive market prices depend mainly on the existence of road and market infrastructure survey data in bihinaayili show that it takes on average about 30 min walking to get to a main local market center this is a reasonably accessible market access point compared to most african rural villages only 34 of rural africa has such road access 54 the zanlerigu community is located close ca 20 min drive to the main regional marketing center of bolgatanga town 4 2 technology scenario ranking a utility based approach is used to rank the different alternative scenarios this is a preferred approach to compare alternative farming scenarios that help the decision maker in selecting among alternative farming systems based on producer risk preferences 6 55 about four utility based ranking functions are included in simetar they comprise of the stochastic dominance with respect to a function sdrf certainty equivalent ce stochastic efficiency with respect to a function serf and risk premiums rp in this study we used serf to rank the risky alternatives hardaker et al 55 merged the use of ce and meyer s range of risk aversion coefficients to create the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function method for ranking risky alternatives serf assumes a utility function in this case a negative exponential utility function with absolute risk aversion range and evaluates the ces over a range of absolute risk aversion coefficients rac between a lower rac and an upper rac the range can go from a lower rac equals zero risk neutral to an upper rac greater than zero 1 wealth for a risk averse the serf approach compares the ce of all risky alternative scenarios for all racs over the range and chooses the scenario with the highest ce at the decision maker s rac as the most preferred and summarizes the ce results in a chart any key output variable npv ncfi and ec distribution can be selected to rank alternative farming systems such as alternative irrigation technologies 5 results a baseline and two alternative scenarios were simulated and forecasted for a five year period in farmsim to evaluate ssi technologies in the two study communities cumulative distribution function cdf and probability density function pdf are presented to compare the scenarios in terms of their income and nutrition effects 5 1 economic returns the simulation results show positive average net present values npv for all the scenarios over the 5 year forecast period for the both study areas overall the npv results as illustrated by the npv cumulative distribution function cdf graph of npv appendix e and f indicate that investing in ssi technologies is economically profitable in both study sites alt 2 associated with the use of a diesel pump has the highest npv value followed by alt 1 that involves the use of a watering can tables 2 and 3 notice that the two alternative scenarios have a higher npv values than the baseline scenario the annual net cash farm income ncfi which represents the farm net profit shows similar results as that of the npv where the average profit under alt 2 is five times higher than the profit under the baseline scenario in bihinaayili and seven times higher in zanlerigu sites tables 2 and 3 the probability distribution of the ncfi illustrated by the cdf also shows the superior performance of alt 2 associated with the use of a diesel powered motor pumps in both sites figs 3 and 4 in bihinaayili site adoption of ssi increases profit by 154 under alt 1 and by 395 under alt 2 against the baseline respectively the distribution of ncfi in bihinaayili shows a 3 probability that the baseline scenario will have a negative net income loss in zanlerigu site however the scenario associated with the use of a watering can has a higher net profit than the diesel pump scenario at the 50 probability mark fig 4 in short while use of diesel pump can generate higher revenues and profit than use of a watering can and the baseline scenario this is achieved if one is ready to take a relatively high level of risk the benefit cost ratio bcr of the two alternative scenarios compared to the baseline show that both alt 1 and alt 2 have positive and greater than one for example in bihinaayili site an average bcr of 2 7 alt 1 and 2 6 alt 2 table 2 and fig 5 similarly as depicted in table 3 and fig 6 on average the bcr for the two technology scenarios in zanlerigu site is greater than one these ratios confirm the profitability and feasibility of the alternative scenarios moreover in bihinayili site the full distribution of bcr values from the cdf shows that all the values for both alternative scenarios lie to the right side of the break even line confirming a zero probability of having a bcr less than one from the 500 simulated values fig 5 however in zanlerigu site although on average alt 2 has a bcr value of greater than 1 it has a 23 probability of having a bcr less than 1 fig 6 notice that even though the profit from the diesel powered pump alt 2 is greater than twice that of the watering can irrigation alt 1 the bcr value of watering can is slightly higher than the bcr of diesel pump technology due to higher investment cost of the diesel powered motorized pump technology a similar outcome as for the bcr is observed for the irr the average irr values for alt 1 watering can and alt 2 diesel pump are respectively 0 48 and 0 46 and greater than the discount rate of 0 1 capital cost considered for this study 5 2 household food consumption and nutrition in general the adoption of agricultural technologies when properly used leads to an increase in quantity and variety of crops produced the implications on the household food consumption and nutrition however vary according to the type of crops grown and consumed moreover the surplus food can be sold and generate revenue to buy food items needed to complement the nutrition requirements the types of crops grown and consumed by the study communities comprised of mainly maize rice corchorus and soybean to which were added moderate purchases of pinto beans yam sorghum beef and milk as indicated by a household survey table 4 presents nutrition simulation results for the bihinaayili site it shows an improvement in terms of quantity intake from the baseline to the alternative scenarios for all nutrition variables calories proteins fat calcium iron and vitamin a particularly the caloric intake available for the household is relatively high 2 times higher than the average required due to large contribution in calories by the soybean consumption in addition to the cereals such as maize it is worth mentioning that maize provided the largest contribution in available quantity intake for all nutrients except vitamin a most of vitamin a nutrients came from the consumption of corchorus and milk as indicated in the baseline household survey although definitive nutrition assessment cannot be achieved based on the crops considered in the model there is a possibility of using the profit from irrigated crops to purchase complementary food needed for the household this is an income nutrition pathway as identified by ref 39 particularly in zanlerigu the calcium intake available for the household has significantly increased 5 7 times in the alternative scenarios as compared to the baseline due to large contribution in calcium intake by amaranth consumption table 5 in the past nutrition studies in developing countries using the farmsim model minimum calcium requirements have often been difficult to meet 46 one of the possible reasons for calcium deficiency in developing countries could be linked to the low consumption of animal source products such as milk meat eggs and cheese 5 3 risk analysis and technology ranking the risk levels associated with each of the alternative irrigation technologies considered in the study were ranked based stochastic efficiency with respect to a function serf values for profit at different levels of risk aversion see section 4 2 this approach further considers all levels of risk aversion for a typical decision maker from risk neutral to extremely risk averse with risk factor included in the analysis the two alternative technology scenarios perform differently in the two study sites in bihinaayili the alternative scenario associated with the diesel pump alt 2 is the most preferred scenario at all levels of risk aversion fig 7 however there is a noticeable decreasing trend of alt 2 curve as the risk aversion level increases which indicates that the decision maker is willing to take less profit to shield against the increase in risk the next most preferred scenario in bihinaayili is the watering can alt 1 its curve shows a lower decreasing rate as the risk aversion increases fig 7 this may be due to the higher investment cost for the diesel pump compared to the watering can in zanlerigu site however the alternative scenario associated with the watering can alt 1 appears to be more preferred than alt 2 associated with diesel pump at all levels of risk aversion fig 8 we notice a sharp decrease of alt 2 curve in ce values profit to zero as the level of risk aversion increases which means that extremely risk averse decision makers would opt out of using a diesel pump given its high risk of loss and high investment cost under extreme risk aversion level a typical decision maker would prefer the baseline option with a low profit to alt 2 the most preferred scenario is alt 1 which shows a smooth decline in ce values profit as the level of risk aversion increases this is a commonly expected behaviour among most smallholder farm households which are willing to take less profit in order to shield against potential risk 47 56 6 discussion and policy implications the simulation results provide decision support evidence for promoting the adoption and upscaling of the ssi technologies comparison of the economic results on watering can and motorized pump technologies shows that the former ssi technology yields a relatively higher return per unit of money invested though the latter technology performs better in terms of higher overall net profit watering can is a traditional and highly labour intensive technology households are restricted to areas they water by hand using family labor and are also limited to crops with lower crop water requirements this ultimately constrains expansion of irrigated area and could restrict the ability to meet food requirements in the market on the other hand the cost of fuel and upfront capital investment required to purchase fuel powered motorized pumps constrain widespread adoption of this technology first in general the high cost of borrowing in ghana makes the upfront investment in irrigation technologies very expensive 57 this is supported by other studies that show smallholder farmers are credit constrained in northern ghana 42 for example the inclusion in the simulation model of technology loan aimed at purchasing water lifting equipment such as a diesel powered motorized pump at 10 interest rate payable between two and five years revealed to be a feasible and profitable option however the actual interest rate on agricultural loans can be 30 or above which significantly hinders smallholder s access to credit thus innovative financing options and targeted assistance may be needed to ensure that smallholders at lower levels of economic status can access financing mechanisms 58 59 11 11 the majority of farmers that adopt ssi technologies on their own are usually wealthier upper quintile and male see 59 secondly to mitigate the impediment to ssi technology adoption that arises from high energy costs alternative energy options notably solar pumps could be a promising option this would simultaneously reduce labor cost and the operating costs associated with fossil fuel based water pumps studies have shown that agriculture labor cost in ghana is high as is the opportunity cost of labor employed in agriculture in absolute terms particularly as rural households increasingly depend on non farm activities to boost income 60 again the upfront cost of solar pumps is relatively expensive in ghana compared to fossil fuel pumps so affordable credit or innovative loan schemes need to be made available to enhance adoption another interesting result that may help in the decision making process of ssi adoption relates to higher risk in ssi technologies investment that was observed more in zanlerigu than bihinaayili community the results on ncfi scenario ranking and bcr see figs 6 8 show an extremely risky situation in zanlerigu with high variability in income and profit a close look at the simulation results show that the source of risk in zanlerigu comes mainly from the production costs of irrigated crops in particular onion production the production cost is about four times higher in zanlerigu than in bihinaayili and onion production alone represents 84 of the total cost of producing all other irrigated crops in zanlerigu irrigation labour digging wells and water application and fertilizers costs seem to be the main factors of increased onion production costs in zanlerigu farmers in bihinaayili who produced and sold corchorus as their irrigated crop experienced less risk and variability in income due to lower production costs producing crops with higher production costs such as onion may not be the best option for certain categories of farmers with limited capital investment and that need to reduce their risks such as in zanlerigu opting for growing traditional and low production cost vegetable crops such as amaranth and corchorus may be a better option for some groups of farmers diversifying production through inter cropping may also be an option to explore as for the nutrition results the production and consumption of traditional and low production cost vegetables such as amaranth resulted in significant improvements in the nutrition status especially in providing and increasing the intake of calcium past studies using the farmsim model has showed consistently calcium intake deficiency especially in ethiopia 46 a study carried out in benin reports that the deficiency of calcium intake especially for pregnant and reproductive age women is common in developing countries 61 only 5 4 of pregnant women from that study sample had adequate calcium intake we noticed a consistent deficiency in vitamin a as well although the simulation results show a modest improvement in vitamin a intake through the consumption of corchorus in bihinaayili the income pathway from irrigation to improved nutrition may become prominent to meet certain nutrient needs especially animal based food products that increase the daily intake of calcium and vitamin a 7 conclusions and recommendations the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of adopting small scale irrigation technologies on farm profitability and household nutrition in northern ghana a baseline scenario with current fertilizer application rates and no or minimal irrigation was compared to two alternative scenarios where recommended fertilizers rates and various ssi technologies were used to grow vegetable crops in selected communities in northern ghana the preferred scenario consisting of the application of recommended fertilizers in combination with the use of watering can or diesel powered motorized pumps to irrigate corchorus onions and amaranth generated high income and profits for the farm households in the study communities although in all the case studies the diesel powered pump generated the highest net income the cost benefit analysis showed the watering can provides more return on investment per unit money invested and at a lower risk level the baseline scenario was the least preferred of all three scenarios analysed increasing risk and income variability were observed more in one study community zanlerigu due to high production costs the use of a diesel powered pump in zanlerigu coupled with high fertilizer and irrigation costs revealed to be a risky option as an alternative farming scenario that can lead to the risk of profit and income losses household food consumption nutrition levels improved significantly in the two alternative scenarios compared to the baseline scenario as a result of the improvements in crop yields noticeably the calcium intake available for household increased substantially due to direct consumption of irrigated vegetables however deficiencies in fat calcium and vitamin a were observed in the two study communities the results further reveal that capital and financial constraints related to initial investment and operational costs particularly fuel cost are the key limiting factors to farmers the choice to grow low production cost vegetables using a simple watering can is less risky to farmers but at the same time generates low economic return farmers are likely to be less resilient and withstand shocks at these marginal levels however the options of using more capital intensive ssi technologies such as solar powered pumps to grow high value cash crops such as onions present a high risk due to high cost of capital enhanced access of smallholders to credit or irrigation equipment leasing arrangements may help ease this constraint and allow farmers to move from the current low input low output production to a more profitable dry season farming system to build on the findings of this study we suggest larger studies in additional communities and across a broader range of ssi technology options such as drip sprinkler gravity based system and small reservoirs in combination with various water lifting and conveyance options including solar powered pumps there is also lack of evidence on the effects of small scale irrigation using low technology tools and high labor methods on resilience including the effects of climate change and variability the impact of climate change on surface and groundwater resources and food security were not addressed in this paper but should be linked to future studies to better understand ssi as a resilience measure in addition to its potential for income effects and nutrition acknowledgements this paper was supported by the feed the future

8701,past studies have estimated residential demand for water and electricity in isolation but these goods are often used as joint inputs in household production activities as such separately estimating electricity and water demand may lead to biased demand parameter estimates if prices are positively correlated and goods are complements ignoring cross price effects will exaggerate own price elasticity estimates leading to inaccurate revenue and conservation forecasts moreover understanding the water electricity demand relationship will allow for synergistic conservation strategies we propose a joint estimation procedure using 3 stage least squares fixed effects 3sls fe to highlight linkages between water and electricity and conclude that water demand in particular appears less own price elastic when cross prices are included in the demand system results from our study region suggest that water and electricity are gross complements with an average cross price elasticity of approximately 0 1 a simple simulation is included to highlight how omitting cross price elasticities may lead to inaccurate forecasting and suboptimal decisions keywords energy water nexus residential utilities electricity demand water demand 1 introduction the relationship between water and energy is well documented in the water use cycle 1 3 most of this work implicitly focuses on the supply side relationship of energy and water where energy production requires non trivial amounts of water for cooling and other activities and considerable amounts of energy are used to treat and deliver water 4 6 in california for example water related activities account for 13 19 of total electricity use where 5 4 of total use occurs in the home 3 7 beyond monetary costs energy consumption associated with water treatment and delivery supply side linkages also produces significant co2 emissions 7 estimate that the urban water cycle accounts for 4 of total per capita emissions in the state of california while 8 estimate that mandatory water restrictions in the state saved 1830 gwh of electricity and reduced co2 emissions by 521 000 metric tons yet despite the well documented production relationship less is known about demand side end use linkages between electricity and water given the environmental goals of many cities and the high costs associated with expanding energy and water supply capacities understanding the impact of demand side management on household consumption of water and electricity can lead to better holistic decision making therefore we use household level billing data to jointly estimate household demand for electricity and water in order to quantify the empirical importance of demand side price linkages between the two goods in this paper a conceptual model of behavior is developed to describe household demand for water and electricity as intermediate inputs herein referred to as inputs in the production of household goods and services herein referred to as household services ultimately whether water and electricity are substitutes or complements depends on their relationship in the production of household services and the demand relationship for those services neither of which are directly observed by the utility managers results from the jointly estimated demand equations are compared to estimates of own price elasticities when water and electricity are estimated in isolation this comparison allows us to identify the size of potential omitted variable bias created when complementarity is ignored in addition to using a 3 stage least squares 3sls model to jointly estimate water and electricity consumption which has rarely been used in this context this paper provides two practical contributions to the literature first to the extent that water and electricity prices are correlated ignoring the linkages across these inputs leads to biased parameter estimates 9 if prices are correlated and goods are complements as we hypothesize ignoring cross price effects will exaggerate the size of own price elasticity 1 1 for example if water and electricity are complementary in consumption when both prices increase water demand falls as a direct response to its price and in response to the higher electricity price a model of water consumption including only its own price would overestimate the marginal effect of water price because the water price coefficient also includes the decrease in water use from the cross price effect this inaccuracy can lead to inaccurate demand forecasts if the current relationship between prices does not hold under future conditions second a better understanding of the demand side linkages between electricity and water can lead to improved resource management and planning for example water targeted conservation programs may be part of a broader effort to manage demand for energy by reducing electricity consumption and its associated carbon emissions 1 1 water and electricity demand side linkages while work investigating the demand side linkages of electricity and water is sparse there are notable exceptions to our knowledge and affirmed by ref 10 only one study empirically estimates household cross price elasticities of demand for electricity and water concluding that these inputs are mild complements with a cross price elasticity of 0 2 11 2 2 two additional studies exist as grey literature which attempt to quantify the water electricity gas relationship 53 54 additionally the relationship between electricity and natural gas which are more clearly substitutes for one another has been estimated in numerous studies 55 56 and investigations into own price elasticity of each input in isolation are prolific in his study hansen uses a household production model where danish households produce household services that require water and energy inputs and household services that only require one of the two while his own price elasticity estimates are somewhat low compared to others findings 12 14 it may be that household demand in denmark circa 1996 differs substantially from demand in other contexts alternatively the relatively low estimate could suggest that correcting for cross prices reduces the elasticity of own price estimates since omitting complementary goods with correlated prices will likely bias own price estimates upward herein we expect to find a similar result beyond empirically estimating cross price elasticities other attempts have been made to evaluate the demand relationship between electricity and water however these attempts largely entail the supply side relationship or impose rational decisions to minimize cost 10 15 while these approaches are useful they are difficult to validate and may not capture income and substitution effects while our analysis does not allow us to separately identify substitution and income effects we do observe the aggregate effect of real households making monthly consumption decision in this vein 16 use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the spill over effects of home water reports on energy use and conclude that water conservation instruments reduce summertime electricity use by between 1 3 and 2 2 again suggesting that these inputs are complements although price is not explicitly included in their experimental design residential water elasticity estimates in the literature range from 0 1 to 1 8 13 while electricity demand elasticity has been estimated between 0 004 and 2 01 with the bulk of estimates around 0 3 17 beyond elasticity residential water demand has been the focus of considerable research including determining the effects of socio demographic characteristics beliefs and motivations 18 20 demand forecasting based on land use weather and climate predictions 21 22 and non price alternative demand management efficacy 23 similar analyses have been conducted for energy demand 24 28 while each of these studies further elucidates the demand for water or electricity this paper analyze the demand for water and electricity as functions of one another 1 2 conceptualizing water and electricity in a household producer consumer model to motivate the empirical analysis of this paper we assume that households maximize utility by choosing quantities of electricity and water as part of a household producer consumer optimization problem 29 for simplicity assume that households derive utility from a market good x that requires neither electricity e nor water w household services that require only water wo only electricity eo water and electricity as substitutes wes or water and electricity as complements wec a household determines the optimal level of x e w wo eo wes and wec subject to a budget and time constraint as well as the production functions relating water and electricity to the produced household services since the quantity of household services consumed equals the quantity produced the solution to this problem consists of an optimal quantity of market goods water and electricity consumed in the household unfortunately the quantity of electricity and water used in each service is unobserved by the utility manager and econometrician therefore for each household we only observe the sum of water and electricity used across the four services w and e respectively in this framework one has a finite budget to produce household services ignoring all other market goods for the moment this budget is split among services demanded by the household a dishwasher or washing machine for instance provides cleaning services and requires both water and electricity thus using either appliance creates a wec service and an increase in either water or electricity price increases the cost of this service lighting by comparison is an eo service whose price increases with electricity price but is unaffected by a change in water price importantly while the prices of eo services do not change with water price their relative price does the same phenomenon is true for every service such that demand for inputs water and electricity cannot be estimated accurately in isolation consider the ways in which an increase in the price of electricity affects the solution to the household producer consumer problem ceteris paribus an increase in electricity price increases production costs for eo wec and possibly wes services which leads to a higher shadow price for these services if eo and wo services are complements in demand we expect an increase in the shadow price of eo services to reduce the consumption of wo services if eo and wo services are substitutes we expect individuals to substitute away from eo services into wo services however the increased shadow prices of eo and wec services also have an associated income effect which may reduce the overall consumption of wo goods assuming they are normal goods similar rationale can be applied to wes and wec ultimately the direction and size of the cross price effects of water and electricity depend on their production relationship in creating household services and the consumption relationship of those services from the preceding thought experiment it is clear that the theoretical relationship between electricity and water in a household producer consumer model is ambiguous such that an empirical approach is necessary to sign and estimate cross price elasticities the empirical methods used to elucidate this relationship are described in the next section 2 methods first traditional two stage least squares 2sls models of water and electricity demand are replicated then a three stage least squares 3sls method is used to simultaneously estimate electricity and water demand accounting for cross price linkages and correlated error terms across demand equations instrumenting for price is required both in the isolated and jointly estimated demand models in order to control for the simultaneity of average price and consumption quantities of each good 2sls models are commonly used because traditional ordinary least squares ols methods that regress water or electricity quantity on price cannot be interpreted as a causal impact of price on demand when increasing block rates ibr exist 30 ibr pricing creates an average and marginal price that depends on the quantity of the good used creating simultaneity which violates a necessary assumption for unbiased estimation 9 ibr s were generally introduced as a conservation tool in which the marginal price of an additional unit of water or electricity increases with its use thus creating an endogeneity issue in which price is a function of quantity and vice versa 26 31 32 while the traditional solution instrumenting for price via 2sls ameliorates endogeneity concerns much of this work estimates demand elasticities for electricity or water in isolation which may introduce another source of bias since these goods are often used jointly as inputs into household services a second complication in estimating demand is determining the price signal to which customers respond and thus the variable for which we must instrument 3 3 some authors suggest that the theoretically consistent approach is to include a term for both marginal price and a block difference term 57 59 others use perceived price 60 or average variable price 18 other researchers have found that the mere presence of an ibr decreases consumption regardless of price 61 while other work suggests that the tractability of the unit price displayed on the bill significantly affects individuals responses 62 average price is used in this analysis for both electricity and water bills based on ito s 26 findings that consumers respond to average price rather than marginal or expected marginal price additionally and in line with past studies lagged price is used because it is the price signal consumers receive such that the perceived average price for a month is that of the previous month s bill 13 26 67 the final complication identified in the literature is one of unobserved heterogeneity across households 33 previous work and intuition suggest that houses are significantly different in their demand for water or electricity these differences may be explained by age of home appliance efficiency environmental motivations number of occupants etc while some of these factors can be included as control variables it is unlikely that the econometrician observes all relevant household characteristics thus to account for the omission of unobserved household characteristics a fixed effects fe approach is used in both the 2sls and 3sls models to average out household level effects consistent with methods commonly used with panel data in the water electricity demand literature 34 36 despite the possibility of inefficient estimates fe is preferred to random effects re because re requires the stringent assumption that each random effect is uncorrelated with all explanatory variables in each time period by comparison fe models estimate deviations in each period from the household s average consumption over time while this method prevents us from estimating the effects of time invariant characteristics it does not impede the goal of this paper to estimate the own and cross price elasticities of water and electricity in household demand 2 1 two stage fe least squares estimation the 2sls method estimates the impact of price on the quantity demanded for each input in two independent models we begin with this method to obtain estimates for comparison in order to determine the impact of jointly modeling electricity e and water w demand let y i t j be the log of demand for input j e w by household i in period t and y i j be the average log of demand for each individual across all periods the 2sls fe specification used in this analysis postulates that y i t j depends on the log average price of input j on last month s bill p i t 1 j days of service in bill period t l i t j total precipitation experienced by household i in time t r i t j average daily temperature c i t j wildfire actively burning f t and a vector of dummies for the month in which the bill was issued m t average temperature was calculated as max daily temperature plus minimum temperature divided by 2 summed across the bill period and divided by the days of service in that bill period l i t we also include the interaction of weather variables with a dummy variable for summer months s t to account for the dependence of outdoor water use on weather patterns in the irrigation season lastly a dummy variable was included to account for the high park fire which burned 87 000 acres just west of town in the summer of 2012 during the fire citizens were cautioned to stay indoors to avoid ash and smoke which likely increased energy use via ac and air purification systems the presence of fire may also affect water consumption but the mechanism and direction of the affect is less clear staying indoors during the fire may increase indoor water use but it may also decrease lawn and garden watering let y i t j be the deviation of log demand for each household in each period from average demand y i t j y i t j y i j prices p i t j precipitation r i t j temperature c i t j and dummy variables m t f t s t are each calculated similarly such that each variable represents that periods deviation from household i s mean across all periods given the above household i s demand for service j in time t can be expressed as 1 y i t j β 0 j p i t 1 j β 1 j l i t j β 2 j r i t j β 3 j c i t j β 4 j s t r i t j β 5 j s t c i t j β 6 j f t m t ϕ j ε i t j where β j s and ϕ j s are coefficients to be estimated and ε i t j represents random error price is instrumented in the first stage by regressing p i t 1 j on all exogenous variables from the second stage as well as mean differenced price of block one for each input ρ t 1 j and the days of service for the corresponding bill l i t 2 j because rates are determined by city council and the days of service for each bill vary over time and are largely determined randomly by the utility billing cycle both variables are correlated with average price but exogenous to the household and uncorrelated with ε i t j further since price and quantities consumed are expressed in logs the estimated coefficients on prices represent an estimate of own price elasticities these 2sls fe estimates provide a benchmark with which to compare the estimates of the joint model described below 2 2 three stage fe least squares estimation while the 2sls fe method is conventionally used in the literature if c o r r p e p w 0 2sls elasticity estimates from models that omit cross prices are erroneous therefore we model water and electricity demand as a system of equations which estimates water and energy consumption jointly as a function of both input prices while allowing for correlation of error terms across demand equations the 3sls fe model developed herein simultaneously estimates the demand for electricity and water 4 4 2sls estimation including prices for both inputs would provide similar results but it would be less efficient than the 3sls model similar to the 2sls we use rate dummy variables and lagged days of service as instruments for price in each equation 5 5 see ref 63 for a formal presentation of the model s identification requirements and assumptions the model simultaneously estimates the following four equations with variables defined identically to those used in the 2sls fe model 2 y i t w β 0 w p i t 1 w β 1 w p i t 1 e β 2 w l i t w β 3 w r i t w β 4 w c i t w β 5 w s t r i t w β 6 w s t c i

w ρ t 1 w γ 2 j l i t 2 w ν i t w 5 p i t 1 e γ i 0 e γ 1 e ρ t 1 e γ 2 j l i t 2 e ν i t e note that days of service l i t j precipitation r i t j and temperature c i t j are specific to the bill period and may vary if the bill period for water and electricity differs 6 6 the sample was limited to observations with bill dates within three days of one another some observations did not have similar bill periods for water and electricity and were excluded from the sample because we cannot determine the cause of this discrepancy additional cleaning was also necessary to remove extreme values and obvious errors frequency plots and the logged mean of consumption remain similar before and after cleaning changing by less than 0 4 the specific cleaning rules can be provided upon request 2 3 data and parameterization this section describes the data used to estimate both the 2sls fe and the 3sls fe models described above and provides a brief explanation of the billing structure the analysis avoids censored data complications associated with demand studies that include zero quantities of particular goods 37 38 by dropping any observation with zero consumption for either water or electricity homes without utility consumption are likely vacant or indicate a billing error and are not indicative of household demand this decision should not meaningfully affect our results so long as home vacancies within a season are random in nature 7 7 across the raw data the percent of vacant homes to homes using power or water remains relatively constant across months at approximately 1 we found no evidence that house characteristics are meaningfully correlated with these vacancies consistent with previous studies 13 17 weather is modeled as a primary driver of deviations in demand total monthly precipitation and average mean daily temperature over each billing cycle were calculated using data from ref 39 daily weather data were match to each billing period to create total precipitation and average daily temperature variables for each household in each bill period billing records from a large utility in colorado provide data on monthly electricity and water consumption and bill amounts for roughly 22 000 households with relatively complete billing records at least 36 monthly bills over the period 2006 2014 bills with fewer than 25 days or more than 35 were excluded because we could not identify why these anomalies occurred 8 8 anecdotally the utility believes that the use of smart meters has essentially randomized the billing cycle across households since meters are no longer read neighborhood by neighborhood and that billing period should be approximately 30 days additionally billing accounts with more than two associated taps were excluded since this feature may indicate landlords or rentals that do not directly receive bills the period of our sample includes significant price variation with twelve changes in rate structure five in water pricing and seven in electricity a summary of the annual rate structures is provided in table 1 for water the ibr structure includes three blocks with incremental increases in price block price thresholds were set at 7 000gal and 13 000gal for the entire period of our sample prices increased for each block across the years in our sample for example block prices in 2006 were 1 87 2 15 2 48 per thousand gallons in block one two and three respectively by 2014 these prices increased to 2 38 2 74 and 3 15 respectively 9 9 because billing method and price perceptions may affect consumption decisions 62 it is worth noting that bills from the utility present line item sub totals by water and electricity tier and new charges this billing period in bold at the bottom of the bill after 2011 electricity prices exhibit a similar upward trend although for 2006 to 2011 block pricing was not in place each block price was given the same value for this period in our model block price thresholds were 500 kwh and 1000 kwh for the years in which they exist however the price at each block varied between summer june to september and winter october to may months for example in 2014 summer block prices were 0 0896 0 106 and 0 140 per kwh in summer but decreased to 0 0824 0 0864 and 0 0951 in winter months fig 1 illustrates average monthly consumption for electricity and water over the period of observation note that both water and electricity use have slight downward trends water has one large peak in summer and electricity consumption peaks both in winter and in summer fig 2 illustrates average monthly total bills for water and electricity note that electricity bills were increasing during this time while water bills remained relatively flat summary statistics for variables used in the analysis are presented in table 2 average per capita per day consumption is approximately 120 gallons and 320 kwh for water and electricity respectively assuming 2 4 persons per household 3

columns 1 2 as well as the coefficients estimated jointly using the system of equations presented in section 2 columns 3 4 10 10 while equations 2 5 represent the model used in our analysis results presented in table 3 many specifications were tested for robustness qualitative results remain consistent across model specifications although the relative size of own price elasticity ranged from 0 42 to 0 69 for water and 0 10 and 0 26 for electricity for cross prices water demand ranged from 0 15 to 0 30 and electricity demand ranged from 0 05 to 0 20 results from a full set of specifications can be made available upon request for all models we report bootstrapped standard errors clustered at the household level to allow for potential dependence across time consistent with expectations we find a moderate correlation between electricity and water price ρ p w p e 0 32 and results from table 3 suggest that water and electricity are related such that demand for each responds to a price change of the other electricity and water are gross complements 11 11 for a more detailed discussion of gross versus net complements see ref 64 although cross price elasticities are relatively small in magnitude water demand is moderately inelastic with an own price elasticity of 0 594 and a cross price elasticity of 0 155 electricity by comparison is very inelastic in both own price 0 179 and cross price 0 051 it is also worth noting that the cross price elasticities are similar across demand functions difference of approximately 0 1 but not identical which suggests a potentially differential income effect across input goods the most plausible explanation for the limited income effect is the relatively insignificant share of income spent on electricity or water such that consumers do not experience a noticeable change in purchasing power as dur to price increases but more work is necessary to validate this conclusion our results also suggest that modeling demand for water and electricity in isolation may lead to erroneous estimates but the bias is small as expected given the hypothesized complementary relationship between household water and electricity use estimating each in isolation produces more elastic estimates than estimating demand jointly when estimated in isolation table 3 columns 1 2 both water and electricity demand appear more own price elastic 0 785 and 0 183 12 12 formal tests of coefficient equality are to our knowledge not possible across non nested models but it is worth noting that point estimates from the 2sls are more than 4 standard deviations away from point estimates in the 3sls in water demand and within 2 deviations in electricity demand our result suggests that improper specification of demand could lead utility managers to overestimate the effectiveness of water price as a conservation tool for water use our result suggests that improper specification of demand could lead utility managers to overestimate the effectiveness of water price as a conservation tool for water use the omitted variable bias in electricity demand is noticeably smaller such that own price coefficients between columns 2 and 4 are not different in an economically significant way while the magnitude of own price bias differs across demand estimates the negative and significant cross price coefficient suggests that synergistic opportunities exist to conserve one utility service by increasing prices of the other 3 2 future scenarios given the well established relationship between electricity and water in production and our current findings of a similar relationship in residential consumption policymakers should pay special attention to the impact one good has on the other when projecting supply needs forecasting revenue and setting prices water and energy utilities should collaborate such that optimal pricing strategies account for cross sectoral linkages our results suggest that utilities can substantially promote water conservation by increasing the price of electricity and perhaps vice versa thus conservation in both inputs is possible even when a price lever only exists for one this implication may be of particular interest in situations where 1 changing the price of one utility service is more politically feasible than changing the other or 2 service providers cannot separately meter across multiple uses apartment buildings for instance may only have a single water tap to the building but have individual electricity meters to illustrate the benefit of jointly considering energy and water use we provide a simple 10 year simulation of predicted summer and winter electricity water demand under varying price and estimation scenarios assuming constant elasticity fig 1 presents six projections for electricity and water demand the grey solid line uses coefficients from the 2sls fe models to project future water use based on an annual 3 increase in its price many utilities have the goal of keeping rate increases below 3 annually as such we use this rate increase for both water and electricity price scenarios the grey dashed line uses the coefficients from the 3sls fe model to project future consumption based on an own price increase of 3 and the black dashed line projects use based on a 3 increase in both electricity and water price fig 3 illustrates the divergent predictions obtained when including or ignoring cross price effects in demand estimation and forecasting under the 2sls estimates projected water consumption is 78 7 of current use by 2028 using the 3sls estimates water use is less elastic and projected at 83 6 of current consumption by 2028 thus if estimates from the 3sls fe are correct utility managers would over project savings from water price increases by 5 points annually projected demand under increases in both electricity and water prices is 79 8 of current use by 2028 a similar but smaller phenomenon can be seen in electricity use results generally suggest that ignoring cross price effects in estimation may not yield large differences in projections so long as both prices continue to move together if this relationship does not hold in the future however using elasticities from isolated demand estimation will significantly over estimate the savings due to own price increases 4 discussion and conclusion nationally roughly 4 of the united states total electricity generation is for water related activities 40 41 water scarcity continues to grow across the southwestern united states 42 and energy production continues to impose negative on local and global communities externalities 43 45 revenue shortfalls for many utilities and uncertainty around supplies and production are also a chief concern 46 cite the importance of including behavioral science in crafting a future with low emissions and reliable resource supply 13 13 yet for every research dollar spent on behavioral demand side energy research 35 is spent on energy supply and infrastructure 65 66 a similar sentiment exists among the physical and natural water sciences 47 this paper fills a gap in our current understanding of the demand side linkages between electricity and water which may improve water energy planning and management this improvement may be particularly valuable if past estimates which do not account for these linkages provide biased results that lead to suboptimal investment and planning decisions in our sample city this bias is relatively small although notably higher in water demand estimation than in electricity given the significant interest among utility providers in understanding consumer choices encouraging conservation and correctly forecasting consumption and revenue our results have significant implications for policy design failing to account for future electricity rate increases leads to inaccurate water use forecasts and maybe vice versa additionally the benefits of water electricity conservation programs extend beyond just those associated with water electricity savings many utilities and city planners are moving away from the traditional utility service provision model to one of integrated management in which water electricity and other resources are managed holistically 48 51 understanding the relatedness of these inputs gives utility managers the ability to coordinate pricing conservation and infrastructure for common goals finally when we consider the amount of energy required to treat water and the water that is required to produce energy our results have implications for greenhouse gas emissions and other negative economic externalities associated with consuming fossil fuels while more work is needed to provide robust carbon emission estimates a back of the envelope calculation suggests that increasing municipal water price by 10 could reduce total electricity consumption in the southwest by over 1 3 million megawatt hours per year 14 14 we assume that annual per household electricity use is 14 000 kwh total population of the southwest is 44 800 000 and households are comprised of 2 4 people thus total megawatt hours consumed is 261 million mwh using our estimates a 10 change in water price leads to a 0 5 change in electricity use 1 3 million mwh given current energy production methods this amount of electricity savings translates to over 1 million metric tons of carbonprevented from entering the atmosphere each year 15 15 this number was calculated using the epa s greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator not including additional savings from supply side energy reductions from decreased water demand 8 future work to further understand the demand side linkages of electricity and water should disentangle the production of household services that require electricity and or water as inputs and the associated seasonality of water electricity relatedness to the extent that households demand different services across seasons the underlying relationship between electricity and water may shift significantly from winter to summer months moreover utilities could benefit greatly from a clearer understanding of how consumers relate bill information to prices considerable work in this area has been conducted but little consensus exists research could also be expanded to include water and electricity as it relates to perceived versus actual use in the context of changing prices since current research suggests that customers have a poor understanding of the inputs required for each household service 52 68 a limitation to this study is the omission of data on natural gas consumption in the home a particularly important energy water connection comes from the need to heat water homes in our study region almost exclusively use natural gas for water and space heating a logical extension of this work would include an analysis of the effect that gas heating has on the electricity water relationship due to the lack of empirical work in this area it remains to be seen how cross price elasticity estimates may differ across locations due to differences in heating technologies population density ecoregions billing methods etc therefore careful consideration must be given before using these estimates in other contexts and locations despite these limitations and needs for future work the analysis

8701,past studies have estimated residential demand for water and electricity in isolation but these goods are often used as joint inputs in household production activities as such separately estimating electricity and water demand may lead to biased demand parameter estimates if prices are positively correlated and goods are complements ignoring cross price effects will exaggerate own price elasticity estimates leading to inaccurate revenue and conservation forecasts moreover understanding the water electricity demand relationship will allow for synergistic conservation strategies we propose a joint estimation procedure using 3 stage least squares fixed effects 3sls fe to highlight linkages between water and electricity and conclude that water demand in particular appears less own price elastic when cross prices are included in the demand system results from our study region suggest that water and electricity are gross complements with an average cross price elasticity of approximately 0 1 a simple simulation is included to highlight how omitting cross price elasticities may lead to inaccurate forecasting and suboptimal decisions keywords energy water nexus residential utilities electricity demand water demand 1 introduction the relationship between water and energy is well documented in the water use cycle 1 3 most of this work implicitly focuses on the supply side relationship of energy and water where energy production requires non trivial amounts of water for cooling and other activities and considerable amounts of energy are used to treat and deliver water 4 6 in california for example water related activities account for 13 19 of total electricity use where 5 4 of total use occurs in the home 3 7 beyond monetary costs energy consumption associated with water treatment and delivery supply side linkages also produces significant co2 emissions 7 estimate that the urban water cycle accounts for 4 of total per capita emissions in the state of california while 8 estimate that mandatory water restrictions in the state saved 1830 gwh of electricity and reduced co2 emissions by 521 000 metric tons yet despite the well documented production relationship less is known about demand side end use linkages between electricity and water given the environmental goals of many cities and the high costs associated with expanding energy and water supply capacities understanding the impact of demand side management on household consumption of water and electricity can lead to better holistic decision making therefore we use household level billing data to jointly estimate household demand for electricity and water in order to quantify the empirical importance of demand side price linkages between the two goods in this paper a conceptual model of behavior is developed to describe household demand for water and electricity as intermediate inputs herein referred to as inputs in the production of household goods and services herein referred to as household services ultimately whether water and electricity are substitutes or complements depends on their relationship in the production of household services and the demand relationship for those services neither of which are directly observed by the utility managers results from the jointly estimated demand equations are compared to estimates of own price elasticities when water and electricity are estimated in isolation this comparison allows us to identify the size of potential omitted variable bias created when complementarity is ignored in addition to using a 3 stage least squares 3sls model to jointly estimate water and electricity consumption which has rarely been used in this context this paper provides two practical contributions to the literature first to the extent that water and electricity prices are correlated ignoring the linkages across these inputs leads to biased parameter estimates 9 if prices are correlated and goods are complements as we hypothesize ignoring cross price effects will exaggerate the size of own price elasticity 1 1 for example if water and electricity are complementary in consumption when both prices increase water demand falls as a direct response to its price and in response to the higher electricity price a model of water consumption including only its own price would overestimate the marginal effect of water price because the water price coefficient also includes the decrease in water use from the cross price effect this inaccuracy can lead to inaccurate demand forecasts if the current relationship between prices does not hold under future conditions second a better understanding of the demand side linkages between electricity and water can lead to improved resource management and planning for example water targeted conservation programs may be part of a broader effort to manage demand for energy by reducing electricity consumption and its associated carbon emissions 1 1 water and electricity demand side linkages while work investigating the demand side linkages of electricity and water is sparse there are notable exceptions to our knowledge and affirmed by ref 10 only one study empirically estimates household cross price elasticities of demand for electricity and water concluding that these inputs are mild complements with a cross price elasticity of 0 2 11 2 2 two additional studies exist as grey literature which attempt to quantify the water electricity gas relationship 53 54 additionally the relationship between electricity and natural gas which are more clearly substitutes for one another has been estimated in numerous studies 55 56 and investigations into own price elasticity of each input in isolation are prolific in his study hansen uses a household production model where danish households produce household services that require water and energy inputs and household services that only require one of the two while his own price elasticity estimates are somewhat low compared to others findings 12 14 it may be that household demand in denmark circa 1996 differs substantially from demand in other contexts alternatively the relatively low estimate could suggest that correcting for cross prices reduces the elasticity of own price estimates since omitting complementary goods with correlated prices will likely bias own price estimates upward herein we expect to find a similar result beyond empirically estimating cross price elasticities other attempts have been made to evaluate the demand relationship between electricity and water however these attempts largely entail the supply side relationship or impose rational decisions to minimize cost 10 15 while these approaches are useful they are difficult to validate and may not capture income and substitution effects while our analysis does not allow us to separately identify substitution and income effects we do observe the aggregate effect of real households making monthly consumption decision in this vein 16 use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the spill over effects of home water reports on energy use and conclude that water conservation instruments reduce summertime electricity use by between 1 3 and 2 2 again suggesting that these inputs are complements although price is not explicitly included in their experimental design residential water elasticity estimates in the literature range from 0 1 to 1 8 13 while electricity demand elasticity has been estimated between 0 004 and 2 01 with the bulk of estimates around 0 3 17 beyond elasticity residential water demand has been the focus of considerable research including determining the effects of socio demographic characteristics beliefs and motivations 18 20 demand forecasting based on land use weather and climate predictions 21 22 and non price alternative demand management efficacy 23 similar analyses have been conducted for energy demand 24 28 while each of these studies further elucidates the demand for water or electricity this paper analyze the demand for water and electricity as functions of one another 1 2 conceptualizing water and electricity in a household producer consumer model to motivate the empirical analysis of this paper we assume that households maximize utility by choosing quantities of electricity and water as part of a household producer consumer optimization problem 29 for simplicity assume that households derive utility from a market good x that requires neither electricity e nor water w household services that require only water wo only electricity eo water and electricity as substitutes wes or water and electricity as complements wec a household determines the optimal level of x e w wo eo wes and wec subject to a budget and time constraint as well as the production functions relating water and electricity to the produced household services since the quantity of household services consumed equals the quantity produced the solution to this problem consists of an optimal quantity of market goods water and electricity consumed in the household unfortunately the quantity of electricity and water used in each service is unobserved by the utility manager and econometrician therefore for each household we only observe the sum of water and electricity used across the four services w and e respectively in this framework one has a finite budget to produce household services ignoring all other market goods for the moment this budget is split among services demanded by the household a dishwasher or washing machine for instance provides cleaning services and requires both water and electricity thus using either appliance creates a wec service and an increase in either water or electricity price increases the cost of this service lighting by comparison is an eo service whose price increases with electricity price but is unaffected by a change in water price importantly while the prices of eo services do not change with water price their relative price does the same phenomenon is true for every service such that demand for inputs water and electricity cannot be estimated accurately in isolation consider the ways in which an increase in the price of electricity affects the solution to the household producer consumer problem ceteris paribus an increase in electricity price increases production costs for eo wec and possibly wes services which leads to a higher shadow price for these services if eo and wo services are complements in demand we expect an increase in the shadow price of eo services to reduce the consumption of wo services if eo and wo services are substitutes we expect individuals to substitute away from eo services into wo services however the increased shadow prices of eo and wec services also have an associated income effect which may reduce the overall consumption of wo goods assuming they are normal goods similar rationale can be applied to wes and wec ultimately the direction and size of the cross price effects of water and electricity depend on their production relationship in creating household services and the consumption relationship of those services from the preceding thought experiment it is clear that the theoretical relationship between electricity and water in a household producer consumer model is ambiguous such that an empirical approach is necessary to sign and estimate cross price elasticities the empirical methods used to elucidate this relationship are described in the next section 2 methods first traditional two stage least squares 2sls models of water and electricity demand are replicated then a three stage least squares 3sls method is used to simultaneously estimate electricity and water demand accounting for cross price linkages and correlated error terms across demand equations instrumenting for price is required both in the isolated and jointly estimated demand models in order to control for the simultaneity of average price and consumption quantities of each good 2sls models are commonly used because traditional ordinary least squares ols methods that regress water or electricity quantity on price cannot be interpreted as a causal impact of price on demand when increasing block rates ibr exist 30 ibr pricing creates an average and marginal price that depends on the quantity of the good used creating simultaneity which violates a necessary assumption for unbiased estimation 9 ibr s were generally introduced as a conservation tool in which the marginal price of an additional unit of water or electricity increases with its use thus creating an endogeneity issue in which price is a function of quantity and vice versa 26 31 32 while the traditional solution instrumenting for price via 2sls ameliorates endogeneity concerns much of this work estimates demand elasticities for electricity or water in isolation which may introduce another source of bias since these goods are often used jointly as inputs into household services a second complication in estimating demand is determining the price signal to which customers respond and thus the variable for which we must instrument 3 3 some authors suggest that the theoretically consistent approach is to include a term for both marginal price and a block difference term 57 59 others use perceived price 60 or average variable price 18 other researchers have found that the mere presence of an ibr decreases consumption regardless of price 61 while other work suggests that the tractability of the unit price displayed on the bill significantly affects individuals responses 62 average price is used in this analysis for both electricity and water bills based on ito s 26 findings that consumers respond to average price rather than marginal or expected marginal price additionally and in line with past studies lagged price is used because it is the price signal consumers receive such that the perceived average price for a month is that of the previous month s bill 13 26 67 the final complication identified in the literature is one of unobserved heterogeneity across households 33 previous work and intuition suggest that houses are significantly different in their demand for water or electricity these differences may be explained by age of home appliance efficiency environmental motivations number of occupants etc while some of these factors can be included as control variables it is unlikely that the econometrician observes all relevant household characteristics thus to account for the omission of unobserved household characteristics a fixed effects fe approach is used in both the 2sls and 3sls models to average out household level effects consistent with methods commonly used with panel data in the water electricity demand literature 34 36 despite the possibility of inefficient estimates fe is preferred to random effects re because re requires the stringent assumption that each random effect is uncorrelated with all explanatory variables in each time period by comparison fe models estimate deviations in each period from the household s average consumption over time while this method prevents us from estimating the effects of time invariant characteristics it does not impede the goal of this paper to estimate the own and cross price elasticities of water and electricity in household demand 2 1 two stage fe least squares estimation the 2sls method estimates the impact of price on the quantity demanded for each input in two independent models we begin with this method to obtain estimates for comparison in order to determine the impact of jointly modeling electricity e and water w demand let y i t j be the log of demand for input j e w by household i in period t and y i j be the average log of demand for each individual across all periods the 2sls fe specification used in this analysis postulates that y i t j depends on the log average price of input j on last month s bill p i t 1 j days of service in bill period t l i t j total precipitation experienced by household i in time t r i t j average daily temperature c i t j wildfire actively burning f t and a vector of dummies for the month in which the bill was issued m t average temperature was calculated as max daily temperature plus minimum temperature divided by 2 summed across the bill period and divided by the days of service in that bill period l i t we also include the interaction of weather variables with a dummy variable for summer months s t to account for the dependence of outdoor water use on weather patterns in the irrigation season lastly a dummy variable was included to account for the high park fire which burned 87 000 acres just west of town in the summer of 2012 during the fire citizens were cautioned to stay indoors to avoid ash and smoke which likely increased energy use via ac and air purification systems the presence of fire may also affect water consumption but the mechanism and direction of the affect is less clear staying indoors during the fire may increase indoor water use but it may also decrease lawn and garden watering let y i t j be the deviation of log demand for each household in each period from average demand y i t j y i t j y i j prices p i t j precipitation r i t j temperature c i t j and dummy variables m t f t s t are each calculated similarly such that each variable represents that periods deviation from household i s mean across all periods given the above household i s demand for service j in time t can be expressed as 1 y i t j β 0 j p i t 1 j β 1 j l i t j β 2 j r i t j β 3 j c i t j β 4 j s t r i t j β 5 j s t c i t j β 6 j f t m t ϕ j ε i t j where β j s and ϕ j s are coefficients to be estimated and ε i t j represents random error price is instrumented in the first stage by regressing p i t 1 j on all exogenous variables from the second stage as well as mean differenced price of block one for each input ρ t 1 j and the days of service for the corresponding bill l i t 2 j because rates are determined by city council and the days of service for each bill vary over time and are largely determined randomly by the utility billing cycle both variables are correlated with average price but exogenous to the household and uncorrelated with ε i t j further since price and quantities consumed are expressed in logs the estimated coefficients on prices represent an estimate of own price elasticities these 2sls fe estimates provide a benchmark with which to compare the estimates of the joint model described below 2 2 three stage fe least squares estimation while the 2sls fe method is conventionally used in the literature if c o r r p e p w 0 2sls elasticity estimates from models that omit cross prices are erroneous therefore we model water and electricity demand as a system of equations which estimates water and energy consumption jointly as a function of both input prices while allowing for correlation of error terms across demand equations the 3sls fe model developed herein simultaneously estimates the demand for electricity and water 4 4 2sls estimation including prices for both inputs would provide similar results but it would be less efficient than the 3sls model similar to the 2sls we use rate dummy variables and lagged days of service as instruments for price in each equation 5 5 see ref 63 for a formal presentation of the model s identification requirements and assumptions the model simultaneously estimates the following four equations with variables defined identically to those used in the 2sls fe model 2 y i t w β 0 w p i t 1 w β 1 w p i t 1 e β 2 w l i t w β 3 w r i t w β 4 w c i t w β 5 w s t r i t w β 6 w s t c i

w ρ t 1 w γ 2 j l i t 2 w ν i t w 5 p i t 1 e γ i 0 e γ 1 e ρ t 1 e γ 2 j l i t 2 e ν i t e note that days of service l i t j precipitation r i t j and temperature c i t j are specific to the bill period and may vary if the bill period for water and electricity differs 6 6 the sample was limited to observations with bill dates within three days of one another some observations did not have similar bill periods for water and electricity and were excluded from the sample because we cannot determine the cause of this discrepancy additional cleaning was also necessary to remove extreme values and obvious errors frequency plots and the logged mean of consumption remain similar before and after cleaning changing by less than 0 4 the specific cleaning rules can be provided upon request 2 3 data and parameterization this section describes the data used to estimate both the 2sls fe and the 3sls fe models described above and provides a brief explanation of the billing structure the analysis avoids censored data complications associated with demand studies that include zero quantities of particular goods 37 38 by dropping any observation with zero consumption for either water or electricity homes without utility consumption are likely vacant or indicate a billing error and are not indicative of household demand this decision should not meaningfully affect our results so long as home vacancies within a season are random in nature 7 7 across the raw data the percent of vacant homes to homes using power or water remains relatively constant across months at approximately 1 we found no evidence that house characteristics are meaningfully correlated with these vacancies consistent with previous studies 13 17 weather is modeled as a primary driver of deviations in demand total monthly precipitation and average mean daily temperature over each billing cycle were calculated using data from ref 39 daily weather data were match to each billing period to create total precipitation and average daily temperature variables for each household in each bill period billing records from a large utility in colorado provide data on monthly electricity and water consumption and bill amounts for roughly 22 000 households with relatively complete billing records at least 36 monthly bills over the period 2006 2014 bills with fewer than 25 days or more than 35 were excluded because we could not identify why these anomalies occurred 8 8 anecdotally the utility believes that the use of smart meters has essentially randomized the billing cycle across households since meters are no longer read neighborhood by neighborhood and that billing period should be approximately 30 days additionally billing accounts with more than two associated taps were excluded since this feature may indicate landlords or rentals that do not directly receive bills the period of our sample includes significant price variation with twelve changes in rate structure five in water pricing and seven in electricity a summary of the annual rate structures is provided in table 1 for water the ibr structure includes three blocks with incremental increases in price block price thresholds were set at 7 000gal and 13 000gal for the entire period of our sample prices increased for each block across the years in our sample for example block prices in 2006 were 1 87 2 15 2 48 per thousand gallons in block one two and three respectively by 2014 these prices increased to 2 38 2 74 and 3 15 respectively 9 9 because billing method and price perceptions may affect consumption decisions 62 it is worth noting that bills from the utility present line item sub totals by water and electricity tier and new charges this billing period in bold at the bottom of the bill after 2011 electricity prices exhibit a similar upward trend although for 2006 to 2011 block pricing was not in place each block price was given the same value for this period in our model block price thresholds were 500 kwh and 1000 kwh for the years in which they exist however the price at each block varied between summer june to september and winter october to may months for example in 2014 summer block prices were 0 0896 0 106 and 0 140 per kwh in summer but decreased to 0 0824 0 0864 and 0 0951 in winter months fig 1 illustrates average monthly consumption for electricity and water over the period of observation note that both water and electricity use have slight downward trends water has one large peak in summer and electricity consumption peaks both in winter and in summer fig 2 illustrates average monthly total bills for water and electricity note that electricity bills were increasing during this time while water bills remained relatively flat summary statistics for variables used in the analysis are presented in table 2 average per capita per day consumption is approximately 120 gallons and 320 kwh for water and electricity respectively assuming 2 4 persons per household 3 regression results and demand scenarios 3 1 elasticity and demand estimation table 3 presents coefficient estimates for the traditional approach of estimating electricity and water demand separately columns 1 2 as well as the coefficients estimated jointly using the system of equations presented in section 2 columns 3 4 10 10 while equations 2 5 represent the model used in our analysis results presented in table 3 many specifications were tested for robustness qualitative results remain consistent across model specifications although the relative size of own price elasticity ranged from 0 42 to 0 69 for water and 0 10 and 0 26 for electricity for cross prices water demand ranged from 0 15 to 0 30 and electricity demand ranged from 0 05 to 0 20 results from a full set of specifications can be made available upon request for all models we report bootstrapped standard errors clustered at the household level to allow for potential dependence across time consistent with expectations we find a moderate correlation between electricity and water price ρ p w p e 0 32 and results from table 3 suggest that water and electricity are related such that demand for each responds to a price change of the other electricity and water are gross complements 11 11 for a more detailed discussion of gross versus net complements see ref 64 although cross price elasticities are relatively small in magnitude water demand is moderately inelastic with an own price elasticity of 0 594 and a cross price elasticity of 0 155 electricity by comparison is very inelastic in both own price 0 179 and cross price 0 051 it is also worth noting that the cross price elasticities are similar across demand functions difference of approximately 0 1 but not identical which suggests a potentially differential income effect across input goods the most plausible explanation for the limited income effect is the relatively insignificant share of income spent on electricity or water such that consumers do not experience a noticeable change in purchasing power as dur to price increases but more work is necessary to validate this conclusion our results also suggest that modeling demand for water and electricity in isolation may lead to erroneous estimates but the bias is small as expected given the hypothesized complementary relationship between household water and electricity use estimating each in isolation produces more elastic estimates than estimating demand jointly when estimated in isolation table 3 columns 1 2 both water and electricity demand appear more own price elastic 0 785 and 0 183 12 12 formal tests of coefficient equality are to our knowledge not possible across non nested models but it is worth noting that point estimates from the 2sls are more than 4 standard deviations away from point estimates in the 3sls in water demand and within 2 deviations in electricity demand our result suggests that improper specification of demand could lead utility managers to overestimate the effectiveness of water price as a conservation tool for water use our result suggests that improper specification of demand could lead utility managers to overestimate the effectiveness of water price as a conservation tool for water use the omitted variable bias in electricity demand is noticeably smaller such that own price coefficients between columns 2 and 4 are not different in an economically significant way while the magnitude of own price bias differs across demand estimates the negative and significant cross price coefficient suggests that synergistic opportunities exist to conserve one utility service by increasing prices of the other 3 2 future scenarios given the well established relationship between electricity and water in production and our current findings of a similar relationship in residential consumption policymakers should pay special attention to the impact one good has on the other when projecting supply needs forecasting revenue and setting prices water and energy utilities should collaborate such that optimal pricing strategies account for cross sectoral linkages our results suggest that utilities can substantially promote water conservation by increasing the price of electricity and perhaps vice versa thus conservation in both inputs is possible even when a price lever only exists for one this implication may be of particular interest in situations where 1 changing the price of one utility service is more politically feasible than changing the other or 2 service providers cannot separately meter across multiple uses apartment buildings for instance may only have a single water tap to the building but have individual electricity meters to illustrate the benefit of jointly considering energy and water use we provide a simple 10 year simulation of predicted summer and winter electricity water demand under varying price and estimation scenarios assuming constant elasticity fig 1 presents six projections for electricity and water demand the grey solid line uses coefficients from the 2sls fe models to project future water use based on an annual 3 increase in its price many utilities have the goal of keeping rate increases below 3 annually as such we use this rate increase for both water and electricity price scenarios the grey dashed line uses the coefficients from the 3sls fe model to project future consumption based on an own price increase of 3 and the black dashed line projects use based on a 3 increase in both electricity and water price fig 3 illustrates the divergent predictions obtained when including or ignoring cross price effects in demand estimation and forecasting under the 2sls estimates projected water consumption is 78 7 of current use by 2028 using the 3sls estimates water use is less elastic and projected at 83 6 of current consumption by 2028 thus if estimates from the 3sls fe are correct utility managers would over project savings from water price increases by 5 points annually projected demand under increases in both electricity and water prices is 79 8 of current use by 2028 a similar but smaller phenomenon can be seen in electricity use results generally suggest that ignoring cross price effects in estimation may not yield large differences in projections so long as both prices continue to move together if this relationship does not hold in the future however using elasticities from isolated demand estimation will significantly over estimate the savings due to own price increases 4 discussion and conclusion nationally roughly 4 of the united states total electricity generation is for water related activities 40 41 water scarcity continues to grow across the southwestern united states 42 and energy production continues to impose negative on local and global communities externalities 43 45 revenue shortfalls for many utilities and uncertainty around supplies and production are also a chief concern 46 cite the importance of including behavioral science in crafting a future with low emissions and reliable resource supply 13 13 yet for every research dollar spent on behavioral demand side energy research 35 is spent on energy supply and infrastructure 65 66 a similar sentiment exists among the physical and natural water sciences 47 this paper fills a gap in our current understanding of the demand side linkages between electricity and water which may improve water energy planning and management this improvement may be particularly valuable if past estimates which do not account for these linkages provide biased results that lead to suboptimal investment and planning decisions in our sample city this bias is relatively small although notably higher in water demand estimation than in electricity given the significant interest among utility providers in understanding consumer choices encouraging conservation and correctly forecasting consumption and revenue our results have significant implications for policy design failing to account for future electricity rate increases leads to inaccurate water use forecasts and maybe vice versa additionally the benefits of water electricity conservation programs extend beyond just those associated with water electricity savings many utilities and city planners are moving away from the traditional utility service provision model to one of integrated management in which water electricity and other resources are managed holistically 48 51 understanding the relatedness of these inputs gives utility managers the ability to coordinate pricing conservation and infrastructure for common goals finally when we consider the amount of energy required to treat water and the water that is required to produce energy our results have implications for greenhouse gas emissions and other negative economic externalities associated with consuming fossil fuels while more work is needed to provide robust carbon emission estimates a back of the envelope calculation suggests that increasing municipal water price by 10 could reduce total electricity consumption in the southwest by over 1 3 million megawatt hours per year 14 14 we assume that annual per household electricity use is 14 000 kwh total population of the southwest is 44 800 000 and households are comprised of 2 4 people thus total megawatt hours consumed is 261 million mwh using our estimates a 10 change in water price leads to a 0 5 change in electricity use 1 3 million mwh given current energy production methods this amount of electricity savings translates to over 1 million metric tons of carbonprevented from entering the atmosphere each year 15 15 this number was calculated using the epa s greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator not including additional savings from supply side energy reductions from decreased water demand 8 future work to further understand the demand side linkages of electricity and water should disentangle the production of household services that require electricity and or water as inputs and the associated seasonality of water electricity relatedness to the extent that households demand different services across seasons the underlying relationship between electricity and water may shift significantly from winter to summer months moreover utilities could benefit greatly from a clearer understanding of how consumers relate bill information to prices considerable work in this area has been conducted but little consensus exists research could also be expanded to include water and electricity as it relates to perceived versus actual use in the context of changing prices since current research suggests that customers have a poor understanding of the inputs required for each household service 52 68 a limitation to this study is the omission of data on natural gas consumption in the home a particularly important energy water connection comes from the need to heat water homes in our study region almost exclusively use natural gas for water and space heating a logical extension of this work would include an analysis of the effect that gas heating has on the electricity water relationship due to the lack of empirical work in this area it remains to be seen how cross price elasticity estimates may differ across locations due to differences in heating technologies population density ecoregions billing methods etc therefore careful consideration must be given before using these estimates in other contexts and locations despite these limitations and needs for future work the analysis presented here provides policymakers with information necessary for synergistic pricing policies and a more thorough understanding of the demand side relationship of water and energy acknowledgements

8702,a great majority of agricultural water is provided by precipitation that is stored in soil moisture defined as green water this water evaporates or transpires through plants and plays a determinative role in crop growth particularly for rainfed agriculture this study aims to assess the economic value of green water production factor that has often been ignored in the literature as the focus was mainly given on blue water resources we employed the production function valuation method and specify a cobb douglas production function using cereal production in the czech republic as a case study green water use was quantified through cropwat model using year to year precipitation and evapotranspiration data at a national level for the period 1993 2014 the green water use values were incorporated into the production function and the marginal value of green water was elicited by computing its marginal contribution with annual average crop market prices estimations were based on empirical time series data at the national level the marginal value of green water ranged from 17 to 25 usd 1000 m3 to our best of knowledge this is the first study that reveals the value of green water and its contribution in the production value of cereals compared to other production factors our findings complement previous studies regarding the crop productivity of green water we conclude with policy implications of the study findings highlighting the use of green water value estimations in the compilation of water accounts as emerged in the system of environmental economic accounting for water keywords green water economic valuation production function water accounts 1 introduction green water greenw stands for the proportion of precipitation water which infiltrates into the unsaturated zone of soil and is temporarily stored in soil and in vegetation canopy 12 14 45 46 the greenw concept was introduced in the mid 1990s by falkenmark 70 who highlighted its importance as a valuable water resource since then the researcher community e g savenije 2000 49 rockström 2001 44 rijsberman 2006 43 liu et al 2009 32 hanasaki et al 2010 21 aldaya et al 2010 1 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012a b 23 24 schyns et al 2015 50 as well as global initiatives such as the isric fao green water initiative tried to raise attention regarding this water resource at global scale almost 60 of the precipitation ends up as greenw resource 38 being almost exclusively consumed by crops as well as by other terrestrial ecosystems 31 in the study by mekonnen and hoekstra 34 it is reported that greenw accounts for more than 80 of the total consumptive water use for crop production equivalent to 5771 km3 year at the global scale with cereal crops such as wheat rice and maize taking the largest share of total greenw use similar findings were also reported by previous global assessments studies 11 31 51 despite the strong evidence regarding the importance of greenw and the recognition of its significant contribution to food production by the scientific community and international institutions studies on greenw are still scarce policy and research attention has been mainly given to blue water resources i e the water that partly runs off to the ocean via rivers and groundwater and is the resource that is used for irrigation as well as drinking purposes 25 26 50 for an extensive review see hackbart et al 20 blue water compared to greenw is more manageable and can be re distributed to other uses through engineering applications 11 68 however water scarcity issues require attention to both types of water resources 26 65 the limited number of previous studies that refer to greenw assessment followed either a water footprint quantification approach or impact assessment frameworks e g seibert and döll 2010 51 pfister et al 2011 40 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 34 nuñez et al 2013 36 chenoweth et al 2014 4 quinteiro et al 2015 42 garrido et al 2010 17 hoekstra et 2012a 23 schyns and hoekstra 2014 57 in these assessments the consumptive use and productivity of water is typically computed on average terms for a certain number of years e g a decade in this study we investigate the contribution of greenw in cereal crops production under rainfed agriculture in czech republic both the country and the crop group were selected due to their high dependence on greenw use 1 1 cereals crops require significant greenw 51 and greenw footprint of cereal crops was found almost three times higher in eastern europe than in northern and western regions 35 greenw in rainfed agriculture refers to the actual evaporation or evapotranspiration 27 50 62 and more precisely to the transpiration and soil evaporation 11 given the vital role of greenw in biomass production and the limited number of studies on greenw valuation we aim to address this knowledge gap by exploring both conceptually and empirically the valuation of greenw at national scale our objective is to estimate the crop greenw productivity in marginal terms i e the change in the output of crop production when one additional unit of water is used for this we employ the production function method various methods including the residual value mathematical programming and hedonic pricing have been employed in past empirical studies to estimate the contribution and the economic value of freshwater 2 2 market price or unit resource rent price methods cannot reflect the value of water resources let alone greenw resource as water is usually not priced at its marginal value 34 36 in cases where water price estimates were available research focus was on blue water and on water basins 5 41 in several sectors e g graveline 2016 19 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that attempts to assess the monetary value of greenw in shadow price terms the selection of the production function method was decided in line with the recommendations provided by the system of environmental economic accounting seea 61 regarding the eligibility of economic valuation methods 9 37 61 recent studies in ecosystem accounting suggest that greenw should be incorporated into accounting in line with seea framework and call for a better consistency in the system of environmental economic accounting framework for water 3 3 seea water is the statistical framework that integrates data on both environmental and economic aspects of water supply and use seea water 30 48 60 to this end our empirical outcomes aim to demonstrate an application of production function method that can facilitate the compilation of water accounts in the future 2 case study area the czech republic is located in central europe its area covers 78 866 km2 and is inhabited by 10 5 million people the climate is temperate continental with blending of oceanic and continental effects the average annual temperature for the studied period 1993 2014 ranged between 6 3 c and 9 4 c while the 1961 1990 long term air temperature normal being 7 5 c the average annual precipitation ranged between 516 mm and 867 mm over the studied period with long term precipitation normal 1961 1990 being 674 mm 7 the fluctuation of temperature and precipitation patters influences the irregular occurrence of drought and flood events in the czech republic 54 long periods of low precipitation have a significant impact on agriculture within the study period draughts have been recorded in the years 2000 2003 2007 2009 2012 and 2014 54 an excessive rainfall has also a negative impact on agricultural production i e after reaching a rainfall water amount threshold the production decreases to account for these variations in greenw estimations and its contribution to production function we use aggregated yearly precipitation values at the national level in 2014 the agricultural land accounted for more than 54 of the total area of the country while 99 5 of the agricultural land was non irrigated 64 the main agricultural crops produced in the czech republic are cereals of which wheat and barley are the most harvested the study considers all cereal crops grown in the country between 1993 and 2014 table 1 this period covers 10 years before and after the country s accession to the european union during this period cereal crop production had been decreasing in both harvested area and output while the gross production value showed a slightly increasing trend 3 methods and data 3 1 green water use calculations several models have been developed to quantify the consumptive crop water use such as impact 55 and gcwm global crop water model 51 in this study the year to year greenw use by cereal crops in czech republic was quantified using the fao s cropwat model and the crop water requirement option 3 52 as suggested by hoekstra et al 25 this model is commonly used in crop water use assessments e g stancalie et al 2010 53 surendran et al 2015 56 crop water requirement at the field level m3 ha is defined as the total water needed for evapotranspiration from planting to harvest for a given crop under a specific climate regime it is assumed that cereal crops grow under optimal conditions meaning that sufficient soil water is maintained by rainfall or irrigation so that it does not limit plant growth and crop yield under this assumption crop evapotranspiration et c c mm day is equal to crop water requirements and is calculated as follows 1 e t c c k c c e t 0 where et 0 mm day is the reference evapotranspiration and k c dimensionless is the crop coefficient of cereal crop c that incorporates the crop characteristics and the effects of soil evaporation the green crop evapotranspiration of each cereal crop et green c mm day is calculated as follows 2 e t g r e e n c min e t c c p e f f where p eff mm day is the effective rainfall defined as the part of the total amount of precipitation that is retained by the soil so that it is potentially available for meeting the water need of a crop there are various methods to compute effective rainfall based on total rainfall in this study effective precipitation is calculated based on the widely used method of the soil conservation service of the united states department of agriculture as suggested by smith 52 the irrigation blue water requirements can be calculated as the difference between the crop water requirement and effective precipitation however as the study focuses on greenw use the blue water component was not computed also compared to greenw blue water requirement is typically negligible in cereal crops grown in czech republic 18 crop water use refers to the total volume of water that is consumed by a crop over a growing season the total greenw use per cereal crop and year greenw m3 year is calculated by summing the daily crop evapotranspiration over the complete growth period from day 1 as follows 3 green w c t 10 d 1 l p e t g r e e n c t a c t where the factor 10 is applied to convert the estimated crop evapotranspiration that is in mm to m3 ha lp denotes the length of growing period in days and a ha year is the total harvested area of each cereal crop c in year t 3 2 production function method the production function method estimates the value of a non marketed factor by assessing its contribution as an input into the production process of a commercially marketed good it is a micro economic method based on empirical data and it models how each input contributes to the production output the contribution is revealed through the marginal productivity indicator this indicator shows the effect on total production i e total quantity of produced output associated to the use of an additional unit of the selected factor to compute the monetary value of factors marginal productivity is multiplied by the output market price these estimations are provided by the first order conditions f o c of the maximization problem subject to certain restrictions 19 33 in the case that the production factor is provided by the ecosystem as with greenw and at no cost it can be internalized in the maximization problem through the introduction of shadow prices as follows 4 max y p i q i c i j l i k i z i λ i e i s t q i f l i k i z i e i and l i k i z i e i 0 where i is a commodity j is input p is the output price q is the output quantity l is labor k is capital and z is the other inputs e denotes the ecosystem input c the cost per unit and λ the implicit value or shadow price of ecosystem input the implicit price of ecosystem input is estimated by solving for f o c 5 ϑ y ϑ e i 0 ϑ q i ϑ e i p i λ i 0 λ i ϑ q i ϑ e i p i 3 3 cobb douglas function and model specifications cobb douglas cd production function is a commonly employed function to describe the technical relationship between the inputs and outputs of a production process the function has been widely used for estimating the contribution of inputs in crop e g yao 1996 66 and fish production e g karagiannis and katranidis 2000 28 ali et al 2016 2 as well as the contribution of water as a resource input in several sectors e g onofri et al 2017 39 wang and lall 2002 63 a classical cd function takes the form q a x 1 b 1 x n b n where b 1 n denote elasticities the elasticity of a production factor indicates the percentage change in the production output due to a percentage change in the use of the production input given that all other inputs remain unchanged by applying the log to the function the classic cd production function is transposed in a linear form as follows 6 l n q l n a b 1 l n x 1 b n l n x n the classic form of cd function may be susceptible to certain limitations due to the assumptions of additivity and homogeneity to overcome such limitations alternative representations of the function are often been employed by researchers the most widely applied is the transcendental logarithmic or translog production function representation 28 63 the function takes the following form 6 7 l n q l n a i 1 n b i l n x i i 1 n b i i l n 2 x i 2 i 1 n j 1 m b i j l n x i l n x j the elasticity of production with respect to each input is calculated by taking the

equipment m transport fuel tf greenw use greenw and harvested crop area a we performed two model specifications model 1 is specified in a translog form eq 7 model 2 is the same as model 1 but it includes crop specific interactions with greenw input for the five most important cereal crop species the models were analyzed in a panel data structure i e for 10 different cereal crops and for 22 time periods specified in years the assumption that the error components are independently and identically distributed idd is rarely realistic with panel data and ordinary least squares error estimates may not be efficient the error terms can be treated as fixed or random parameters to be estimated a fixed effect model introduces a matrix of dummy variables that correspond to the observations of each group of the panel this is called least square dummy variable lsdv model due to the introduction of dummies that capture the specific shocks caused by the panel structure 8 our models were first specified as one way fixed effect models that account for group here the group refers to crop type specific shocks next we also explored the two way fixed effect models that account for time specific shocks the analysis was performed using the nlogit 6 software package econometric software inc plainview ny usa 3 4 data and assumptions 3 4 1 green water data for the calculation of greenw use daily potential evapotranspiration and precipitation values for czech republic over the period 1993 2014 were obtained from the high resolution dataset cru cy v 3 24 01 of 22 these data refer to the daily average conditions at the national level crop planting and harvesting dates were obtained from sacks et al 47 and crop coefficients from allen et al 3 a range of planting and harvesting dates was tested i e early average and late yet no significant differences were found in greenw use thus for simplicity we assumed that cereals were planted and harvested in the mid average range of each period respectively the total production and harvested area per cereal crop per year was derived from the faostat database as reported at country level cropwat model revealed the greenw consumption per crop type table 2 presents the mean consumption per crop type during the time period 1993 2014 on average cereal crops consumed around 385 million m3 year of greenw or 2199 m3 ha year 3 4 2 production function factors based on available data the following production inputs have been identified 4 4 according to the farm accountancy data network fadn report ec 2014 10 60 of the main costs of farms producing common wheat in the czech republic originated from the non specific costs i e transport fuel machinery buildings upkeep and by and the specific ones i e seeds fertilizers crop protection and water labor paid and unpaid accounted for almost 20 of the production cost labour fertilizers pesticides machinery equipment transport fuels and harvested area the data were obtained from faostat database 15 with the exception of harvested area all other production inputs data were not provided by each crop but rather were available at an aggregated level in order to approximate the data of inputs for each cereal crop we assumed weights which were specified in accordance to the share of each crop to the total production output of all crops as in yao 1996 66 missing values 5 5 for fertilizers and pesticides inputs almost half of the data were missing for the rest of inputs the shortage was less severe with missing cases to represent around 15 30 of sample size of data were filled using linear interpolations table 3 4 results table 4 presents the estimated parameters of the one way fixed effects econometric models of translog specification where decreasing return to scale and substitution effects are accounted for the r2 value showed an adequate fit of models the fixed effect coefficients table 1 appendix were found statistically significant for model 1 implying that variation in crop production can be explained by crop specific factors that are not captured by the independent variables considering the f statistics test the null hypothesis that the ordinary least squares model is better than the one way fixed effects model was rejected in both models 1 and 2 the results of the two way fixed model of translog model 1 are reported in table 2 appendix 6 6 the two way fixed effect models table 3 appendix showed statistically significant time specific coefficients for model 1 while model 2 of the thanslog specification with interactions didn t converge to a solution the null hypothesis of a one way fixed effects model being more appropriate than a two way fixed effects one was rejected at 0 02 significance level in model 1 on this basis we decided to leave the two way fixed effect models results out of the core body of the manuscript and proceed with calculations considering only the one way fixed effects models most of the production inputs had positive elasticities as expected table 5 harvested land showed the largest contribution in crop production with elasticity level being close to 0 9 the elasticity of greenw ranged from 0 04 to 0 06 indicating that a 10 increase in greenw would result in a 0 4 0 6 increase in crop production all other things being equal this is a sizeable effect on food provision also compared to the effect of other production inputs the interaction terms revealed the relationship between these inputs greenw is positively related to land as expected and hence the marginal effect of greenw on crop production is determined by the size of harvested land the estimates of elasticity of greenw per crop type ranged from 0 1 to 0 79 table 5 maize and wheat presented the highest elasticity estimates a 10 increase in greenw use would cause almost an 8 increase in the maize production and a 6 in wheat production considering that maize is the third most important crop in the czech republic in terms of harvested area this outcome highlights the important role of greenw in cereal production at national level 7 7 all estimates are provided under the assumptions that coefficients of inputs are the same across the different crop types where an average country level greenw value varies per year the former does not take into account that production depends on a crop specific technology i e over the study period we assume constant production technology while the latter disregard the dynamic use of greenw which depends on crop specific needs that change dynamically over space and time as well as the precipitation rate these assumptions were regarded necessary given data availability we provide the results of a classic cd function per crop type and greenw estimates for three different planting and harvesting dates in supplementary material a translog model per crop type could not be feasible since there are only 22 observations per crop table 6 reports the marginal productivity the implicit price or value and the economic return of greenw i e the value of the average use of input in crop production one additional unit i e 1000 m3 of greenw increases crop production by 0 9 to 0 13 tonnes given the estimates of marginal productivity we elicited the implicit price of greenw implicit price estimates were based on producer prices in usd kg for the time period 2004 2014 which were available only for wheat barley maize oats and triticale this should be regarded as an approximation and subject to price volatilities within years the impicit price of greenw ranged from 17 to 25 usd 1000 m3 the economic return or contribution of greenw to crop production ranged between 6 5 and 9 6 million usd per year in table 7 we report the estimates of average and marginal product of greenw in the four most important crop types in czech republic oats has been neglected due to the negative estimated elasticity although the average product across maize wheat barley and triticale was ranged at almost the same level in marginal terms the picture was different one additional unit of greenw would increase wheat and maize production at almost ten times the size of effect on barley or triticale maize and wheat showed the highest greenw implicit price with the price ranging between 221 and 368 usd 1000 m3 which is almost ten times larger than the implicit price of barley and triticale as well as that of cereal crops on average for wheat a value of approximately 460 million usd per year is generated by the provision of greenw this is due to the high consumption of greenw per year for wheat production and the high implicit price of greenw that result to high implicit cost of ecosystem input that is not internalized in the production function 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 overview of findings this study employed the production function method to estimate the marginal productivity as well as the value of green water greenw in cereal crops production the production function was specified as a cobb douglas cd function where the coefficients of production factors represent elasticities i e the increase of crop production given a increase in the production factor greenw elasticities ranged between 0 04 and 0 06 implying that a 10 increase in greenw use would result in 0 4 0 6 increase of cereal crop production this is substantial compared also to the corresponding elasticity estimates of the other production inputs the elasticity estimates were used for assessing the value of marginal productivity and the shadow value of greenw the marginal productivity and the implicit value of greenw were assessed within the range of 0 09 0 12 tonnes 1000 m3 and 17 25 usd 1000 m3 respectively the model with crop interactions revealed that the marginal productivity and value of greenw for maize and wheat were at the highest level compared to other crop estimates with respect to overall greenw contribution wheat is the crop with the highest overall benefits which is expected given the high yearly harvested area and the consumption of greenw for wheat production both indications i e marginal and return value reflect the contribution of greenw in the economy that is often ignored in literature these figures complement previous water footprint studies that focus on the consumptive use of water in crop production as a first step towards greenw valuation greenw use per year is estimated for each cereal crop at the national level and is then incorporated as a component in a crop production function this enables the estimation of marginal crop productivity of greenw where additional to water other production inputs have been accounted for 5 2 policy implications the valuation of greenw offers important insights for the compilation of water accounts and their integration to the environmental economic accounting in national accounts ecosystem accounting is a relatively recent research domain that attracts increasing interest for water resources in particular the seea water 60 includes all water resources and more specifically surface groundwater blue water as well as soil water here defined as greenw examples of water accounts that include also greenw resources are still scarce the production function method that was employed here is concurrent with the objectives of the seea principles 61 physical supply and use tables are the primary tables that countries are expected to compile while monetary accounts are optional depending on data availability and policy willingness 61 our estimates facilitate both parts of the accounts in the case of cereal crops for the czech republic the same approach can be applied to all crops and can integrate all water resources i e green and blue water subject to data availability the valuation of water resources has policy implications in water resource management climate change adaptation policies and conservation policy water resource management calls for decisions on land use and allocation of both blue and green water resources considering that both are interrelated and under a scarcity threat 58 economic returns and efficiency are part of the criteria in decision making 39 according to our czech republic case study findings wheat maize and barley attain the highest economic returns as well as the highest efficiency of greenw use this may be important information in policy making and land use scenario assessments along with social economic and technological factors that determine demand and reallocation of crop production in czech republic greenw depends on climate factors i e temperature precipitation as well as on land use population growth and technological developments hydro geological studies have questioned before how climate change may affect the stability of the green blue water ratio e g konar et al 2016 29 moreover research conducted in czech republic e g potova et al 2015 69 trnka et al 2016 59 showed the increasing trend of drought events and their effects on crop yields as well as on total farm level production our findings are indicative of the economic consequences in the case of drought events and respond to critical questions such as what the forgone benefits or the economic loss could be if an additional unit of greenw is no longer available for cereal production for wheat production in particular the economic loss in case of frequent drought events will be substantial considering the high contribution of greenw in the production earnings per year 5 3 study limitations as with all economic and crop water use modelling studies our study has certain limitations mostly related to data availability which are worth noting the data which are provided by a global database i e by fao are national level data and hence our model doesn t capture spatial variation moreover we confronted with a lack of data for several variables in the model and also limited data availability for all variables in temporal terms hence we were not able to model per crop type estimates but we rather employed a panel data approach furthermore due to the lack of spatio temporal data we restrict the estimation to average greenw use in reality greenw varies over space and time thus our model estimates are prone to this uncertainly the dynamic determination of greenw use implies that the reported elasticity estimates should be interpreted as proxies within a range of uncertainty 5 4 future perspectives high resolution datasets are eligible for exploratory purposes but come at the expense of the reliability and validity of findings local data would be more preferable in regards to crop coefficients and cropping pattern e g planting and harvesting dates farming practices etc such information would probably improve the precision of our estimates and would also allow for modelling each crop type something which can be applied in the future or at countries and regions where such data are available and reliable in addition future assessments could include spatial valuation tools that would account for the variance of greenw availability and demand over space as well as the variance of crop production at local regional or even farm level in such more refined models and downscaled applications a sensitivity analysis can be applied to account for model uncertainties e g zhuo et al 2014 67 furthermore the temporal dimension which is critical in the case of precipitation and therefore greenw could be better captured with more refined datasets including the variability of greenw between wet dry and average years from an ecosystem perspective greenw flow supports biomass provision food fibre and fodder but at the same time is vital for non economic biomass provision like weeds and vegetation in open drainage ditches 44 50 this enables a trade off between food sufficiency and nature conservation monetary estimates of greenw offer valuable insights on this debate future research is essentially required to estimate the value of greenw in the provision of both agricultural and non agricultural ecosystem services which would enable more informed decisions and policy making regarding the use of land and water

8702,a great majority of agricultural water is provided by precipitation that is stored in soil moisture defined as green water this water evaporates or transpires through plants and plays a determinative role in crop growth particularly for rainfed agriculture this study aims to assess the economic value of green water production factor that has often been ignored in the literature as the focus was mainly given on blue water resources we employed the production function valuation method and specify a cobb douglas production function using cereal production in the czech republic as a case study green water use was quantified through cropwat model using year to year precipitation and evapotranspiration data at a national level for the period 1993 2014 the green water use values were incorporated into the production function and the marginal value of green water was elicited by computing its marginal contribution with annual average crop market prices estimations were based on empirical time series data at the national level the marginal value of green water ranged from 17 to 25 usd 1000 m3 to our best of knowledge this is the first study that reveals the value of green water and its contribution in the production value of cereals compared to other production factors our findings complement previous studies regarding the crop productivity of green water we conclude with policy implications of the study findings highlighting the use of green water value estimations in the compilation of water accounts as emerged in the system of environmental economic accounting for water keywords green water economic valuation production function water accounts 1 introduction green water greenw stands for the proportion of precipitation water which infiltrates into the unsaturated zone of soil and is temporarily stored in soil and in vegetation canopy 12 14 45 46 the greenw concept was introduced in the mid 1990s by falkenmark 70 who highlighted its importance as a valuable water resource since then the researcher community e g savenije 2000 49 rockström 2001 44 rijsberman 2006 43 liu et al 2009 32 hanasaki et al 2010 21 aldaya et al 2010 1 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012a b 23 24 schyns et al 2015 50 as well as global initiatives such as the isric fao green water initiative tried to raise attention regarding this water resource at global scale almost 60 of the precipitation ends up as greenw resource 38 being almost exclusively consumed by crops as well as by other terrestrial ecosystems 31 in the study by mekonnen and hoekstra 34 it is reported that greenw accounts for more than 80 of the total consumptive water use for crop production equivalent to 5771 km3 year at the global scale with cereal crops such as wheat rice and maize taking the largest share of total greenw use similar findings were also reported by previous global assessments studies 11 31 51 despite the strong evidence regarding the importance of greenw and the recognition of its significant contribution to food production by the scientific community and international institutions studies on greenw are still scarce policy and research attention has been mainly given to blue water resources i e the water that partly runs off to the ocean via rivers and groundwater and is the resource that is used for irrigation as well as drinking purposes 25 26 50 for an extensive review see hackbart et al 20 blue water compared to greenw is more manageable and can be re distributed to other uses through engineering applications 11 68 however water scarcity issues require attention to both types of water resources 26 65 the limited number of previous studies that refer to greenw assessment followed either a water footprint quantification approach or impact assessment frameworks e g seibert and döll 2010 51 pfister et al 2011 40 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 34 nuñez et al 2013 36 chenoweth et al 2014 4 quinteiro et al 2015 42 garrido et al 2010 17 hoekstra et 2012a 23 schyns and hoekstra 2014 57 in these assessments the consumptive use and productivity of water is typically computed on average terms for a certain number of years e g a decade in this study we investigate the contribution of greenw in cereal crops production under rainfed agriculture in czech republic both the country and the crop group were selected due to their high dependence on greenw use 1 1 cereals crops require significant greenw 51 and greenw footprint of cereal crops was found almost three times higher in eastern europe than in northern and western regions 35 greenw in rainfed agriculture refers to the actual evaporation or evapotranspiration 27 50 62 and more precisely to the transpiration and soil evaporation 11 given the vital role of greenw in biomass production and the limited number of studies on greenw valuation we aim to address this knowledge gap by exploring both conceptually and empirically the valuation of greenw at national scale our objective is to estimate the crop greenw productivity in marginal terms i e the change in the output of crop production when one additional unit of water is used for this we employ the production function method various methods including the residual value mathematical programming and hedonic pricing have been employed in past empirical studies to estimate the contribution and the economic value of freshwater 2 2 market price or unit resource rent price methods cannot reflect the value of water resources let alone greenw resource as water is usually not priced at its marginal value 34 36 in cases where water price estimates were available research focus was on blue water and on water basins 5 41 in several sectors e g graveline 2016 19 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that attempts to assess the monetary value of greenw in shadow price terms the selection of the production function method was decided in line with the recommendations provided by the system of environmental economic accounting seea 61 regarding the eligibility of economic valuation methods 9 37 61 recent studies in ecosystem accounting suggest that greenw should be incorporated into accounting in line with seea framework and call for a better consistency in the system of environmental economic accounting framework for water 3 3 seea water is the statistical framework that integrates data on both environmental and economic aspects of water supply and use seea water 30 48 60 to this end our empirical outcomes aim to demonstrate an application of production function method that can facilitate the compilation of water accounts in the future 2 case study area the czech republic is located in central europe its area covers 78 866 km2 and is inhabited by 10 5 million people the climate is temperate continental with blending of oceanic and continental effects the average annual temperature for the studied period 1993 2014 ranged between 6 3 c and 9 4 c while the 1961 1990 long term air temperature normal being 7 5 c the average annual precipitation ranged between 516 mm and 867 mm over the studied period with long term precipitation normal 1961 1990 being 674 mm 7 the fluctuation of temperature and precipitation patters influences the irregular occurrence of drought and flood events in the czech republic 54 long periods of low precipitation have a significant impact on agriculture within the study period draughts have been recorded in the years 2000 2003 2007 2009 2012 and 2014 54 an excessive rainfall has also a negative impact on agricultural production i e after reaching a rainfall water amount threshold the production decreases to account for these variations in greenw estimations and its contribution to production function we use aggregated yearly precipitation values at the national level in 2014 the agricultural land accounted for more than 54 of the total area of the country while 99 5 of the agricultural land was non irrigated 64 the main agricultural crops produced in the czech republic are cereals of which wheat and barley are the most harvested the study considers all cereal crops grown in the country between 1993 and 2014 table 1 this period covers 10 years before and after the country s accession to the european union during this period cereal crop production had been decreasing in both harvested area and output while the gross production value showed a slightly increasing trend 3 methods and data 3 1 green water use calculations several models have been developed to quantify the consumptive crop water use such as impact 55 and gcwm global crop water model 51 in this study the year to year greenw use by cereal crops in czech republic was quantified using the fao s cropwat model and the crop water requirement option 3 52 as suggested by hoekstra et al 25 this model is commonly used in crop water use assessments e g stancalie et al 2010 53 surendran et al 2015 56 crop water requirement at the field level m3 ha is defined as the total water needed for evapotranspiration from planting to harvest for a given crop under a specific climate regime it is assumed that cereal crops grow under optimal conditions meaning that sufficient soil water is maintained by rainfall or irrigation so that it does not limit plant growth and crop yield under this assumption crop evapotranspiration et c c mm day is equal to crop water requirements and is calculated as follows 1 e t c c k c c e t 0 where et 0 mm day is the reference evapotranspiration and k c dimensionless is the crop coefficient of cereal crop c that incorporates the crop characteristics and the effects of soil evaporation the green crop evapotranspiration of each cereal crop et green c mm day is calculated as follows 2 e t g r e e n c min e t c c p e f f where p eff mm day is the effective rainfall defined as the part of the total amount of precipitation that is retained by the soil so that it is potentially available for meeting the water need of a crop there are various methods to compute effective rainfall based on total rainfall in this study effective precipitation is calculated based on the widely used method of the soil conservation service of the united states department of agriculture as suggested by smith 52 the irrigation blue water requirements can be calculated as the difference between the crop water requirement and effective precipitation however as the study focuses on greenw use the blue water component was not computed also compared to greenw blue water requirement is typically negligible in cereal crops grown in czech republic 18 crop water use refers to the total volume of water that is consumed by a crop over a growing season the total greenw use per cereal crop and year greenw m3 year is calculated by summing the daily crop evapotranspiration over the complete growth period from day 1 as follows 3 green w c t 10 d 1 l p e t g r e e n c t a c t where the factor 10 is applied to convert the estimated crop evapotranspiration that is in mm to m3 ha lp denotes the length of growing period in days and a ha year is the total harvested area of each cereal crop c in year t 3 2 production function method the production function method estimates the value of a non marketed factor by assessing its contribution as an input into the production process of a commercially marketed good it is a micro economic method based on empirical data and it models how each input contributes to the production output the contribution is revealed through the marginal productivity indicator this indicator shows the effect on total production i e total quantity of produced output associated to the use of an additional unit of the selected factor to compute the monetary value of factors marginal productivity is multiplied by the output market price these estimations are provided by the first order conditions f o c of the maximization problem subject to certain restrictions 19 33 in the case that the production factor is provided by the ecosystem as with greenw and at no cost it can be internalized in the maximization problem through the introduction of shadow prices as follows 4 max y p i q i c i j l i k i z i λ i e i s t q i f l i k i z i e i and l i k i z i e i 0 where i is a commodity j is input p is the output price q is the output quantity l is labor k is capital and z is the other inputs e denotes the ecosystem input c the cost per unit and λ the implicit value or shadow price of ecosystem input the implicit price of ecosystem input is estimated by solving for f o c 5 ϑ y ϑ e i 0 ϑ q i ϑ e i p i λ i 0 λ i ϑ q i ϑ e i p i 3 3 cobb douglas function and model specifications cobb douglas cd production function is a commonly employed function to describe the technical relationship between the inputs and outputs of a production process the function has been widely used for estimating the contribution of inputs in crop e g yao 1996 66 and fish production e g karagiannis and katranidis 2000 28 ali et al 2016 2 as well as the contribution of water as a resource input in several sectors e g onofri et al 2017 39 wang and lall 2002 63 a classical cd function takes the form q a x 1 b 1 x n b n where b 1 n denote elasticities the elasticity of a production factor indicates the percentage change in the production output due to a percentage change in the use of the production input given that all other inputs remain unchanged by applying the log to the function the classic cd production function is transposed in a linear form as follows 6 l n q l n a b 1 l n x 1 b n l n x n the classic form of cd function may be susceptible to certain limitations due to the assumptions of additivity and homogeneity to overcome such limitations alternative representations of the function are often been employed by researchers the most widely applied is the transcendental logarithmic or translog production function representation 28 63 the function takes the following form 6 7 l n q l n a i 1 n b i l n x i i 1 n b i i l n 2 x i 2 i 1 n j 1 m b i j l n x i l n x j the elasticity of production with respect to each input is calculated by taking the partial derivative of output with respect to the input under consideration as follows 8 η i ϑ l n q ϑ l n x i b i b i i l n x i j 1 m b i j l n x j marginal productivity is calculated as 9 σ i ϑ q ϑ x

function is specified as 10 q f l f p m t f g r e e n w a where the dependent variable q is the production output and the independent variables stand for labor l fertilizers f pesticides p harvesting equipment m transport fuel tf greenw use greenw and harvested crop area a we performed two model specifications model 1 is specified in a translog form eq 7 model 2 is the same as model 1 but it includes crop specific interactions with greenw input for the five most important cereal crop species the models were analyzed in a panel data structure i e for 10 different cereal crops and for 22 time periods specified in years the assumption that the error components are independently and identically distributed idd is rarely realistic with panel data and ordinary least squares error estimates may not be efficient the error terms can be treated as fixed or random parameters to be estimated a fixed effect model introduces a matrix of dummy variables that correspond to the observations of each group of the panel this is called least square dummy variable lsdv model due to the introduction of dummies that capture the specific shocks caused by the panel structure 8 our models were first specified as one way fixed effect models that account for group here the group refers to crop type specific shocks next we also explored the two way fixed effect models that account for time specific shocks the analysis was performed using the nlogit 6 software package econometric software inc plainview ny usa 3 4 data and assumptions 3 4 1 green water data for the calculation of greenw use daily potential evapotranspiration and precipitation values for czech republic over the period 1993 2014 were obtained from the high resolution dataset cru cy v 3 24 01 of 22 these data refer to the daily average conditions at the national level crop planting and harvesting dates were obtained from sacks et al 47 and crop coefficients from allen et al 3 a range of planting and harvesting dates was tested i e early average and late yet no significant differences were found in greenw use thus for simplicity we assumed that cereals were planted and harvested in the mid average range of each period respectively the total production and harvested area per cereal crop per year was derived from the faostat database as reported at country level cropwat model revealed the greenw consumption per crop type table 2 presents the mean consumption per crop type during the time period 1993 2014 on average cereal crops consumed around 385 million m3 year of greenw or 2199 m3 ha year 3 4 2 production function factors based on available data the following production inputs have been identified 4 4 according to the farm accountancy data network fadn report ec 2014 10 60 of the main costs of farms producing common wheat in the czech republic originated from the non specific costs i e transport fuel machinery buildings upkeep and by and the specific ones i e seeds fertilizers crop protection and water labor paid and unpaid accounted for almost 20 of the production cost labour fertilizers pesticides machinery equipment transport fuels and harvested area the data were obtained from faostat database 15 with the exception of harvested area all other production inputs data were not provided by each crop but rather were available at an aggregated level in order to approximate the data of inputs for each cereal crop we assumed weights which were specified in accordance to the share of each crop to the total production output of all crops as in yao 1996 66 missing values 5 5 for fertilizers and pesticides inputs almost half of the data were missing for the rest of inputs the shortage was less severe with missing cases to represent around 15 30 of sample size of data were filled using linear interpolations table 3 4 results table 4 presents the estimated parameters of the one way fixed effects econometric models of translog specification where decreasing return to scale and substitution effects are accounted for the r2 value showed an adequate fit of models the fixed effect coefficients table 1 appendix were found statistically significant for model 1 implying that variation in crop production can be explained by crop specific factors that are not captured by the independent variables considering the f statistics test the null hypothesis that the ordinary least squares model is better than the one way fixed effects model was rejected in both models 1 and 2 the results of the two way fixed model of translog model 1 are reported in table 2 appendix 6 6 the two way fixed effect models table 3 appendix showed statistically significant time specific coefficients for model 1 while model 2 of the thanslog specification with interactions didn t converge to a solution the null hypothesis of a one way fixed effects model being more appropriate than a two way fixed effects one was rejected at 0 02 significance level in model 1 on this basis we decided to leave the two way fixed effect models results out of the core body of the manuscript and proceed with calculations considering only the one way fixed effects models most of the production inputs had positive elasticities as expected table 5 harvested land showed the largest contribution in crop production with elasticity level being close to 0 9 the elasticity of greenw ranged from 0 04 to 0 06 indicating that a 10 increase in greenw would result in a 0 4 0 6 increase in crop production all other things being equal this is a sizeable effect on food provision also compared to the effect of other production inputs the interaction terms revealed the relationship between these inputs greenw is positively related to land as expected and hence the marginal effect of greenw on crop production is determined by the size of harvested land the estimates of elasticity of greenw per crop type ranged from 0 1 to 0 79 table 5 maize and wheat presented the highest elasticity estimates a 10 increase in greenw use would cause almost an 8 increase in the maize production and a 6 in wheat production considering that maize is the third most important crop in the czech republic in terms of harvested area this outcome highlights the important role of greenw in cereal production at national level 7 7 all estimates are provided under the assumptions that coefficients of inputs are the same across the different crop types where an average country level greenw value varies per year the former does not take into account that production depends on a crop specific technology i e over the study period we assume constant production technology while the latter disregard the dynamic use of greenw which depends on crop specific needs that change dynamically over space and time as well as the precipitation rate these assumptions were regarded necessary given data availability we provide the results of a classic cd function per crop type and greenw estimates for three different planting and harvesting dates in supplementary material a translog model per crop type could not be feasible since there are only 22 observations per crop table 6 reports the marginal productivity the implicit price or value and the economic return of greenw i e the value of the average use of input in crop production one additional unit i e 1000 m3 of greenw increases crop production by 0 9 to 0 13 tonnes given the estimates of marginal productivity we elicited the implicit price of greenw implicit price estimates were based on producer prices in usd kg for the time period 2004 2014 which were available only for wheat barley maize oats and triticale this should be regarded as an approximation and subject to price volatilities within years the impicit price of greenw ranged from 17 to 25 usd 1000 m3 the economic return or contribution of greenw to crop production ranged between 6 5 and 9 6 million usd per year in table 7 we report the estimates of average and marginal product of greenw in the four most important crop types in czech republic oats has been neglected due to the negative estimated elasticity although the average product across maize wheat barley and triticale was ranged at almost the same level in marginal terms the picture was different one additional unit of greenw would increase wheat and maize production at almost ten times the size of effect on barley or triticale maize and wheat showed the highest greenw implicit price with the price ranging between 221 and 368 usd 1000 m3 which is almost ten times larger than the implicit price of barley and triticale as well as that of cereal crops on average for wheat a value of approximately 460 million usd per year is generated by the provision of greenw this is due to the high consumption of greenw per year for wheat production and the high implicit price of greenw that result to high implicit cost of ecosystem input that is not internalized in the production function 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 overview of findings this study employed the production function method to estimate the marginal productivity as well as the value of green water greenw in cereal crops production the production function was specified as a cobb douglas cd function where the coefficients of production factors represent elasticities i e the increase of crop production given a increase in the production factor greenw elasticities ranged between 0 04 and 0 06 implying that a 10 increase in greenw use would result in 0 4 0 6 increase of cereal crop production this is substantial compared also to the corresponding elasticity estimates of the other production inputs the elasticity estimates were used for assessing the value of marginal productivity and the shadow value of greenw the marginal productivity and the implicit value of greenw were assessed within the range of 0 09 0 12 tonnes 1000 m3 and 17 25 usd 1000 m3 respectively the model with crop interactions revealed that the marginal productivity and value of greenw for maize and wheat were at the highest level compared to other crop estimates with respect to overall greenw contribution wheat is the crop with the highest overall benefits which is expected given the high yearly harvested area and the consumption of greenw for wheat production both indications i e marginal and return value reflect the contribution of greenw in the economy that is often ignored in literature these figures complement previous water footprint studies that focus on the consumptive use of water in crop production as a first step towards greenw valuation greenw use per year is estimated for each cereal crop at the national level and is then incorporated as a component in a crop production function this enables the estimation of marginal crop productivity of greenw where additional to water other production inputs have been accounted for 5 2 policy implications the valuation of greenw offers important insights for the compilation of water accounts and their integration to the environmental economic accounting in national accounts ecosystem accounting is a relatively recent research domain that attracts increasing interest for water resources in particular the seea water 60 includes all water resources and more specifically surface groundwater blue water as well as soil water here defined as greenw examples of water accounts that include also greenw resources are still scarce the production function method that was employed here is concurrent with the objectives of the seea principles 61 physical supply and use tables are the primary tables that countries are expected to compile while monetary accounts are optional depending on data availability and policy willingness 61 our estimates facilitate both parts of the accounts in the case of cereal crops for the czech republic the same approach can be applied to all crops and can integrate all water resources i e green and blue water subject to data availability the valuation of water resources has policy implications in water resource management climate change adaptation policies and conservation policy water resource management calls for decisions on land use and allocation of both blue and green water resources considering that both are interrelated and under a scarcity threat 58 economic returns and efficiency are part of the criteria in decision making 39 according to our czech republic case study findings wheat maize and barley attain the highest economic returns as well as the highest efficiency of greenw use this may be important information in policy making and land use scenario assessments along with social economic and technological factors that determine demand and reallocation of crop production in czech republic greenw depends on climate factors i e temperature precipitation as well as on land use population growth and technological developments hydro geological studies have questioned before how climate change may affect the stability of the green blue water ratio e g konar et al 2016 29 moreover research conducted in czech republic e g potova et al 2015 69 trnka et al 2016 59 showed the increasing trend of drought events and their effects on crop yields as well as on total farm level production our findings are indicative of the economic consequences in the case of drought events and respond to critical questions such as what the forgone benefits or the economic loss could be if an additional unit of greenw is no longer available for cereal production for wheat production in particular the economic loss in case of frequent drought events will be substantial considering the high contribution of greenw in the production earnings per year 5 3 study limitations as with all economic and crop water use modelling studies our study has certain limitations mostly related to data availability which are worth noting the data which are provided by a global database i e by fao are national level data and hence our model doesn t capture spatial variation moreover we confronted with a lack of data for several variables in the model and also limited data availability for all variables in temporal terms hence we were not able to model per crop type estimates but we rather employed a panel data approach furthermore due to the lack of spatio temporal data we restrict the estimation to average greenw use in reality greenw varies over space and time thus our model estimates are prone to this uncertainly the dynamic determination of greenw use implies that the reported elasticity estimates should be interpreted as proxies within a range of uncertainty 5 4 future perspectives high resolution datasets are eligible for exploratory purposes but come at the expense of the reliability and validity of findings local data would be more preferable in regards to crop coefficients and cropping pattern e g planting and harvesting dates farming practices etc such information would probably improve the precision of our estimates and would also allow for modelling each crop type something which can be applied in the future or at countries and regions where such data are available and reliable in addition future assessments could include spatial valuation tools that would account for the variance of greenw availability and demand over space as well as the variance of crop production at local regional or even farm level in such more refined models and downscaled applications a sensitivity analysis can be applied to account for model uncertainties e g zhuo et al 2014 67 furthermore the temporal dimension which is critical in the case of precipitation and therefore greenw could be better captured with more refined datasets including the variability of greenw between wet dry and average years from an ecosystem perspective greenw flow supports biomass provision food fibre and fodder but at the same time is vital for non economic biomass provision like weeds and vegetation in open drainage ditches 44 50 this enables a trade off between food sufficiency and nature conservation monetary estimates of greenw offer valuable insights on this debate future research is essentially required to estimate the value of greenw in the provision of both agricultural and non agricultural ecosystem services which would enable more informed decisions and policy making regarding the use of land and water

8703,forests worldwide provide a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration soil protection and water purification in particular the minimal use of pesticides and fertilizers in forest operations coupled with the tree root system are associated with higher drinking water quality however forest coverage is expected to have a more influential impact in groundwater quality rather than surface as well as consequently on drinking water treatment costs this study uses cross sectional data at firm level to assess the marginal effect of forest cover on drinking water treatment costs for the case of portugal the first of its kind for the country our analysis makes use of a range of gis and spatial variables which capture the heterogeneity in local forest coverage the results obtained suggest the existence of a positive and significant effect of local forest cover on water treatment cost savings of 0 056 however this effect applies to firms extracting water from groundwater intakes neighboring measures of forest coverage have a greater impact on costs from surface water firms the crucial role of local forest coverage through groundwater provision relates to a problem of intertemporal variation of those costs given the expected impact of climate change on precipitation in some regions where drinking water is mostly supplied by groundwater intakes and since around 97 of forest land is privately owned these results may suggest that appropriate incentives e g payments for ecosystem services could contribute to ensuring the sustainable use of water and forest resources keywords water purification forest coverage water treatment costs jel codes q23 q25 1 introduction forests provide a variety of important ecosystem services ranging from market goods or services including timber cork energy or food extraction to non market benefits such as carbon sequestration recreation habitat preservation soil conservation and importantly the protection of watershed areas 1 2 compared to other land uses especially agriculture forests reduce storm water run off and trap suspended solids caused by topsoil water erosion preventing them from reaching surface water systems 3 4 the dense network of forest roots further acts as a filter reducing pollutant levels of the water passing through and moderating excessive levels of nutrients that would otherwise contaminate the watershed groundwater system 5 6 water purification is one of the most valuable ecosystem services provided by forests and significantly influences the local ecology and human health 7 9 the european union forest strategy recommends the maintenance and enhancement of forest cover to protect soils and regulate both quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater resources 7 9 in many regions forest and water policies are considered complementary and designed on the assumption that under any hydrological and ecological circumstance forest is the best land cover to maximize water yield regulate seasonal flows and ensure high water quality 10 as the world s population increases there is increased pressure for land conversion from forest to other land covers including agriculture and urban land resulting in forest loss and fragmentation 6 11 at the same time the demand for drinking water is increasing 11 which coupled with forest loss translates into higher costs for the provision of drinking water 4 the link between forest coverage and either water quality or drinking water treatment costs has been addressed by several studies including the 4 5 8 12 13 and 6 among others these studies suggest that forests can be an effective land cover for intercepting and removing water pollutants which helps to protect raw water quality forest cover is associated with reduced drinking water treatment costs as large capital costs can be avoided by water treatment plants 4 highlight different cases across the world where watershed protection schemes were created to foster reduced capital and operational costs of water treatment however the authors note that further information is needed regarding the causal relationship between land cover and hydrological services before planning and implementing proper watershed protection one of the most successful watershed protection project was implemented in new york city by spending 1 5 billion in restoring and protecting the catskills forest watershed the city avoided building a new filtration plant and saved at least 6 billion as well as 300 million in annual operating costs 4 more recent empirical work estimated the impact of land cover on treatment costs in different contexts 1 1 other studies explore the link between water quality and forest cover 6 find that a percent conversion of forest coverage to urban area in the united states increases turbidity in the watershed by 3 9 while 18 estimate an increase of 2 9 of turbidity and 0 59 of total organic carbon if a 1 of forest coverage in the united states is converted into alternative land covers e g urban or agricultural 38 further find significantly higher water quality in the forested watersheds of brazil comparing with agricultural or urban land 13 is one of the few studies that has investigated environmental aspects of water treatment costs in tropical regions namely in malaysia the results obtained suggest that by avoiding conversion of 1 of virgin forest to other land covers drinking water treatment costs savings are estimated to be 0 47 the authors also point out that this contribution is larger than that obtained in the case of logged forests 2 2 generally natural forests contribute to higher water quality due to a higher infiltration rate less soil erosion and mitigated pollutants managed forests on the other hand require several interventions to ensure viability and improve biomass productivity and quality namely soil scarification and the introduction of fertilizers 39 40 which can have lasting impacts on water quality in the context of temperate regions 14 estimate a price reduction of 0 003 per m3 of water for french domestic users in response to a one percent increase in forest cover while 15 estimate savings in drinking water price of 0 011 per m3 per hectare of forest cover on the vosges department in north eastern france the mechanisms affecting a firm s cost structure however may depend on whether water is collected from surface or groundwater intakes the technological and chemical treatment processes vary for the two types of water intakes since groundwater tends to be of higher quality compared to surface water 16 3 3 regarding groundwater after a period of rain water infiltrates into the unsaturated zone and then percolates into the saturated zone passing through a process of filtration which is better in forest covered soils compared to agricultural land water may be stored in unconfined and confined aquifers the later type enclosed in two impermeable rock layers in portugal there are 62 aquifer systems which store the bulk of groundwater and are responsible for 44 of public water supply 50 of industry and 80 of agriculture water may travel more than 1000 m a day in porous formations and less than 1 mm a day in clay formations 41 in the case of surface water aquifers are more likely to be used for water supply and thus more likely to be threaten by diffuse pollution achieving appropriate quality of drinking water from groundwater sources typically only requires a disinfection process while additional procedures are required for surface water due to the excess of nutrients 17 4 4 surface water is characterized by increased acidity and very low mineralization and water treatment firms must implement treatment systems to counter this effect the treatments required and installed in these firms use chemical reagents based on the addition of carbon dioxide and lime moreover when surface water has organic matter content higher than allowed by law 42 additional oxidation processes are necessary namely the use of ozone additionally all firms must have disinfection systems that give the treated surface water a residual free chlorine content that meets the disinfection requirements 42 which depends on the typology and extent of the water supply distribution network for public consumption to the best of our knowledge no previous study has focused on the impact of forest cover on drinking water treatment costs conditional on source of water intake both 6 13 focus on water quality from treatment plants with surface water sources i e rivers or reservoirs while 18 5 5 not peer reviewed only considered water treatment firms with at least 90 of raw water collected on surface water intakes water supply services examined in ref 14 use a mix of both surface and groundwater sources with 72 of water coming from groundwater intakes the authors estimate that higher proportions of groundwater reduce water prices by 0 0046 per m3 of treated water however do not explore varying impacts of forest coverage on prices conditional on water intake sources our work contributes to the literature by identifying the heterogeneous impact of forest cover on firm s costs conditional on water intake source we expect that forest coverage has a greater influence on cost in the case of groundwater intakes due to the natural water filtration in the soil from the trees root system that absorbs phosphorous and nitrates 6 6 this occurs because of the reduction in the instantaneous filtration rate against other types of land cover and from the increased time in which this filtration occurs furthermore when considering deep aquifers greater than 100 m forest cover has no direct influence on refilling these same aquifers this paper explores the impact of forest coverage on drinking water treatment costs using firm portuguese firm level data for 2015 to the best of our knowledge no similar study has been conducted in portugal to date in 2010 forest land accounted for approximately 35 of the country s area 19 of which managed private and community forests account for 97 of the total forest area while the remaining 3 is owned by the state 20 privately held forests are often managed in order to maximize private revenues from both energy and timber products without consideration of potential external benefits from non market environmental good provision since increased water quality is traditionally a non market benefit the service of water purification is likely under provided by markets relative to the socially efficient level recognizing the value of water purification at the country level can inform on the non market value of such land use contributing to aligning private agents behavior with socially optimal practices such values provide an indication on the non market spillover benefits that ecosystem services can have on economic outcomes our analysis finds evidence for portugal that local forest cover have a significant impact on reducing water treatment costs for firms extracting from groundwater intakes but interestingly not for surface water intakes water treatment costs for firms with groundwater intake sources decrease by approximately 0 056 for a one percent increase in local forest cover moreover as in ref 15 we conclude that a firm s treatment costs are also affected by neighboring forest coverage especially in the case of surface water firms we also highlight the important differences in the underlying cost structure of firms extracting water from surface and those using groundwater water intakes this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the analytical and empirical framework accounting for spatial influences localized ecological measures and the heterogeneity of capture points section 3 describes the data while section 4 presents and discusses the empirical results finally section 5 outlines the overarching conclusions of the paper 2 analytical and empirical framework the value of water purification can be estimated using a variety of frameworks including the use of production functions changes in the associated productivity or via replacement costs or preventive expenditures techniques 21 recently many studies have focused on estimating the cost function of drinking water suppliers which is influenced by a variety of productive locational and ecological characteristics 13 15 adding forest cover as a covariate these studies established a negative relationship between the presence of forest and drinking water treatment costs in empirical specifications and in different contexts the firm s cost function depends on the output level i e drinking water volume and production inputs such as treatment chemicals energy labour and capital as well as the quantity and quality of the local natural capital 13 we follow the framework employed in ref 13 to model the cost function of drinking water treatment firms a reduced model of cost for firm i is specified as follows 1 c i f v i x i g i w i l i f i where c i denotes the cost of water treatment v i the drinking water volume and x i a vector of firm specific characteristics e g private or public management other ecological or geographical influences e g precipitation are included in the vector g i while w i is a variable representing whether the firm has at least one groundwater intake finally f i represents the area covered by forests and l i is a vector of other land cover variables denoting the area covered by each land type in order to account for non linear cost functions we take the natural logarithm of costs and continuous covariates and as such these coefficients can be readily interpreted as elasticities we estimate the cost function described in 1 using the following empirical specification 2 l n c i β 0 β 1 l n v i β 2 x i β 3 g i β 4 l n f i β 5 ln f i w i β 6 l n l i ε i we use a firm s total variable annual cost of water treatment as the dependent variable as argued in ref 18 poor water quality may be reflected through both higher capital and operating costs the present work focuses on operating costs which may be due to the greater need for chemicals such as coagulants disinfectants and ph adjusters while higher capital costs may result from higher investment in improved infrastructure because of lower raw water quality in the case of portugal the water treatment sector is highly regulated and subsidized and firms operate in noncompetitive markets therefore in lieu of using the price of water as in refs 14 15 we make use of costs we test whether the role of forest cover differs for surface and groundwater intakes through inference on the coefficients β 4 and β 5 forest coverage is assumed to decrease treatment costs and thus we expect the estimate of β 4 attributed to local forest coverage to be negative this estimate is interpreted as an elasticity measuring the percentage change in treatment cost associated to a percentage change in the per km2 forest coverage we expect that extracting from groundwater intakes results in a more influential role of forests in this case the estimate of the joint effect of β 4 β 5 should be statistically significant and negative 2 1 measurement of local forest land coverage it is important that the measure of forest coverage used accurately reflects the local areas that influence water quality in that region these basins encompass the area where water is drained to any common body of water and where local forest coverage has a great influence on the quality of raw water these are referred to as water catchment areas watersheds or drainage basins to precisely estimate the impact of land cover on water treatment costs the measure of land cover should ideally be calculated for each catchment area these calculations for corresponding catchment areas are often conditional on elevation and the relative location of water intakes using gis data 6 13 18 calculate forest coverage conditional on the watersheds and the location of water intake points in portugal however an exhaustive list of the location of water intake points is not available and we are further not able to match the location of known intake points with individual firms our baseline measure of land usage is thus obtained using municipal boundary delineations representative of a firm since individual firms are aligned with specific municipalities the forest coverage is measured as the area of forest within each firm s boundary this measure of forest coverage however may be inaccurate at representing local forest coverage surrounding water intakes where coverage has the greatest impact we thus employ alternative refinements of our forest coverage the approximate and dated location of water intakes for the country was obtained via maps from the management plans of the watershed units in portugal 22 30 we geo reference the point data for groundwater and surface water intakes in portugal from the available years of 2008 and 2009 identifying 4599 groundwater and 224 surface water intakes across the country this underestimates the true location of capture points for our firms since in 2015 there are reported 5783 groundwater and 264 surface water intakes while we are only able to geo reference a subset of 85 of known surface water and 80 of known groundwater intakes active in 2015 this provides a proxy of all intake locations given the limitations to match water intakes with their corresponding firms in lieu of an exact match we assume all identifiable water intakes located within a firm s boundary to represent the collection of water intakes for this firm instead of identifying catchment areas we construct a buffer radius surrounding each water intake from which the size of forested land is calculated forest coverage is then defined as the size of forested land within 10 km of all water intakes within a given firm s boundary by restricting the measurement of forest coverage around water intakes we remove skewed effects which may come from concentrations or sparsity of forests not near water intakes and likely with very little influence on water quality this may be of particular importance for firms serving large urban areas whereby the use of municipal level forest coverage may underestimate the actual forest coverage of importance near the water capture points thus buffer radii surrounding water intakes better captures the local realities of land coverage as it pertains to water quality 2 2 spatial models and measurement of neighboring forest land coverage the effect of forest coverage on water quality and subsequently on treatment costs presumably has important spatial considerations given the continuous nature of forest and land cover impacts at broad scales in the context of portugal spatial characteristics vary widely from the north to the south of the country 7 7 for example average precipitation in the 10 most northern municipalities is 3 5 times higher than in the 12 most southern municipalities given the nature of dependence of the geology ecology and land coverage between observations it is important to consider whether spatial influences should be incorporated in the model we introduce spatial modeling techniques in two ways first we consider spatial econometric models to account for spatial dependence in the dependent variable or autocorrelation in the residuals and second we construct a variable to explicitly capture and introduce the impact of neighboring forest coverage the motivations to account for spatial dependencies are summarized in ref 31 we test for spatial influences according to a variety of models reflecting the structure of correlation over space in the dependent variable via a spatial lag model through unobservable potentially omitted local aspects via a spatial error model or spill over influences from neighboring covariates via a spatial durbin model each specification respectively includes a spatial lag on the appropriate components to test whether significant neighboring spillover effects exist between firm observations results indicate no underlying spatial influences unaccounted for in the econometric specification 8 8 to test the significance of spatial dependence and autocorrelation we employ the global moran i statistic for spatial autocorrelation from both the dependent variable and the residuals of the estimated models we conduct spatial lagrange multiplier tests on all global models and present the results for the preferred model specifications in table a1 of the appendix the moran i statistic indicates that although there is some positive spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable the residuals of the model do not exhibit any unobserved spatial dependence the spatial lagrange multiplier test diagnostics compares the baseline ols as the restricted model null hypothesis and the spatial autoregressive model i e lag on the dependent variable or spatial error model i e lag on the residuals as the unrestricted model alternative hypothesis this test can effectively consider differences between spatial and non spatial models to determine whether spatial dependence is a result of an omitted spatial lag of the dependent variable or through the error component and suggests no indication of spatial dependence this suggests no additional benefits from including spatial lags in the specification and estimating the respective spatial parameters the second way in which we include spatial spillovers into the estimated model is by explicitly including a variable representing the spatially lagged forest cover 15 use spatially lagged variables representing neighboring municipalities weighted by a distance decay function to account for the effect of broader land coverage on a municipality s water price using the baseline measure of forest cover within the municipality s boundaries it may also be the case that neighboring forest coverage has beneficial filtering properties and thus influences costs especially if catchment areas of water intakes intercept neighboring municipalities we construct measures of the neighboring forest coverage by calculating a spatially lagged variable using of the queen contiguity weight matrix whereby all adjacent firms have equal weight 9 9 to ensure inferences and estimates are not driven by the chosen matrix we also used four other spatial weight matrices to capture varying definitions of neighboring firms three of these are distance based weights including an inverse distance inverse distance squared with strength decaying over space and a binary matrix assigning equal weight to all observations within the given threshold the fourth assigns equal weights to the ten nearest neighbors we define neighboring forested land coverage as the percentage of each adjacent neighbor municipality covered by forests multiplied by the respective size of the neighbor by modeling this effect we are considering that a firm surrounded by higher forest coverage outside its own boundary benefits in terms of reduced costs as ecological characteristics of the terrain are continuous we would expect broader effects coming from neighboring areas in addition to forest coverage within the firm borders in an attempt to explore the heterogeneity of impacts over space while taking into account the physical terrain we further test spatially weighted neighborhood forest cover conditional on having higher elevations than a given firm 3 data description 3 1 water treatment sector in portugal water supply is a recognized public service in portugal obeying a set of principles namely the universality of access continuity and quality of service efficiency and acuity of prices the management structure of public water supply services is fundamentally based on the creation of multi municipal systems that are mainly responsible for the abstraction and treatment of water and municipal systems mostly responsible for distribution multi municipal systems are state owned entities that serve at least two municipalities and require the intervention of the state to ensure the provision of this service so as to meet the national interest in mainland portugal a single multi municipal system entity águas de portugal captures and treats the water supply in 234 of the 278 municipalities representing 80 of the population according to the national regulating entity of water and waste services 17 municipal systems on the other hand consist of municipalities acting alone 96 in 2015 or jointly associations of municipalities or in partnership with the state carrying out the distribution operations of water supply municipal ownership firms are the unit of analysis in this paper hereby referred to as firms the supply of drinking water in municipal ownership systems is provided by firms under three different management regimes 1 direct management through municipal services or association of municipalities 2 delegated management through established partnerships with the state local business companies without state participation or parish council and 3 concessionary management through a municipal concessionaire 17 direct management is the most common practice with 70 of municipalities and 54 of the population being served by firms in this regime 17 there is an increasing trend from public to private management in the sector in 2000 the figure of privately management firms was 20 having increased to 48 by 2015 17 the average number of surface water intake points per firm is only 0 79 while the average number of groundwater sources per firm is 20 3 17 there may be multiple capture and treatment stations per firm although not all need be operational at the same time some water intakes may be strategic for an extreme period of drought while others are not operational due to a new surface reservoir centralizing the service of water supply while in absolute terms groundwater intakes are dominant 5783 groundwater locations exist compared to 264 surface water intakes approximately 67 of distributed water volume is collected through surface water sources while only 33 is collected from groundwater sources 17 our geographic water treatment firm observations correspond to the municipality delimited area that each firm serves it is from these zones that land cover and geological data are calculated see section 3 3 total cost data yearly operating and maintenance costs is available for 265 firms in the country referring to the year 2015 17 of these 30 observations were excluded either due to missing cost data or the inability to geo reference the local municipalities with the firms which service them overall 235 observations at the national level were kept covering the 278 municipalities in continental portugal 3 2 firm characteristics data all data on firm characteristics described in this section were collected from ref 17 which is the annual report by ersar the regulatory agency of the water and waste sector in portugal table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the cost and firm specific covariates firms supplying drinking water to primarily urbanized areas are expected to reap from economies of production density which would imply a negative coefficient associated with this dummy variable we would also expect that if privately run firms such as firms under concession or delegated managements are cost minimizers then these management types should be associated with lower costs relative to publically managed firms 15 however find evidence that privately operated firms have higher water prices similar to previous work 6 13 15 we include the volume of captured raw water as an input for the production of drinking water total supplied tap water in 2015 amounted to 1003 million m3 17 the coefficient associated with the natural log of water volume β 1 can be readily interpreted as a cost elasticity indicating whether these firms have decreasing constant or increasing returns to size 32 to test whether groundwater and surface water mechanisms vary in terms of how they relate to the water purification service the groundwater dummy variable takes the value one for firms that collect water from at least one groundwater intake and zero otherwise 3 3 land cover and geographic variables many factors affect water quality namely climate geology topography and land cover highlighting the capacity of forests to provide water purification services several of these variables that may affect water quality were controlled for and are summarized in table 2 land cover measures reflect forest agriculture urban and cork oak woodlands land covers as extracted from the corine land cover 2012 10 10 corine land cover data for 2012 available from http land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc 2012 by considering the natural logarithm of these variables in the estimated model the corresponding coefficient estimates are interpreted directly as elasticities of water treatment costs with respect to the size of each type of land cover it is expected that forest coverage is associated with lower water treatment costs due to water purification while both agricultural and urban land cover are expected to be positively related with those costs this is due to water quality degradation from increased nitrogen and phosphorous due to agricultural practices and organic matter and suspended solids from urban uses intensive agricultural practices including the use of synthetic fertilizers may result in fertilizers reaching nearby groundwater resources through leaching particularly if the resource is shallow or reach surface water by run off and subsoil drainage 5 14 yielding increased water treatment costs cork oak woodlands are included as a separate land class variable given their prevalence in portugal despite being considered agroforested land in the corine land cover the environmental impacts in terms of fertilizers and pesticides use associated with cork oak woodlands are lower in comparison to more traditional agricultural uses 33 slope is calculated as percentage points using the digital elevation model over europe eu dem 11 11 digital elevation model map data available from https www eea europa eu data and maps data eu dem precipitation is included at the firm level as the average annual precipitation climatologically normal for the 30 year period of 1971 2000 using the maps from instituto português do mar e da atmosfera ipma as no data is available for 2015 12 12 precipitation map data available from http portaldoclima pt pt data on the proportion of rock types were collected from the lithological map available from the environmental atlas from agência portuguesa do ambiente 13 13 gis data available from http sniamb apambiente pt home default htm four categories granite limestone schist and quartzite are considered and the respective proportion of each rock type within the firm s area of influence was calculated other variables such as temperature and soil type were considered but dropped as control variables the impact of temperature on water quality is seasonal and site specific while our analysis is annual and at the country level the type of soil may influence groundwater quality but how soil influences water quality is a complex mechanism beyond the scope of the paper 4 results fig 1 and fig 2 illustrate how the water treatment cost per cubic meter of water and the proportion of forest are spatially distributed for the 235 firms considered municipalities further from the coast appear to have a lower proportion of forest cover as well as a higher cost per cubic meter of treated water compared with municipalities in the west 4 1 model selection the breusch pagan test suggests evidence of heteroskedastic errors p value of 0 044 to account for heteroscedasticity we use both robust and wild bootstrapped clustered standard errors using the eight national watersheds as clusters 14 14 if the regressors and the errors are correlated within cluster then estimation is inefficient and standard errors need to be adjusted to account for the clustered nature of the data 43 in our application there are natural clusters at watershed level a total of 8 clusters however this is a case of a small number of clusters for which the wild cluster bootstrap instead of the more common cluster robust standard errors leads to significant improvement on the efficiency of the estimated parameters avoiding over rejections 43 as expected using both robust and clustered standard errors increases the p values and avoids over rejection of insignificance of parameters compared with standard errors not accounting for the heteroscedastic nature of the data however in terms of inference either using clustered or robust standard errors yields the same conclusions especially in what concerns the variables of interest the preferred practice is thus to account for robust standard errors to capture potential underlying influences attributed to differences in the raw water characteristics we further include fixed effects at the watershed level this captures locational differences in source water across the country that may inherently influence the cost eight dummies are included in all model specifications which yields the least squares dummy variable estimators for these covariates as the mean variance inflated ratio vif is lower than 10 we disregard the problem of multicollinearity land cover variables however especially agricultural and urban land seem to be highly correlated with other covariates vifs of 10 79 and 9 83 respectively and thus we do not make hard inferences regarding these covariates as the firms main output water volume is an important driver of treatment cost 13 however it may also be a decision variable from the perspective of water treatment firms and both 14 15 find evidence that water volume is endogenous to account for endogeneity 15 estimated a two stage least squares 2sls model consisting of both a cost function and a demand function for drinking water given the potential endogeneity of water volume we implement an instrumental variable specification with instruments for water volume ideal instruments should not have an impact on costs directly yet should be highly linked to the volume of water treated we use evapotranspiration and the municipal population level as valid instruments for treated water volume terrestrial evapotranspiration is the sum of water vapour from soil evaporation wet canopy evaporation and plant transpiration that returns to the atmosphere 34 evapotranspiration has a direct and indirect impact on the quantity of water rather than quality by decreasing the run off and changing the concentration of nutrients on surface water the number of residents per area of influence of each firm was collected from the census 2011 which has geo referenced data of the number of residents within each municipality 15 15 census 2011 data can be found at http mapas ine pt download index2011 phtml higher populations within the municipality should be correlated with water volume treated per firm due to increased demand for quantity of drinking water our diagnostics indicate that the null hypothesis of the hausman test is rejected implying that water volume is indeed an endogenous variable the number of residents and evapotranspiration appear to be both valid and strong instruments 16 16 the null hypothesis of the sargan test is not rejected meaning the instruments are valid and the model is correctly specified and the first stage statistics suggest strong instruments in explaining water volume our preferred model is thus a 2sls model using number of residents and evapotranspiration as instrumental variables with fixed effects eight watershed dummies and robust standard errors 4 2 main results the covariates included in the model are the natural logarithm of treated water volume dummies for delegated and concession management regimes a dummy representing whether the municipality is mostly urbanized average precipitation and slope within the municipality proportion of area covered by granite schist limestone and quartzite rock forest cover measures and other land cover variables agricultural urban and cork oak woodlands coverage full regression results are presented in table a2 in the appendix we present specifications which differ in terms of the measurement of the forest cover variable the coefficients of which are presented in table 3 the coefficient of our baseline measure of forest cover coverage within municipality boundaries is insignificant across all specifications models 1 3 and 4 as expected however the interaction term of forest coverage within municipality and the groundwater dummy is always negative and significant for firms extracting water from at least one groundwater intake relative to those without groundwater intakes a 1 increase in forest cover within the municipality results in reductions of water treatment costs around 0 043 if instead we consider the coverage of forest 10 km surrounding known water intakes the main results regarding significance remain unchanged with elasticities of 0 026 in models 2 and 5 there is a slight decrease in magnitude which suggests that using the entire municipal forest coverage may overestimate the true impact of coverage surrounding intake points incorporating neighboring forest coverage from adjacent municipalities seems to improve the fit of the model compared with the baseline as seen in models 3 and 5 suggesting that it is important to consider broader effects from forest coverage this result is in line with 15 who find evidence that ecological processes with impact on water quality seem also to be affected by land covers in the surrounding areas to each firm s influence however the coefficient associated with neighboring forest coverage conditional on higher elevations model 4 is insignificant and yields an adjusted r squared lower than alternative models using the refined model which includes both forest coverage in 10 km of water intakes and neighboring forest coverage measures yields the model with the best fit it is thus important for firms to consider the land use at the extraction point of water but also the broader ecological processes stemming from nearby areas this model indicates that both the interaction effect of forest coverage in 10 km and groundwater dummy is negative and significant as well as the size of neighboring forest coverage the joint elasticity of all three forest measures is negative and significant and approximately 0 12 this is the highest elasticity estimated for the joint effect for companies extracting from at least one groundwater intake which range from 0 035 to 0 12 adding the neighboring forest variable increases the joint effect three fold models 3 and 5 the results suggest that the mechanisms through which forests affect water quality are different for surface and groundwater sources this provides evidence that in our case the positive effect of cost savings due to forest coverage applies to firms collecting water from groundwater intakes rather than exclusively from surface water intakes this conclusion is valid across all models to further investigate the differences between firms who extract water from groundwater sources and those that do not we subset the data in the following section 4 3 firm subsetting in addition to forest coverage there may be other ecological processes affecting differently the quality of water from surface and groundwater intakes these processes should be reflected in the underlying cost structure of firms with and without groundwater intakes in different ways moreover estimating a single cost function for all firms requires the assumption of a similar technology across firms 32 which may not apply when considering that firms extract water from different sources this section looks at these inherent differences to corroborate the findings that local forest land impacts groundwater rather than surface water treatment costs and further to analyze the cost structure of these different types of firms four distinct groups of firms are identified upon further disaggregation of the data 114 firms which only use groundwater intakes 6 firms which only use surface water intakes 60 firms using both surface water and groundwater intakes and 54 which do not report their water intake source since only six firms in our data extract uniquely from surface water intake points we cannot compare firms extracting exclusively surface water with firms extracting exclusively groundwater however water collected from surface water intakes makes up the majority 67 of the water volume extracted see section 3 1 and therefore we assume that any firm collecting water from at least one surface water intake is more likely to have a cost structure that resembles those of firms extracting exclusively from surface water intakes we thus estimate effects by comparing firms only collecting from groundwater intakes hereby referred to as groundwater firms 114 observations and firms collecting from at least from one surface water intake hereby referred to as surface firms 66 observations table 4 compares the sample mean difference between types of firms and significance level with a two sample t test the two samples differ in terms of mean costs precipitation slope granite rock cover and cork oak woodlands coverage but are not statistically different in what concerns the forest variable table 5 thus presents the regression results using the preferred specification from section 4 2 individually for our two categories of surface and groundwater firms we conduct a likelihood ratio test to infer whether these two subsamples of firms should be pooled with test results rejecting the null hypothesis that the subsamples should be pooled p value of 0 0085 the coefficient estimates from each subset confirms the previously obtained result that forest coverage in the proximity of water intakes affects the cost of firms collecting from groundwater and not surface water intakes for a 1 increase in forest cover within a 10 km radius of the firm s groundwater water intakes water treatment costs decrease by 0 056 on average this effect is insignificant for surface water firms moreover neighboring forest cover affects negatively both groundwater and surface water firms costs but by different magnitudes the impact of neighboring forest coverage on surface water firms costs is almost double 0 19 compared with groundwater firms 0 11 we conclude that forest coverage impacts differently the cost structure of these two types of firms with surface water firms being mostly affected by neighboring forest and groundwater firms affected by both local and neighboring forest coverage as expected water volume is one of the most important factors explaining drinking water treatment costs in the pooled model see table a2 in the appendix the cost elasticity of water volume is around 0 98 meaning that on average a 1 increase in the volume of treated water is associated with a 0 98 increase in water treatment costs this is the case of constant returns to size the cost elasticity decreases in the case of surface firms suggesting increasing returns to size 32 firm specific variables seem to impact the cost function of groundwater rather than surface water firms similarly to 15 privately run water treatment groundwater firms in a concession management regime are associated with higher costs than alternative management types in the case of groundwater firms likewise a groundwater firm serving an urbanized area is expected to have lower costs suggesting that these firms benefit from economies of production density the cost structure of groundwater firms appears more complex than those of surface water firms and significantly influenced by local ecology the coefficients associated with precipitation granite schist and quartzite rock covers are all significant for groundwater firms but not surface water firms higher precipitation is associated with increases in water treatment costs in particular the linkage between water quality and precipitation is more prominent in extreme rainfalls events causing pollutant transport and dilution 35 municipalities dominated by both granite and schist rock are also associated with higher water treatment costs due to the acidic and low mineralization characteristics of waters exposed to these conditions interestingly watershed level fixed effects are significant in the groundwater firm model in contrast with the pooled or surface firms model 5 discussion and conclusion forest ecosystems and water supply are interconnected systems whose sustainable management is crucial to promote people s well being forests maintain water supply by reducing flood and drought risk but also purify water streams by decreasing run off and allowing for soil filtration into aquifers this paper contributes to the existing literature by estimating the value of the water purification ecosystem service provided by forests in the case of portugal through the indirect impact on treatment costs we attempt at disentangling some of the ecohydrological processes related with this service especially in what concerns the differences between surface and groundwater intakes given challenges regarding the right measure of the forest coverage variable we compare different measurements of land coverage and estimate the impact of forest cover in each case our results suggest that forest coverage is generally associated with lower water treatment costs which is in line with previous findings 4 6 8 12 13 however the role played by forests and consequently the magnitude of the impact of this land cover on water treatment costs is highly dependent on whether water is captured through surface or groundwater sources our results suggest that because groundwater is filtered and purified in the soil by the trees root system reducing the concentration of phosphorous and nitrates and thus improving water quality local forest measures have a cost reduction effect for firms extracting water only from groundwater intakes 0 056 no effect of local forest is observable for surface water firms neighboring forest coverage however is associated with cost reductions for both surface and groundwater firms with the effect on surface water being much more pronounced the effect of forest land on water treatment costs found in this study is significantly lower than that reported in ref 13 who find elasticities of 0 47 for native forests and 0 31 for logged forests in malaysia or that obtained by ref 36 17 17 not peer reviewed who report a 20 decrease in costs due to a 10 increase in forest cover for watersheds up to 60 of coverage our findings are of a similar magnitude that those found by ref 14 who estimated a reduction of 0 0034 per m3 of invoiced drinking water in the case of france due to 1 increase of forest cover or 15 who estimated savings in the water price of 0 011 of per m3 of water given a 1 ha increase for a french case study 18 18 converting the elasticities found in our study we find at the mean that an increase in forest cover of 1 km2 decreases water treatment costs by between 0 0018 per m3 of water or alternatively that on average costs per m3 decrease by 0 146 due to a 1 increase in forest cover 6 estimate that converting 10 of the average watershed from forest to developed area would increase annual chemical treatment costs between 0 00059 and 0 0054 per m3 of water treated or 2 52 to 20 48 per year per million gallons treated moreover the cost structure of surface and groundwater firms is quite distinct the effect of local ecological processes on costs is different across these two types of firms with groundwater firms having a more complex cost structure controlling for ecohydrological variables that are rarely accounted for such as rock types the fit of both models improves substantially 19 19 13 included rainfall as a control variable and accounted for water treatment firm effects given the panel nature of the data these effects included time invariant characteristics at firm level such as catchment area geology or topography we find that higher precipitation granite schists and quartzite rock coverage are associated with higher water treatment costs of groundwater firms the fact that costs savings in water treatment due to local forest cover are only achieved through improved quality of groundwater in the case of portugal raises interesting issues preserving the quality of groundwater is highly valuable in contrast to surface waters the water stored in aquifers is a stock which is subject to depletion even in the absence of limit situations such as floods or droughts the quality of the water in the reservoir depends on the balance between use and regeneration this implies that from the perspective of society intertemporal externalities should not be ignored and if they exist they should be taken into account in the prices charged for water in what concerns this research work the treatment cost might depend on the stock of groundwater which could be another reason for having costs changing over time which is outside the scope of this study due to its cross sectional nature despite only representing 33 of total water volume when compared to surface water groundwater may be the main source of drinking water for some local populations for instance the southern region of portugal the algarve relies heavily on groundwater as a source of drinking water water in this region is in high demand given the increase in tourist and at the same time it is one the regions in portugal where climate change is expected to have the largest impact in what concerns rainfall which is the main source of groundwater replenishment 37 in this region the groundwater has been recording higher degrees of salinity which increase treatment costs and has very detrimental environmental consequences namely to the soil land conversion from forest to other uses due to pressure from the tourism sector may incur in high societal costs in the form of higher drinking water costs the diversity of the results found in the literature provides clear evidence of the different contexts underlying the impact of land cover and of the land use dependent ecological processes influencing water quality in fact the results not only depend upon location specific natural conditions but also on the institutional arrangements that characterize the water markets in the different locations in this context more interdisciplinary scientific studies that estimate locally the contribution of natural ecosystems to water quality can contribute to engage societies in preserving natural ecosystems by potentially suggesting better management practices from the perspective of local populations they also challenge policy makers to improve policy design for sustainable use of natural capital for policy purposes all these issues deserve to be studied in order to create the appropriate incentives to

8703,forests worldwide provide a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration soil protection and water purification in particular the minimal use of pesticides and fertilizers in forest operations coupled with the tree root system are associated with higher drinking water quality however forest coverage is expected to have a more influential impact in groundwater quality rather than surface as well as consequently on drinking water treatment costs this study uses cross sectional data at firm level to assess the marginal effect of forest cover on drinking water treatment costs for the case of portugal the first of its kind for the country our analysis makes use of a range of gis and spatial variables which capture the heterogeneity in local forest coverage the results obtained suggest the existence of a positive and significant effect of local forest cover on water treatment cost savings of 0 056 however this effect applies to firms extracting water from groundwater intakes neighboring measures of forest coverage have a greater impact on costs from surface water firms the crucial role of local forest coverage through groundwater provision relates to a problem of intertemporal variation of those costs given the expected impact of climate change on precipitation in some regions where drinking water is mostly supplied by groundwater intakes and since around 97 of forest land is privately owned these results may suggest that appropriate incentives e g payments for ecosystem services could contribute to ensuring the sustainable use of water and forest resources keywords water purification forest coverage water treatment costs jel codes q23 q25 1 introduction forests provide a variety of important ecosystem services ranging from market goods or services including timber cork energy or food extraction to non market benefits such as carbon sequestration recreation habitat preservation soil conservation and importantly the protection of watershed areas 1 2 compared to other land uses especially agriculture forests reduce storm water run off and trap suspended solids caused by topsoil water erosion preventing them from reaching surface water systems 3 4 the dense network of forest roots further acts as a filter reducing pollutant levels of the water passing through and moderating excessive levels of nutrients that would otherwise contaminate the watershed groundwater system 5 6 water purification is one of the most valuable ecosystem services provided by forests and significantly influences the local ecology and human health 7 9 the european union forest strategy recommends the maintenance and enhancement of forest cover to protect soils and regulate both quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater resources 7 9 in many regions forest and water policies are considered complementary and designed on the assumption that under any hydrological and ecological circumstance forest is the best land cover to maximize water yield regulate seasonal flows and ensure high water quality 10 as the world s population increases there is increased pressure for land conversion from forest to other land covers including agriculture and urban land resulting in forest loss and fragmentation 6 11 at the same time the demand for drinking water is increasing 11 which coupled with forest loss translates into higher costs for the provision of drinking water 4 the link between forest coverage and either water quality or drinking water treatment costs has been addressed by several studies including the 4 5 8 12 13 and 6 among others these studies suggest that forests can be an effective land cover for intercepting and removing water pollutants which helps to protect raw water quality forest cover is associated with reduced drinking water treatment costs as large capital costs can be avoided by water treatment plants 4 highlight different cases across the world where watershed protection schemes were created to foster reduced capital and operational costs of water treatment however the authors note that further information is needed regarding the causal relationship between land cover and hydrological services before planning and implementing proper watershed protection one of the most successful watershed protection project was implemented in new york city by spending 1 5 billion in restoring and protecting the catskills forest watershed the city avoided building a new filtration plant and saved at least 6 billion as well as 300 million in annual operating costs 4 more recent empirical work estimated the impact of land cover on treatment costs in different contexts 1 1 other studies explore the link between water quality and forest cover 6 find that a percent conversion of forest coverage to urban area in the united states increases turbidity in the watershed by 3 9 while 18 estimate an increase of 2 9 of turbidity and 0 59 of total organic carbon if a 1 of forest coverage in the united states is converted into alternative land covers e g urban or agricultural 38 further find significantly higher water quality in the forested watersheds of brazil comparing with agricultural or urban land 13 is one of the few studies that has investigated environmental aspects of water treatment costs in tropical regions namely in malaysia the results obtained suggest that by avoiding conversion of 1 of virgin forest to other land covers drinking water treatment costs savings are estimated to be 0 47 the authors also point out that this contribution is larger than that obtained in the case of logged forests 2 2 generally natural forests contribute to higher water quality due to a higher infiltration rate less soil erosion and mitigated pollutants managed forests on the other hand require several interventions to ensure viability and improve biomass productivity and quality namely soil scarification and the introduction of fertilizers 39 40 which can have lasting impacts on water quality in the context of temperate regions 14 estimate a price reduction of 0 003 per m3 of water for french domestic users in response to a one percent increase in forest cover while 15 estimate savings in drinking water price of 0 011 per m3 per hectare of forest cover on the vosges department in north eastern france the mechanisms affecting a firm s cost structure however may depend on whether water is collected from surface or groundwater intakes the technological and chemical treatment processes vary for the two types of water intakes since groundwater tends to be of higher quality compared to surface water 16 3 3 regarding groundwater after a period of rain water infiltrates into the unsaturated zone and then percolates into the saturated zone passing through a process of filtration which is better in forest covered soils compared to agricultural land water may be stored in unconfined and confined aquifers the later type enclosed in two impermeable rock layers in portugal there are 62 aquifer systems which store the bulk of groundwater and are responsible for 44 of public water supply 50 of industry and 80 of agriculture water may travel more than 1000 m a day in porous formations and less than 1 mm a day in clay formations 41 in the case of surface water aquifers are more likely to be used for water supply and thus more likely to be threaten by diffuse pollution achieving appropriate quality of drinking water from groundwater sources typically only requires a disinfection process while additional procedures are required for surface water due to the excess of nutrients 17 4 4 surface water is characterized by increased acidity and very low mineralization and water treatment firms must implement treatment systems to counter this effect the treatments required and installed in these firms use chemical reagents based on the addition of carbon dioxide and lime moreover when surface water has organic matter content higher than allowed by law 42 additional oxidation processes are necessary namely the use of ozone additionally all firms must have disinfection systems that give the treated surface water a residual free chlorine content that meets the disinfection requirements 42 which depends on the typology and extent of the water supply distribution network for public consumption to the best of our knowledge no previous study has focused on the impact of forest cover on drinking water treatment costs conditional on source of water intake both 6 13 focus on water quality from treatment plants with surface water sources i e rivers or reservoirs while 18 5 5 not peer reviewed only considered water treatment firms with at least 90 of raw water collected on surface water intakes water supply services examined in ref 14 use a mix of both surface and groundwater sources with 72 of water coming from groundwater intakes the authors estimate that higher proportions of groundwater reduce water prices by 0 0046 per m3 of treated water however do not explore varying impacts of forest coverage on prices conditional on water intake sources our work contributes to the literature by identifying the heterogeneous impact of forest cover on firm s costs conditional on water intake source we expect that forest coverage has a greater influence on cost in the case of groundwater intakes due to the natural water filtration in the soil from the trees root system that absorbs phosphorous and nitrates 6 6 this occurs because of the reduction in the instantaneous filtration rate against other types of land cover and from the increased time in which this filtration occurs furthermore when considering deep aquifers greater than 100 m forest cover has no direct influence on refilling these same aquifers this paper explores the impact of forest coverage on drinking water treatment costs using firm portuguese firm level data for 2015 to the best of our knowledge no similar study has been conducted in portugal to date in 2010 forest land accounted for approximately 35 of the country s area 19 of which managed private and community forests account for 97 of the total forest area while the remaining 3 is owned by the state 20 privately held forests are often managed in order to maximize private revenues from both energy and timber products without consideration of potential external benefits from non market environmental good provision since increased water quality is traditionally a non market benefit the service of water purification is likely under provided by markets relative to the socially efficient level recognizing the value of water purification at the country level can inform on the non market value of such land use contributing to aligning private agents behavior with socially optimal practices such values provide an indication on the non market spillover benefits that ecosystem services can have on economic outcomes our analysis finds evidence for portugal that local forest cover have a significant impact on reducing water treatment costs for firms extracting from groundwater intakes but interestingly not for surface water intakes water treatment costs for firms with groundwater intake sources decrease by approximately 0 056 for a one percent increase in local forest cover moreover as in ref 15 we conclude that a firm s treatment costs are also affected by neighboring forest coverage especially in the case of surface water firms we also highlight the important differences in the underlying cost structure of firms extracting water from surface and those using groundwater water intakes this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the analytical and empirical framework accounting for spatial influences localized ecological measures and the heterogeneity of capture points section 3 describes the data while section 4 presents and discusses the empirical results finally section 5 outlines the overarching conclusions of the paper 2 analytical and empirical framework the value of water purification can be estimated using a variety of frameworks including the use of production functions changes in the associated productivity or via replacement costs or preventive expenditures techniques 21 recently many studies have focused on estimating the cost function of drinking water suppliers which is influenced by a variety of productive locational and ecological characteristics 13 15 adding forest cover as a covariate these studies established a negative relationship between the presence of forest and drinking water treatment costs in empirical specifications and in different contexts the firm s cost function depends on the output level i e drinking water volume and production inputs such as treatment chemicals energy labour and capital as well as the quantity and quality of the local natural capital 13 we follow the framework employed in ref 13 to model the cost function of drinking water treatment firms a reduced model of cost for firm i is specified as follows 1 c i f v i x i g i w i l i f i where c i denotes the cost of water treatment v i the drinking water volume and x i a vector of firm specific characteristics e g private or public management other ecological or geographical influences e g precipitation are included in the vector g i while w i is a variable representing whether the firm has at least one groundwater intake finally f i represents the area covered by forests and l i is a vector of other land cover variables denoting the area covered by each land type in order to account for non linear cost functions we take the natural logarithm of costs and continuous covariates and as such these coefficients can be readily interpreted as elasticities we estimate the cost function described in 1 using the following empirical specification 2 l n c i β 0 β 1 l n v i β 2 x i β 3 g i β 4 l n f i β 5 ln f i w i β 6 l n l i ε i we use a firm s total variable annual cost of water treatment as the dependent variable as argued in ref 18 poor water quality may be reflected through both higher capital and operating costs the present work focuses on operating costs which may be due to the greater need for chemicals such as coagulants disinfectants and ph adjusters while higher capital costs may result from higher investment in improved infrastructure because of lower raw water quality in the case of portugal the water treatment sector is highly regulated and subsidized and firms operate in noncompetitive markets therefore in lieu of using the price of water as in refs 14 15 we make use of costs we test whether the role of forest cover differs for surface and groundwater intakes through inference on the coefficients β 4 and β 5 forest coverage is assumed to decrease treatment costs and thus we expect the estimate of β 4 attributed to local forest coverage to be negative this estimate is interpreted as an elasticity measuring the percentage change in treatment cost associated to a percentage change in the per km2 forest coverage we expect that extracting from groundwater intakes results in a more influential role of forests in this case the estimate of the joint effect of β 4 β 5 should be statistically significant and negative 2 1 measurement of local forest land coverage it is important that the measure of forest coverage used accurately reflects the local areas that influence water quality in that region these basins encompass the area where water is drained to any common body of water and where local forest coverage has a great influence on the quality of raw water these are referred to as water catchment areas watersheds or drainage basins to precisely estimate the impact of land cover on water treatment costs the measure of land cover should ideally be calculated for each catchment area these calculations for corresponding catchment areas are often conditional on elevation and the relative location of water intakes using gis data 6 13 18 calculate forest coverage conditional on the watersheds and the location of water intake points in portugal however an exhaustive list of the location of water intake points is not available and we are further not able to match the location of known intake points with individual firms our baseline measure of land usage is thus obtained using municipal boundary delineations representative of a firm since individual firms are aligned with specific municipalities the forest coverage is measured as the area of forest within each firm s boundary this measure of forest coverage however may be inaccurate at representing local forest coverage surrounding water intakes where coverage has the greatest impact we thus employ alternative refinements of our forest coverage the approximate and dated location of water intakes for the country was obtained via maps from the management plans of the watershed units in portugal 22 30 we geo reference the point data for groundwater and surface water intakes in portugal from the available years of 2008 and 2009 identifying 4599 groundwater and 224 surface water intakes across the country this underestimates the true location of capture points for our firms since in 2015 there are reported 5783 groundwater and 264 surface water intakes while we are only able to geo reference a subset of 85 of known surface water and 80 of known groundwater intakes active in 2015 this provides a proxy of all intake locations given the limitations to match water intakes with their corresponding firms in lieu of an exact match we assume all identifiable water intakes located within a firm s boundary to represent the collection of water intakes for this firm instead of identifying catchment areas we construct a buffer radius surrounding each water intake from which the size of forested land is calculated forest coverage is then defined as the size of forested land within 10 km of all water intakes within a given firm s boundary by restricting the measurement of forest coverage around water intakes we remove skewed effects which may come from concentrations or sparsity of forests not near water intakes and likely with very little influence on water quality this may be of particular importance for firms serving large urban areas whereby the use of municipal level forest coverage may underestimate the actual forest coverage of importance near the water capture points thus buffer radii surrounding water intakes better captures the local realities of land coverage as it pertains to water quality 2 2 spatial models and measurement of neighboring forest land coverage the effect of forest coverage on water quality and subsequently on treatment costs presumably has important spatial considerations given the continuous nature of forest and land cover impacts at broad scales in the context of portugal spatial characteristics vary widely from the north to the south of the country 7 7 for example average precipitation in the 10 most northern municipalities is 3 5 times higher than in the 12 most southern municipalities given the nature of dependence of the geology ecology and land coverage between observations it is important to consider whether spatial influences should be incorporated in the model we introduce spatial modeling techniques in two ways first we consider spatial econometric models to account for spatial dependence in the dependent variable or autocorrelation in the residuals and second we construct a variable to explicitly capture and introduce the impact of neighboring forest coverage the motivations to account for spatial dependencies are summarized in ref 31 we test for spatial influences according to a variety of models reflecting the structure of correlation over space in the dependent variable via a spatial lag model through unobservable potentially omitted local aspects via a spatial error model or spill over influences from neighboring covariates via a spatial durbin model each specification respectively includes a spatial lag on the appropriate components to test whether significant neighboring spillover effects exist between firm observations results indicate no underlying spatial influences unaccounted for in the econometric specification 8 8 to test the significance of spatial dependence and autocorrelation we employ the global moran i statistic for spatial autocorrelation from both the dependent variable and the residuals of the estimated models we conduct spatial lagrange multiplier tests on all global models and present the results for the preferred model specifications in table a1 of the appendix the moran i statistic indicates that although there is some positive spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable the residuals of the model do not exhibit any unobserved spatial dependence the spatial lagrange multiplier test diagnostics compares the baseline ols as the restricted model null hypothesis and the spatial autoregressive model i e lag on the dependent variable or spatial error model i e lag on the residuals as the unrestricted model alternative hypothesis this test can effectively consider differences between spatial and non spatial models to determine whether spatial dependence is a result of an omitted spatial lag of the dependent variable or through the error component and suggests no indication of spatial dependence this suggests no additional benefits from including spatial lags in the specification and estimating the respective spatial parameters the second way in which we include spatial spillovers into the estimated model is by explicitly including a variable representing the spatially lagged forest cover 15 use spatially lagged variables representing neighboring municipalities weighted by a distance decay function to account for the effect of broader land coverage on a municipality s water price using the baseline measure of forest cover within the municipality s boundaries it may also be the case that neighboring forest coverage has beneficial filtering properties and thus influences costs especially if catchment areas of water intakes intercept neighboring municipalities we construct measures of the neighboring forest coverage by calculating a spatially lagged variable using of the queen contiguity weight matrix whereby all adjacent firms have equal weight 9 9 to ensure inferences and estimates are not driven by the chosen matrix we also used four other spatial weight matrices to capture varying definitions of neighboring firms three of these are distance based weights including an inverse distance inverse distance squared with strength decaying over space and a binary matrix assigning equal weight to all observations within the given threshold the fourth assigns equal weights to the ten nearest neighbors we define neighboring forested land coverage as the percentage of each adjacent neighbor municipality covered by forests multiplied by the respective size of the neighbor by modeling this effect we are considering that a firm surrounded by higher forest coverage outside its own boundary benefits in terms of reduced costs as ecological characteristics of the terrain are continuous we would expect broader effects coming from neighboring areas in addition to forest coverage within the firm borders in an attempt to explore the heterogeneity of impacts over space while taking into account the physical terrain we further test spatially weighted neighborhood forest cover conditional on having higher elevations than a given firm 3 data description 3 1 water treatment sector in portugal water supply is a recognized public service in portugal obeying a set of principles namely the universality of access continuity and quality of service efficiency and acuity of prices the management structure of public water supply services is fundamentally based on the creation of multi municipal systems that are mainly responsible for the abstraction and treatment of water and municipal systems mostly responsible for distribution multi municipal systems are state owned entities that serve at least two municipalities and require the intervention of the state to ensure the provision of this service so as to meet the national interest in mainland portugal a single multi municipal system entity águas de portugal captures and treats the water supply in 234 of the 278 municipalities representing 80 of the population according to the national regulating entity of water and waste services 17 municipal systems on the other hand consist of municipalities acting alone 96 in 2015 or jointly associations of municipalities or in partnership with the state carrying out the distribution operations of water supply municipal ownership firms are the unit of analysis in this paper hereby referred to as firms the supply of drinking water in municipal ownership systems is provided by firms under three different management regimes 1 direct management through municipal services or association of municipalities 2 delegated management through established partnerships with the state local business companies without state participation or parish council and 3 concessionary management through a municipal concessionaire 17 direct management is the most common practice with 70 of municipalities and 54 of the population being served by firms in this regime 17 there is an increasing trend from public to private management in the sector in 2000 the figure of privately management firms was 20 having increased to 48 by 2015 17 the average number of surface water intake points per firm is only 0 79 while the average number of groundwater sources per firm is 20 3 17 there may be multiple capture and treatment stations per firm although not all need be operational at the same time some water intakes may be strategic for an extreme period of drought while others are not operational due to a new surface reservoir centralizing the service of water supply while in absolute terms groundwater intakes are dominant 5783 groundwater locations exist compared to 264 surface water intakes approximately 67 of distributed water volume is collected through surface water sources while only 33 is collected from groundwater sources 17 our geographic water treatment firm observations correspond to the municipality delimited area that each firm serves it is from these zones that land cover and geological data are calculated see section 3 3 total cost data yearly operating and maintenance costs is available for 265 firms in the country referring to the year 2015 17 of these 30 observations were excluded either due to missing cost data or the inability to geo reference the local municipalities with the firms which service them overall 235 observations at the national level were kept covering the 278 municipalities in continental portugal 3 2 firm characteristics data all data on firm characteristics described in this section were collected from ref 17 which is the annual report by ersar the regulatory agency of the water and waste sector in portugal table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the cost and firm specific covariates firms supplying drinking water to primarily urbanized areas are expected to reap from economies of production density which would imply a negative coefficient associated with this dummy variable we would also expect that if privately run firms such as firms under concession or delegated managements are cost minimizers then these management types should be associated with lower costs relative to publically managed firms 15 however find evidence that privately operated firms have higher water prices similar to previous work 6 13 15 we include the volume of captured raw water as an input for the production of drinking water total supplied tap water in 2015 amounted to 1003 million m3 17 the coefficient associated with the natural log of water volume β 1 can be readily interpreted as a cost elasticity indicating whether these firms have decreasing constant or increasing returns to size 32 to test whether groundwater and surface water mechanisms vary in terms of how they relate to the water purification service the groundwater dummy variable takes the value one for firms that collect water from at least one groundwater intake and zero otherwise 3 3 land cover and geographic variables many factors affect water quality namely climate geology topography and land cover highlighting the capacity of forests to provide water purification services several of these variables that may affect water quality were controlled for and are summarized in table 2 land cover measures reflect forest agriculture urban and cork oak woodlands land covers as extracted from the corine land cover 2012 10 10 corine land cover data for 2012 available from http land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc 2012 by considering the natural logarithm of these variables in the estimated model the corresponding coefficient estimates are interpreted directly as elasticities of water treatment costs with respect to the size of each type of land cover it is expected that forest coverage is associated with lower water treatment costs due to water purification while both agricultural and urban land cover are expected to be positively related with those costs this is due to water quality degradation from increased nitrogen and phosphorous due to agricultural practices and organic matter and suspended solids from urban uses intensive agricultural practices including the use of synthetic fertilizers may result in fertilizers reaching nearby groundwater resources through leaching particularly if the resource is shallow or reach surface water by run off and subsoil drainage 5 14 yielding increased water treatment costs cork oak woodlands are included as a separate land class variable given their prevalence in portugal despite being considered agroforested land in the corine land cover the environmental impacts in terms of fertilizers and pesticides use associated with cork oak woodlands are lower in comparison to more traditional agricultural uses 33 slope is calculated as percentage points using the digital elevation model over europe eu dem 11 11 digital elevation model map data available from https www eea europa eu data and maps data eu dem precipitation is included at the firm level as the average annual precipitation climatologically normal for the 30 year period of 1971 2000 using the maps from instituto português do mar e da atmosfera ipma as no data is available for 2015 12 12 precipitation map data available from http portaldoclima pt pt data on the proportion of rock types were collected from the lithological map available from the environmental atlas from agência portuguesa do ambiente 13 13 gis data available from http sniamb apambiente pt home default htm four categories granite limestone schist and quartzite are considered and the respective proportion of each rock type within the firm s area of influence was calculated other variables such as temperature and soil type were considered but dropped as control variables the impact of temperature on water quality is seasonal and site specific while our analysis is annual and at the country level the type of soil may influence groundwater quality but how soil influences water quality is a complex mechanism beyond the scope of the paper 4 results fig 1 and fig 2 illustrate how the water treatment cost per cubic meter of water and the proportion of forest are spatially distributed for the 235 firms considered municipalities further from the coast appear to have a lower proportion of forest cover as well as a higher cost per cubic meter of treated water compared with municipalities in the west 4 1 model selection the breusch pagan test suggests evidence of heteroskedastic errors p value of 0 044 to account for heteroscedasticity we use both robust and wild bootstrapped clustered standard errors using the eight national watersheds as clusters 14 14 if the regressors and the errors are correlated within cluster then estimation is inefficient and standard errors need to be adjusted to account for the clustered nature of the data 43 in our application there are natural clusters at watershed level a total of 8 clusters however this is a case of a small number of clusters for which the wild cluster bootstrap instead of the more common cluster robust standard errors leads to significant improvement on the efficiency of the estimated parameters avoiding over rejections 43 as expected using both robust and clustered standard errors increases the p values and avoids over rejection of insignificance of parameters compared with standard errors not accounting for the heteroscedastic nature of the data however in terms of inference either using clustered or robust standard errors yields the same conclusions especially in what concerns the variables of interest the preferred practice is thus to account for robust standard errors to capture potential underlying influences attributed to differences in the raw water characteristics we further include fixed effects at the watershed level this captures locational differences in source water across the country that may inherently influence the cost eight dummies are included in all model specifications which yields the least squares dummy variable estimators for these covariates as the mean variance inflated ratio vif is lower than 10 we disregard the problem of multicollinearity land cover variables however especially agricultural and urban land seem to be highly correlated with other covariates vifs of 10 79 and 9 83 respectively and thus we do not make hard inferences regarding these covariates as the firms main output water volume is an important driver of treatment cost 13 however it may also be a decision variable from the perspective of water treatment firms and both 14 15 find evidence that water volume is endogenous to account for endogeneity 15 estimated a two stage least squares 2sls model consisting of both a cost function and a demand function for drinking water given the potential endogeneity of water volume we implement an instrumental variable specification with instruments for water volume ideal instruments should not have an impact on costs directly yet should be highly linked to the volume of water treated we use evapotranspiration and the municipal population level as valid instruments for treated water volume terrestrial evapotranspiration is the sum of water vapour from soil evaporation wet canopy evaporation and plant transpiration that returns to the atmosphere 34 evapotranspiration has a direct and indirect impact on the quantity of water rather than quality by decreasing the run off and changing the concentration of nutrients on surface water the number of residents per area of influence of each firm was collected from the census 2011 which has geo referenced data of the number of residents within each municipality 15 15 census 2011 data can be found at http mapas ine pt download index2011 phtml higher populations within the municipality should be correlated with water volume treated per firm due to increased demand for quantity of drinking water our diagnostics indicate that the null hypothesis of the hausman test is rejected implying that water volume is indeed an endogenous variable the number of residents and evapotranspiration appear to be both valid and strong instruments 16 16 the null hypothesis of the sargan test is not rejected meaning the instruments are valid and the model is correctly specified and the first stage statistics suggest strong instruments in explaining water volume our preferred model is thus a 2sls model using number of residents and evapotranspiration as instrumental variables with fixed effects eight watershed dummies and robust standard errors 4 2 main results the covariates included in the model are the natural logarithm of treated water volume dummies for delegated and concession management regimes a dummy representing whether the municipality is mostly urbanized average precipitation and slope within the municipality proportion of area covered by granite schist limestone and quartzite rock forest cover measures and other land cover variables agricultural urban and cork oak woodlands coverage full regression results are presented in table a2 in the appendix we present specifications which differ in terms of the measurement of the forest cover variable the coefficients of which are presented in table 3 the coefficient of our baseline measure of forest cover coverage within municipality boundaries is insignificant across all specifications models 1 3 and 4 as expected however the interaction term of forest coverage within municipality and the groundwater dummy is always negative and significant for firms extracting water from at least one groundwater intake relative to those without groundwater intakes a 1 increase in forest cover within the municipality results in reductions of water treatment costs around 0 043 if instead we consider the coverage of forest 10 km surrounding known water intakes the main results regarding significance remain unchanged with elasticities of 0 026 in models 2 and 5 there is a slight decrease in magnitude which suggests that using the entire municipal forest coverage may overestimate the true impact of coverage surrounding intake points incorporating neighboring forest coverage from adjacent municipalities seems to improve the fit of the model compared with the baseline as seen in models 3 and 5 suggesting that it is important to consider broader effects from forest coverage this result is in line with 15 who find evidence that ecological processes with impact on water quality seem also to be affected by land covers in the surrounding areas to each firm s influence however the coefficient associated with neighboring forest coverage conditional on higher elevations model 4 is insignificant and yields an adjusted r squared lower than alternative models using the refined model which includes both forest coverage in 10 km of water intakes and neighboring forest coverage measures yields the model with the best fit it is thus important for firms to consider the land use at the extraction point of water but also the broader ecological processes stemming from nearby areas this model indicates that both the interaction effect of forest coverage in 10 km and groundwater dummy is negative and significant as well as the size of neighboring forest coverage the joint elasticity of all three forest measures is negative and significant and approximately 0 12 this is the highest elasticity estimated for the joint effect for companies extracting from at least one groundwater intake which range from 0 035 to 0 12 adding the neighboring forest variable increases the joint effect three fold models 3 and 5 the results suggest that the mechanisms through which forests affect water quality are different for surface and groundwater sources this provides evidence that in our case the positive effect of cost savings due to forest coverage applies to firms collecting water from groundwater intakes rather than exclusively from surface water intakes this conclusion is valid across all models to further investigate the differences between firms who extract water from groundwater sources and those that do not we subset the data in the following section 4 3 firm subsetting in addition to forest coverage there may be other ecological processes affecting differently the quality of water from surface and groundwater intakes these processes should be reflected in the underlying cost structure of firms with and without groundwater intakes in different ways moreover estimating a single cost function for all firms requires the assumption of a similar technology across firms 32 which may not apply when considering that firms extract water from different sources this section looks at these inherent differences to corroborate the findings that local forest land impacts groundwater rather than surface water treatment costs and further to analyze the cost structure of these different types of firms four distinct groups of firms are identified upon further disaggregation of the data 114 firms which only use groundwater intakes 6 firms which only use surface water intakes 60 firms using both surface water and groundwater intakes and 54 which do not report their water intake source since only six firms in our data extract uniquely from surface water intake points we cannot compare firms extracting exclusively surface water with firms extracting exclusively groundwater however water collected from surface water intakes makes up the majority 67 of the water volume extracted see section 3 1 and therefore we assume that any firm collecting water from at least one surface water intake is more likely to have a cost structure that resembles those of firms extracting exclusively from surface water intakes we thus estimate effects by comparing firms only collecting from groundwater intakes hereby referred to as groundwater firms 114 observations and firms collecting from at least from one surface water intake hereby referred to as surface firms 66 observations table 4 compares the sample mean difference between types of firms and significance level with a two sample t test the two samples differ in terms of mean costs precipitation slope granite rock cover and cork oak woodlands coverage but are not statistically different in what concerns the forest variable table 5 thus presents the regression results using the preferred specification from section 4 2 individually for our two categories of surface and groundwater firms we conduct a likelihood ratio test to infer whether these two subsamples of firms should be pooled with test results rejecting the null hypothesis that the subsamples should be pooled p value of 0 0085 the coefficient estimates from each subset confirms the previously obtained result that forest coverage in the proximity of water intakes affects the cost of firms collecting from groundwater and not surface water intakes for a 1 increase in forest cover within a 10 km radius of the firm s groundwater water intakes water treatment costs decrease by 0 056 on average this effect is insignificant for surface water firms moreover neighboring forest cover affects negatively both groundwater and surface water firms costs but by different magnitudes the impact of neighboring forest coverage on surface water firms costs is almost double 0 19 compared with groundwater firms 0 11 we conclude that forest coverage impacts differently the cost structure of these two types of firms with surface water firms being mostly affected by neighboring forest and groundwater firms affected by both local and neighboring forest coverage as expected water volume is one of the most important factors explaining drinking water treatment costs in the pooled model see table a2 in the appendix the cost elasticity of water volume is around 0 98 meaning that on average a 1 increase in the volume of treated water is associated with a 0 98 increase in water treatment costs this is the case of constant returns to size the cost elasticity decreases in the case of surface firms suggesting increasing returns to size 32 firm specific variables seem to impact the cost function of groundwater rather than surface water firms similarly to 15 privately run water treatment groundwater firms in a concession management regime are associated with higher costs than alternative management types in the case of groundwater firms likewise a groundwater firm serving an urbanized area is expected to have lower costs suggesting that these firms benefit from economies of production density the cost structure of groundwater firms appears more complex than those of surface water firms and significantly influenced by local ecology the coefficients associated with precipitation granite schist and quartzite rock covers are all significant for groundwater firms but not surface water firms higher precipitation is associated with increases in water treatment costs in particular the linkage between water quality and precipitation is more prominent in extreme rainfalls events causing pollutant transport and dilution 35 municipalities dominated by both granite and schist rock are also associated with higher water treatment costs due to the acidic and low mineralization characteristics of waters exposed to these conditions interestingly watershed level fixed effects are significant in the groundwater firm model in contrast with the pooled or surface firms model 5 discussion and conclusion forest ecosystems and water supply are interconnected systems whose sustainable management is crucial to promote people s well being forests maintain water supply by reducing flood and drought risk but also purify water streams by decreasing run off and allowing for soil filtration into aquifers this paper contributes to the existing literature by estimating the value of the water purification ecosystem service provided by forests in the case of portugal through the indirect impact on treatment costs we attempt at disentangling some of the ecohydrological processes related with this service especially in what concerns the differences between surface and groundwater intakes given challenges regarding the right measure of the forest coverage variable we compare different measurements of land coverage and estimate the impact of forest cover in each case our results suggest that forest coverage is generally associated with lower water treatment costs which is in line with previous findings 4 6 8 12 13 however the role played by forests and consequently the magnitude of the impact of this land cover on water treatment costs is highly dependent on whether water is captured through surface or groundwater sources our results suggest that because groundwater is filtered and purified in the soil by the trees root system reducing the concentration of phosphorous and nitrates and thus improving water quality local forest measures have a cost reduction effect for firms extracting water only from groundwater intakes 0 056 no effect of local forest is observable for surface water firms neighboring forest coverage however is associated with cost reductions for both surface and groundwater firms with the effect on surface water being much more pronounced the effect of forest land on water treatment costs found in this study is significantly lower than that reported in ref 13 who find elasticities of 0 47 for native forests and 0 31 for logged forests in malaysia or that obtained by ref 36 17 17 not peer reviewed who report a 20 decrease in costs due to a 10 increase in forest cover for watersheds up to 60 of coverage our findings are of a similar magnitude that those found by ref 14 who estimated a reduction of 0 0034 per m3 of invoiced drinking water in the case of france due to 1 increase of forest cover or 15 who estimated savings in the water price of 0 011 of per m3 of water given a 1 ha increase for a french case study 18 18 converting the elasticities found in our study we find at the mean that an increase in forest cover of 1 km2 decreases water treatment costs by between 0 0018 per m3 of water or alternatively that on average costs per m3 decrease by 0 146 due to a 1 increase in forest cover 6 estimate that converting 10 of the average watershed from forest to developed area would increase annual chemical treatment costs between 0 00059 and 0 0054 per m3 of water treated or 2 52 to 20 48 per year per million gallons treated moreover the cost structure of surface and groundwater firms is quite distinct the effect of local ecological processes on costs is different across these two types of firms with groundwater firms having a more complex cost structure controlling for ecohydrological variables that are rarely accounted for such as rock types the fit of both models improves substantially 19 19 13 included rainfall as a control variable and accounted for water treatment firm effects given the panel nature of the data these effects included time invariant characteristics at firm level such as catchment area geology or topography we find that higher precipitation granite schists and quartzite rock coverage are associated with higher water treatment costs of groundwater firms the fact that costs savings in water treatment due to local forest cover are only achieved through improved quality of groundwater in the case of portugal raises interesting issues preserving the quality of groundwater is highly valuable in contrast to surface waters the water stored in aquifers is a stock which is subject to depletion even in the absence of limit situations such as floods or droughts the quality of the water in the reservoir depends on the balance between use and regeneration this implies that from the perspective of society intertemporal externalities should not be ignored and if they exist they should be taken into account in the prices charged for water in what concerns this research work the treatment cost might depend on the stock of groundwater which could be another reason for having costs changing over time which is outside the scope of this study due to its cross sectional nature despite only representing 33 of total water volume when compared to surface water groundwater may be the main source of drinking water for some local populations for instance the southern region of portugal the algarve relies heavily on groundwater as a source of drinking water water in this region is in high demand given the increase in tourist and at the same time it is one the regions in portugal where climate change is expected to have the largest impact in what concerns rainfall which is the main source of groundwater replenishment 37 in this region the groundwater has been recording higher degrees of salinity which increase treatment costs and has very detrimental environmental consequences namely to the soil land conversion from forest to other uses due to pressure from the tourism sector may incur in high societal costs in the form of higher drinking water costs the diversity of the results found in the literature provides clear evidence of the different contexts underlying the impact of land cover and of the land use dependent ecological processes influencing water quality in fact the results not only depend upon location specific natural conditions but also on the institutional arrangements that characterize the water markets in the different locations in this context more interdisciplinary scientific studies that estimate locally the contribution of natural ecosystems to water quality can contribute to engage societies in preserving natural ecosystems by potentially suggesting better management practices from the perspective of local populations they also challenge policy makers to improve policy design for sustainable use of natural capital for policy purposes all these issues deserve to be studied in order to create the appropriate incentives to

studies pontificia universidad javeriana colombia c nicholas school of the environment duke university usa nicholas school of the environment duke university usa corresponding author corresponding author payments for ecosystem services pes programs are now high in number if not always in impact when groups of users pay groups of service providers establishing pes involves collective action we study the creation of collective pes institutions and their continuation as group coordination we use framed lab in field experiments with hydroservices users and providers within watersheds participating in mexico s matching funds program in veracruz yucatan and quintana roo states we explore the coordination of contributions between downstream users and upstream providers plus effects of different types of sanctions that can affect expectations for both users and providers both information alone and sanctions raise contributions overall although outcomes varied by site in line with our rankings of watershed trust for instance monetary sanctions raise contributions in the watershed we ranked high in trust yet initially lowered them for the lowest trust watershed this suggests that upstream downstream social capital will be central to new collective local pes while our overall trends suggest social capital can be raised by successful coordination over time keywords payments for ecosystem services field lab experiments trust coordination sanctions collective action mexico jel classification d02 q23 q28 c93 1 introduction payments for ecosystem services pes are voluntary contracts between users of services and land managers who provide services that specify transfers based upon service flows or related actions such agreements can arise voluntarily if both users and providers feel they will benefit sufficiently to incur transactions costs 1 establishing such contracts does involve significant costs finding willing counterparts coordinating on payments as well as the metrics to be used to measure the flows of services and deciding how compliance will be monitored and enforced 23 states can lower transaction costs and help with coordination in organizing new pes institutions states also stand in for the users of services as in the largest and best known pes e g costa rica mexico and china 1 1 that could include compelling providers to participate even while compensating them as some have described pes in china 78 here we focus on states roles in contexts that are purely voluntary for all actors yet state involvement in pes faces challenges payments are public costs that can be put at risk by overall budget reductions and shifts in priorities across political regimes further states face high costs of monitoring and enforcement particularly for rural forest frontiers involving local users of ecosystem services can both costs of monitoring and local political risks local users also heighten the focus on outcomes i e truly conditioning payments on service flows or related actions overall implementation costs may be lower and payment effectiveness higher due to involved users who are proximate to the forest relative to the state s limited local presence finally local involvement may more generally allow pes designs to be adapted to local contexts e g to focus on activities that are least costly upstream or that best fit local facts and institutions even local services users though may face high costs of monitoring individual providers actions and measuring any program s outcomes as well as baselines which are needed to estimate impacts these issues motivate contracting with groups of providers 2 which also can follow from collective tenure or property rights upstream using group or collective measures within such contracts can lower monitoring costs states may more easily measure both baselines and ongoing forest or water quality at scales above the individual or the property level other examples of a focus on collective or group performance instruments in environmental policy include ambient based non point source pollution control e g refs 3 4 and the use of aggregate permits for natural resources 5 for a much more general discussion of potential policies based upon group performance see kotchen segerson 6 yet it is unclear how the upstream providers of ecosystem services will respond to group contracts as both services flows and institutions that generate them can be public goods that benefit many one known hazard is free riding i e doing nothing yet gaining from others actions under contracts 7 8 for instance a provider upstream might not contribute to land use changes required for services flows or a user downstream may not contribute financially the former might be addressed by upstream institutions including those created within collective tenure regimes kaczan et al 2017 s results suggest upstream capacity to solve free riding hurdles for the same program in mexico the latter might be addressed by downstream institutions e g water utilities charging fees yet even if both of these local solutions arise upstream and down there remains a challenge of coordinating effort levels between upstream and downstream groups 1 1 mexican program mexico s national forestry commission conafor has valuable experience with these issues it implemented a national state pays landowner pes program in 2003 that continues to this day multiple studies discuss its origins function and outcomes 9 11 and 12 as well as 2015 and find on the whole relatively little conditioning of payment on higher ecosystem service flows that is very consistent with national level findings for a similar state led national pes program in costa rica see e g refs 13 14 that mexican and that costa rican pes program also have both been vulnerable to shifts within broad political and economic forces that can threaten program budgets and ultimately viability 10 15 to support development of local pes initiatives with involvement of users in 2008 conafor started a local payments for ecosystem services mechanisms through matching funds program mecanismos locales de pagos por servicios ambientales a través de fondos concurrentes i e matching funds in this program conafor matches up to 50 of the funding committed by local users strong interest and involvement by downstream users are central to this program s theory of impact all applications must include up front financial commitments from the users because there are often numerous downstream users or ecosystem service beneficiaries in such situations these pes initiatives often require local organization and collective action downstream upstream collective action also is often required an estimated 60 of the forested land in mexico is under collective title in ejidos or indigenous communities 16 and 17 find that the great majority of the enrolled properties in the national pes program 2004 2010 were under collective title thus often upstream groups already have confronted and are likely to have significant experience with the challenge of martialing groups for effective collective action 1 2 experiment results in sum for pes in mexico and elsewhere involving local actors can raise the salience of services flows to users and can lower the cost of monitoring those flows yet even with perfect institutions at each end of a watershed upstream downstream coordination is a challenge creating new local pes can therefore usefully be considered as a between group coordination or assurance game each group will gain if the pes works assuming a price exists that is below users gains yet above providers costs yet contributing is pointless if one believes the other group will not also do so 2 2 42 highlights a 2nd order collective action dilemma a new institution is to solve an incentive problem but its creation faces incentive problems on rationality of cooperation given others cooperation see skyrms 74 creating and sustaining pes has significant costs including time required for building consensus and new processes and institutions then all of that again if shocks occur since effort is pointless if it is at only one end of the watershed expectations are critical for contributions we model pes interactions as an assurance game between these two groups any one group upstream providers or downstream users will lose out from contributing if the group at the other end of the watershed contributes little yet it does not lose if the other group contributes a lot whether contributing is rational depends upon one s belief about the other group the problem is one of mutual assurance 18 critically there exist high efficient and low inefficient symmetric equilibria what shapes groups expectations of each other should be a focus for design and implementation of local pes perceptions at one end of a watershed concerning the other end obviously are critical it matters not only if there exists trust between upstream providers and downstream users but also whether each group thinks the other handles internal free riding effectively to function as a group evolving watershed trust is a central focus within this study in multiple ways we conduct surveys and post games group discussions to explore attitudes and perceptions at the individual level and the group level as well as the watershed scale we implement trust games between individual upstream and downstream participants also framed around pes before our assurance games and we study the dynamics with non monetary sanctions on providers for insufficient contributions our interest in sanctions follows from our belief that there is low additionality in pes schemes i e little conditioning of payment on services and thus services do not rise relative to the baseline sanctions such as cutting payments for a lack of action can be one way to increase conditioning yet external judgmental interventions might produce anger instead of increased service provision this tension highlights the value of experiments with field populations while we could not alter conafor s actual pes policy design to test speculations about reactions to possible sanctions 3 3 conafor has not emphasized sanctions within pes consistent with pes globally not insisting on additionality we note that sanctions have occurred though in the monarch butterfly biosphere reserve 98 experiments let us work with the agency to simulate the behavioral impacts of potential policies by randomizing possible variations upon local pes structures with the relevant field populations we find that few groups in our experiments start at high or low equilibria yet many move toward social optima i e efficient high equilibria over time in accord with payoffs from coordination we find that site conditions matter upstream downstream trust perceptions vary and align by site with both baseline pre sanction assurance behaviors and the impacts of our sanction treatments monetary sanctions raise contributions by upstream provider for our highest prior trust site yet the same sanctions initially lower contributions by downstream users within our lowest trust site at an individual level we find that having gotten a sanction leads providers to raise contributions further after initial rounds which can include negative reactions both information provision alone and our sanctions treatments raise overall contributions from both the user and the provider groups thus our results suggest that for institutional settings that require collective action between users downstream and providers upstream upstream downstream social capital is central to local pes creation and function plus it can be built through success even if successes required sanctions both prior watershed trust and sanctions can act as assurance tools which align key expectations sections 2 and 3 review literature and the development of pes in mexico section 4 presents our sample motivation for and details of our upstream downstream assurance game framed as local pes section 5 then describes our results in detail while section 6 provides additional discussion 2 related literature voluntary contracts for clear services 19 95 resemble coase 1960 1 response to pigou socially inefficient externalities can be resolved by bargaining to transactions if property rights are defined and enforced while transaction costs are low 20 that sounds simple yet in practice the design and implementation of pes have not been simple in fact it is difficult to link specific actions by providers to the flow of ecosystem services 8 21 given scales and biophysical complexities 22 compliance additionality temporal permanence and spatial leakage are immense challenges too returning to coase also transaction costs can be high 21 as noted above all of these challenge could suggest gains from state roles within pes 22 23 however as noted above there are clear ways in which the involvement of local individuals and groups might improve outcomes it can lower political risks both by lowering federal dominance of program support and by fostering a sense of local ownership of all the agreed arrangements certainly it can lower costs of monitoring local users may also heighten the focus on outcomes making payments more strongly conditional on services or related actions from which they benefit finally as noted in literature on potential benefits from decentralization 24 involvement of locals may allow pes designs to be adapted to local contexts e g with activities that are least costly or fit institutions upstream altogether then payment effectiveness can rise given users in closer proximity to forest frontiers relative to the state s often limited presence 2 1 local collective institutions payments for ecosystem services state versus direct user financing is a key pes dimension in user financed pes buyers are actual users of ecosystem services more like a coasian ideal while in government financed pes the buyer is a third party acting for users users have clearest incentives to ensure that services are actually delivered they may also be able to directly observe the delivery of services and if it fails be able to end pes 25 wunder et al 21 find user financed programs better targeted more locally adapted better monitored and more likely to enforce conditionality in practice varied public private and hybrid pes institutions exist which can be closer to market transactions government subsidies or social agreements for collective action around public goods while all pes use transfers between actors to align individual and social incentives they vary in emphasis upon social elements values perceptions relationships power and politics 26 27 4 4 there is great variation wunder et al 21 distinguish the sloping land conversion program in china with over 12 m ha and a central government buyer from the los negros watershed program in bolivia which covers 3k ha with variety of actors including municipalities ngos as the demanders negotiating agreements with the upstream actors variations are clear in local pes 28 31 93 including with regard to upstream downstream conflict resolution plus trust fairness and social motivations 15 32 33 raising the issue of whether pes reduce or even enhance related intrinsic and social motivations 34 62 5 5 underlying this idea is a psychological notion of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation 79 there is ample literature for situations such as blood donation civic engagement and punctuality of parents in picking up children from day care see e g refs 69 70 80 81 collective contracts can help coordinate landowners over large areas and reduce transaction costs of verification and payments 2 this could improve performance see ref 35 meta analysis of 47 watershed schemes with 17 community contracts although social capital and trust are critical for better participation and function 36 given roles for local social norms 6 6 social norms are shared understandings of how individual members should behave in a given circumstance people within a community reward or punish people for their behaviors in following or breaking the rules 37 and neighbors decisions 37 pes design could in turn help to build local social capital for evidence in mexico see e g ref 38 that helps to address other group challenges 22 39 participation cooperation and coordination are highlighted in common pool resource management 40 42 with insights for pes design 43 44 conceptualizing the provision of ecosystem services in part as social dilemma rather than solely an externality issue for which market instruments are sufficient can facilitate local roles within hybrid structures in which monetary incentives are just a part 45 2 2 economic experiments 2 2 1 social dilemmas cooperation coordination noussair and van soest 46 review two uses of economic lab experiments on environmental policy first as a test bed for market mechanisms such as for water or pollution permits second to explore social dilemmas in providing public goods and extracting common pool resources e g 42 47 48 72 for the latter the focus has been the identification of conditions in which self regulation and cooperation occur including the specifics of policy design and taking into account possible motivational crowding 7 7 changes in motivations due to interventions with economic incentives have been for common pool resources and public goods games cardenas et al 47 find extraction is closer to the selfish nash solution when a fine is imposed vollan 82 showed that a supportive intervention e g reward does not crowd out initial cooperative motivations while restrictive external interventions e g punishment may especially for situations with substantial trust and social norms in the community kolinjivadi et al 83 observed that pre existing social norms and tradition explain baseline cooperation while collective monetary incentives and individual image based incentives boost cooperation most results do not support crowding out of intrinsic and social motivations 34 84 though incentives may reduce motivations of those excluded if that is considered unfair 85 2016 some such conditions produce coordination challenges as in the assurance game 18 49 with efficient and inefficient equilibria we want to employ assurance rather than pure coordination between equally valued equilibria 8 8 coordination games can be matching games games with asymmetric payoffs and games with asymmetric equilibria 49 in matching games all equilibria have the same payoffs for each player in games with asymmetric payoffs players disagree about which equilibrium is best e g battle of the sexes in games with asymmetric equilibria players are symmetric but payoffs for efficient and inefficient equilibria are not e g assurance games because having a functioning new local pes institution pareto dominates an equilibrium of non contribution i e both groups fare better yet there is a risk in contributing to creating new local pes institutions if others do not contribute thus as in the assurance structure the non contribution inefficient equilibrium is risk dominant compared to being in a prisoners dilemma achieving the efficient high contribution equilibrium seems less demanding even given the risk of being the only contributor yet coordination involves expectations often a function of prior interactions and institutions camerer 49 finds that in assurance failure is common i e play often does not converge to the pareto efficient equilibrium games requiring threshold levels of contributions to generate public goods have been widely used in laboratories with standard student subjects and abstract framing as opposed to field settings they require a minimum level of contributions to trigger the provision of the public good reward from which all benefit marginal benefits of contributions are zero up to the threshold then at the threshold it is beneficial to cooperate above the threshold defecting again is a preferred strategy experimental literature mainly explores coordination challenges for different institutional designs 50 52 coordination upon an efficient equilibrium is highly dependent on institutional features but it can be 30 40 53 54 55 96 when coordination devices are employed e g money back guarantee e g ref 50 or various forms of communication 56 success rates increase significantly 2 2 2 pes experiments pes experiments can consider designs not yet observed 9 9 pes experiments also have considered auctions to reveal private information to reach more cost effective allocations among landholders e g refs 86 88 and jindale et al 89 use auction results and household data to simulate tradeoffs between cost effectiveness and maximizing participation by poor households and permit the exploration of motivations 57 58 payments may raise efforts if norms of communal work are absent 59 and perhaps by more when coupled with a nudge 60 collective contracting in pes is an understudied element kaczan et al 61 take pes as given i e do not focus on institutional creation by upstream and downstream groups as we do here and employ an upstream public goods game facing pes incentives with incentives to free ride in watersheds involved in the same mexican pes program we study here they find that groups solve this challenge that implies greater impacts when the pes contracts demand greater additionality they also find better outcomes when players can participate in rule making and when mechanisms such as the availability of non monetary sanctions within a community can facilitate cooperation as kaczan et al 61 find success in this setting in overcoming free riding problems upstream to supply services we assume functioning institutions at each end of a watershed and instead focus on the coordination between upstream and downstream groups to create new collective local pes collective payments can crowd out social norms given the free riding potential in collective action 57 58 on the other hand success with collective incentives can enhance social motivations even when individual incentives do not 62 for this same setting in fact kaczan et al 61 find if anything a crowding in of contributions by pes 63 and cardenas et al 64 use trust games 65 to mimic a pes relationship between upstream and downstream jack 63 finds removing an intervention lowered transfers relative to the situation without enforcement at any point cardenas et al 64 focused on initial trust levels finding lowest levels among the downstream users in considering upstream providers we also focus on upstream downstream interactions with groups at each end of the watersheds we employ an assurance game with efficient and inefficient equilibria unlike most prior work moreover rather than considering coordination by individuals we explore coordination of groups 2 2 3 peer sanctioning sanctions allow less drastic signaling than a collapse of cooperation participants express prosocial motives by condemning negative behaviors or rewarding cooperation 66 aiding cooperation 67 68 by reinforcing reciprocity and fairness signaling pro social motives and activating shame or other social preferences 69 70 field and experimental evidence find that conditional cooperation and costly punishment of free riders are key for collective action e g refs 42 71 91 especially if greater deviations from cooperation lead to heavier sanctions 67 68 sanctions need not be monetary expressions of disapproval can boost cooperation 48 61 72 non monetary sanctions have a monetary cost only for sanctioners and thus they are more efficient in situations in which they are equally effective yet they may have less effect over time 48 66 72 our coordination is between groups and adds sanctioning of upstream mostly from downstream this novel inclusion relevant for real pes allows us see whether our downstream participants are willing to invest in signaling upstream participants while simultaneously contributing to pes and whether upstream participants in turn respond to sanctioning by increasing their contributions 3 pes in mexico 3 1 government financed national pes mexico s federal payments for ecosystem services program was started in 2003 as a response to water scarcities and deforestation communal or small private landholders sign 5 year contracts with conafor to conserve enrolled forest lands in exchange for a per hectare annual payment if deforestation is detected conafor reduces the payments proportional to the hectares lost conafor data indicate that 8969 contracts enrolled 6 310 344 ha between 2003 and 2016 key factors in eligibility involve supply and demand e g being upstream of a population center 11 smallholders can enroll yet the majority of suppliers and land area are from federally recognized communal properties which include ejidos and indigenous communities 17 enrollment is by the democratic governing bodies of these communal properties 10 those involved make required forest management plans from a menu of activities firebreaks patrols to prevent illegal logging fencing to exclude cattle pest control and soil conservation the program has prioritized sites with high poverty and high percentages of indigenous populations 17 10 10 alix garcia et al 90 found that even though there is generally a trade off between poverty reduction and avoided deforestation the situation in common property lands is different compared to individual properties the program is more effective in avoiding deforestation in common property and still has positive effect on poverty reduction the national pes program has been funded to date by federal revenues from water fees with few initiatives evolving into local and user financed pes 11 73 yet funding has varied with budgets and priorities 3 2 federal facilitation of local pes in response to the lack of development of user financed initiatives from the national pes program in 2008 conafor created the innovative matching funds pes program its novel objective is to incentivize and support the development of the new institutions necessary for local pes initiatives conafor partners with a local organization e g an ngo water utility hydroelectric company municipal or state government and matches the funding that users committed to pay the providers the partners select users and providers find and manage the funds and largely monitor the results the great majority of matching funds initiatives involve hydrological services users have varied e g bottling plants irrigators state and municipal water utilities hydroelectric and mining firms conafor data from 2008 to 2016 indicate 157 total agreements with partners who have in turn developed 2061 contracts with communal and private landowners that enrolled 515 454 ha requirements for lands getting conafor funds are similar to those in the national pes program however partners can impose distinct standards for areas being paid through funding from users in those areas local partners can pay higher rates target land and land use of particular local value and require different management activities than conafor this flexibility allows the program to be adapted to local conditions and needs unlike the national pes program the matching funds program also allows that some of the monitoring of activities that are undertaken by the providers and some of the sanctioning for non compliance be done by local partners on behalf of the users 4 coordination to create collective local pes in a stag hunt assurance game 74 a hunter can put in effort to help catch a high value stag yet whether others will help is uncertain so it may be rational to hunt small prey alone yielding a lower but certain value if sufficient others help so the group can succeed with the stag it is rational for each to help either effort or defection could be rational depending upon beliefs 18 one symmetric nash equilibrium is pareto dominant and efficient in which all are fully contributing another is inefficient where none contribute the latter is risk dominant since it minimizes players joint risk 49 as expectations are central and based on the past equilibria can be self reinforcing reaching the pareto dominant equilibrium depends on prior and updated expectations of others trustworthiness if achieved that may be repeated 18 generally any tools that can influence beliefs clearly can affect the ongoing levels of cooperation 4 1 assurance games our assurance game was inspired by the design of conafor s novel matching funds program 11 11 similar dynamics could arise within a gift exchange game 67 68 in which a contribution by one group may be reciprocated it is sequential we think assurance mimics better local pes in which decisions in each group are made without being certain about the other group s total contribution while contributions evolve over time across rounds yet a sequential version of our group group coordination experiment could be an institutional variant building a new local pes can be represented we believe as a between group coordination game both users and providers are better off if the institution is created and functions yet organizing one s end of a watershed is pointless if one does not think that the other end can and will do so too given pes institution payments are not productive if cooperation breaks down upstream and thus behaviors do not shift while costly upstream shifts to create services are not productive if users downstream fails to collect funds so payments end if the other group does not do its part then the payoffs from effort are negative this interdependence makes beliefs about the other end critical in our field lab experiment each provider and each user decide how much effort to contribute no player receives direct benefits from their own group s contributions instead individuals earnings rise with the other group s total contributions while falling with one s own level of contributions unless the other group has high contributions in which case one does not lose from contributing as noted and distinct from standard public goods provision there are multiple equilibria here defecting could dominate or full contribution may remain stable we cannot predict contributions we can expect that higher contributions by another group will raise expectations and contributions in our game each participant in each group chooses to contribute 0 1 2 or 3 units of effort to pes recall that we used an explicit frame of pes contributions by providers are represented as trees i e changes in land use that raise tree cover while contributions by users are represented as coins i e payments that flow to upstream providers all participants make decisions simultaneously table 1 shows payoffs as a function of one s own contribution and the average contribution at the other end of a watershed appendix 1 shows the materials that were actually used out in the field each person chooses between 0 and 3 units of effort groups of 5 users and groups of 5 providers are randomly matched thus the total contribution by any user or provider group ranges from 0 to 15 in table 1 s upper left cell are the payoffs due to zero effort by users and zero effort by providers i e no payments and baseline land use moving to the right each cell represents increased efforts to conserve trees upstream moving down each cell represents greater contributions to payments by downstream users we used ranges or intervals to make this table simpler for field participants there is an equilibrium at all zeros i e no contributions and a cooperative equilibrium with full contributions neither is dominant as the best choice depends on expectations of others as above we highlight our across watershed focus the payment of an individual participant does not depend on their own group contribution but on the collective contribution of the other end of the watershed again taking as given the institutions upstream and downstream we are focused upon the creation of a new upstream downstream institution that requires coordination for sustenance of ecoservices as we think often occurs in pes upstream and downstream actors decide how much effort to put into the creation and continuation of an institution that can benefit both groups once pes exists each year downstream users sign contracts with upstream providers yet as pes are very often not highly conditional users do not have great information on flows when they make their payments over time at least proxies for direct measures are available our game models this through rounds 4 2 trust games in the same experimental sessions before assurance games we anonymously and randomly paired each provider with an individual user for a trust game 65 framed in terms of pes each player had no information other than their partner s location i e upstream or downstream each was endowed with eight tokens first movers decided how many tokens s 0 to 8 to send that amount was tripled by the experimenter so that second movers had their initial eight tokens plus three times the amount s sent by the first mover they then sent back between zero and 8 3s first mover decisions were made without knowing that a second mover role would follow 12 12 in the strategy method with respondent decisions for each possible offer by the 1st mover thus our 2nd movers do not know the 1st movers decisions but decide for each hypothetical choice from 0 to 8 tokens made by a 1st mover with random assignment to one role to calculate earnings role reversal with random rematching 75 for payments purposes after first mover decisions participants were asked how many tokens they expected in return for our analysis we only use decisions as 1st movers plus the expectations about what will be returned we do not use 2nd mover decisions given a focus on expectations or trust i e not trustworthiness we also collected perceptions of inter group upstream downstream and intra group trust in surveys post games group discussions and qualitative observations our site descriptions subsection 4 5 focus on the trust perceptions 4 3 information sanctions we explored policy interventions to maintain local pes institutions and to increase contributions sanctions can be signals of dissatisfaction e g in the matching funds program non compliance could be sanctioned by a reduction of payments as decided by conafor or by the local partner in our experiment the largest sanction could enforce a lack of contributions so all are worse off that is analogous to not having a new local pes institution either a new mechanism never started or it started but then was cancelled as the largest possible sanction which has happened in reality after an initial baseline round played as described in subection 4 1 we played three additional rounds in which we gave information to all participants concerning individual choices of providers beyond that information which everyone always had our treatments are three types of sanctions to estimate impacts of sanctions we compared each sanction treatment to information alone i e to sessions in which information about provider choices was provided but there were no sanctions we focus treatments on providers as within pes payments are conditioned on provider behavior and imposed by users our sanctioning treatments are intended to explore whether some sanctions can be useful for cases of upstream non compliance in avoiding the total cancelation of payments information on the behavior of providers anonymously list the actions of all the providers for all participants to see and anonymity is achieved via random assignments of pictures the groups who were randomly assigned to this treatment functioned as our control groups

1 fine to fee ratio is widely used in sustaining contributions 91 92 expectations are critical if users expect to send sanctions which raise contributions by providers users who sanction should increase contributions a virtuous cycle of strategic complementarities yet if users think sanctions exist since providers are not trustworthy they will lower contributions 4 4 recruitment implementation after a field pilot in coatepec in veracruz state we conducted experiments in three sites where the matching funds program had been implemented recruiting 240 users and 240 providers 80 each per site sessions had 10 users and 10 providers meeting simultaneously in different places providers are inhabitants of communal properties enrolled in the pes where they gathered users live and gathered in cities that receive services produced by those upstream communal properties xalapa veracruz cancun quintana roo and merida yucatan upstream and downstream sites are separated by over an hour of driving all the recruitment was done by the local ngos involved in the matching funds program in each of these sites invitations were extended through word of mouth as well as through advertising in ngos headquarters and other local venues in xalapa at the office of the water utility all of the adults who showed up were accepted into the sessions the facilitators were researchers from duke university and staff from the ngos for consistency a single experimenter led all the sessions with providers while another led all sessions with users users and providers interacted through facilitators via cell phone calls treatments followed the logic within table 2 which reflects our downstream upstream focus we employed less upstream upstream sanctioning noting that it has been considerably more studied in the existing literature for the trust games the anonymity was assured using randomly assigned identification numbers also used for upstream downstream matching after trust games although without their results participants played our assurance games each group was anonymously matched with one group at the other end of the watershed using the random color of identification number cards after the baseline assurance round i e the initial round with no treatments information or sanctions participants in all treatments played three more rounds in which all participants received all of the information about providers behavior within each treatment again always with full anonymity decisions were made simultaneously we did not provide the baseline results so that we could test reactions to treatments alone in the round after the baseline without reactions to baseline results results of trust games and assurance baselines were communicated after all decisions were made at session s end contributions during the treatment rounds were communicated after each round we played only a few rounds because the logistics of the experiment were very challenging as it required upstream downstream communication where the cell phone signal was poor in addition due to lower education it took some time to play upstream each session lasted about three hours given multiple sessions per location to avoid the risk of communications from all those who had already participated we shifted villages once per day for upstream participants for downstream participants were invited to participate through different means including word of mouth and the games were always in the same venue in the regressions we have included controls per session 4 5 sites for our framed experiment we chose three sites for experiments during the summer of 2014 after consulting with conafor and visiting 12 matching funds sites in mid 2013 one site in the state of veracruz led by the ngo sendas one in the state of yucatan led by the ngo niños y crias and one in the state of quintana roo led by the ngo amigos de sianka an a primary selection criterion was that there be multiple services users and multiple providers unlike when single large actors such as the state or a downstream utility as a user or an upstream landowner as a provider can decide with no collective action required our experimental design explicitly matched reality we complement experiments with surveys and post games group discussions with the participants in order to get contextual information on both the individuals and the site to inform interpretation of experimental results 76 characteristics of participants by site based upon surveys and baseline choices in the trust and the assurance games are summarized in appendix 2 below we highlight contrasts across the sites based on surveys and post games group discussions for instance while ejidos in the case of quintana roo have not been divided into individual plots in yucatan and veracruz cases the property rights have been partially individualized following a 1992 constitutional reform 94 yucatan and veracruz ejidos also face larger financial opportunity costs of conservation than in quintana roo while most of the quintana roo and veracruz providers participating in our experiments are ejidatarios i e have property rights most yucatan participants do not have but are allowed to live within the ejido this is reflected in the asambleas i e meetings of all those with rights in ejidos where decisions about community governance and communal lands are made asamblea participation was higher in quintana roo at an average of 7 91 meetings with a rate of attendance of 90 of the assemblies on average most providers in quintana roo and veracruz spend 1 2 days per month on forest management most participants in yucatan are not in community groups and 40 are not actively involved in forest management involvement in community organizations is higher in veracruz with 60 of our participants devoting on average a solid 17 5 h per month to community activities intra community trust is generally higher within quintana roo and veracruz than it is in yucatan while 80 of participants in quintana roo and in veracruz stated that they can trust most people in their community the share is significantly lower in yucatan 55 3 upstream to downstream trust also is higher within quintana roo where 72 6 of providers think they can trust most people within the city well above veracruz 38 4 and yucatan 35 1 generally historical tensions between users and providers were more evident in the post games groups discussions in yucatan where some providers stated that the city is buying up but underpaying ejido lands to ensure water provision in the long run leaving those ejidatarios in relevant locations with no land and no water users perceptions of environmental issues and their causes also contrast sharply across sites while 50 of veracruz participants believe that there exist serious issues of local water scarcity only 16 perceived local water scarcity in quintana roo and yucatan water quality issues were noted in post games group discussions in quintana roo and yucatan yucatan downstream users said they distrust upstream providers blaming them for a fall in water quality and more generally expressing doubt about provider commitment to forest conservation yucatan users said providers in the jungle are responsible for the reduction in the city s water quality while quintana roo downstream users expressed that their upstream providers do comply with forest conservation once they have committed to it for payment these results coincide with the downstream upstream trust reported in the survey while 80 of downstream users in quintana roo think they can trust most people upstream that share is 70 in veracruz and yucatan users in quintana roo also report higher willingness to pay the providers for ecosystem services than users in the other sites at us 111 3 per year in quintana roo versus us 22 0 in veracruz and us 35 5 in yucatan in sum we find differences across space in levels of prior upstream downstream watershed trust within both the survey data above and qualitative data including post games group discussions from our interpretation of the data we identify an upstream downstream apparent trust gradient across the sites quintana roo has the highest prior level of upstream downstream trust veracruz has intermediate prior trust level or perhaps ambiguous based upon the information we have and yucatan has the lowest prior trust this perceived gradient as well as trust game results allow us to explore effects on assurance contributions of perceived watershed trust among users and providers we believe upstream downstream trust should affect not only average contributions but also in principle the impacts of having any sanction available for signaling dissatisfaction as noted above how the option of sanctions affects expectations could vary considerably by group 5 results 5 1 assurance contributions separating watersheds in baseline before any mention of sanctions yucatan had the lowest contributions by providers in group group assurance baselines table 3 among the users once again the yucatan participants contributed least quintana roo in contrast had the highest contributions among the users as well the providers note that those quintana roo provider participants included some men quite familiar with pes as longstanding ejidatorios in total by watershed contributions averaged quintana roo 2 21 veracruz 2 1 yucatan 1 85 thus these baseline contribution levels align with our perceived trust gradient across watersheds also the number of tokens sent in the initial trust game as well as the expected return had some predictive power for users assurance baselines appendix 4 pooled or by site showing stronger effects in veracruz and quintana roo but not focused on differences in trust across watersheds table 3 also shows the share of participants making each possible choice by site and role while the equilibria are zero and three units two is the modal contribution for both users and providers perhaps reflecting uncertainty about others choices table 4 shows that over half of the upstream downstream pairings of groups are in the 8 12 8 12 cell i e 2 2 on average whose payoff is no more than the zeros equilibrium but whose downside risk is lower than contributing three units since within our relatively challenging assurance game the highest payoff from raising one s own contributions is zero the baseline contributions seemed relatively high we speculatively link this to both a predilection toward and exposure to local pes as our sites participate in matching funds given such prior experiences we might expect our games to start with relatively high cooperation 5 2 sanctions impacts pooling watersheds on assurance contributions across rounds options for some actors to sanction upstream participants are announced after the baseline decision round 0 but before participants make round 1 decisions thus before round 1 all are aware that some actors will have the option to impose a sanction on any participant upstream after round 1 sanctions would be based on upstream individuals contributions in round 1 which after the round will be listed for all to see albeit anonymously as the core information we always made available any impacts of sanctions upon round 1 are due to the threat not to having received any sanctions for rounds 2 and 3 though players could also react to having received or sent some sanction s fig 1 shows provider choices before round 0 and after sanctions are announced round 1 and implemented rounds 2 and 3 we see that on average all treatments raise providers giving we note that while treatment assignment was random treatments varied in baseline contributions thus to best perceive the impacts of the treatments we need to assess not just endpoints but slopes through repetition a larger percentage of participants tend to move towards the optimum of three this can be seen also in appendix 3 where we report the distribution of choices per round and site fig 2 shows users choices before round 0 plus after sanctions are announced round 1 and implemented rounds 2 3 again giving rises with treatments even with initial negative effects again more details are in our appendix 3 where we report the all the choices per round and site what we take away from figs 1 and 2 beyond the overall increases in contributions over time is that there existed considerable differences between responses by upstream providers and those by downstream users across the rounds as our information and sanctions treatments played out this is confirmed in table 5 s regressions on average across the watersheds providers and users varied in reactions to sanctions consistent with average differences in baselines in table 3 above in short average provider contributions responded positively if sanctions were available and used while average user reactions to having and sending sanctions were if anything initially negative tables 5 s first three columns compare individuals rounds 1 2 3 with their round 0 baselines the last two columns analyze contributions changes round2 round1 and round3 round2 to allow a focus upon who received or sent sanctions once we control for sanctions that occurred however coefficients on the treatments themselves are harder to interpret than in initial columns table 5a shows that on average providers responded positively to sanctions by the 3rd and final round each type of sanction ended up with higher contributions relative to baseline than did the information alone treatment all coefficients are positive and across the three sanction treatments they increase in both magnitude and significance when looking at the 3rd round versus the 1st round further looking at the table s final two columns for changes across rounds once a provider could have been sanctioned which at earliest could happen as a reaction to a provider s 1st round choice we see that when an individual provider has received a sanction that too increases contributions table 5b tells a rather different story for users no coefficient is significant for round 3 further no coefficient is significant for nonmonetary sanctions the only significant sanctions coefficients are for monetary sanctions for earlier rounds and those are not positive but significantly negative thus averaging across watersheds having the option to sanction lowered round 1 contributions seemingly in anticipation of lower provider contributions than are expected without any sanctions further as sanctions arose the only significant coefficient on sending a sanction also is negative thus if one felt the need to sanction not surprising that lowered expectations and contributions finally as it raised the baseline appendix 4 trust giving has a negative coefficient for change 5 3 sanctions impacts separating watersheds on assurance contributions across rounds 5 3 1 upstream providers contributions by site in tables 6 we use regression analyses to study impacts of sanctions on assurance contributions by site yet like table 5 still considering separately the providers table 6a and users table 6b we believe that prior upstream downstream trust levels varied across the three sites and further that those differences in watershed trust could impact not only average contributions in assurance consistent with table 3 discussed above but also impacts of the existence and use of sanctions for providers sanction impacts vary by watershed with a consistent gradient by prior trust level between upstream and downstream again almost all our sanctions were from down to up stream monetary sanctions consistently raise overall upstream contributions in quintana roo where we observed more trust from upstream to downstream and vice versa i e our high prior trust site monetary sanctions never raise overall upstream contributions in yucatan low prior trust site the other user to provider sanctions from downstream to upstream are non monetary sanctions 14 14 appendix 5 presents details about the frequency of each type of sanctions received and sent per site and treatment the non monetary sanctions were more common 31 vs 18 for r1 26 vs 12 for r2 26 vs 7 for r3 which is consistent with overall cost efficiency being higher for non monetary sanctions than monetary sanctions given not only lower total costs of non monetary sanctions but also on average at least as high contribution gains they did not significantly raise providers assurance contributions in veracruz however they did have some initial effects in quintana roo and yucatan seemingly anticipating better coordination yet as in veracruz ultimately they did not raise provider contributions for group group assurance finally in veracruz alone we also tried another non monetary sanction i e provider to provider they were non monetary because we feel that is more likely for upstream i e peer sanctioning interestingly if tentatively given only one site those non monetary sanctions started slowly but in contrast to user to provider non monetary sanctions they rose in impact across the three rounds 5 3 2 downstream users contributions by site now examining downstream users assurance contributions given these treatments to start we continue with non monetary sanctions table 6b for the high trust site again the sanctions help after round 1 this option to signal displeasure to upstream raised contributions by downstream that is consistent with sanctions being a tool to nudge providers so all move to a better equilibrium yet with intermediate trust in veracruz these sanctions have no significant effect on contributions and for low trust in yucatan if anything these sanctions appear to lower the users contributions expectations could explain effects in either direction if with high trust providers will respond well as in fact they did as seen in table 6a then users may be more hopeful about site cooperation yet on the other hand having the option to sanction could itself lower expectations of providers bowles 69 hypothesized that institutions impart information that affects individual decisions here an option to sanction may slander providers i e lead users to believe providers will defect if not the reasoning goes then the experiment would not have involved any such sanction option in other words sanctions may tell downstream participants that the providers are not trustworthy further those who sent a sanction after judging contributions lower than sufficient likely lowered their expectations as is suggested in table 6b by negative effects even in the higher trust site with this in mind we further consider the monetary sanctions which might send stronger signals were bowles idea to apply we might expect such a negative inference from the option to sanction to be more prevalent for low prior trust table 6b supports such a conjecture monetary sanctions had no significant effects in quintana roo yet they actually reduce user contributions in yucatan it seems possible then that by offering sanction options we are reinforcing low trust perceptions yet even in yucatan eventually the contributions catch up to baseline with no effect in round 3 that clearly could be due to the power of observed behavior to overcome any inferences based on e g simply the option to sanction if people actually contribute eventually users should expect it thus table 6b is consistent with complementarity of upstream and downstream groups efforts because sanctions increase providers contributions downstream participants should update their expectations based on use of sanctions after initial reductions in contributions they end up rising even if sanctions are needed to encourage contributions eventually expectations or trust can rise 6 discussion inspired by the design of a novel mexican policy to support the development of new local pes we used a novel experimental design to model creation and continuation of collective local pes mechanisms we model them as an assurance game between downstream user groups who pay and upstream provider groups who are paid to take costly actions upstream which conserve forests if both the costly actions and the payments occur both groups will be better off yet if one group upstream or downstream fails to do its part efforts at the other end will lower welfare there that can yield a collapse of pes coordination i e failure to create or continue the new local pes the results of our games carried out in three watersheds in mexico support the supposition that outcomes in such a coordination setting will be a function of expectations including prior beliefs as well as both positive and negative impacts upon expectations created by the option to sanction we found sanctions can increase trust and contributions over time albeit with different average impacts upon the contributions by upstream services suppliers and downstream services users we also documented what we believe to be significant different across watersheds in prior trust between upstream and downstream that should affect baseline coordination and sanction impacts our results suggest that is the case differences in baseline contributions aligned with prior trust so too did the impacts from sanctions which could be either monetary or non monetary sanctions for instance monetary sanctions raised upstream contributions only for our higher trust watershed while they initially lowered downstream contributions only for our lower prior trust watershed this suggests that for collective settings trust capital is central for creation and function of pes our finding regarding the role of trust within successful coordination during these games matches observations made by program implementers about the importance of social capital in pes sites it is also in line with our observations that some of the earliest and most successful adopters in the matching funds program are located in sites that had some prior upstream downstream success in coordination which can build watershed trust as well as high levels of organization upstream building on prior watershed social capital is consistent with ostrom 42 trying a new policy where conditions are easier can help with harder cases later by setting precedents and expectations our results also suggest potential for positive impacts from introduction or greater use of sanctions in pes including in collective local pes in which downstream groups pay upstream groups we find that getting sanctioned raise individual contributions and sanctions raise total contributions even after any initial negative effects in settings where mutual assurance or coordination is key sanctioning can help local pes institutions to start and to build watershed user provider trust however such sanctioning has not been common within pes initiatives in mexico or elsewhere perhaps not surprisingly given the lack of conditioning payments on services 77 our results suggest that stronger conditioning through the imposition and enforcement of sanctions could bring watershed gains and other lab in feld experiments also help to examine their potential kaczan et al 61 combine sanctions with greater insistence upon additionality in ecoservices an agency could sanction as a signal before cancelling payments for lack of services generation yet how will upstream providers respond they find conditioning on contributions above baseline additionality raised contributions upstream for matching funds sites in a public goods game while non monetary sanctions similar to those tested here can function to improve coordination this may be particularly important if pes need to be applied to higher pressure regions for impacts 97 and others show higher impacts with more pressure and those regions have higher opportunity costs and non compliance requiring monitoring and enforcement our results show that for assurance settings external intervention could be welcome as a tool to coordinate in practice local partners interested in ensuring ecosystem services flows can monitor compliance of providers with pes contracts in our yucatan site ngos partner with conafor to monitor and then decide upon sanctions which nicely highlights the potential for flexibility in local pes in our veracruz site even before the pes mechanism was implemented external and local actors were integrated through a watershed governance committee including upstream and downstream actors plus authorities in this case decision making and governance of the local pes program including verification and ensuring compliance with contracts were easily taken up by the existing committee this shows the potential value of allowing flexibility for local institutional innovations that adapt to details of local settings including for the construction and enforcement of sanctions stepping back our results suggest a potential to create and sustain local collective pes and that this is more likely with greater watershed trust between upstream providers and downstream users we found both that prior social capital is important for coordination and sanction impacts and that so too is the building up of trust that can occur over time when there is a successful coordination that in turn points to the potential of sanctions as tools for keeping everybody in good order to create and sustain environments in which social capital can be built yet we also show the potential for sanctions to elicit negative reactions highlighting the value of piloting policy variation within experiments with relevant field populations before attempting to change program rules in practice our experimental design explored some variations related to upstream downstream coordination as a complement to learning about trust and sanctions from all actual ongoing pes arrangements further research can explore additional variations to inform the design of future pes mechanisms acknowledgements we thank paola bauche socios

author payments for ecosystem services pes programs are now high in number if not always in impact when groups of users pay groups of service providers establishing pes involves collective action we study the creation of collective pes institutions and their continuation as group coordination we use framed lab in field experiments with hydroservices users and providers within watersheds participating in mexico s matching funds program in veracruz yucatan and quintana roo states we explore the coordination of contributions between downstream users and upstream providers plus effects of different types of sanctions that can affect expectations for both users and providers both information alone and sanctions raise contributions overall although outcomes varied by site in line with our rankings of watershed trust for instance monetary sanctions raise contributions in the watershed we ranked high in trust yet initially lowered them for the lowest trust watershed this suggests that upstream downstream social capital will be central to new collective local pes while our overall trends suggest social capital can be raised by successful coordination over time keywords payments for ecosystem services field lab experiments trust coordination sanctions collective action mexico jel classification d02 q23 q28 c93 1 introduction payments for ecosystem services pes are voluntary contracts between users of services and land managers who provide services that specify transfers based upon service flows or related actions such agreements can arise voluntarily if both users and providers feel they will benefit sufficiently to incur transactions costs 1 establishing such contracts does involve significant costs finding willing counterparts coordinating on payments as well as the metrics to be used to measure the flows of services and deciding how compliance will be monitored and enforced 23 states can lower transaction costs and help with coordination in organizing new pes institutions states also stand in for the users of services as in the largest and best known pes e g costa rica mexico and china 1 1 that could include compelling providers to participate even while compensating them as some have described pes in china 78 here we focus on states roles in contexts that are purely voluntary for all actors yet state involvement in pes faces challenges payments are public costs that can be put at risk by overall budget reductions and shifts in priorities across political regimes further states face high costs of monitoring and enforcement particularly for rural forest frontiers involving local users of ecosystem services can both costs of monitoring and local political risks local users also heighten the focus on outcomes i e truly conditioning payments on service flows or related actions overall implementation costs may be lower and payment effectiveness higher due to involved users who are proximate to the forest relative to the state s limited local presence finally local involvement may more generally allow pes designs to be adapted to local contexts e g to focus on activities that are least costly upstream or that best fit local facts and institutions even local services users though may face high costs of monitoring individual providers actions and measuring any program s outcomes as well as baselines which are needed to estimate impacts these issues motivate contracting with groups of providers 2 which also can follow from collective tenure or property rights upstream using group or collective measures within such contracts can lower monitoring costs states may more easily measure both baselines and ongoing forest or water quality at scales above the individual or the property level other examples of a focus on collective or group performance instruments in environmental policy include ambient based non point source pollution control e g refs 3 4 and the use of aggregate permits for natural resources 5 for a much more general discussion of potential policies based upon group performance see kotchen segerson 6 yet it is unclear how the upstream providers of ecosystem services will respond to group contracts as both services flows and institutions that generate them can be public goods that benefit many one known hazard is free riding i e doing nothing yet gaining from others actions under contracts 7 8 for instance a provider upstream might not contribute to land use changes required for services flows or a user downstream may not contribute financially the former might be addressed by upstream institutions including those created within collective tenure regimes kaczan et al 2017 s results suggest upstream capacity to solve free riding hurdles for the same program in mexico the latter might be addressed by downstream institutions e g water utilities charging fees yet even if both of these local solutions arise upstream and down there remains a challenge of coordinating effort levels between upstream and downstream groups 1 1 mexican program mexico s national forestry commission conafor has valuable experience with these issues it implemented a national state pays landowner pes program in 2003 that continues to this day multiple studies discuss its origins function and outcomes 9 11 and 12 as well as 2015 and find on the whole relatively little conditioning of payment on higher ecosystem service flows that is very consistent with national level findings for a similar state led national pes program in costa rica see e g refs 13 14 that mexican and that costa rican pes program also have both been vulnerable to shifts within broad political and economic forces that can threaten program budgets and ultimately viability 10 15 to support development of local pes initiatives with involvement of users in 2008 conafor started a local payments for ecosystem services mechanisms through matching funds program mecanismos locales de pagos por servicios ambientales a través de fondos concurrentes i e matching funds in this program conafor matches up to 50 of the funding committed by local users strong interest and involvement by downstream users are central to this program s theory of impact all applications must include up front financial commitments from the users because there are often numerous downstream users or ecosystem service beneficiaries in such situations these pes initiatives often require local organization and collective action downstream upstream collective action also is often required an estimated 60 of the forested land in mexico is under collective title in ejidos or indigenous communities 16 and 17 find that the great majority of the enrolled properties in the national pes program 2004 2010 were under collective title thus often upstream groups already have confronted and are likely to have significant experience with the challenge of martialing groups for effective collective action 1 2 experiment results in sum for pes in mexico and elsewhere involving local actors can raise the salience of services flows to users and can lower the cost of monitoring those flows yet even with perfect institutions at each end of a watershed upstream downstream coordination is a challenge creating new local pes can therefore usefully be considered as a between group coordination or assurance game each group will gain if the pes works assuming a price exists that is below users gains yet above providers costs yet contributing is pointless if one believes the other group will not also do so 2 2 42 highlights a 2nd order collective action dilemma a new institution is to solve an incentive problem but its creation faces incentive problems on rationality of cooperation given others cooperation see skyrms 74 creating and sustaining pes has significant costs including time required for building consensus and new processes and institutions then all of that again if shocks occur since effort is pointless if it is at only one end of the watershed expectations are critical for contributions we model pes interactions as an assurance game between these two groups any one group upstream providers or downstream users will lose out from contributing if the group at the other end of the watershed contributes little yet it does not lose if the other group contributes a lot whether contributing is rational depends upon one s belief about the other group the problem is one of mutual assurance 18 critically there exist high efficient and low inefficient symmetric equilibria what shapes groups expectations of each other should be a focus for design and implementation of local pes perceptions at one end of a watershed concerning the other end obviously are critical it matters not only if there exists trust between upstream providers and downstream users but also whether each group thinks the other handles internal free riding effectively to function as a group evolving watershed trust is a central focus within this study in multiple ways we conduct surveys and post games group discussions to explore attitudes and perceptions at the individual level and the group level as well as the watershed scale we implement trust games between individual upstream and downstream participants also framed around pes before our assurance games and we study the dynamics with non monetary sanctions on providers for insufficient contributions our interest in sanctions follows from our belief that there is low additionality in pes schemes i e little conditioning of payment on services and thus services do not rise relative to the baseline sanctions such as cutting payments for a lack of action can be one way to increase conditioning yet external judgmental interventions might produce anger instead of increased service provision this tension highlights the value of experiments with field populations while we could not alter conafor s actual pes policy design to test speculations about reactions to possible sanctions 3 3 conafor has not emphasized sanctions within pes consistent with pes globally not insisting on additionality we note that sanctions have occurred though in the monarch butterfly biosphere reserve 98 experiments let us work with the agency to simulate the behavioral impacts of potential policies by randomizing possible variations upon local pes structures with the relevant field populations we find that few groups in our experiments start at high or low equilibria yet many move toward social optima i e efficient high equilibria over time in accord with payoffs from coordination we find that site conditions matter upstream downstream trust perceptions vary and align by site with both baseline pre sanction assurance behaviors and the impacts of our sanction treatments monetary sanctions raise contributions by upstream provider for our highest prior trust site yet the same sanctions initially lower contributions by downstream users within our lowest trust site at an individual level we find that having gotten a sanction leads providers to raise contributions further after initial rounds which can include negative reactions both information provision alone and our sanctions treatments raise overall contributions from both the user and the provider groups thus our results suggest that for institutional settings that require collective action between users downstream and providers upstream upstream downstream social capital is central to local pes creation and function plus it can be built through success even if successes required sanctions both prior watershed trust and sanctions can act as assurance tools which align key expectations sections 2 and 3 review literature and the development of pes in mexico section 4 presents our sample motivation for and details of our upstream downstream assurance game framed as local pes section 5 then describes our results in detail while section 6 provides additional discussion 2 related literature voluntary contracts for clear services 19 95 resemble coase 1960 1 response to pigou socially inefficient externalities can be resolved by bargaining to transactions if property rights are defined and enforced while transaction costs are low 20 that sounds simple yet in practice the design and implementation of pes have not been simple in fact it is difficult to link specific actions by providers to the flow of ecosystem services 8 21 given scales and biophysical complexities 22 compliance additionality temporal permanence and spatial leakage are immense challenges too returning to coase also transaction costs can be high 21 as noted above all of these challenge could suggest gains from state roles within pes 22 23 however as noted above there are clear ways in which the involvement of local individuals and groups might improve outcomes it can lower political risks both by lowering federal dominance of program support and by fostering a sense of local ownership of all the agreed arrangements certainly it can lower costs of monitoring local users may also heighten the focus on outcomes making payments more strongly conditional on services or related actions from which they benefit finally as noted in literature on potential benefits from decentralization 24 involvement of locals may allow pes designs to be adapted to local contexts e g with activities that are least costly or fit institutions upstream altogether then payment effectiveness can rise given users in closer proximity to forest frontiers relative to the state s often limited presence 2 1 local collective institutions payments for ecosystem services state versus direct user financing is a key pes dimension in user financed pes buyers are actual users of ecosystem services more like a coasian ideal while in government financed pes the buyer is a third party acting for users users have clearest incentives to ensure that services are actually delivered they may also be able to directly observe the delivery of services and if it fails be able to end pes 25 wunder et al 21 find user financed programs better targeted more locally adapted better monitored and more likely to enforce conditionality in practice varied public private and hybrid pes institutions exist which can be closer to market transactions government subsidies or social agreements for collective action around public goods while all pes use transfers between actors to align individual and social incentives they vary in emphasis upon social elements values perceptions relationships power and politics 26 27 4 4 there is great variation wunder et al 21 distinguish the sloping land conversion program in china with over 12 m ha and a central government buyer from the los negros watershed program in bolivia which covers 3k ha with variety of actors including municipalities ngos as the demanders negotiating agreements with the upstream actors variations are clear in local pes 28 31 93 including with regard to upstream downstream conflict resolution plus trust fairness and social motivations 15 32 33 raising the issue of whether pes reduce or even enhance related intrinsic and social motivations 34 62 5 5 underlying this idea is a psychological notion of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation 79 there is ample literature for situations such as blood donation civic engagement and punctuality of parents in picking up children from day care see e g refs 69 70 80 81 collective contracts can help coordinate landowners over large areas and reduce transaction costs of verification and payments 2 this could improve performance see ref 35 meta analysis of 47 watershed schemes with 17 community contracts although social capital and trust are critical for better participation and function 36 given roles for local social norms 6 6 social norms are shared understandings of how individual members should behave in a given circumstance people within a community reward or punish people for their behaviors in following or breaking the rules 37 and neighbors decisions 37 pes design could in turn help to build local social capital for evidence in mexico see e g ref 38 that helps to address other group challenges 22 39 participation cooperation and coordination are highlighted in common pool resource management 40 42 with insights for pes design 43 44 conceptualizing the provision of ecosystem services in part as social dilemma rather than solely an externality issue for which market instruments are sufficient can facilitate local roles within hybrid structures in which monetary incentives are just a part 45 2 2 economic experiments 2 2 1 social dilemmas cooperation coordination noussair and van soest 46 review two uses of economic lab experiments on environmental policy first as a test bed for market mechanisms such as for water or pollution permits second to explore social dilemmas in providing public goods and extracting common pool resources e g 42 47 48 72 for the latter the focus has been the identification of conditions in which self regulation and cooperation occur including the specifics of policy design and taking into account possible motivational crowding 7 7 changes in motivations due to interventions with economic incentives have been for common pool resources and public goods games cardenas et al 47 find extraction is closer to the selfish nash solution when a fine is imposed vollan 82 showed that a supportive intervention e g reward does not crowd out initial cooperative motivations while restrictive external interventions e g punishment may especially for situations with substantial trust and social norms in the community kolinjivadi et al 83 observed that pre existing social norms and tradition explain baseline cooperation while collective monetary incentives and individual image based incentives boost cooperation most results do not support crowding out of intrinsic and social motivations 34 84 though incentives may reduce motivations of those excluded if that is considered unfair 85 2016 some such conditions produce coordination challenges as in the assurance game 18 49 with efficient and inefficient equilibria we want to employ assurance rather than pure coordination between equally valued equilibria 8 8 coordination games can be matching games games with asymmetric payoffs and games with asymmetric equilibria 49 in matching games all equilibria have the same payoffs for each player in games with asymmetric payoffs players disagree about which equilibrium is best e g battle of the sexes in games with asymmetric equilibria players are symmetric but payoffs for efficient and inefficient equilibria are not e g assurance games because having a functioning new local pes institution pareto dominates an equilibrium of non contribution i e both groups fare better yet there is a risk in contributing to creating new local pes institutions if others do not contribute thus as in the assurance structure the non contribution inefficient equilibrium is risk dominant compared to being in a prisoners dilemma achieving the efficient high contribution equilibrium seems less demanding even given the risk of being the only contributor yet coordination involves expectations often a function of prior interactions and institutions camerer 49 finds that in assurance failure is common i e play often does not converge to the pareto efficient equilibrium games requiring threshold levels of contributions to generate public goods have been widely used in laboratories with standard student subjects and abstract framing as opposed to field settings they require a minimum level of contributions to trigger the provision of the public good reward from which all benefit marginal benefits of contributions are zero up to the threshold then at the threshold it is beneficial to cooperate above the threshold defecting again is a preferred strategy experimental literature mainly explores coordination challenges for different institutional designs 50 52 coordination upon an efficient equilibrium is highly dependent on institutional features but it can be 30 40 53 54 55 96 when coordination devices are employed e g money back guarantee e g ref 50 or various forms of communication 56 success rates increase significantly 2 2 2 pes experiments pes experiments can consider designs not yet observed 9 9 pes experiments also have considered auctions to reveal private information to reach more cost effective allocations among landholders e g refs 86 88 and jindale et al 89 use auction results and household data to simulate tradeoffs between cost effectiveness and maximizing participation by poor households and permit the exploration of motivations 57 58 payments may raise efforts if norms of communal work are absent 59 and perhaps by more when coupled with a nudge 60 collective contracting in pes is an understudied element kaczan et al 61 take pes as given i e do not focus on institutional creation by upstream and downstream groups as we do here and employ an upstream public goods game facing pes incentives with incentives to free ride in watersheds involved in the same mexican pes program we study here they find that groups solve this challenge that implies greater impacts when the pes contracts demand greater additionality they also find better outcomes when players can participate in rule making and when mechanisms such as the availability of non monetary sanctions within a community can facilitate cooperation as kaczan et al 61 find success in this setting in overcoming free riding problems upstream to supply services we assume functioning institutions at each end of a watershed and instead focus on the coordination between upstream and downstream groups to create new collective local pes collective payments can crowd out social norms given the free riding potential in collective action 57 58 on the other hand success with collective incentives can enhance social motivations even when individual incentives do not 62 for this same setting in fact kaczan et al 61 find if anything a crowding in of contributions by pes 63 and cardenas et al 64 use trust games 65 to mimic a pes relationship between upstream and downstream jack 63 finds removing an intervention lowered transfers relative to the situation without enforcement at any point cardenas et al 64 focused on initial trust levels finding lowest levels among the downstream users in considering upstream providers we also focus on upstream downstream interactions with groups at each end of the watersheds we employ an assurance game with efficient and inefficient equilibria unlike most prior work moreover rather than considering coordination by individuals we explore coordination of groups 2 2 3 peer sanctioning sanctions allow less drastic signaling than a collapse of cooperation participants express prosocial motives by condemning negative behaviors or rewarding cooperation 66 aiding cooperation 67 68 by reinforcing reciprocity and fairness signaling pro social motives and activating shame or other social preferences 69 70 field and experimental evidence find that conditional cooperation and costly punishment of free riders are key for collective action e g refs 42 71 91 especially if greater deviations from cooperation lead to heavier sanctions 67 68 sanctions need not be monetary expressions of disapproval can boost cooperation 48 61 72 non monetary sanctions have a monetary cost only for sanctioners and thus they are more efficient in situations in which they are equally effective yet they may have less effect over time 48 66 72 our coordination is between groups and adds sanctioning of upstream mostly from downstream this novel inclusion relevant for real pes allows us see whether our downstream participants are willing to invest in signaling upstream participants while simultaneously contributing to pes and whether upstream participants in turn respond to sanctioning by increasing their contributions 3 pes in mexico 3 1 government financed national pes mexico s federal payments for ecosystem services program was started in 2003 as a response to water scarcities and deforestation communal or small private landholders sign 5 year contracts with conafor to conserve enrolled forest lands in exchange for a per hectare annual payment if deforestation is detected conafor reduces the payments proportional to the hectares lost conafor data indicate that 8969 contracts enrolled 6 310 344 ha between 2003 and 2016 key factors in eligibility involve supply and demand e g being upstream of a population center 11 smallholders can enroll yet the majority of suppliers and land area are from federally recognized communal properties which include ejidos and indigenous communities 17 enrollment is by the democratic governing bodies of these communal properties 10 those involved make required forest management plans from a menu of activities firebreaks patrols to prevent illegal logging fencing to exclude cattle pest control and soil conservation the program has prioritized sites with high poverty and high percentages of indigenous populations 17 10 10 alix garcia et al 90 found that even though there is generally a trade off between poverty reduction and avoided deforestation the situation in common property lands is different compared to individual properties the program is more effective in avoiding deforestation in common property and still has positive effect on poverty reduction the national pes program has been funded to date by federal revenues from water fees with few initiatives evolving into local and user financed pes 11 73 yet funding has varied with budgets and priorities 3 2 federal facilitation of local pes in response to the lack of development of user financed initiatives from the national pes program in 2008 conafor created the innovative matching funds pes program its novel objective is to incentivize and support the development of the new institutions necessary for local pes initiatives conafor partners with a local organization e g an ngo water utility hydroelectric company municipal or state government and matches the funding that users committed to pay the providers the partners select users and providers find and manage the funds and largely monitor the results the great majority of matching funds initiatives involve hydrological services users have varied e g bottling plants irrigators state and municipal water utilities hydroelectric and mining firms conafor data from 2008 to 2016 indicate 157 total agreements with partners who have in turn developed 2061 contracts with communal and private landowners that enrolled 515 454 ha requirements for lands getting conafor funds are similar to those in the national pes program however partners can impose distinct standards for areas being paid through funding from users in those areas local partners can pay higher rates target land and land use of particular local value and require different management activities than conafor this flexibility allows the program to be adapted to local conditions and needs unlike the national pes program the matching funds program also allows that some of the monitoring of activities that are undertaken by the providers and some of the sanctioning for non compliance be done by local partners on behalf of the users 4 coordination to create collective local pes in a stag hunt assurance game 74 a hunter can put in effort to help catch a high value stag yet whether others will help is uncertain so it may be rational to hunt small prey alone yielding a lower but certain value if sufficient others help so the group can succeed with the stag it is rational for each to help either effort or defection could be rational depending upon beliefs 18 one symmetric nash equilibrium is pareto dominant and efficient in which all are fully contributing another is inefficient where none contribute the latter is risk dominant since it minimizes players joint risk 49 as expectations are central and based on the past equilibria can be self reinforcing reaching the pareto dominant equilibrium depends on prior and updated expectations of others trustworthiness if achieved that may be repeated 18 generally any tools that can influence beliefs clearly can affect the ongoing levels of cooperation 4 1 assurance games our assurance game was inspired by the design of conafor s novel matching funds program 11 11 similar dynamics could arise within a gift exchange game 67 68 in which a contribution by one group may be reciprocated it is sequential we think assurance mimics better local pes in which decisions in each group are made without being certain about the other group s total contribution while contributions evolve over time across rounds yet a sequential version of our group group coordination experiment could be an institutional variant building a new local pes can be represented we believe as a between group coordination game both users and providers are better off if the institution is created and functions yet organizing one s end of a watershed is pointless if one does not think that the other end can and will do so too given pes institution payments are not productive if cooperation breaks down upstream and thus behaviors do not shift while costly upstream shifts to create services are not productive if users downstream fails to collect funds so payments end if the other group does not do its part then the payoffs from effort are negative this interdependence makes beliefs about the other end critical in our field lab experiment each provider and each user decide how much effort to contribute no player receives direct benefits from their own group s contributions instead individuals earnings rise with the other group s total contributions while falling with one s own level of contributions unless the other group has high contributions in which case one does not lose from contributing as noted and distinct from standard public goods provision there are multiple equilibria here defecting could dominate or full contribution may remain stable we cannot predict contributions we can expect that higher contributions by another group will raise expectations and contributions in our game each participant in each group chooses to contribute 0 1 2 or 3 units of effort to pes recall that we used an explicit frame of pes contributions by providers are represented as trees i e changes in land use that raise tree cover while contributions by users are represented as coins i e payments that flow to upstream providers all participants make decisions simultaneously table 1 shows payoffs as a function of one s own contribution and the average contribution at the other end of a watershed appendix 1 shows the materials that were actually used out in the field each person chooses between 0 and 3 units of effort groups of 5 users and groups of 5 providers are randomly matched thus the total contribution by any user or provider group ranges from 0 to 15 in table 1 s upper left cell are the payoffs due to zero effort by users and zero effort by providers i e no payments and baseline land use moving to the right each cell represents increased efforts to conserve trees upstream moving down each cell represents greater contributions to payments by downstream users we used ranges or intervals to make this table simpler for field participants there is an equilibrium at all zeros i e no contributions and a cooperative equilibrium with full contributions neither is dominant as the best choice depends on expectations of others as above we highlight our across watershed focus the payment of an individual participant does not depend on their own group contribution but on the collective contribution of the other end of the watershed again taking as given the institutions upstream and downstream we are focused upon the creation of a new upstream downstream institution that requires coordination for sustenance of ecoservices as we think often occurs in pes upstream and downstream actors decide how much effort to put into the creation and continuation of an institution that can benefit both groups once pes exists each year downstream users sign contracts with upstream providers yet as pes are very often not highly conditional users do not have great information on flows when they make their payments over time at least proxies for direct measures are available our game models this through rounds 4 2 trust games in the same experimental sessions before assurance games we anonymously and randomly paired each provider with an individual user for a trust game 65 framed in terms of pes each player had no information other than their partner s location i e upstream or downstream each was endowed with eight tokens first movers decided how many tokens s 0 to 8 to send that amount was tripled by the experimenter so that second movers had their initial eight tokens plus three times the amount s sent by the first mover they then sent back between zero and 8 3s first mover decisions were made without knowing that a second mover role would follow 12 12 in the strategy method with respondent decisions for each possible offer by the 1st mover thus our 2nd movers do not know the 1st movers decisions but decide for each hypothetical choice from 0 to 8 tokens made by a 1st mover with random assignment to one role to calculate earnings role reversal with random rematching 75 for payments purposes after first mover decisions participants were asked how many tokens they expected in return for our analysis we only use decisions as 1st movers plus the expectations about what will be returned we do not use 2nd mover decisions given a focus on expectations or trust i e not trustworthiness we also collected perceptions of inter group upstream downstream and intra group trust in surveys post games group discussions and qualitative observations our site descriptions subsection 4 5 focus on the trust perceptions 4 3 information sanctions we explored policy interventions to maintain local pes institutions and to increase contributions sanctions can be signals of dissatisfaction e g in the matching funds program non compliance could be sanctioned by a reduction of payments as decided by conafor or by the local partner in our experiment the largest sanction could enforce a lack of contributions so all are worse off that is analogous to not having a new local pes institution either a new mechanism never started or it started but then was cancelled as the largest possible sanction which has happened in reality after an initial baseline round played as described in subection 4 1 we played three additional rounds in which we gave information to all participants concerning individual choices of providers beyond that information which everyone always had our treatments are three types of sanctions to estimate impacts of sanctions we compared each sanction treatment to information alone i e to sessions in which information about provider choices was provided but there were no sanctions we focus treatments on providers as within pes payments are conditioned on provider behavior and imposed by users our sanctioning treatments are intended to explore whether some sanctions can be useful for cases of upstream non compliance in avoiding the total cancelation of payments information on the behavior of providers anonymously list the actions of all the providers for all participants to see and anonymity is achieved via random assignments of pictures the groups who were randomly assigned to this treatment functioned as our control groups providers providers nonmonetary sanction after seeing individual choices by providers for a financial cost mxn 1 providers could send a red card to disapprove of a provider if any were sent then the facilitators displayed the red cards received by each participant users providers nonmonetary sanction after seeing the individual choices by providers for a financial cost mxn 1 any user could send a red card to disapprove of any provider if any were sent then the facilitators displayed the red cards received by each participant users providers monetary sanction after seeing all of the individual choices by providers for a financial cost mxn 1 any user could monetarily sanction a provider as disapproval again anonymous via use of random pictures the cost of being sanctioned was mx 3 13 13 a 3 1 fine to fee ratio is widely used in sustaining contributions 91 92 expectations are critical if users expect to send sanctions which raise contributions by providers users who sanction should increase contributions a virtuous cycle of strategic complementarities yet if users think sanctions exist since providers are not trustworthy they will lower contributions 4 4 recruitment implementation after a field pilot in coatepec in veracruz state we conducted experiments in three sites where the matching funds program had been implemented recruiting 240 users and 240 providers 80 each per site sessions had 10 users and 10 providers meeting simultaneously in different places providers are inhabitants of communal properties enrolled in the pes where they gathered users live and gathered in cities that receive services produced by those upstream communal properties xalapa veracruz cancun quintana roo and merida yucatan upstream and downstream sites are separated by over an hour of driving all the recruitment was done by the local ngos involved in the matching funds program in each of these sites invitations were extended through word of mouth as well as through advertising in ngos headquarters and other local venues in xalapa at the office of the water utility all of the adults who showed up were accepted into the sessions the facilitators were researchers from duke university and staff from the ngos for consistency a single experimenter led all the sessions with providers while another led all sessions with users users and providers interacted through facilitators via cell phone calls treatments followed the logic within table 2 which reflects our downstream upstream focus we employed less upstream upstream sanctioning noting that it has been considerably more studied in the existing literature for the trust games the anonymity was assured using randomly assigned identification numbers also used for upstream downstream matching after trust games although without their results participants played our assurance games each group was anonymously matched with one group at the other end of the watershed using the random color of identification number cards after the baseline assurance round i e the initial round with no treatments information or sanctions participants in all treatments played three more rounds in which all participants received all of the information about providers behavior within each treatment again always with full anonymity decisions were made simultaneously we did not provide the baseline results so that we could test reactions to treatments alone in the round after the baseline without reactions to baseline results results of trust games and assurance baselines were communicated after all decisions were made at session s end contributions during the treatment rounds were communicated after each round we played only a few rounds because the logistics of the experiment were very challenging as it required upstream downstream communication where the cell phone signal was poor in addition due to lower education it took some time to play upstream each session lasted about three hours given multiple sessions per location to avoid the risk of communications from all those who had already participated we shifted villages once per day for upstream participants for downstream participants were invited to participate through different means including word of mouth and the games were always in the same venue in the regressions we have included controls per session 4 5 sites for our framed experiment we chose three sites for experiments during the summer of 2014 after consulting with conafor and visiting 12 matching funds sites in mid 2013 one site in the state of veracruz led by the ngo sendas one in the state of yucatan led by the ngo niños y crias and one in the state of quintana roo led by the ngo amigos de sianka an a primary selection criterion was that there be multiple services users and multiple providers unlike when single large actors such as the state or a downstream utility as a user or an upstream landowner as a provider can decide with no collective action required our experimental design explicitly matched reality we complement experiments with surveys and post games group discussions with the participants in order to get contextual information on both the individuals and the site to inform interpretation of experimental results 76 characteristics of participants by site based upon surveys and baseline choices in the trust and the assurance games are summarized in appendix 2 below we highlight contrasts across the sites based on surveys and post games group discussions for instance while ejidos in the case of quintana roo have not been divided into individual plots in yucatan and veracruz cases the property rights have been partially individualized following a 1992 constitutional reform 94 yucatan and veracruz ejidos also face larger financial opportunity costs of conservation than in quintana roo while most of the quintana roo and veracruz providers participating in our experiments are ejidatarios i e have property rights most yucatan participants do not have but are allowed to live within the ejido this is reflected in the asambleas i e meetings of all those with rights in ejidos where decisions about community governance and communal lands are made asamblea participation was higher in quintana roo at an average of 7 91 meetings with a rate of attendance of 90 of the assemblies on average most providers in quintana roo and veracruz spend 1 2 days per month on forest management most participants in yucatan are not in community groups and 40 are not actively involved in forest management involvement in community organizations is higher in veracruz with 60 of our participants devoting on average a solid 17 5 h per month to community activities intra community trust is generally higher within quintana roo and veracruz than it is in yucatan while 80 of participants in quintana roo and in veracruz stated that they can trust most people in their community the share is significantly lower in yucatan 55 3 upstream to downstream trust also is higher within quintana roo where 72 6 of providers think they can trust most people within the city well above veracruz 38 4 and yucatan 35 1 generally historical tensions between users and providers were more evident in the post games groups discussions in yucatan where some providers stated that the city is buying up but underpaying ejido lands to ensure water provision in the long run leaving those ejidatarios in relevant locations with no land and no water users perceptions of environmental issues and their causes also contrast sharply across sites while 50 of veracruz participants believe that there exist serious issues of local water scarcity only 16 perceived local water scarcity in quintana roo and yucatan water quality issues were noted in post games group discussions in quintana roo and yucatan yucatan downstream users said they distrust upstream providers blaming them for a fall in water quality and more generally expressing doubt about provider commitment to forest conservation yucatan users said providers in the jungle are responsible for the reduction in the city s water quality while quintana roo downstream users expressed that their upstream providers do comply with forest conservation once they have committed to it for payment these results coincide with the downstream upstream trust reported in the survey while 80 of downstream users in quintana roo think they can trust most people upstream that share is 70 in veracruz and yucatan users in quintana roo also report higher willingness to pay the providers for ecosystem services than users in the other sites at us 111 3 per year in quintana roo versus us 22 0 in veracruz and us 35 5 in yucatan in sum we find differences across space in levels of prior upstream downstream watershed trust within both the survey data above and qualitative data including post games group discussions from our interpretation of the data we identify an upstream downstream apparent trust gradient across the sites quintana roo has the highest prior level of upstream downstream trust veracruz has intermediate prior trust level or perhaps ambiguous based upon the information we have and yucatan has the lowest prior trust this perceived gradient as well as trust game results allow us to explore effects on assurance contributions of perceived watershed trust among users and providers we believe upstream downstream trust should affect not only average contributions but also in principle the impacts of having any sanction available for signaling dissatisfaction as noted above how the option of sanctions affects expectations could vary considerably by group 5 results 5 1 assurance contributions separating watersheds in baseline before any mention of sanctions yucatan had the lowest contributions by providers in group group assurance baselines table 3 among the users once again the yucatan participants contributed least quintana roo in contrast had the highest contributions among the users as well the providers note that those quintana roo provider participants included some men quite familiar with pes as longstanding ejidatorios in total by watershed contributions averaged quintana roo 2 21 veracruz 2 1 yucatan 1 85 thus these baseline contribution levels align with our perceived trust gradient across watersheds also the number of tokens sent in the initial trust game as well as the expected return had some predictive power for users assurance baselines appendix 4 pooled or by site showing stronger effects in veracruz and quintana roo but not focused on differences in trust across watersheds table 3 also shows the share of participants making each possible choice by site and role while the equilibria are zero and three units two is the modal contribution for both users and providers perhaps reflecting uncertainty about others choices table 4 shows that over half of the upstream downstream pairings of groups are in the 8 12 8 12 cell i e 2 2 on average whose payoff is no more than the zeros equilibrium but whose downside risk is lower than contributing three units since within our relatively challenging assurance game the highest payoff from raising one s own contributions is zero the baseline contributions seemed relatively high we speculatively link this to both a predilection toward and exposure to local pes as our sites participate in matching funds given such prior experiences we might expect our games to start with relatively high cooperation 5 2 sanctions impacts pooling watersheds on assurance contributions across rounds options for some actors to sanction upstream participants are announced after the baseline decision round 0 but before participants make round 1 decisions thus before round 1 all are aware that some actors will have the option to impose a sanction on any participant upstream after round 1 sanctions would be based on upstream individuals contributions in round 1 which after the round will be listed for all to see albeit anonymously as the core information we always made available any impacts of sanctions upon round 1 are due to the threat not to having received any sanctions for rounds 2 and 3 though players could also react to having received or sent some sanction s fig 1 shows provider choices before round 0 and after sanctions are announced round 1 and implemented rounds 2 and 3 we see that on average all treatments raise providers giving we note that while treatment assignment was random treatments varied in baseline contributions thus to best perceive the impacts of the treatments we need to assess not just endpoints but slopes through repetition a larger percentage of participants tend to move towards the optimum of three this can be seen also in appendix 3 where we report the distribution of choices per round and site fig 2 shows users choices before round 0 plus after sanctions are announced round 1 and implemented rounds 2 3 again giving rises with treatments even with initial negative effects again more details are in our appendix 3 where we report the all the choices per round and site what we take away from figs 1 and 2 beyond the overall increases in contributions over time is that there existed considerable differences between responses by upstream providers and those by downstream users across the rounds as our information and sanctions treatments played out this is confirmed in table 5 s regressions on average across the watersheds providers and users varied in reactions to sanctions consistent with average differences in baselines in table 3 above in short average provider contributions responded positively if sanctions were available and used while average user reactions to having and sending sanctions were if anything initially negative tables 5 s first three columns compare individuals rounds 1 2 3 with their round 0 baselines the last two columns analyze contributions changes round2 round1 and round3 round2 to allow a focus upon who received or sent sanctions once we control for sanctions that occurred however coefficients on the treatments themselves are harder to interpret than in initial columns table 5a shows that on average providers responded positively to sanctions by the 3rd and final round each type of sanction ended up with higher contributions relative to baseline than did the information alone treatment all coefficients are positive and across the three sanction treatments they increase in both magnitude and significance when looking at the 3rd round versus the 1st round further looking at the table s final two columns for changes across rounds once a provider could have been sanctioned which at earliest could happen as a reaction to a provider s 1st round choice we see that when an individual provider has received a sanction that too increases contributions table 5b tells a rather different story for users no coefficient is significant for round 3 further no coefficient is significant for nonmonetary sanctions the only significant sanctions coefficients are for monetary sanctions for earlier rounds and those are not positive but significantly negative thus averaging across watersheds having the option to sanction lowered round 1 contributions seemingly in anticipation of lower provider contributions than are expected without any sanctions further as sanctions arose the only significant coefficient on sending a sanction also is negative thus if one felt the need to sanction not surprising that lowered expectations and contributions finally as it raised the baseline appendix 4 trust giving has a negative coefficient for change 5 3 sanctions impacts separating watersheds on assurance contributions across rounds 5 3 1 upstream providers contributions by site in tables 6 we use regression analyses to study impacts of sanctions on assurance contributions by site yet like table 5 still considering separately the providers table 6a and users table 6b we believe that prior upstream downstream trust levels varied across the three sites and further that those differences in watershed trust could impact not only average contributions in assurance consistent with table 3 discussed above but also impacts of the existence and use of sanctions for providers sanction impacts vary by watershed with a consistent gradient by prior trust level between upstream and downstream again almost all our sanctions were from down to up stream monetary sanctions consistently raise overall upstream contributions in quintana roo where we observed more trust from upstream to downstream and vice versa i e our high prior trust site monetary sanctions never raise overall upstream contributions in yucatan low prior trust site the other user to provider sanctions from downstream to upstream are non monetary sanctions 14 14 appendix 5 presents details about the frequency of each type of sanctions received and sent per site and treatment the non monetary sanctions were more common 31 vs 18 for r1 26 vs 12 for r2 26 vs 7 for r3 which is consistent with overall cost efficiency being higher for non monetary sanctions than monetary sanctions given not only lower total costs of non monetary sanctions but also on average at least as high contribution gains they did not significantly raise providers assurance contributions in veracruz however they did have some initial effects in quintana roo and yucatan seemingly anticipating better coordination yet as in veracruz ultimately they did not raise provider contributions for group group assurance finally in veracruz alone we also tried another non monetary sanction i e provider to provider they were non monetary because we feel that is more likely for upstream i e peer sanctioning interestingly if tentatively given only one site those non monetary sanctions started slowly but in contrast to user to provider non monetary sanctions they rose in impact across the three rounds 5 3 2 downstream users contributions by site now examining downstream users assurance contributions given these treatments to start we continue with non monetary sanctions table 6b for the high trust site again the sanctions help after round 1 this option to signal displeasure to upstream raised contributions by downstream that is consistent with sanctions being a tool to nudge providers so all move to a better equilibrium yet with intermediate trust in veracruz these sanctions have no significant effect on contributions and for low trust in yucatan if anything these sanctions appear to lower the users contributions expectations could explain effects in either direction if with high trust providers will respond well as in fact they did as seen in table 6a then users may be more hopeful about site cooperation yet on the other hand having the option to sanction could itself lower expectations of providers bowles 69 hypothesized that institutions impart information that affects individual decisions here an option to sanction may slander providers i e lead users to believe providers will defect if not the reasoning goes then the experiment would not have involved any such sanction option in other words sanctions may tell downstream participants that the providers are not trustworthy further those who sent a sanction after judging contributions lower than sufficient likely lowered their expectations as is suggested in table 6b by negative effects even in the higher trust site with this in mind we further consider the monetary sanctions which might send stronger signals were bowles idea to apply we might expect such a negative inference from the option to sanction to be more prevalent for low prior trust table 6b supports such a conjecture monetary sanctions had no significant effects in quintana roo yet they actually reduce user contributions in yucatan it seems possible then that by offering sanction options we are reinforcing low trust perceptions yet even in yucatan eventually the contributions catch up to baseline with no effect in round 3 that clearly could be due to the power of observed behavior to overcome any inferences based on e g simply the option to sanction if people actually contribute eventually users should expect it thus table 6b is consistent with complementarity of upstream and downstream groups efforts because sanctions increase providers contributions downstream participants should update their expectations based on use of sanctions after initial reductions in contributions they end up rising even if sanctions are needed to encourage contributions eventually expectations or trust can rise 6 discussion inspired by the design of a novel mexican policy to support the development of new local pes we used a novel experimental design to model creation and continuation of collective local pes mechanisms we model them as an assurance game between downstream user groups who pay and upstream provider groups who are paid to take costly actions upstream which conserve forests if both the costly actions and the payments occur both groups will be better off yet if one group upstream or downstream fails to do its part efforts at the other end will lower welfare there that can yield a collapse of pes coordination i e failure to create or continue the new local pes the results of our games carried out in three watersheds in mexico support the supposition that outcomes in such a coordination setting will be a function of expectations including prior beliefs as well as both positive and negative impacts upon expectations created by the option to sanction we found sanctions can increase trust and contributions over time albeit with different average impacts upon the contributions by upstream services suppliers and downstream services users we also documented what we believe to be significant different across watersheds in prior trust between upstream and downstream that should affect baseline coordination and sanction impacts our results suggest that is the case differences in baseline contributions aligned with prior trust so too did the impacts from sanctions which could be either monetary or non monetary sanctions for instance monetary sanctions raised upstream contributions only for our higher trust watershed while they initially lowered downstream contributions only for our lower prior trust watershed this suggests that for collective settings trust capital is central for creation and function of pes our finding regarding the role of trust within successful coordination during these games matches observations made by program implementers about the importance of social capital in pes sites it is also in line with our observations that some of the earliest and most successful adopters in the matching funds program are located in sites that had some prior upstream downstream success in coordination which can build watershed trust as well as high levels of organization upstream building on prior watershed social capital is consistent with ostrom 42 trying a new policy where conditions are easier can help with harder cases later by setting precedents and expectations our results also suggest potential for positive impacts from introduction or greater use of sanctions in pes including in collective local pes in which downstream groups pay upstream groups we find that getting sanctioned raise individual contributions and sanctions raise total contributions even after any initial negative effects in settings where mutual assurance or coordination is key sanctioning can help local pes institutions to start and to build watershed user provider trust however such sanctioning has not been common within pes initiatives in mexico or elsewhere perhaps not surprisingly given the lack of conditioning payments on services 77 our results suggest that stronger conditioning through the imposition and enforcement of sanctions could bring watershed gains and other lab in feld experiments also help to examine their potential kaczan et al 61 combine sanctions with greater insistence upon additionality in ecoservices an agency could sanction as a signal before cancelling payments for lack of services generation yet how will upstream providers respond they find conditioning on contributions above baseline additionality raised contributions upstream for matching funds sites in a public goods game while non monetary sanctions similar to those tested here can function to improve coordination this may be particularly important if pes need to be applied to higher pressure regions for impacts 97 and others show higher impacts with more pressure and those regions have higher opportunity costs and non compliance requiring monitoring and enforcement our results show that for assurance settings external intervention could be welcome as a tool to coordinate in practice local partners interested in ensuring ecosystem services flows can monitor compliance of providers with pes contracts in our yucatan site ngos partner with conafor to monitor and then decide upon sanctions which nicely highlights the potential for flexibility in local pes in our veracruz site even before the pes mechanism was implemented external and local actors were integrated through a watershed governance committee including upstream and downstream actors plus authorities in this case decision making and governance of the local pes program including verification and ensuring compliance with contracts were easily taken up by the existing committee this shows the potential value of allowing flexibility for local institutional innovations that adapt to details of local settings including for the construction and enforcement of sanctions stepping back our results suggest a potential to create and sustain local collective pes and that this is more likely with greater watershed trust between upstream providers and downstream users we found both that prior social capital is important for coordination and sanction impacts and that so too is the building up of trust that can occur over time when there is a successful coordination that in turn points to the potential of sanctions as tools for keeping everybody in good order to create and sustain environments in which social capital can be built yet we also show the potential for sanctions to elicit negative reactions highlighting the value of piloting policy variation within experiments with relevant field populations before attempting to change program rules in practice our experimental design explored some variations related to upstream downstream coordination as a complement to learning about trust and sanctions from all actual ongoing pes arrangements further research can explore additional variations to inform the design of future pes mechanisms acknowledgements we thank paola bauche socios
