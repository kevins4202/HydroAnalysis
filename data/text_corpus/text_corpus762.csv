3810,hydrologic regionalization consists of regrouping stations and catchments in pools based on a similarity measure regionalization is commonly used to extract a robust signal that can be used to describe the hydrology of the region or extrapolated to a location without measured information obviously the similarity measure used affects the type of hydrological behavior one would expect from stations within a region most regionalization methods assume a stable and or linear relationship between parameters of interests while it is well known that the physical processes driving the behavior of hydrometeorological variables are inherently non linear and non stationary in this paper we propose a similarity measure that is based on the location of changepoints in hydrological time series the proposed method has the unique advantage over other hydrological region delineation methods to detect regions where hydrological member stations are non linearly correlated and where the strength of the relation varies with time it therefore has the potential to uncover similarities that would not have been detected by existing regionalization techniques the proposed method is applied to the tensift watershed located in morocco north africa the coherence of the detected regions is checked using wavelet coherence keywords hydrologic regionalization similarity hydrological time series changepoints wavelet coherence 1 introduction the tensift basin fig 1 an arid to semi arid 20381 km2 watershed located in west central morocco it is limited by the jbilets desert in the north the high atlas mountains in the south the tassaout watershed in the east and the atlantic ocean in the west the climate of the region is classified as arid to semi arid saidi et al 2010 mahé et al 2012 precipitation in the watershed is highly variable in space and time annual rainfall varies from 650 mm in mountain areas to 100 mm in desert plains saidi et al 2003 saidi et al 2010 saidi et al 2012 agriculture is the main socio economic activity in the watershed its expansion has created a pressure on existing water resources and a depletion of the water table has been observed the increasing water scarcity is generating fears of recurrent droughts the study area is located in a transition zone between mediterranean and semi arid climates a region known to be affected by global changes such as the expansion of the hadley cell peleg et al 2015 evidence of the poleward expansion of the hadley zone has been documented by several authors in past observations as well as cmip5 and cmip6 simulations hu and fu 2007 peleg et al 2015 xia et al 2020 grise and davis 2020 the hadley cell extension will affect the regional climate in the subtropics through the displacement of warm climate coupled with the disruption of deep water upwelling feng and fu 2013 schmidt and grise 2017 the poleward extension of the hadley cell will make its intensity weaker and ultimately lead to the extension of the subtropical dry zone lu et al 2007 according to the draft ipcc ar6 technical report masson delmote et al 2021 there is a high confidence that the total land area subject to increasing drought frequency and severity will expand and that future aridification will far exceed the magnitude of change seen in the last millennium in several regions of the mediterranean basin there is hence a growing interest in understanding regional precipitation variability as it is of major importance for the management of water resources decision makers in morocco are very much interested in understanding whether there is a single or multiple regional climates over the study area in order to implement the appropriate policies one way of gaining that understanding is through hydrologic regionalization hydrologic regionalization consists of regrouping stations and catchments in pools which are expected to have the same hydrological behaviors regionalization has been intensively used for flood frequency analysis farquharson et al 1992 rosbjerg and madsen 1995 durrans and tomic 1996 pandey and nguyen 1999 alila 1999 2000 ouarda et al 2000 chokmani and ouarda 2004 and hydrological models parameters estimation sefton and howarth 1998 mwakalila 2003 heuvelmans et al 2006 seidou et al 2006 hundecha et al 2008 the delineation of regions is typically based on a similarity measure between watershed physiographic parameters or time series statistics at the sites of interests the similarity measure can be geographical distance grehys 1996 or the proximity of catchment attributes in projected specific spaces e g ouarda et al 1999 2001 han et al 2020 principal components analysis pca is one of the most popular regionalization methods pca regionalization approach is defined as a multivariate statistical method that aims to analyze and simplify a data table with m observations and n variables basilevsky 1994 it consists in transforming correlated variables into orthogonal principal components the variables are projected in a new space where along each axis the variance is maximized el alaoui el fels et al 2020 applied pca to monthly precipitation in the tensift region to delineate three homogenous regions ahattab et al 2015 applied pca to monthly precipitation from 23 stations in the tensift region and found four homogenous regions one of the limitations of pca is the assumption that the relationships between time series in a region are linear and constant trough time at the same time natural relations tend to be non linear and non stationary transformations of input time series such as log transformations allow accounting for a limited amount of nonlinearity agarwal et al 2016 used multiscale wavelet entropy to define the similarity measure between catchments they studied the monthly streamflow temporal variability of 530 stations during 52 years over the united states and determined homogenous groups where each one has a signature by defining clusters the idea of using wavelets for regions delineation is interesting as it accounts for relations that are non stationary and non linear one way to account for nonlinearity and non stationarity in the relations between two time series is to examine the similarities between the dates of changes in trends in the two time series time series in the same hydrologic region may not be linearly correlated but will have similar locations for the changepoints while any multiple changepoint approaches can be used to detect the positions of the changepoints we will be using the multiple changepoint detection procedure developed by seidou and ouarda 2007 because of its flexibility the method is designed to detect multiple changepoints in a multiple linear relation between one or many predictors and a predictand by changing the predictors one can detect abrupt shifts continuous or non continuous linear segments in analyzed time series the method also has the advantage of providing a probabilistic description of the changepoint locations another alternative for hydrologic region delineation using non stationary and non linear relations similar to agarwal et al 2016 is to define the similarity between two time series using wavelet cross coherence as defined by torrence and compo 1998 cross wavelet transform xwt aims to evaluate the covariance and causality between x and y however there are certain drawbacks associated with its use because it is not normalized as reported by maraun and kurths 2004 for this reason the authors believe that the best method to adopt for the examination of causality is the wavelet transform coherence wtc in so far as two variables can be dependent without there being a strong link xwt finds regions in the time frequency space where the time series show high common energy wavelet coherence is calculated using the continuous wavelet transform cwt of two time series cwt is an alternative approach to the fourier transform applied in the signal processing cwt and xwt has been widely used in many investigational studies grinsted et al 2004 özger et al 2009 keener et al 2010 ouachani et al 2011 sang 2013 naizghi and ouarda 2017 thiombiano et al 2016 chang et al 2017 santos et al 2018 the objectives of this paper are to extend the multiple changepoint detection method of seidou and ouarda 2007 to hydrological region delineation apply the methodology to the tensift watershed and verify the delineated regions using wavelet coherence 2 material and methods 2 1 bayesian multiple changepoint detection approach the original multiple changepoint detection method proposed by seidou and ouarda 2007 is a generalization of the changepoint procedure of seidou et al 2007 it is commonly used in the field of water resources see for instance ehsanzadeh et al 2011 the procedure is briefly presented below let y y 1 y 2 y n a time series of observation of length n m the number of changepoints τ 0 0 τ 1 τ n m the changepoints and y i j the observations from time i to time j let g be probability distribution of the time between changepoints and g 0 is the probability distribution of the first changepoint assuming the observations are independent conditional on the changepoints and parameters values fearnhead 2006 demonstrated that if 1 pr τ 1 y 1 n p 1 τ 1 q τ 1 1 g 0 τ 1 q 1 pr τ j τ j 1 y 1 n p τ j

and p t s s t are linked by these recursive equations 3 q 1 s 1 n 1 p 1 s q s 1 g 0 s p 1 n 1 g 0 n 1 q t s 1 n 1 p t s q s 1 g 0 s 1 t p t n 1 g n 1 where g t i 1 t g i and g 0 t i 1 t g 0 i seidou and ouarda 2007 derived an analytical expression for p t s when y is linked to a predictor x by a multiple linear regression equation 4 y j k 1 d θ k x ij ε i i 1 n or 5 y x θ ε y j k 1 d θ k x kj ε i

i 1 i 2 i n 1 and y t s y i 1 i 2 i n 1 the inference on the position of the changepoints is made by generating a set e s k k 1 m of m possible scatter schemes of the changepoints on the segment using the posterior probability mass of the first changepoint and the conditional probability mass of subsequent changepoints e s k k 1 m the k th element of e caller herein changepoint scatter scheme is a set of m k changepoints s k t 1 k t 2 k t m k k an efficient simulation algorithm for e is given by fearnhead 2006 1 for a sample of size m initiate m samples with a changepoint at t 0 2 for t 0 n 2 repeat the following steps a compute the number n t of samples for which the last changepoint was at time t b if n t 0 compute pr τ τ j 1 t y 1 n c sample n t times from pr τ τ j 1 t y 1 n and use the values to update the n t samples of changepoints which have a changepoint at time t in a practical problem it is unlikely to have two changepoints that are very close hence when sampling from pr τ τ j 1 t y 1 n if the next position is within the length of the time series but is less than a user defined l min from the previous changepoint it is discarded and another value is sampled inference on the number and positions of the changepoints is readily carried out using the m samples for instance the probability of having i changepoints is approximated by 9 pr m i c a r d k c a r d s k i m the posterior probability of having the kth changepoint at position t given m changepoints can be approximated by 10 pr τ i t m c a r d k card s k m t i k t card k c a r d s m where c a r d s stands for the number of elements of the set s the estimators of the number and positions of changepoints are the modes of their posterior distributions i e 11 m max t c a r d k c a r d k s t m 12 τ i max t c a r d k card s k m t i k t c a r d k c a r d s m 2 2 use of changepoints positions as a measure of similarity we propose to use the positions of the changepoints as a measure of similarity between two time series this is a fairly original use of the changepoint procedure ouarda et al 2014 used the same changepoint procedure to identify common dates of change in precipitation series in a number of meteorological stations in the united arab emirates with the objective of identifying low frequency climate oscillation indices that influence precipitation in various regions the procedure is presented below assume an ensemble of n climatic stations where a time series of a particular parameter e g annual precipitation is available for the sake of simplicity let s assume that the time series are available in the same period from y start to y end let y i the time series at the ith station y i pc p ystart i pc p ystart 1 i pc p yend i assume that the changepoint method of seidou and ouarda 2007 is applied to each station using the following predictand x 1 y start 1 y start 1 1 y end the application of the method to station i will result in a set e i s k i k 1 m of m possible scatter schemes of the changepoints positions as illustrated in fig 2 we define the similarity between n stations as the number changepoints scatter schemes with at least one changepoint that are common to e 1 e 2 e n divided by the maximum number of scatter schemes with at least one changepoint in any of e 1 e 2 e n the concept of similarity is illustrated in fig 3 using m 20 for a set of two and three stations for the sake of illustration the changepoints positions scatter schemes e i s k i k 1 m are represented as an array where the columns correspond to the position in the time series and the rows represent k black cells represent the changepoints lines that are common to all stations are coloured for illustration purposes in the two station example panel a the first station 19 rows with at least one changepoint and the second one has 20 the two stations have four similar rows hence their similarity is si m changepo int s s 1 s 2 4 min 19 20 4 19 0 2105 in the second example panel b the number of lines with at least one changepoint is 19 17 and 18 for the first second and third stations respectively given that they have three lines in common si m changepo int s s 1 s 2 s 3 3 min 19 17 18 3 17 0 1765 2 3 regions delimitation using changepoint based similarity the following algorithm is used to delineate regions in a set of n stations using the similarity measure defined in section 3 1 1 an initial set of n regions containing each one element is created 2 repeat until each region contains each station a for each station s i for each region r that does not contain s calculate the similarity sr of region r station s ii assign station s to the region with the highest sr and record sr as the entrance score of station s in region r b remove duplicates in regions 3 at the end of the process we have m revealed regions k n containing each of them includes the n stations in a specific order 4 iteratively search for the highest threshold t such as if stations with scores higher than t are removed from each region the union of the remaining elements in the regions contains all n stations 5 eliminate all stations with scores above t and obtain m regions that cover the n stations 2 4 local and regional trend for each station in the study region the probability of having one or several changepoints as well as the most likely position of these changes can be obtained using equations 9 11 once the number and positions of the changepoints are determined a local linear trend can be estimated between the detected changepoints the modeler can decide whether the trend is continuous or discontinuous at the changepoints the decision must be guided by the understanding of the physical process under consideration for instance hydroclimatic time series tend to vary smoothly because of climate change or climatic oscillations discontinuities generally occur only when there is a brutal change in the watershed such as a forest fire or the construction of a hydraulic infrastructure unless the modeler has knowledge of such of a sudden change on the watershed it is safer to assume continuity at the changepoints in this paper the trend is assumed to be continuous as we are dealing with precipitation time series and see no reason for an abrupt change once a region is delineated the same method can be used to have a regional probability of having a changepoint the position of the changepoints and a regional trend the only difference is that the union of the changepoints scatter schemes of all stations in the region is used in equations 9 11 the difference between the regional and local changepoints and trends can be a hint that a local perturbation has occurred and can be used for hydrologic data homogenization a number of other elements need to be integrated in the analysis future efforts will attempt to add more covariates physiographic climatic land cover etc in the model this will also explaining a larger portion of the variance and developing a more detailed and complete model which should translate into improved estimation results in addition the spatial and temporal variability including potential change points have to be combined and work in parallel in the same modeling logic to cover all aspects the geomorphological aspect and the study of the prevailing climate remain insufficient in regards to the definition of the homogeneous regions 2 5 continuous wavelet transform and wavelet coherence wavelet coherence is a mean of evaluating the covariance and causality between x and y first the continuous wavelet transform of x and y w n x and w n y are calculated the cross wavelet transform of x and y w n x y s is then calculated to explore high common power in both time frequency domains between the two time series finally their wavelet coherence r n 2 is calculated using their wavelet and cross wavelet transforms the mathematical expressions of w n x w n y and r n 2 are presented in the next sections w n x y s 2 5 1 continuous wavelet transform the continuous wavelet transform for a discrete time series x n n 1 n is defined by the convolution of x n with a scaled and translated wavelet ψ 0 η 13 w n x s δ t s 1 2 n n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where n indicates the length of the time series and the asterisk is relative to the complex conjugate the wavelet in its width is ordered by the scale parameter whereas wavelet power spectrum wps is a powerful tool univariate analysis that makes clear the evolution of the variance throughout the time dimension at each frequency as previously reported by torrence and compo 1998 mathematically wps can be described by 14 w n x s 2 w n x s w n x s then the wps is normalized by the global wavelet spectrum gws which is more suitable measure to describe the variability of the time series in a non stationary case by targeting the scale parameter hence interpretation of results becomes easy it is expressed as 15 w n 2 s n 1 n w n s 2 while different types of wavelets can be used the most commonly type of wavelet for a given time series x 1 x 2 x 3 x n of size n spaced with regular time interval δ t the morlet wavelet ψ 0 η is a specific wavelet function with ω0 6 having zero mean and localized simultaneously in time and frequency domain modulated by a gaussian envelope its choice is crucial because it is compatible with the criteria required by the cwt based on maintaining a balance between both dimensions of time and frequency torrence and compo 1998 it can be expressed as 16 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e x p i ω 0 η e x p η 2 2 where η and ω 0 are dimensionless time and the wavenumber respectively 2 5 1 cross wavelet transform in order to explore high common power in both time frequency domains between two time series x and y defined by their corresponding cwts w n x s and w n y s w n x y s is obtained by the convolution between cwts written as 17 w n x y s w n x s w n y s however there are certain drawbacks associated with its use because it is not normalized as reported by maraun and kurths 2004 for this reason it was decided that the best method to adopt for the examination of causality is the wavelet transform coherence wtc in so far as two variables can be dependent without there being a strong link 2 5 2 wavelet transform coherence according to torrence and compo 1998 the magnitude of the covariance between two time series is given as follows 18 r n x y 2 s s s 1 w n x y s s s 1 w n x s s s 1 w n y s assuming that the time series has a mean power spectrum torrence and compo 1998 proposed to calculate the statistical significance level sl n s of the wavelet coherence as well as its 95 confidence level cl n x y 95 s is estimated using monte carlo methods 2 5 3 time series similarity based on wavelet coherence the wavelet coherence provided in the previous section is a two dimensional surface with high and low values that is hard to interpret we define the similarity between two time series x and y as si m wavelet xy s 1 n n 1 n r n x y 2 s c l n x y 95 s the above definition is a curve of similarity as function of s and is easier to interpret than a wavelet coherence graph fig 4 it can easily be extended to n time series by taking the minimum similarity between each pair for each frequency s in the case of three time series the formula would be 19 si m wavelet xyz s min 1 n n 1 n r n x y 2 s c l n x y 95 s 1 n n 1 n r n x y 2 s c l n x z 95 s 1 n n 1 n r n x y 2 s c l n y z 95 s 2 6 case study the developed hydrological region delineation method will be applied to the tensift basin unfortunately the network of climatic and hydrologic stations is usually of low density so direct information about hydro climatic conditions at a particular point are usually missing daily rainfall time series spanning between 31 and 48 years from 11 hydro meteorological stations were obtained from the tensift river basin agency fig 1 the majority of stations are concentrated in the south east close to the atlas mountains while vast areas in the north and south west are not gauged the statistical characteristics of rainfall time series used in this paper are summarized in table 1 the highest average total annual rainfall is observed within the available stations in aghbalou in the atlas mountains 534 4 mm while the lowest one is observed in the desert at abadela 172 2 mm in the way to the outlet of the basin 3 results and discussion the methodology was applied to the 11 time series of annual precipitation using m 1000 and a minimum segment length l min 10 given that the length of the time series varies from station to station the data of the common period 1986 2017 the multiple changepoint detection is also applied 3 1 delineated regions a total of 4 regions were detected containing 3 6 1 and 1 stations table 2 the local and regional trends are presented in fig 5 the regional and local probabilities of changes are shown in fig 6 along with the conditional probability of the position of the first changepoint it is interesting to note that no regional changepoint was detected in regions 1 and 2 and that a single regional changepoint is detected in regions 3 and 4 no local changepoint was detected at any station in regions 1 and 2 and only one changepoint was detected at each station in region 3 and 4 the position of the local and regional changepoints are very close in region 3 and 4 as the most probable date of change is 1998 for nkouris and 1996 for taferiat for these particular regions the local and regional trends are the same for all stations suggesting that the regions are homogeneous it is however worth mentioning that the directions of the regional trends are not the same for the two stations in regions 3 and 4 the two segments of the local and regional trend at taferiat are all decreasing while nkouris has a decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend another interesting fact is that two regions were delineated despite both having zero changepoint seidou and ouarda 2007 assume there is a changepoint only when the probability of not having a changepoint is below 0 5 or the probability of having one or more changepoints is above 0 5 regions 1 and 2 have probabilities of having zero changepoint of 0 9145 and 0 8294 however the regional conditional probability of the position of the changepoints varies between the regions fig 6 fig 7 shows the homogenous groups of regions based on the probabilities of changes and on the conditional probability of the locations of the change table 3 presents regions based on the conditional probabilities of the positions of the changepoints as can be seen even though stations belong to the same region there is a conditional probability difference at the date of change between stations it should be noted that only 3 stations in region 1 show a negative difference between the local and regional conditional probability these differences led to the delineation of four different regions fig 7 even though no changepoints are expected it is also worth noticing that while regional and local probabilities of changes and conditional probabilities of changepoint locations are different at each station the difference between the local and regional conditional probability of the positions of the changepoints is very small once again suggesting that the delineated regions are homogeneous as fig 8 depicts a large difference between the local and regional trend at a particular station may be a signal of an inhomogeneity at that station which means that the absence of abrupt changes in local trend does not imply the verification of this conclusion in a regional one consequently the regional trend could possibly present not only jumps in the average but also in the trend orientation 3 2 validation of the delineated regions globally the findings of this study mirror those of ahattab et al 2015 and salama 2010 who detected 4 regions in the tensift watershed by applying pca to monthly precipitation records the regions detected by each study are presented in table 4 all methods place the station of nkouris apart from the others in group 3 66 2 out of 3 of the stations in group 1 are the same in the two papers the merger of groups 2 and 4 contains 7 stations according to each study and 6 out of the 7 are similar the main difference is in this study marrakech was found to be in group 2 and aghbalou in group 1 ahattab et al 2015 classified aghbalou in group 2 and marrakech in group 1 the similarity measure based on wavelet coherence equation 18 is used to show that the inclusion of any station outside a particular region would significantly reduce the similarity within the region the similarity called here intra region coherence of each of the 4 delineated regions is shown in fig 9 we found that the intra region coherence is maximal for the 8 10 periods consistent with the minimum data segment of 10 years used in the bayesian model for each of the region the intra region coherence is recalculated after the addition of an external station for instance the first panel of fig 10 shows how the intra region coherence decreases when marrakech which belongs to region 2 is added to region 1 the second resp third fourth shows the decrease of intra region coherence when chichaoua resp aghbalou abadela are added to region 2 resp region 3 region 4 in all cases it can be seen that the intra region coherence drops when an outside station is added to the region and that the magnitude of the changes varies with the frequency and the region in this particular example the decrease in coherence is the most severe in region 3 and the least severe in region 2 the loss of coherence of all regions due to the inclusion of all possible out of region stations is presented in fig 11 once again the loss of coherence is systematically more severe in region 3 and less severe in region 2 this result suggests that region 3 is very different from the rest of stations in the study area while region 2 has a lot of similarity at least for this particular measure with the rest of the study area the findings from this study make several contributions to the literature 4 conclusions and further research the main goal of the current study was to extend the multiple changepoint detection procedure seidou and ouarda 2007 to delineate homogenous hydrological regions a similarity measure based on the positions of the changepoints and an algorithm for the delineation of homogeneous region were proposed the method was applied to the tensift watershed in morocco and it was shown that the results are like those of previous studies of the same watershed wavelet coherence was used to further confirm the homogeneity of the detected regions the method presented in this paper relaxes the assumption of a stable and linear relationship between time series at stations within a region and therefore is more general than pca these two assumptions are convenient from a mathematical point of view but have no physical basis the climate system is highly complex and non linear and relationships between variables are nonlinear and nonstationary by default the application of the new method should lead to larger homogeneous regions and uncover hidden relationships between stations while the method application is limited to one watershed in a semiarid context there is no limitation to its application to other hydroclimatic regions the only requirement is the existence of annual time series of the variables of interest despite the fact that the method presented in this paper does not provide estimates of hydrological variables it can improve water management by improving homogeneous regions delineation a better delineation of homogeneous regions is likely to improve estimation results as the quality of the regional estimation of hydrological variables e g flood quantiles is directly linked to the homogeneity of the regions in this paper the similarity measure only considers the positions of changepoints and acknowledges the similarity only when the changepoints at the two stations occur at the same date possible improvements include a consider the direction of the trend between changepoints in the similarity measure b find a way to account for changepoints which are close but on different dates and c combine this similarity measure with a number of other physiographic and climatic similarity measures that are for the instance based on river network configuration for further research it is recommended to apply these approaches to watersheds elsewhere in morocco and in the world to assess their effectiveness for ensuring sustainable territorial management future research can also focus on the use of the identified regions to transfer information within regions and to build a full regional frequency analysis procedure that can be used for quantile estimation at ungauged locations this can be achieved by combining the regional delineation procedure proposed in the present work with a regional estimation approach future research can also look into the potential advantages of using time series of variable lengths in the similarity measure the extension of the approach to the multivariate case can also be considered declaration of competing interest the

3810,hydrologic regionalization consists of regrouping stations and catchments in pools based on a similarity measure regionalization is commonly used to extract a robust signal that can be used to describe the hydrology of the region or extrapolated to a location without measured information obviously the similarity measure used affects the type of hydrological behavior one would expect from stations within a region most regionalization methods assume a stable and or linear relationship between parameters of interests while it is well known that the physical processes driving the behavior of hydrometeorological variables are inherently non linear and non stationary in this paper we propose a similarity measure that is based on the location of changepoints in hydrological time series the proposed method has the unique advantage over other hydrological region delineation methods to detect regions where hydrological member stations are non linearly correlated and where the strength of the relation varies with time it therefore has the potential to uncover similarities that would not have been detected by existing regionalization techniques the proposed method is applied to the tensift watershed located in morocco north africa the coherence of the detected regions is checked using wavelet coherence keywords hydrologic regionalization similarity hydrological time series changepoints wavelet coherence 1 introduction the tensift basin fig 1 an arid to semi arid 20381 km2 watershed located in west central morocco it is limited by the jbilets desert in the north the high atlas mountains in the south the tassaout watershed in the east and the atlantic ocean in the west the climate of the region is classified as arid to semi arid saidi et al 2010 mahé et al 2012 precipitation in the watershed is highly variable in space and time annual rainfall varies from 650 mm in mountain areas to 100 mm in desert plains saidi et al 2003 saidi et al 2010 saidi et al 2012 agriculture is the main socio economic activity in the watershed its expansion has created a pressure on existing water resources and a depletion of the water table has been observed the increasing water scarcity is generating fears of recurrent droughts the study area is located in a transition zone between mediterranean and semi arid climates a region known to be affected by global changes such as the expansion of the hadley cell peleg et al 2015 evidence of the poleward expansion of the hadley zone has been documented by several authors in past observations as well as cmip5 and cmip6 simulations hu and fu 2007 peleg et al 2015 xia et al 2020 grise and davis 2020 the hadley cell extension will affect the regional climate in the subtropics through the displacement of warm climate coupled with the disruption of deep water upwelling feng and fu 2013 schmidt and grise 2017 the poleward extension of the hadley cell will make its intensity weaker and ultimately lead to the extension of the subtropical dry zone lu et al 2007 according to the draft ipcc ar6 technical report masson delmote et al 2021 there is a high confidence that the total land area subject to increasing drought frequency and severity will expand and that future aridification will far exceed the magnitude of change seen in the last millennium in several regions of the mediterranean basin there is hence a growing interest in understanding regional precipitation variability as it is of major importance for the management of water resources decision makers in morocco are very much interested in understanding whether there is a single or multiple regional climates over the study area in order to implement the appropriate policies one way of gaining that understanding is through hydrologic regionalization hydrologic regionalization consists of regrouping stations and catchments in pools which are expected to have the same hydrological behaviors regionalization has been intensively used for flood frequency analysis farquharson et al 1992 rosbjerg and madsen 1995 durrans and tomic 1996 pandey and nguyen 1999 alila 1999 2000 ouarda et al 2000 chokmani and ouarda 2004 and hydrological models parameters estimation sefton and howarth 1998 mwakalila 2003 heuvelmans et al 2006 seidou et al 2006 hundecha et al 2008 the delineation of regions is typically based on a similarity measure between watershed physiographic parameters or time series statistics at the sites of interests the similarity measure can be geographical distance grehys 1996 or the proximity of catchment attributes in projected specific spaces e g ouarda et al 1999 2001 han et al 2020 principal components analysis pca is one of the most popular regionalization methods pca regionalization approach is defined as a multivariate statistical method that aims to analyze and simplify a data table with m observations and n variables basilevsky 1994 it consists in transforming correlated variables into orthogonal principal components the variables are projected in a new space where along each axis the variance is maximized el alaoui el fels et al 2020 applied pca to monthly precipitation in the tensift region to delineate three homogenous regions ahattab et al 2015 applied pca to monthly precipitation from 23 stations in the tensift region and found four homogenous regions one of the limitations of pca is the assumption that the relationships between time series in a region are linear and constant trough time at the same time natural relations tend to be non linear and non stationary transformations of input time series such as log transformations allow accounting for a limited amount of nonlinearity agarwal et al 2016 used multiscale wavelet entropy to define the similarity measure between catchments they studied the monthly streamflow temporal variability of 530 stations during 52 years over the united states and determined homogenous groups where each one has a signature by defining clusters the idea of using wavelets for regions delineation is interesting as it accounts for relations that are non stationary and non linear one way to account for nonlinearity and non stationarity in the relations between two time series is to examine the similarities between the dates of changes in trends in the two time series time series in the same hydrologic region may not be linearly correlated but will have similar locations for the changepoints while any multiple changepoint approaches can be used to detect the positions of the changepoints we will be using the multiple changepoint detection procedure developed by seidou and ouarda 2007 because of its flexibility the method is designed to detect multiple changepoints in a multiple linear relation between one or many predictors and a predictand by changing the predictors one can detect abrupt shifts continuous or non continuous linear segments in analyzed time series the method also has the advantage of providing a probabilistic description of the changepoint locations another alternative for hydrologic region delineation using non stationary and non linear relations similar to agarwal et al 2016 is to define the similarity between two time series using wavelet cross coherence as defined by torrence and compo 1998 cross wavelet transform xwt aims to evaluate the covariance and causality between x and y however there are certain drawbacks associated with its use because it is not normalized as reported by maraun and kurths 2004 for this reason the authors believe that the best method to adopt for the examination of causality is the wavelet transform coherence wtc in so far as two variables can be dependent without there being a strong link xwt finds regions in the time frequency space where the time series show high common energy wavelet coherence is calculated using the continuous wavelet transform cwt of two time series cwt is an alternative approach to the fourier transform applied in the signal processing cwt and xwt has been widely used in many investigational studies grinsted et al 2004 özger et al 2009 keener et al 2010 ouachani et al 2011 sang 2013 naizghi and ouarda 2017 thiombiano et al 2016 chang et al 2017 santos et al 2018 the objectives of this paper are to extend the multiple changepoint detection method of seidou and ouarda 2007 to hydrological region delineation apply the methodology to the tensift watershed and verify the delineated regions using wavelet coherence 2 material and methods 2 1 bayesian multiple changepoint detection approach the original multiple changepoint detection method proposed by seidou and ouarda 2007 is a generalization of the changepoint procedure of seidou et al 2007 it is commonly used in the field of water resources see for instance ehsanzadeh et al 2011 the procedure is briefly presented below let y y 1 y 2 y n a time series of observation of length n m the number of changepoints τ 0 0 τ 1 τ n m the changepoints and y i j the observations from time i to time j let g be probability distribution of the time between changepoints and g 0 is the probability distribution of the first changepoint assuming the observations are independent conditional on the changepoints and parameters values fearnhead 2006 demonstrated that if 1 pr τ 1 y 1 n p 1 τ 1 q τ 1 1 g 0 τ 1 q 1 pr τ j τ j 1 y 1 n p τ j

and ouarda 2007 derived an analytical expression for p t s when y is linked to a predictor x by a multiple linear regression equation 4 y j k 1 d θ k x ij ε i i 1 n or 5 y x θ ε y j k 1 d θ k x kj ε i

i 1 i 2 i n 1 and y t s y i 1 i 2 i n 1 the inference on the position of the changepoints is made by generating a set e s k k 1 m of m possible scatter schemes of the changepoints on the segment using the posterior probability mass of the first changepoint and the conditional probability mass of subsequent changepoints e s k k 1 m the k th element of e caller herein changepoint scatter scheme is a set of m k changepoints s k t 1 k t 2 k t m k k an efficient simulation algorithm for e is given by fearnhead 2006 1 for a sample of size m initiate m samples with a changepoint at t 0 2 for t 0 n 2 repeat the following steps a compute the number n t of samples for which the last changepoint was at time t b if n t 0 compute pr τ τ j 1 t y 1 n c sample n t times from pr τ τ j 1 t y 1 n and use the values to update the n t samples of changepoints which have a changepoint at time t in a practical problem it is unlikely to have two changepoints that are very close hence when sampling from pr τ τ j 1 t y 1 n if the next position is within the length of the time series but is less than a user defined l min from the previous changepoint it is discarded and another value is sampled inference on the number and positions of the changepoints is readily carried out using the m samples for instance the probability of having i changepoints is approximated by 9 pr m i c a r d k c a r d s k i m the posterior probability of having the kth changepoint at position t given m changepoints can be approximated by 10 pr τ i t m c a r d k card s k m t i k t card k c a r d s m where c a r d s stands for the number of elements of the set s the estimators of the number and positions of changepoints are the modes of their posterior distributions i e 11 m max t c a r d k c a r d k s t m 12 τ i max t c a r d k card s k m t i k t c a r d k c a r d s m 2 2 use of changepoints positions as a measure of similarity we propose to use the positions of the changepoints as a measure of similarity between two time series this is a fairly original use of the changepoint procedure ouarda et al 2014 used the same changepoint procedure to identify common dates of change in precipitation series in a number of meteorological stations in the united arab emirates with the objective of identifying low frequency climate oscillation indices that influence precipitation in various regions the procedure is presented below assume an ensemble of n climatic stations where a time series of a particular parameter e g annual precipitation is available for the sake of simplicity let s assume that the time series are available in the same period from y start to y end let y i the time series at the ith station y i pc p ystart i pc p ystart 1 i pc p yend i assume that the changepoint method of seidou and ouarda 2007 is applied to each station using the following predictand x 1 y start 1 y start 1 1 y end the application of the method to station i will result in a set e i s k i k 1 m of m possible scatter schemes of the changepoints positions as illustrated in fig 2 we define the similarity between n stations as the number changepoints scatter schemes with at least one changepoint that are common to e 1 e 2 e n divided by the maximum number of scatter schemes with at least one changepoint in any of e 1 e 2 e n the concept of similarity is illustrated in fig 3 using m 20 for a set of two and three stations for the sake of illustration the changepoints positions scatter schemes e i s k i k 1 m are represented as an array where the columns correspond to the position in the time series and the rows represent k black cells represent the changepoints lines that are common to all stations are coloured for illustration purposes in the two station example panel a the first station 19 rows with at least one changepoint and the second one has 20 the two stations have four similar rows hence their similarity is si m changepo int s s 1 s 2 4 min 19 20 4 19 0 2105 in the second example panel b the number of lines with at least one changepoint is 19 17 and 18 for the first second and third stations respectively given that they have three lines in common si m changepo int s s 1 s 2 s 3 3 min 19 17 18 3 17 0 1765 2 3 regions delimitation using changepoint based similarity the following algorithm is used to delineate regions in a set of n stations using the similarity measure defined in section 3 1 1 an initial set of n regions containing each one element is created 2 repeat until each region contains each station a for each station s i for each region r that does not contain s calculate the similarity sr of region r station s ii assign station s to the region with the highest sr and record sr as the entrance score of station s in region r b remove duplicates in regions 3 at the end of the process we have m revealed regions k n containing each of them includes the n stations in a specific order 4 iteratively search for the highest threshold t such as if stations with scores higher than t are removed from each region the union of the remaining elements in the regions contains all n stations 5 eliminate all stations with scores above t and obtain m regions that cover the n stations 2 4 local and regional trend for each station in the study region the probability of having one or several changepoints as well as the most likely position of these changes can be obtained using equations 9 11 once the number and positions of the changepoints are determined a local linear trend can be estimated between the detected changepoints the modeler can decide whether the trend is continuous or discontinuous at the changepoints the decision must be guided by the understanding of the physical process under consideration for instance hydroclimatic time series tend to vary smoothly because of climate change or climatic oscillations discontinuities generally occur only when there is a brutal change in the watershed such as a forest fire or the construction of a hydraulic infrastructure unless the modeler has knowledge of such of a sudden change on the watershed it is safer to assume continuity at the changepoints in this paper the trend is assumed to be continuous as we are dealing with precipitation time series and see no reason for an abrupt change once a region is delineated the same method can be used to have a regional probability of having a changepoint the position of the changepoints and a regional trend the only difference is that the union of the changepoints scatter schemes of all stations in the region is used in equations 9 11 the difference between the regional and local changepoints and trends can be a hint that a local perturbation has occurred and can be used for hydrologic data homogenization a number of other elements need to be integrated in the analysis future efforts will attempt to add more covariates physiographic climatic land cover etc in the model this will also explaining a larger portion of the variance and developing a more detailed and complete model which should translate into improved estimation results in addition the spatial and temporal variability including potential change points have to be combined and work in parallel in the same modeling logic to cover all aspects the geomorphological aspect and the study of the prevailing climate remain insufficient in regards to the definition of the homogeneous regions 2 5 continuous wavelet transform and wavelet coherence wavelet coherence is a mean of evaluating the covariance and causality between x and y first the continuous wavelet transform of x and y w n x and w n y are calculated the cross wavelet transform of x and y w n x y s is then calculated to explore high common power in both time frequency domains between the two time series finally their wavelet coherence r n 2 is calculated using their wavelet and cross wavelet transforms the mathematical expressions of w n x w n y and r n 2 are presented in the next sections w n x y s 2 5 1 continuous wavelet transform the continuous wavelet transform for a discrete time series x n n 1 n is defined by the convolution of x n with a scaled and translated wavelet ψ 0 η 13 w n x s δ t s 1 2 n n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where n indicates the length of the time series and the asterisk is relative to the complex conjugate the wavelet in its width is ordered by the scale parameter whereas wavelet power spectrum wps is a powerful tool univariate analysis that makes clear the evolution of the variance throughout the time dimension at each frequency as previously reported by torrence and compo 1998 mathematically wps can be described by 14 w n x s 2 w n x s w n x s then the wps is normalized by the global wavelet spectrum gws which is more suitable measure to describe the variability of the time series in a non stationary case by targeting the scale parameter hence interpretation of results becomes easy it is expressed as 15 w n 2 s n 1 n w n s 2 while different types of wavelets can be used the most commonly type of wavelet for a given time series x 1 x 2 x 3 x n of size n spaced with regular time interval δ t the morlet wavelet ψ 0 η is a specific wavelet function with ω0 6 having zero mean and localized simultaneously in time and frequency domain modulated by a gaussian envelope its choice is crucial because it is compatible with the criteria required by the cwt based on maintaining a balance between both dimensions of time and frequency torrence and compo 1998 it can be expressed as 16 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e x p i ω 0 η e x p η 2 2 where η and ω 0 are dimensionless time and the wavenumber respectively 2 5 1 cross wavelet transform in order to explore high common power in both time frequency domains between two time series x and y defined by their corresponding cwts w n x s and w n y s w n x y s is obtained by the convolution between cwts written as 17 w n x y s w n x s w n y s however there are certain drawbacks associated with its use because it is not normalized as reported by maraun and kurths 2004 for this reason it was decided that the best method to adopt for the examination of causality is the wavelet transform coherence wtc in so far as two variables can be dependent without there being a strong link 2 5 2 wavelet transform coherence according to torrence and compo 1998 the magnitude of the covariance between two time series is given as follows 18 r n x y 2 s s s 1 w n x y s s s 1 w n x s s s 1 w n y s assuming that the time series has a mean power spectrum torrence and compo 1998 proposed to calculate the statistical significance level sl n s of the wavelet coherence as well as its 95 confidence level cl n x y 95 s is estimated using monte carlo methods 2 5 3 time series similarity based on wavelet coherence the wavelet coherence provided in the previous section is a two dimensional surface with high and low values that is hard to interpret we define the similarity between two time series x and y as si m wavelet xy s 1 n n 1 n r n x y 2 s c l n x y 95 s the above definition is a curve of similarity as function of s and is easier to interpret than a wavelet coherence graph fig 4 it can easily be extended to n time series by taking the minimum similarity between each pair for each frequency s in the case of three time series the formula would be 19 si m wavelet xyz s min 1 n n 1 n r n x y 2 s c l n x y 95 s 1 n n 1 n r n x y 2 s c l n x z 95 s 1 n n 1 n r n x y 2 s c l n y z 95 s 2 6 case study the developed hydrological region delineation method will be applied to the tensift basin unfortunately the network of climatic and hydrologic stations is usually of low density so direct information about hydro climatic conditions at a particular point are usually missing daily rainfall time series spanning between 31 and 48 years from 11 hydro meteorological stations were obtained from the tensift river basin agency fig 1 the majority of stations are concentrated in the south east close to the atlas mountains while vast areas in the north and south west are not gauged the statistical characteristics of rainfall time series used in this paper are summarized in table 1 the highest average total annual rainfall is observed within the available stations in aghbalou in the atlas mountains 534 4 mm while the lowest one is observed in the desert at abadela 172 2 mm in the way to the outlet of the basin 3 results and discussion the methodology was applied to the 11 time series of annual precipitation using m 1000 and a minimum segment length l min 10 given that the length of the time series varies from station to station the data of the common period 1986 2017 the multiple changepoint detection is also applied 3 1 delineated regions a total of 4 regions were detected containing 3 6 1 and 1 stations table 2 the local and regional trends are presented in fig 5 the regional and local probabilities of changes are shown in fig 6 along with the conditional probability of the position of the first changepoint it is interesting to note that no regional changepoint was detected in regions 1 and 2 and that a single regional changepoint is detected in regions 3 and 4 no local changepoint was detected at any station in regions 1 and 2 and only one changepoint was detected at each station in region 3 and 4 the position of the local and regional changepoints are very close in region 3 and 4 as the most probable date of change is 1998 for nkouris and 1996 for taferiat for these particular regions the local and regional trends are the same for all stations suggesting that the regions are homogeneous it is however worth mentioning that the directions of the regional trends are not the same for the two stations in regions 3 and 4 the two segments of the local and regional trend at taferiat are all decreasing while nkouris has a decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend another interesting fact is that two regions were delineated despite both having zero changepoint seidou and ouarda 2007 assume there is a changepoint only when the probability of not having a changepoint is below 0 5 or the probability of having one or more changepoints is above 0 5 regions 1 and 2 have probabilities of having zero changepoint of 0 9145 and 0 8294 however the regional conditional probability of the position of the changepoints varies between the regions fig 6 fig 7 shows the homogenous groups of regions based on the probabilities of changes and on the conditional probability of the locations of the change table 3 presents regions based on the conditional probabilities of the positions of the changepoints as can be seen even though stations belong to the same region there is a conditional probability difference at the date of change between stations it should be noted that only 3 stations in region 1 show a negative difference between the local and regional conditional probability these differences led to the delineation of four different regions fig 7 even though no changepoints are expected it is also worth noticing that while regional and local probabilities of changes and conditional probabilities of changepoint locations are different at each station the difference between the local and regional conditional probability of the positions of the changepoints is very small once again suggesting that the delineated regions are homogeneous as fig 8 depicts a large difference between the local and regional trend at a particular station may be a signal of an inhomogeneity at that station which means that the absence of abrupt changes in local trend does not imply the verification of this conclusion in a regional one consequently the regional trend could possibly present not only jumps in the average but also in the trend orientation 3 2 validation of the delineated regions globally the findings of this study mirror those of ahattab et al 2015 and salama 2010 who detected 4 regions in the tensift watershed by applying pca to monthly precipitation records the regions detected by each study are presented in table 4 all methods place the station of nkouris apart from the others in group 3 66 2 out of 3 of the stations in group 1 are the same in the two papers the merger of groups 2 and 4 contains 7 stations according to each study and 6 out of the 7 are similar the main difference is in this study marrakech was found to be in group 2 and aghbalou in group 1 ahattab et al 2015 classified aghbalou in group 2 and marrakech in group 1 the similarity measure based on wavelet coherence equation 18 is used to show that the inclusion of any station outside a particular region would significantly reduce the similarity within the region the similarity called here intra region coherence of each of the 4 delineated regions is shown in fig 9 we found that the intra region coherence is maximal for the 8 10 periods consistent with the minimum data segment of 10 years used in the bayesian model for each of the region the intra region coherence is recalculated after the addition of an external station for instance the first panel of fig 10 shows how the intra region coherence decreases when marrakech which belongs to region 2 is added to region 1 the second resp third fourth shows the decrease of intra region coherence when chichaoua resp aghbalou abadela are added to region 2 resp region 3 region 4 in all cases it can be seen that the intra region coherence drops when an outside station is added to the region and that the magnitude of the changes varies with the frequency and the region in this particular example the decrease in coherence is the most severe in region 3 and the least severe in region 2 the loss of coherence of all regions due to the inclusion of all possible out of region stations is presented in fig 11 once again the loss of coherence is systematically more severe in region 3 and less severe in region 2 this result suggests that region 3 is very different from the rest of stations in the study area while region 2 has a lot of similarity at least for this particular measure with the rest of the study area the findings from this study make several contributions to the literature 4 conclusions and further research the main goal of the current study was to extend the multiple changepoint detection procedure seidou and ouarda 2007 to delineate homogenous hydrological regions a similarity measure based on the positions of the changepoints and an algorithm for the delineation of homogeneous region were proposed the method was applied to the tensift watershed in morocco and it was shown that the results are like those of previous studies of the same watershed wavelet coherence was used to further confirm the homogeneity of the detected regions the method presented in this paper relaxes the assumption of a stable and linear relationship between time series at stations within a region and therefore is more general than pca these two assumptions are convenient from a mathematical point of view but have no physical basis the climate system is highly complex and non linear and relationships between variables are nonlinear and nonstationary by default the application of the new method should lead to larger homogeneous regions and uncover hidden relationships between stations while the method application is limited to one watershed in a semiarid context there is no limitation to its application to other hydroclimatic regions the only requirement is the existence of annual time series of the variables of interest despite the fact that the method presented in this paper does not provide estimates of hydrological variables it can improve water management by improving homogeneous regions delineation a better delineation of homogeneous regions is likely to improve estimation results as the quality of the regional estimation of hydrological variables e g flood quantiles is directly linked to the homogeneity of the regions in this paper the similarity measure only considers the positions of changepoints and acknowledges the similarity only when the changepoints at the two stations occur at the same date possible improvements include a consider the direction of the trend between changepoints in the similarity measure b find a way to account for changepoints which are close but on different dates and c combine this similarity measure with a number of other physiographic and climatic similarity measures that are for the instance based on river network configuration for further research it is recommended to apply these approaches to watersheds elsewhere in morocco and in the world to assess their effectiveness for ensuring sustainable territorial management future research can also focus on the use of the identified regions to transfer information within regions and to build a full regional frequency analysis procedure that can be used for quantile estimation at ungauged locations this can be achieved by combining the regional delineation procedure proposed in the present work with a regional estimation approach future research can also look into the potential advantages of using time series of variable lengths in the similarity measure the extension of the approach to the multivariate case can also be considered declaration of competing interest the

3811,the equilibrium of natural groundwater systems can be disrupted by excessive withdrawal accurate estimation of groundwater levels is needed to assess water level fluctuations caused by groundwater withdrawal and seasonal distributions of precipitation this study aims to estimate the next month s groundwater levels using monthly real world data that includes rainfall electricity estimated pumping volumes and current groundwater levels invoking time dependent spatial regression the new approach involves state estimation and change estimation methods which will be evaluated to determine the optimal model based on its root mean square error values the response of estimated future next month s groundwater levels within the alluvial fan in changhua and yunlin taiwan is based on monthly precipitation and pumping this study yields a data driven explanation of how water levels temporally and spatially respond to groundwater pumping and rainfall infiltration in different regions within the alluvial fan results indicate that the proximal fan yields the smallest response to decreased groundwater levels and subsequent increases in pumping the effect of reducing groundwater levels is greater in the southern areas of the study site than in the northern areas water levels in the mid fan and distal fan in the southern area show a greater drawdown due to larger pumping volumes compared to the northern area keywords rainfall pumping groundwater level estimation time dependent spatial regression 1 introduction groundwater is an invaluable and necessary natural resource for many countries for meeting primary human needs because of its quality quantity and accessibility the natural equilibrium balance of groundwater between natural recharge and discharge can be disrupted by excessive withdrawal as the exploitation of groundwater triggers a decrease in the water level and reduction in available storage liu et al 2004 on the other hand recharge from precipitation can counterbalance groundwater withdrawals in hydrological systems and therefore is an important parameter in aquifer system analysis yeh et al 2007 however the volume of naturally replenished water is also typically not proportional to the rate and quantity of groundwater use resulting in aquifer depletion chang et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 in recent decades overexploitation of groundwater for agriculture industry and urbanization has become a worldwide common occurrence qi et al 2018 a significant depletion of groundwater storage has occurred in several regions of the world e g india china usa as a result of groundwater pumping abstraction for irrigation asoka et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 in addition the overexploitation of groundwater in chunghua and yunlin counties in west central taiwan casues regional land subsidence chu et al 2020 agriculture and aquaculture in this area have increased dramatically since the 1970s with massive quantities of groundwater being withdrawn due to a lack of sufficient surface water hung et al 2012 to try to quantify unregulated pumping electrical power usage of pumping wells has been used to estimate pumping volume yet such estimates are frequently applied over whole municipalities therefore lacking sufficient resolution for planning or quantifying local usage vasco et al 2019 a detailed electrical usage study applied to water well pumps was conducted by chu et al 2020 to determine the monthly volume of groundwater extracted from individual wells over an area of 1 km2 and covering a 10 year period for changhua and yunlin counties taiwan in this investigation we correlate these estimations of pumping volume from electricity usage to water level changes detailed time dependent water level data are needed to analyze aquifer system response to natural and anthropogenic stresses chang et al 2016 machine learning and ai approaches have been successfully applied and developed for data models of groundwater prediction chu and chang 2009 chang et al 2016 sahoo et al 2017 smith and majumdar 2020 including groundwater quantity choubin and malekian 2017 mosavi et al 2020 and groundwater quality rahmati et al 2019 mosavi et al 2021 chu and chang 2009 used neural networks to predict next months forward prediction groundwater levels based on the current groundwater levels and pumping volumes however these data are based on numerical simulations and are not real world observations chang et al 2016 considered ai to predict monthly regional groundwater levels based on rainfall and river flow data sahoo et al 2017 predicted groundwater level change based on irrigation demand precipitation temperature and stream discharge using a hybrid artificial neural network these results showed that irrigation demand has the highest influence on groundwater level changes this data driven model approach represents an effective way to create a connection between groundwater recharge extraction and subsequent changes in groundwater levels in addition the data driven models also quantify the relation between the various widely available input data sets including evapotranspiration land use sediment thickness and land subsidence smith majumdar 2020 moreover the time dependent spatial regression based data model method will be used in this investigation because it effectively extends the standard linear regression process to a spatially weighted data modeling approach brunsdon et al 1996 ali et al 2020 chu et al 2021 time dependent spatial regression can be used to model the spatially varying and non stationary relation amongst precipitation pumping volume and groundwater level changes groundwater recharge and discharge are highly correlated to precipitation and pumping therefore only precipitation and pumping are considered important for mass balance purposes at the study site in this paper we aim to provide estimated future next month s groundwater levels using time dependent spatial regression approaches involving variations in monthly precipitation data monthly pumping volumes and monthly groundwater levels for improved groundwater management in addition we will investigate the efficiency of the regression method for forecasting next month s groundwater levels here we consider state estimation and change estimation approaches to compare the model

their implementation in the overall formulation for the estimation of pumping volume in this study the monthly pumping volumes are represented as the sum of the total monthly pumping volume within each 1 0 km2 grid over the entire study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimated groundwater extraction fig 2 shows the estimated spatial distribution of groundwater pumping volumes the monthly maximum groundwater extraction ranges from 253 097 m3 km2 to 363 592 m3 km2 during this study period the average pumping volume is approximately 65 156 74 m3 km2 the lowest estimated rate is 42 392 02 m3 km2 in november 2014 and the highest estimated rate is 86 681 29 m3 km2 in february 2015 fig 3 shows the range of total groundwater withdrawals the minimum 87 million m3 and maximum 178 million m3 amounts of groundwater production occurs in november 2014 and february 2015 respectively fig 3 4 2 model performance of groundwater level estimation the model performance for the estimation of next month s groundwater levels is analyzed using rmses to compare observation versus simulated groundwater levels at ht 1 table 3 shows that the rmses for the change estimation approach are better than that of state estimation approach average rmse for the state estimation approach is 1 05 times higher than that of the change estimation approach overall the maximum difference of the rmses is 29 cm in july when comparing a state estimation approach and a change estimation approach in april and june the lowest rmse for the time dependent spatial regression model is 1 61 m the highest rmses occurrs in november which is 2 20 and 2 24 m respectively for the change estimation and state estimation approaches fig 4 shows that the extreme residuals deep blue and red colors rarely occur in the change estimation approach light blue points are fig 4b when compared to the state estimation approach some deep blue and red colors in fig 4a hence the change estimation approach is the preferred model for the simulations presented in this study the change estimation is found to be superior due to the numerical calculation scheme e g change in the water level is usually smaller in addition the current groundwater level is known in the change estimation but represents the input for the estimation function in the state estimation approach 4 3 validation of the model the model validation process involves checking the estimated and observed groundwater levels from the representative locations from each of the proximal fan mid fan and distal fan regions see fig 5 the proximal fan fitting lines between the observed and model estimated groundwater levels are shown in fig 5a a high correlation of 0 97 and 0 99 exists between the observed and model estimated ht 1 for the ershui and gukeng sites respectively see table 4 ershui is an area north of the choushui river while gukeng is located south of the river tuku and dapi are mid fan locations in the southern part of the study area while erlun is located in the northern mid fan region the correlation values between observed and model estimated ht 1 values at these mid fan sites are 0 99 in tuku 0 96 in dapi and 0 95 in erlun fig 5b in tuku and dapi the increasing and lowering trends for both the observed and model estimated values are similar except for erlun and especially in december 2014 where the model estimated groundwater levels are higher than in other months groundwater level fluctuations at taixi fangyuan and fuxing within the distal fan region have correlation coefficients between observed and model estimated values of 0 92 0 97 and 0 94 respectively fig 5c in the southern distal fan taixi is located in the southern distal fan region while fangyuan and fuxing are located in the northern distal fan region all three of these dista fan sites have similar observed and model estimated groundwater levels 4 4 spatial mapping of groundwater levels fig 6 shows the spatial monthly groundwater level observations and estimated groundwater level maps from the state estimation and change estimation modeling approaches fig 6a shows the groundwater observation levels for the period from june 2014 to may 2105 the state estimation and change estimation groundwater levels for the forthcoming month ht 1 over the time period of july 2014 to june 2015 are shown in fig 6b and 6c respectively the simulation results for the ht 1 estimates using the two approaches are visually similar across the region when compared to the spatial observational data map the two methods are mostly similar and not visually distinct based on the contour patterns shown the spatial maps indicate that a decrease in groundwater level is more prevalent in the southern distal fan from july to february fig 6c meanwhile from august to november as well as from january to may the area on the north side of the choushui river exhibits a decrease in ht 1 increased water levels are shown to occur in december 2014 and june 2015 4 5 maps of groundwater level changes the spatial maps of groundwater level change estimates using the change estimation approach are shown in fig 7 in june august and september δh appears to have an approximate range from 2 5 to 2 5 m in july november and may δh varies from 0 to 2 5 m results imply that groundwater notably increases during these months conversely the estimated range is lower 0 5 m to 1 2 m for october and april meanwhile a groundwater level change reduction from 0 m to 2 5 m occurs in january february and march furthermore the southern part of the study area shows a high sensitivity to groundwater change for the months of november 2014 january february and may 2015 fig 8 shows the average δh based on the statistical analysis from spatial maps fig 7 with a connection between precipitation pumping volume fig 2 and monthly fluctuations in groundwater levels i e δh in june 2014 the groundwater level dropped to 0 853 m because of more than 120 million m3 of withdrawals that occurred and the region experienced a lower than average monthly precipitation of 213 86 mm in the following month while there was an insignificant increase in pumping and a reduction in the amount of precipitation δh nonetheless increased to 0 749 m moreover a subsequent decrease in precipitation occurred from august to october 2014 a reduction in the groundwater withdrawals over this three month period was also accompanied by a reduction in precipitation as a result a decrease in δh of 0 657 0 932 and 0 141 m respectively occurred for three consecutive months the cumulative reduction in groundwater levels was simulated to be 1 730 m in these three months however a net rise in water level of 1 037 m occurred in november 2014 the explanation for this rise is because the lowest pumping volumes over the simulation period occurred in november 2014 while precipitation was basically unchanged from the previous month meanwhile groundwater extraction steadily increased from december 2014 to february 2015 the greatest quantity of groundwater extraction occurred in february with a rate reaching nearly 180 million cubic meters throughout the study region moreover the volume pumped decreased marginally in june 2015 to a value of about 140 million meters in summary pumping volume appears to be the most important factor influencing groundwater levels in the study area the average groundwater level from june 2014 to may 2015 rose 3 005 m over the study period the change in groundwater level represents the respone of precipitation and groundwater pumping the wet season is usually from may to auguest by contrast the serious groundwater drawdown occurs during the agricultural season which coincides with the dry season from january to april the average groundwater level decline during this dry period is 3 5 m a groundwater management plan is needed during this period to help mitigate the ongoing land subsidence problem 4 6 relation between groundwater level change and local precipitation and pumping volumes fig 9 shows the time series plots of groundwater level local precipitation and pumping volumes from site observations in the proximal mid and distal regions of the alluvial fan groundwater levels dynamically vary with changes in precipitation and pumping volumes groundwater levels generally are lowest during the period from february to april and are also low in september and october in the mid and distal fan regions which is related to low precipitation rates and high pumping volumes fig 10 shows the effect of precipitation on groundwater level fluctuations in the proximal mid and distal regions of the alluvial fan a typical wet season can generally accommodate normal annual groundwater withdrawals without an annual decline in water level abdullahi garba 2016 recharge from precipitation occurs far more readily in the proximal fan region than in the mid and distal fan regions the relation between groundwater change and precipitation is most positively correlated in the proximal fan region but only mildly correlated in the mid fan region unlike the other two regions of the fan the effect of precipitation on the distal fan is not positively correlated the slope of the fitting line indicates that a 10 cm rise in groundwater level in the mid fan region must be accommodated by an annual precipitation amount of 1300 mm on the other hand a 10 cm rise in groundwater level in the proximal fan region only requires 187 mm of annual precipitation this result shows that the proximal fan region represents a strong recharge zone for groundwater replenishment and should be protected as an important recharge area fig 11 represents a plot comparing the local effect of pumping volumes on groundwater level fluctuations in the northern and southern regions of the fan the six samples indicate that pumping causes an overall decline in groundwater levels the slope of each fitting line implies the level of impact that pumping has on groundwater levels a larger slope indicates that pumping has a greater impact more drawdown on water levels all lines in areas north of the choushui river fig 11a tend to have a lower slope than in the southern region fig 11b this suggests that the northern half of the study area experiences less pumping induced impacts on water levels than areas south of the choushui river the overall sensitivity between pumping and water level change can be determined using the regression equation generated from the fitting line in the northern study area a one meter decline in groundwater level occurs for every 318 8 million m3 of groundwater withdrawan from the proximal fan whereas a one meter decline in water level occurs for every 204 6 million m3 of withdrawan from the mid fan and 192 7 million m3 withdrawan from the distal fan in the southern region a one meter decline in water level occurs for every 205 8 million m3 withdrawan from the proximal fan 145 0 million m3 of withdrawan from the mid fan and 148 7 million m3 of withdrawn from the distal fan respectively this study shows that water levels are influenced differently by pumping based on north south position within the fan as well as on the east west postion within the fan proximal mid distal the southern region experiences greater drawdown for a similar volume of water pumped compared to the northern region moreover the mid fan is more susceptible to groundwater extraction than the other two fan regions the least sensitive region for pumping is the proximal fan 5 conclusions this study uses time dependent spatial regression models to estimate forthcoming the next month s regional groundwater levels two data driven modeling approaches are used in this investigation the state estimation approach is used to estimate the next months groundwater levels based on the values of current pumping volume precipitation and current this month s water levels the change estimation approach estimates the groundwater level change δht firstly based on precipitation and groundwater extraction and then calculates the next months groundwater level by adding the δht to the current groundwater level based on the rmse values as model performance the change estimation approach is moderately better than the state estimation approach the change estimation approach is appropriately applied to the choushui river alluvial fan region of west cental taiwan the results yield a good understanding of how groundwater levels react to groundwater pumping and monthly precipitation rates within the proximal mid and distal fan regions of changhua north of the choushui river and yunlin south of the choushui river counties model results suggest that based on the local pumping effects groundwater levels are more highly impacted by pumping in the southern area yunlin than in northern area chunghua meanwhile the proximal fan is found to be the region with the smallest response to decreases groundwater level due to increased pumping the mid fan and distal fan regions of the southern area experience a greater decline in water level from pumping than the northern area specifically it takes 318 8 million m3 of withdrawal to cause 1 meter decline in water level in the proximal fan s northern area 204 6 million m3 of withdrawal for a one meter decline in water level in the mid fan and 192 7 million m3 of withdrawal for a one meter decline in water level in the distal fan similarly for the southern area it requires 205 8 million m3 of withdrawal to cause a one meter decline in water level in the proximal fan region 145 0 million m3 of withdrawal for a one meter decline in water level for the mid fan region and 148 7 million m3 of withdrawal for a one meter decline in water level in the distal fan region furthermore groundwater levels in the southern half of the study area is more sensitive to pumping volume than the areas north of the choushui river

3811,the equilibrium of natural groundwater systems can be disrupted by excessive withdrawal accurate estimation of groundwater levels is needed to assess water level fluctuations caused by groundwater withdrawal and seasonal distributions of precipitation this study aims to estimate the next month s groundwater levels using monthly real world data that includes rainfall electricity estimated pumping volumes and current groundwater levels invoking time dependent spatial regression the new approach involves state estimation and change estimation methods which will be evaluated to determine the optimal model based on its root mean square error values the response of estimated future next month s groundwater levels within the alluvial fan in changhua and yunlin taiwan is based on monthly precipitation and pumping this study yields a data driven explanation of how water levels temporally and spatially respond to groundwater pumping and rainfall infiltration in different regions within the alluvial fan results indicate that the proximal fan yields the smallest response to decreased groundwater levels and subsequent increases in pumping the effect of reducing groundwater levels is greater in the southern areas of the study site than in the northern areas water levels in the mid fan and distal fan in the southern area show a greater drawdown due to larger pumping volumes compared to the northern area keywords rainfall pumping groundwater level estimation time dependent spatial regression 1 introduction groundwater is an invaluable and necessary natural resource for many countries for meeting primary human needs because of its quality quantity and accessibility the natural equilibrium balance of groundwater between natural recharge and discharge can be disrupted by excessive withdrawal as the exploitation of groundwater triggers a decrease in the water level and reduction in available storage liu et al 2004 on the other hand recharge from precipitation can counterbalance groundwater withdrawals in hydrological systems and therefore is an important parameter in aquifer system analysis yeh et al 2007 however the volume of naturally replenished water is also typically not proportional to the rate and quantity of groundwater use resulting in aquifer depletion chang et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 in recent decades overexploitation of groundwater for agriculture industry and urbanization has become a worldwide common occurrence qi et al 2018 a significant depletion of groundwater storage has occurred in several regions of the world e g india china usa as a result of groundwater pumping abstraction for irrigation asoka et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 in addition the overexploitation of groundwater in chunghua and yunlin counties in west central taiwan casues regional land subsidence chu et al 2020 agriculture and aquaculture in this area have increased dramatically since the 1970s with massive quantities of groundwater being withdrawn due to a lack of sufficient surface water hung et al 2012 to try to quantify unregulated pumping electrical power usage of pumping wells has been used to estimate pumping volume yet such estimates are frequently applied over whole municipalities therefore lacking sufficient resolution for planning or quantifying local usage vasco et al 2019 a detailed electrical usage study applied to water well pumps was conducted by chu et al 2020 to determine the monthly volume of groundwater extracted from individual wells over an area of 1 km2 and covering a 10 year period for changhua and yunlin counties taiwan in this investigation we correlate these estimations of pumping volume from electricity usage to water level changes detailed time dependent water level data are needed to analyze aquifer system response to natural and anthropogenic stresses chang et al 2016 machine learning and ai approaches have been successfully applied and developed for data models of groundwater prediction chu and chang 2009 chang et al 2016 sahoo et al 2017 smith and majumdar 2020 including groundwater quantity choubin and malekian 2017 mosavi et al 2020 and groundwater quality rahmati et al 2019 mosavi et al 2021 chu and chang 2009 used neural networks to predict next months forward prediction groundwater levels based on the current groundwater levels and pumping volumes however these data are based on numerical simulations and are not real world observations chang et al 2016 considered ai to predict monthly regional groundwater levels based on rainfall and river flow data sahoo et al 2017 predicted groundwater level change based on irrigation demand precipitation temperature and stream discharge using a hybrid artificial neural network these results showed that irrigation demand has the highest influence on groundwater level changes this data driven model approach represents an effective way to create a connection between groundwater recharge extraction and subsequent changes in groundwater levels in addition the data driven models also quantify the relation between the various widely available input data sets including evapotranspiration land use sediment thickness and land subsidence smith majumdar 2020 moreover the time dependent spatial regression based data model method will be used in this investigation because it effectively extends the standard linear regression process to a spatially weighted data modeling approach brunsdon et al 1996 ali et al 2020 chu et al 2021 time dependent spatial regression can be used to model the spatially varying and non stationary relation amongst precipitation pumping volume and groundwater level changes groundwater recharge and discharge are highly correlated to precipitation and pumping therefore only precipitation and pumping are considered important for mass balance purposes at the study site in this paper we aim to provide estimated future next month s groundwater levels using time dependent spatial regression approaches involving variations in monthly precipitation data monthly pumping volumes and monthly groundwater levels for improved groundwater management in addition we will investigate the efficiency of the regression method for forecasting next month s groundwater levels here we consider state estimation and change estimation approaches to compare the model performance moreover to understand the groundwater response to precipitation and pumping volume in various locations the study will present the groundwater response on the basis of its position within

model for the simulations presented in this study the change estimation is found to be superior due to the numerical calculation scheme e g change in the water level is usually smaller in addition the current groundwater level is known in the change estimation but represents the input for the estimation function in the state estimation approach 4 3 validation of the model the model validation process involves checking the estimated and observed groundwater levels from the representative locations from each of the proximal fan mid fan and distal fan regions see fig 5 the proximal fan fitting lines between the observed and model estimated groundwater levels are shown in fig 5a a high correlation of 0 97 and 0 99 exists between the observed and model estimated ht 1 for the ershui and gukeng sites respectively see table 4 ershui is an area north of the choushui river while gukeng is located south of the river tuku and dapi are mid fan locations in the southern part of the study area while erlun is located in the northern mid fan region the correlation values between observed and model estimated ht 1 values at these mid fan sites are 0 99 in tuku 0 96 in dapi and 0 95 in erlun fig 5b in tuku and dapi the increasing and lowering trends for both the observed and model estimated values are similar except for erlun and especially in december 2014 where the model estimated groundwater levels are higher than in other months groundwater level fluctuations at taixi fangyuan and fuxing within the distal fan region have correlation coefficients between observed and model estimated values of 0 92 0 97 and 0 94 respectively fig 5c in the southern distal fan taixi is located in the southern distal fan region while fangyuan and fuxing are located in the northern distal fan region all three of these dista fan sites have similar observed and model estimated groundwater levels 4 4 spatial mapping of groundwater levels fig 6 shows the spatial monthly groundwater level observations and estimated groundwater level maps from the state estimation and change estimation modeling approaches fig 6a shows the groundwater observation levels for the period from june 2014 to may 2105 the state estimation and change estimation groundwater levels for the forthcoming month ht 1 over the time period of july 2014 to june 2015 are shown in fig 6b and 6c respectively the simulation results for the ht 1 estimates using the two approaches are visually similar across the region when compared to the spatial observational data map the two methods are mostly similar and not visually distinct based on the contour patterns shown the spatial maps indicate that a decrease in groundwater level is more prevalent in the southern distal fan from july to february fig 6c meanwhile from august to november as well as from january to may the area on the north side of the choushui river exhibits a decrease in ht 1 increased water levels are shown to occur in december 2014 and june 2015 4 5 maps of groundwater level changes the spatial maps of groundwater level change estimates using the change estimation approach are shown in fig 7 in june august and september δh appears to have an approximate range from 2 5 to 2 5 m in july november and may δh varies from 0 to 2 5 m results imply that groundwater notably increases during these months conversely the estimated range is lower 0 5 m to 1 2 m for october and april meanwhile a groundwater level change reduction from 0 m to 2 5 m occurs in january february and march furthermore the southern part of the study area shows a high sensitivity to groundwater change for the months of november 2014 january february and may 2015 fig 8 shows the average δh based on the statistical analysis from spatial maps fig 7 with a connection between precipitation pumping volume fig 2 and monthly fluctuations in groundwater levels i e δh in june 2014 the groundwater level dropped to 0 853 m because of more than 120 million m3 of withdrawals that occurred and the region experienced a lower than average monthly precipitation of 213 86 mm in the following month while there was an insignificant increase in pumping and a reduction in the amount of precipitation δh nonetheless increased to 0 749 m moreover a subsequent decrease in precipitation occurred from august to october 2014 a reduction in the groundwater withdrawals over this three month period was also accompanied by a reduction in precipitation as a result a decrease in δh of 0 657 0 932 and 0 141 m respectively occurred for three consecutive months the cumulative reduction in groundwater levels was simulated to be 1 730 m in these three months however a net rise in water level of 1 037 m occurred in november 2014 the explanation for this rise is because the lowest pumping volumes over the simulation period occurred in november 2014 while precipitation was basically unchanged from the previous month meanwhile groundwater extraction steadily increased from december 2014 to february 2015 the greatest quantity of groundwater extraction occurred in february with a rate reaching nearly 180 million cubic meters throughout the study region moreover the volume pumped decreased marginally in june 2015 to a value of about 140 million meters in summary pumping volume appears to be the most important factor influencing groundwater levels in the study area the average groundwater level from june 2014 to may 2015 rose 3 005 m over the study period the change in groundwater level represents the respone of precipitation and groundwater pumping the wet season is usually from may to auguest by contrast the serious groundwater drawdown occurs during the agricultural season which coincides with the dry season from january to april the average groundwater level decline during this dry period is 3 5 m a groundwater management plan is needed during this period to help mitigate the ongoing land subsidence problem 4 6 relation between groundwater level change and local precipitation and pumping volumes fig 9 shows the time series plots of groundwater level local precipitation and pumping volumes from site observations in the proximal mid and distal regions of the alluvial fan groundwater levels dynamically vary with changes in precipitation and pumping volumes groundwater levels generally are lowest during the period from february to april and are also low in september and october in the mid and distal fan regions which is related to low precipitation rates and high pumping volumes fig 10 shows the effect of precipitation on groundwater level fluctuations in the proximal mid and distal regions of the alluvial fan a typical wet season can generally accommodate normal annual groundwater withdrawals without an annual decline in water level abdullahi garba 2016 recharge from precipitation occurs far more readily in the proximal fan region than in the mid and distal fan regions the relation between groundwater change and precipitation is most positively correlated in the proximal fan region but only mildly correlated in the mid fan region unlike the other two regions of the fan the effect of precipitation on the distal fan is not positively correlated the slope of the fitting line indicates that a 10 cm rise in groundwater level in the mid fan region must be accommodated by an annual precipitation amount of 1300 mm on the other hand a 10 cm rise in groundwater level in the proximal fan region only requires 187 mm of annual precipitation this result shows that the proximal fan region represents a strong recharge zone for groundwater replenishment and should be protected as an important recharge area fig 11 represents a plot comparing the local effect of pumping volumes on groundwater level fluctuations in the northern and southern regions of the fan the six samples indicate that pumping causes an overall decline in groundwater levels the slope of each fitting line implies the level of impact that pumping has on groundwater levels a larger slope indicates that pumping has a greater impact more drawdown on water levels all lines in areas north of the choushui river fig 11a tend to have a lower slope than in the southern region fig 11b this suggests that the northern half of the study area experiences less pumping induced impacts on water levels than areas south of the choushui river the overall sensitivity between pumping and water level change can be determined using the regression equation generated from the fitting line in the northern study area a one meter decline in groundwater level occurs for every 318 8 million m3 of groundwater withdrawan from the proximal fan whereas a one meter decline in water level occurs for every 204 6 million m3 of withdrawan from the mid fan and 192 7 million m3 withdrawan from the distal fan in the southern region a one meter decline in water level occurs for every 205 8 million m3 withdrawan from the proximal fan 145 0 million m3 of withdrawan from the mid fan and 148 7 million m3 of withdrawn from the distal fan respectively this study shows that water levels are influenced differently by pumping based on north south position within the fan as well as on the east west postion within the fan proximal mid distal the southern region experiences greater drawdown for a similar volume of water pumped compared to the northern region moreover the mid fan is more susceptible to groundwater extraction than the other two fan regions the least sensitive region for pumping is the proximal fan 5 conclusions this study uses time dependent spatial regression models to estimate forthcoming the next month s regional groundwater levels two data driven modeling approaches are used in this investigation the state estimation approach is used to estimate the next months groundwater levels based on the values of current pumping volume precipitation and current this month s water levels the change estimation approach estimates the groundwater level change δht firstly based on precipitation and groundwater extraction and then calculates the next months groundwater level by adding the δht to the current groundwater level based on the rmse values as model performance the change estimation approach is moderately better than the state estimation approach the change estimation approach is appropriately applied to the choushui river alluvial fan region of west cental taiwan the results yield a good understanding of how groundwater levels react to groundwater pumping and monthly precipitation rates within the proximal mid and distal fan regions of changhua north of the choushui river and yunlin south of the choushui river counties model results suggest that based on the local pumping effects groundwater levels are more highly impacted by pumping in the southern area yunlin than in northern area chunghua meanwhile the proximal fan is found to be the region with the smallest response to decreases groundwater level due to increased pumping the mid fan and distal fan regions of the southern area experience a greater decline in water level from pumping than the northern area specifically it takes 318 8 million m3 of withdrawal to cause 1 meter decline in water level in the proximal fan s northern area 204 6 million m3 of withdrawal for a one meter decline in water level in the mid fan and 192 7 million m3 of withdrawal for a one meter decline in water level in the distal fan similarly for the southern area it requires 205 8 million m3 of withdrawal to cause a one meter decline in water level in the proximal fan region 145 0 million m3 of withdrawal for a one meter decline in water level for the mid fan region and 148 7 million m3 of withdrawal for a one meter decline in water level in the distal fan region furthermore groundwater levels in the southern half of the study area is more sensitive to pumping volume than the areas north of the choushui river

3812,eco flows ecosurplus es and ecodeficit ed calculated with flow duration curves fdcs have some limitations on their use in assessing the ecohydrological conditions of rivers a new method of defining eco flows based on discharge hydrographs dhs instead of fdcs is presented in this study in this method the annual es is the ratio of the surplus annual runoff above the 75th percentile dh to the probable maximum surplus annual runoff above the 75th percentile dh the annual ed is the ratio of the deficient annual runoff below the 25th percentile dh to the probable maximum deficient annual runoff below the 25th percentile dh the monthly and seasonal eco flows are redefined similarly a methodforranking the risks posed by certainecohydrological conditions is proposed that includes four risk levels no risk low risk moderate risk and high risk data from the yellow river were used to illustrate these new methods results indicate that the new method based on dhs addresses the limitations and that the annual eds based on dhs have the strongest correlativity to the shannon diversity index the risk graph produced with this method displayed the risk levels for each month season and year overthe past 60 years in an intuitive format the changes in the dominant risk levels between the pre and post impact periods indicated the degree to which reservoirs impacted ecohydrological conditions at monthly seasonal and yearly scales this study can be used in the future to design ecological regulation measures to improve ecohydrological conditions during adversely impacted months and seasons keywords eco flows discharge hydrograph ecodeficit risk yellow river 1 introduction ecohydrological conditions are a key factor impacting river ecosystems understanding the ecohydrological conditions is essential to reveal the interaction mechanism between river ecosystems and hydrological regimes for instance consecutive flow rises in the spawning period can stimulate fish spawning occasional large floods can provide water and nutrients for plant growth along river beaches water temperature changes are indicators of breeding migration and extreme drought and floods can destroy fish habitats however 46 of the 106 primary watersheds worldwide have been modified by the construction of at least one large dam revenga et al 1998 revenga et al 2000 which can dramatically alter watershed conditions researchers have proposed many metrics to assess ecohydrological conditions and changes such as the most widely used indicators of hydrologic alterations iha richter et al 1996 richter et al 1997 in recent years eco flows ecosurplus es and ecodeficit ed calculated with flow duration curves fdcs have been suggested for use in the assessment of the ecohydrological conditions of rivers vogel and fennessey 1994 vogel and fennessey 1995 vogel et al 2007 gao et al 2012 2018 gu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 2018 lu et al 2018 ghotbi et al 2020 an fdc is a cumulative curve that shows the percentage of time in which specified discharges were equaled or exceeded during a given period hordon 2005 taking an annual fdc as an example the range between the 25th percentile fdc and the 75th percentile fdc is considered a target for maintaining sustainable river development gao et al 2012 the annual ed represents the amount of water below the target range in a year the annual es represents the amount of water above the target range in a year the annual eco flows are then divided by the mean or median discharge and become dimensionless metrics gao et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the monthly and seasonal eco flows are calculated similarly to the monthly and seasonal fdcs respectively although the eco flows calculated with fdcs have been proposed as indicators for a number of years they are farfrombeingpopular with river managers due to two limitations the first limitation is that cases of nonzero monthly ed and zero seasonal ed can be obtained in some years the nonzero monthly ed means lacking water in this month whereas the zero seasonal ed means not lacking water in this season therefore these two contradictory eds at the two time scales are very puzzling they seriously affect the assessment of ecohydrological conditions and are essentially different the seasonal es and annual es can also have similar inconsistencies although these cases are not widespread they can not be completely avoided and are an inherent problem of the definition method based on fdcs the second limitation is the absence of a method for evaluating the risk of certain ecohydrological conditions too much and too little water can both have a negative effect on river ecosystems for instance droughts usually cause a bad condition of ecosystems and a high risk of degradation of ecosystems the more serious the drought is the higher the risk of degradation is thus es and ed are potentially able to indirectly reflect the risk of damage to ecosystems by certain ecohydrological conditions based on the risk levels river managers can target the months and seasons with the most hazardous conditions to prevent further deterioration although gao et al 2009 pointed out that the eco flows did not include the risk level no relevant published progress on this topic has been made in the past decade one of the reasons is that the first limitation mentioned above has hindered the development of assessment methods for example in cases of nonzero january ed and zero winter ed january will be considered risky but winter which consists of december january and february will be considered no risk apparently the two risk levels at the two time scales are completely opposite and can confuse river managers they may neglect the risky january depending on only the riskless spring in essence the first limitation makes it a little difficult to propose a method for evaluating the risk therefore the eco flows based on fdcs are limited for assessing risk levels to address these two limitations and make the eco flows usable as widespread metrics the objectives of this study are a to propose new eco flows that are consistent across different time scales b to propose a risk assessment method for ecohydrological conditions and c to clearly interpret the impacts of reservoirs on ecohydrological conditions the yellow river in china is used to illustrate the presented method the results can indicate to river managers which month season and year had the most hazardous ecohydrological conditions in the past river managers can then design individually targeted ecological regulation measures to improve conditions in the adversely impacted months and seasons 2 methods 2 1 eco flows calculated by the fdc an fdc is a daily discharge q i function of the corresponding exceedance probability p i i n 1 where n is the number of days in the time scale and i is the rank vogel and fennessey 1994 vogel and fennessey 1995 vogel et al 2007 therefore a monthly fdc is obtained by arranging the daily discharges in a month in descending order a seasonal fdc is obtained by arranging the daily discharges in a season in descending order and an annual fdc is obtained by arranging the daily discharges in a year in descending order all the annual fdcs of each year in the post impact period constitute a family of annual fdcs the 25th percentile and 75th percentile annual fdcs can be obtained based on this family the 25th percentile and 75th percentile monthly and seasonal fdcs are calculated similarly taking a given january fdc as an example fig 1 b the yellow area below the 25th percentile january fdc divided by the january median daily discharge is the january ed and the cyan area above the 75th percentile january fdc divided by the january median daily discharge is the january es the seasonal and annual eco flows are calculated similarly 2 2 monthly eco flows in this study the monthly seasonal and annual eco flows are redefined based on the discharge hydrograph dh a dh is plotted using the daily discharge time series for an entire year all dhs before damming constitute a family of dhs based on all of the daily discharges on the same day in the family the 25th percentile daily discharges can be counted the 25th percentile daily discharge of each day constitute the 25th percentile dh the 75th percentile dh is constituted by all the 75th percentile daily discharges the range between the 25th percentile dh and the 75th percentile dh is considered a river management target and the 25th percentile and 75th percentile dhs are taken as the lower and upper limits of the target range respectively fig 2 after the target range is specified two important variables the maximum ecological water requirement max w m and the minimum ecological water requirement min w m are defined for each month taking march as an example the area below the 75th percentile dh from march 1 to 31 which is a product of the daily discharge and time is defined as march max w m fig 3 a the area below the 25th percentile dh from march 1 to 31 is defined as march min w m fig 3 b the max w m and min w m of other months are calculated similarly for a given dh fig 4 the daily discharges above the 75th percentile dh are identified cyan area the total cyan area from march 1 to 31 is the surplus runoff in march the daily discharges below the 25th percentile dh are also identified yellow area the total yellow area from march 1 to 31 is the deficient runoff in march the two variables e s m and e d m are defined as 1 e s m d i 1 m q i q i 75 max w m i f q i q i 75 2 e d m d i 1 m q i q i 25 min w m i f q i q i 25 where m denotes the month m 1 for march m 2 for april and so on d 86 400 s m is the number of days in each month m 31 for march m 30 for april and so on q i 75 and q i 25 denote the 75th percentile and 25th percentile discharge of each day respectively the numerator of eq 1 indicates the surplus runoff in a month the cyan area in fig 4 and that of eq 2 indicates the deficient runoff in a month the yellow area in fig 4 e s m indicates how many times the surplus runoff exceeds max w m e d m indicates how many times the deficient runoff is lower than min w m e s m is nonnegative and e d m is nonpositive eqs 1 and 2 imply that the larger the absolute value of the monthly e d m is the worse the ecohydrological conditions are e d m indicates only the multiples of deficient runoff less than min w m in each month but does not provide a clear picture of the ecohydrological conditions the worst condition and the largest absolute value of e d m are still unknown if we know the worst condition comparing that value with the e d m can characterize the ecohydrological conditions more clearly therefore two other variables e s m max and e d m min are defined as 3 e s m max d i 1 m q i max q i 75 max w m 4 e d m min d i 1 m q i min q i 25 min w m where q i max denotes the maximum discharge on each day and q i min denotes the minimum discharge on each day e s m max is the probable maximum es in month m and e d m min is the probable minimum ed in month m the numerator of eq 3 indicates the probable maximum surplus runoff in a month psrmaxm which is indicated by the green area in fig 5 a the numerator of eq 4 is the probable maximum deficient runoff in a month pdrmaxm which is indicated by the red area in fig 5 b by comparing e s m with e s m max and e d m with e d m min the monthly es and ed are defined as 5 e s m e s m e s m max i 1 m q i q i 75 i 1 m q i max q i 75 i f q i q i 75 6 e d m e d m e d m min i 1 m q i q i 25 i 1 m q i min q i 25 i f q i q i 25 although the ecological water requirement has been discussed in many papers whipple et al 1999 li and kang 2014 it has still not been conclusively defined eqs 5 and 6 show that e s m has nothing to do with max w m and that e d m has nothing to do with min w m therefore e s m and e d m cannot indicate the reasonability of max w m and min w m and they also show a specificrange of variation e s m can range between 0 and 1 and e d m can range between 1 and 0 a negative e d m indicatesa lack of water the different signs of es and ed help to easily distinguish between them although the monthly es and ed are relative values to some degree they can provide a certain amount of information based on e d m we can directly compare the current conditions with the probable worst conditions the larger the absolute value of e d m is the worse the ecological conditions are conversely the larger e s m is the better the ecological conditions are 2 3 seasonal eco flows according to the climate characteristics in our study area the seasons were defined as spring from march to may summer from june to august autumn from september to november and winter from december to february similar to the monthly eco flows the seasonal eco flows are defined 7 e s s i 1 s q i q i 75 i 1 s q i max q i 75 i f q i q i 75 8 e d s i 1 s q i q i 25 i 1 s q i min q i 25 i f q i q i 25 where e s s and e d s are the seasonal es and ed respectively s denotes the number of days in a season s 92 for spring s 92 for summer and so on the denominator of eq 7 indicates the probable maximum surplus runoff in a season psrmaxs which is indicated by the green area in fig 6 a the denominator of eq 8 is the probable maximum deficient runoff in a season pdrmaxs which is indicated by the red area in fig 6 b 2 4 annual eco flows for a given dh the annual eco flows are defined as follows 9 e s a i 1 y q i q i 75 i 1 y q i max q i 75 i f q i q i 75 10 e d a i 1 y q i q i 25 i 1 y q i min q i 25 i f q i q i 25 where e s a and e d a are the annual es and ed respectively y denotes the number of days in a year 365 or 366 the denominator of eq 9 indicates the probable maximum surplus runoff in a year psrmaxa which is indicated by the green area in fig 7 a the denominator of eq 10 is the probable maximum deficient runoff in a year pdrmaxa which is indicated by the red area in fig 7 b as the monthly seasonal and annual eco flows are all calculated with the same given dh cases of nonzero monthly ed and zero seasonal ed in some years as described in the introduction will not occur taking the march es as an example the numerator in eq 9 includes that in eq 7 which includes that in eq 5 based on the containment relationship among the three numerators if the march ed is nonzero the spring ed cannot be zero and the annual ed must also be nonzero therefore the new definition method above eliminates the inconsistencies in eco flows calculated with fdcs 2 5 risk evaluation maintaining a certain discharge is a necessary condition to sustain the river ecosystem in studies on the ecological discharge in rivers reasonably determining the minimum discharge rather than the maximum discharge is the core issue in this sense water shortages can increase the risk of ecosystem degradation therefore ed measuring the degree of deficient runoff is more suitable to evaluate the risk of ecohydrological conditions than es measuring the degree of surplus runoff tennant 1976 suggested 10 and 20 of the average flow as minimum and good base flows respectively in this study a method for ranking the risk of certain ecohydrological conditions is proposed by drawing on tennant s method here two key threshold values of ed at different time scales are first calculated based on the 10th percentile dh and 20th percentile dh table 1 the e d m 20 d h and e d m 10 d h for each month are calculated based on eq 6 e d s 20 d h and e d s 10 d h are calculated based on eq 8 e d a 20 d h and e d a 10 d h are calculated based on eq 10 as shown in table 1 four risk levels are proposed no risk low risk moderate risk and high risk for instance if a monthly ed is lower than e d m 10 d h the month has high risk if it is higher than e d m 10 d h but lower than e d m 20 d h the month has moderate risk if it is higher than e d m 20 d h but lower than zero the month has low risk and if it is zero the month has no risk the risk levels of seasonal ed and annual ed are ranked similarly 3 case study the yellow river is the second longest river in china it is 5 464 km in length with a basin area of 752 000 km2 fig 8 shows the monthly mean precipitation of the whole basin during 1961 2010 the precipitation is concentrated between june and september and the total rainfall in the four months accounted for 70 of the annual precipitation june has the maximum precipitation and december has the minimum the precipitation in spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february accounted for 18 08 55 13 24 11 and 2 68 of the annual precipitation respectively yao and wu 2014 tan et al 2016 the seasonal mean air temperature of the whole basin is 8 15 c spring 18 99 c summer 6 97 c autumn and 6 18 c winter in general summer and autumn are wet and rainy but winter and spring are cold and dry the xiaolangdi reservoir xldr which has the largest capacity on the river was completed in december 2001 the reservoir is mainly used to prevent floods and generate electricity it has a drainage area of 694 000 km2 accounting for 92 3 of the entire basin as a key reservoir it significantly alters the downstream flow regime the xiaolangdi hydrological station is located 4 km downstream of the dam and there are no tributaries between the dam and the station the available daily discharge time series at the station spans from 1956 to 2015 fig 8 shows the monthly mean discharge at the xiaolangdi hydrological station floods often occurred in late summer july and august and early autumn september and october low flows occurred in winter which is the dry season of the basin the whole time series is subdivided into two subseries 1956 to 2001 and 2002 to 2015 the period from 1956 to 2001 represents the natural status of the river the 25th percentile and 75th percentile dhs were obtained using daily discharge data from 1956 to 2001 4 results and discussion 4 1 impact of xldr previous studies have often displayed the eco flows for each month in figures which prevented clear interpretations of the long termchangetendencies and the impacts of reservoirs zhang et al 2015 2018 gao et al 2012 2018 here the cumulative monthly eco flows from 1956 to 2015 are shown in fig 9 in the cumulative monthly ed curves a very steep line segment indicates that the absolute monthly ed at the right endpoint is much larger than that at the left endpoint and a horizontal line segment indicates that the monthly ed at the right endpoint is zero the cumulative monthly es curves can be similarly interpreted the slopes of the curves before and after constructing the xldr are clearly different for the ed in may july august september october november and january the cumulative curves descended more quickly in the post impact period than in the preimpact period this change implies a negative impact of the xldr for the es in june and february the cumulative curves ascended more quickly in the post impact period than in the preimpact period implying a positive impact of the xldr to measure the impacts of the xldr quantitatively the increase rates of the cumulative monthly eco flows in the pre and post impact periods were calculated respectively for example the increase rate in the preimpact period was calculated as the difference in the cumulative values between 1956 and 2001 divided by 46 as there were 46 years in this period the impact of the xldr can be measured by the percentage change in the increase rate between the two periods table 2 for the monthly es a negative percentage change indicates that the xldr had an adverse impact and vice versa for the monthly ed a positive percentage change indicates an adverse impact and vice versa based on table 2 it is further confirmed that june was the most positively affected month with a 611 9 change in es and a 97 2 change in ed september was the most adversely affected month with a 100 0 change in es and a 334 4 change in ed the cumulative seasonal eco flows from 1956 to 2015 are shown in fig 10 for the cumulative es curves only the summer es curve ascended faster in the post impact period than in the preimpact period the cumulative spring summer and autumn eds descended faster in the post impact period than in the preimpact period table 3 shows the quantitative assessment of the impacts of the xldr on the seasonal eco flows the xldr had positive effects on only the summer es and winter ed regardless of the seasonal es or ed autumn was the most adverselyaffected season with a 94 6 change in es and a 200 7 change in ed the seasonal impacts were consistent with the monthly impacts the cumulative annual eco flows from 1956 to 2015 are shown in fig 11 the cumulative annual ed curve started to descend quickly in 1996 when the xldr was under construction the cumulative annual es curve in the post impact period showed a rising trend that was not significant table 4 shows that the xldr had adverse effects on both the annual es and ed and the annual ed was affected more seriously than the annual es 4 2 relationship between h and annual eco flows to demonstrate the superiority of the newly defined eco flows based on dhs the relationship between the annual eco flows and shannon diversity index h values was explored kuo et al 2001 h is a metric measuring the biodiversity of river ecosystems in this study h was calculated based on the relationships between some ihas and h yang et al 2008 the values of h and the annual eco flows calculated with fdcs are shown in fig 12 fig 13 shows h and the annual eco flows calculated with dhs the pearson s correlation coefficients between h and the annual eco flows showed that the annual ed calculated with dhs had a stronger correlation with h than the other three metrics the fréchet distance is the minimum length of a line that connects two points of each curve it is commonly used to measure the similarity between two curves the smaller the fréchet distance is the greater the similarity is between the two curves details about this approach can be found in the literature technische et al 1994 the results showed that the annual ed calculated with dhs had the smallest fréchet distance 2 6184 implying that the temporal variations in the annual ed from dhs were the most similar to those of h therefore the eco flows defined with dhs are more relevant to riverine ecosystems than those defined with fdcs moreover the strongest relevance between ed and h proves that adopting ed as the indicator to evaluate the risk of ecohydrological conditions is well founded 4 3 risk levels at different time scales river managers can intuitively understand the monthly seasonal and annual ecohydrological conditions presented in the risk graph fig 14 the annual risk graph indicates that 1997 and 2001 were the years with the highest risk levels this result is consistent with the facts since 1972 especially in the late 20th century the downstream of the xldr has frequently dried up in 1997 although the xiaolangdi hydrological station did not dry up the river downstream of the station had no flow for 226 days over a length of 104 km from the yellow riverestuary as the yellow river is the second longest river in china this drying event was a shock to the chinese people the consistency between the results and the facts validated the assessment method to some extent the changes in the four risk levels at different time scales before and after the construction of the xldr were further analyzed the frequencies at which each risk level occurred in the pre and post impact periods were calculated and compared fig 15 at the monthly scale taking june as an example after the construction of the xldr no risk instances occurred more frequently fig 15 a low risk instances occurred less frequently and moderate and high risk instances did not occur fig 15 b d this transformation of risk conditions suggests the positive effects of xldr on ecohydrological conditions in june at the seasonal scale taking autumn as an example one third of autumn seasons in the preimpact period were determined to show no risk after the construction of the xldr no risk instances stopped occurring low risk instances became less frequent and moderate and high risk instances occurred more often this transformation of risk conditions suggests the adverse effects of the xldr on ecohydrological conditions in autumn which is consistent with the relevant conclusions provided in section 4 1 at the yearly scale in the post impact period low risk instances became less frequent high risk instances stopped occurring and moderate risk instances occurred more often this transformation of risk conditions suggests the adverse effects of the xldr on annual ecohydrological conditions at each time scale the risk level with the highest proportion of occurrence in the pre or post impact period was considered the dominant risk level for the period table 5 table 5 shows that the risk in august and september increased by three levels with this information river managers could design individually targeted ecological regulation measures to improve conditions in august and september the effects of these measures can also be evaluated after their implementation with the method provided here 4 4 comparison between fdc and dh the above results indicate that the new eco flows based on dhs addressed the two limitations of eco flows based on fdcs however this does not mean that the former method can completely replace the latter and they have their own advantages and limitations previous studies have shown that fdcs can capture the variations of extreme flows very well such as the moving down of the head of an fdc and the moving up of the tail of an fdc which can intuitively mirror the effect of reservoir regulations zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 river managers can easily infer the changes in the magnitude and frequency of high and low flows from these change features of fdcs nevertheless as dh is squiggly rather than descending dhs can not present such obvious characteristics and reflect the effect as intuitively as fdcs do meanwhile the presented new method is also not perfect and conditional to be broadly adopted at the global scale for seasonal rivers that always have no flows through some months as the denominators in eqs 5 and 6 are zero the monthly eco flows in the months with no flows cannot be evaluated similarly eqs 7 and 8 cannot be applied to calculate the seasonal eco flows throughout seasons with no flows however eqs 9 and 10 are suitable for seasonal rivers therefore the eco flows at the three time scales can only be applied to rivers that do not dry in a year and the monthly and seasonal eco flows of seasonal rivers can only be evaluated for months and seasons with flows respectively 5 conclusions the newly defined es and ed based on dhs augment the potential uses of eco flows the values of the new es are limited to between 0 and 1 and those of the new ed are limited to between 1 and 0 from these es and ed values river managers can directly estimate how far the ecohydrological conditions are from the probable maximum es or the probable minimum ed respectively the risk assessment method presented here provides a new approach to assessing river health the case study of the yellow river shows that the annual eds based on dhs have the strongest correlativity to h and the inconsistencies in the eco flows calculated with fdcs cease to exist risk assessment shows that xldr had not only a positive impact on hydrological conditions in june but also an adverse effect on hydrological conditions in august and september in the future if river managers implement individually targeted ecological regulation measures thepresented assessment method could also be used as a post implementation evaluation tool however the suitability of the two threshold values of the 10th percentile and 20th percentile which are used to classify the risk levels needs to be further analyzed studies on more rivers are also needed to determine whether it is suitable to use the same threshold values for the ecohydrological conditions at monthly seasonal and annual scales in addition not only the 25th percentile and 75th percentile dh but also other pairs of percentiles can also be adopted as the target range such as the 33rd percentile and 67th percentile meanwhile different pairs of percentiles of dh can also be adopted at different time scales future research should be implemented to analyze the effect of different pairs of percentiles on eco flows in more rivers 6 data availability statement the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request

3812,eco flows ecosurplus es and ecodeficit ed calculated with flow duration curves fdcs have some limitations on their use in assessing the ecohydrological conditions of rivers a new method of defining eco flows based on discharge hydrographs dhs instead of fdcs is presented in this study in this method the annual es is the ratio of the surplus annual runoff above the 75th percentile dh to the probable maximum surplus annual runoff above the 75th percentile dh the annual ed is the ratio of the deficient annual runoff below the 25th percentile dh to the probable maximum deficient annual runoff below the 25th percentile dh the monthly and seasonal eco flows are redefined similarly a methodforranking the risks posed by certainecohydrological conditions is proposed that includes four risk levels no risk low risk moderate risk and high risk data from the yellow river were used to illustrate these new methods results indicate that the new method based on dhs addresses the limitations and that the annual eds based on dhs have the strongest correlativity to the shannon diversity index the risk graph produced with this method displayed the risk levels for each month season and year overthe past 60 years in an intuitive format the changes in the dominant risk levels between the pre and post impact periods indicated the degree to which reservoirs impacted ecohydrological conditions at monthly seasonal and yearly scales this study can be used in the future to design ecological regulation measures to improve ecohydrological conditions during adversely impacted months and seasons keywords eco flows discharge hydrograph ecodeficit risk yellow river 1 introduction ecohydrological conditions are a key factor impacting river ecosystems understanding the ecohydrological conditions is essential to reveal the interaction mechanism between river ecosystems and hydrological regimes for instance consecutive flow rises in the spawning period can stimulate fish spawning occasional large floods can provide water and nutrients for plant growth along river beaches water temperature changes are indicators of breeding migration and extreme drought and floods can destroy fish habitats however 46 of the 106 primary watersheds worldwide have been modified by the construction of at least one large dam revenga et al 1998 revenga et al 2000 which can dramatically alter watershed conditions researchers have proposed many metrics to assess ecohydrological conditions and changes such as the most widely used indicators of hydrologic alterations iha richter et al 1996 richter et al 1997 in recent years eco flows ecosurplus es and ecodeficit ed calculated with flow duration curves fdcs have been suggested for use in the assessment of the ecohydrological conditions of rivers vogel and fennessey 1994 vogel and fennessey 1995 vogel et al 2007 gao et al 2012 2018 gu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 2018 lu et al 2018 ghotbi et al 2020 an fdc is a cumulative curve that shows the percentage of time in which specified discharges were equaled or exceeded during a given period hordon 2005 taking an annual fdc as an example the range between the 25th percentile fdc and the 75th percentile fdc is considered a target for maintaining sustainable river development gao et al 2012 the annual ed represents the amount of water below the target range in a year the annual es represents the amount of water above the target range in a year the annual eco flows are then divided by the mean or median discharge and become dimensionless metrics gao et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the monthly and seasonal eco flows are calculated similarly to the monthly and seasonal fdcs respectively although the eco flows calculated with fdcs have been proposed as indicators for a number of years they are farfrombeingpopular with river managers due to two limitations the first limitation is that cases of nonzero monthly ed and zero seasonal ed can be obtained in some years the nonzero monthly ed means lacking water in this month whereas the zero seasonal ed means not lacking water in this season therefore these two contradictory eds at the two time scales are very puzzling they seriously affect the assessment of ecohydrological conditions and are essentially different the seasonal es and annual es can also have similar inconsistencies although these cases are not widespread they can not be completely avoided and are an inherent problem of the definition method based on fdcs the second limitation is the absence of a method for evaluating the risk of certain ecohydrological conditions too much and too little water can both have a negative effect on river ecosystems for instance droughts usually cause a bad condition of ecosystems and a high risk of degradation of ecosystems the more serious the drought is the higher the risk of degradation is thus es and ed are potentially able to indirectly reflect the risk of damage to ecosystems by certain ecohydrological conditions based on the risk levels river managers can target the months and seasons with the most hazardous conditions to prevent further deterioration although gao et al 2009 pointed out that the eco flows did not include the risk level no relevant published progress on this topic has been made in the past decade one of the reasons is that the first limitation mentioned above has hindered the development of assessment methods for example in cases of nonzero january ed and zero winter ed january will be considered risky but winter which consists of december january and february will be considered no risk apparently the two risk levels at the two time scales are completely opposite and can confuse river managers they may neglect the risky january depending on only the riskless spring in essence the first limitation makes it a little difficult to propose a method for evaluating the risk therefore the eco flows based on fdcs are limited for assessing risk levels to address these two limitations and make the eco flows usable as widespread metrics the objectives of this study are a to propose new eco flows that are consistent across different time scales b to propose a risk assessment method for ecohydrological conditions and c to clearly interpret the impacts of reservoirs on ecohydrological conditions the yellow river in china is used to illustrate the presented method the results can indicate to river managers which month season and year had the most hazardous ecohydrological conditions in the past river managers can then design individually targeted ecological regulation measures to improve conditions in the adversely impacted months and seasons 2 methods 2 1 eco flows calculated by the fdc an fdc is a daily discharge q i function of the corresponding exceedance probability p i i n 1 where n is the number of days in the time scale and i is the rank vogel and fennessey 1994 vogel and fennessey 1995 vogel et al 2007 therefore a monthly fdc is obtained by arranging the daily discharges in a month in descending order a seasonal fdc is obtained by arranging the daily discharges in a season in descending order and an annual fdc is obtained by arranging the daily discharges in a year in descending order all the annual fdcs of each year in the post impact period constitute a family of annual fdcs the 25th percentile and 75th percentile annual fdcs can be obtained based on this family the 25th percentile and 75th percentile monthly and seasonal fdcs are calculated similarly taking a given january fdc as an example fig 1 b the yellow area below the 25th percentile january fdc divided by the january median daily discharge is the january ed and the cyan area above the 75th percentile january fdc divided by the january median daily discharge is the january es the seasonal and annual eco flows are calculated similarly 2 2 monthly eco flows in this study the monthly seasonal and annual eco flows are redefined based on the discharge hydrograph dh a dh is plotted using the daily discharge time series for an entire year all dhs before damming constitute a family of dhs based on all of the daily discharges on the same day in the family the 25th percentile daily discharges can be counted the 25th percentile daily discharge of each day constitute the 25th percentile dh the 75th percentile dh is constituted by all the 75th percentile daily discharges the range between the 25th percentile dh and the 75th percentile dh is considered a river management target and the 25th percentile and 75th percentile dhs are taken as the lower and upper limits of the target range respectively fig 2 after the target range is specified two important variables the maximum ecological water requirement max w m and the minimum ecological water requirement min w m are defined for each month taking march as an example the area below the 75th percentile dh from march 1 to 31 which is a product of the daily discharge and time is defined as march max w m fig 3 a the area below the 25th percentile dh from march 1 to 31 is defined as march min w m fig 3 b the max w m and min w m of other months are calculated similarly for a given dh fig 4 the daily discharges above the 75th percentile dh are identified cyan area the total cyan area from march 1 to 31 is the surplus runoff in march the daily discharges below the 25th percentile dh are also identified yellow area the total yellow area from march 1 to 31 is the deficient runoff in march the two variables e s m and e d m are defined as 1 e s m d i 1 m q i q i 75 max w m i f q i q i 75 2 e d m d i 1 m q i q i 25 min w m i f q i q i 25 where m denotes the month m 1 for march m 2 for april and so on d 86 400 s m is the number of days in each month m 31 for march m 30 for april and so on q i 75 and q i 25 denote the 75th percentile and 25th percentile discharge of each day respectively the numerator of eq 1 indicates the surplus runoff in a month the cyan area in fig 4 and that of eq 2 indicates the deficient runoff in a month the yellow area in fig 4 e s m indicates how many times the surplus runoff exceeds max w m e d m indicates how many times the deficient runoff is lower than min w m e s m is nonnegative and e d m is nonpositive eqs 1 and 2 imply that the larger the absolute value of the monthly e d m is the worse the ecohydrological conditions are e d m indicates only the multiples of deficient runoff less than min w m in each month but does not provide a clear picture of the ecohydrological conditions the worst condition and the largest absolute value of e d m are still unknown if we know the worst condition comparing that value with the e d m can characterize the ecohydrological conditions more clearly therefore two other variables e s m max and e d m min are defined as 3 e s m max d i 1 m q i max q i 75 max w m 4 e d m min d i 1 m q i min q i 25 min w m where q i max denotes the maximum discharge on each day and q i min denotes the minimum discharge on each day e s m max is the probable maximum es in month m and e d m min is the probable minimum ed in month m the numerator of eq 3 indicates the probable maximum surplus runoff in a month psrmaxm which is indicated by the green area in fig 5 a the numerator of eq 4 is the probable maximum deficient runoff in a month pdrmaxm which is indicated by the red area in fig 5 b by comparing e s m with e s m max and e d m with e d m min the monthly es and ed are defined as 5 e s m e s m e s m max i 1 m q i q i 75 i 1 m q i max q i 75 i f q i q i 75 6 e d m e d m e d m min i 1 m q i q i 25 i 1 m q i min q i 25 i f q i q i 25 although the ecological water requirement has been discussed in many papers whipple et al 1999 li and kang 2014 it has still not been conclusively defined eqs 5 and 6 show that e s m has nothing to do with max w m and that e d m has nothing to do with min w m therefore e s m and e d m cannot indicate the reasonability of max w m and min w m and they also show a specificrange of variation e s m can range between 0 and 1 and e d m can range between 1 and 0 a negative e d m indicatesa lack of water the different signs of es and ed help to easily distinguish between them although the monthly es and ed are relative values to some degree they can provide a certain amount of information based on e d m we can directly compare the current conditions with the probable worst conditions the larger the absolute value of e d m is the worse the ecological conditions are conversely the larger e s m is the better the ecological conditions are 2 3 seasonal eco flows according to the climate characteristics in our study area the seasons were defined as spring from march to may summer from june to august autumn from september to november and winter from december to february similar to the monthly eco flows the seasonal eco flows are defined 7 e s s i 1 s q i q i 75 i 1 s q i max q i 75 i f q i q i 75 8 e d s i 1 s q i q i 25 i 1 s q i min q i 25 i f q i q i 25 where e s s and e d s are the seasonal es and ed respectively s denotes the number of days in a season s 92 for spring s 92 for summer and so on the denominator of eq 7 indicates the probable maximum surplus runoff in a season psrmaxs which is indicated by the green area in fig 6 a the denominator of eq 8 is the probable maximum deficient runoff in a season pdrmaxs which is indicated by the red area in fig 6 b 2 4 annual eco flows for a given dh the annual eco flows are defined as follows 9 e s a i 1 y q i q i 75 i 1 y q i max q i 75 i f q i q i 75 10 e d a i 1 y q i q i 25 i 1 y q i min q i 25 i f q i q i 25 where e s a and e d a are the annual es and ed respectively y denotes the number of days in a year 365 or 366 the denominator of eq 9 indicates the probable maximum surplus runoff in a year psrmaxa which is indicated by the green area in fig 7 a the denominator of eq 10 is the probable maximum deficient runoff in a year pdrmaxa which is indicated by the red area in fig 7 b as the monthly seasonal and annual eco flows are all calculated with the same given dh cases of nonzero monthly ed and zero seasonal ed in some years as described in the introduction will not occur taking the march es as an example the numerator in eq 9 includes that in eq 7 which includes that in eq 5 based on the containment relationship among the three numerators if the march ed is nonzero the spring ed cannot be zero and the annual ed must also be nonzero therefore the new definition method above eliminates the inconsistencies in eco flows calculated with fdcs 2 5 risk evaluation maintaining a certain discharge is a necessary condition to sustain the river ecosystem in studies on the ecological discharge in rivers reasonably determining the minimum discharge rather than the maximum discharge is the core issue in this sense water shortages can increase the risk of ecosystem degradation therefore ed measuring the degree of deficient runoff is more suitable to evaluate the risk of ecohydrological conditions than es measuring the degree of surplus runoff tennant 1976 suggested 10 and 20 of the average flow as minimum and good base flows respectively in this study a method for ranking the risk of certain ecohydrological conditions is proposed by drawing on tennant s method here two key threshold values of ed at different time scales are first calculated based on the 10th percentile dh and 20th percentile dh table 1 the e d m 20 d h and e d m 10 d h for each month are calculated based on eq 6 e d s 20 d h and e d s 10 d h are calculated based on eq 8 e d a 20 d h and e d a 10 d h are calculated based on eq 10 as shown in table 1 four risk levels are proposed no risk low risk moderate risk and high risk for instance if a monthly ed is lower than e d m 10 d h the month has high risk if it is higher than e d m 10 d h but lower than e d m 20 d h the month has moderate risk if it is higher than e d m 20 d h but lower than zero the month has low risk and if it is zero the month has no risk the risk levels of seasonal ed and annual ed are ranked similarly 3 case study the yellow river is the second longest river in china it is 5 464 km in length with a basin area of 752 000 km2 fig 8 shows the monthly mean precipitation of the whole basin during 1961 2010 the precipitation is concentrated between june and september and the total rainfall in the four months accounted for 70 of the annual precipitation june has the maximum precipitation and december has the minimum the precipitation in spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february accounted for 18 08 55 13 24 11 and 2 68 of the annual precipitation respectively yao and wu 2014 tan et al 2016 the seasonal mean air temperature of the whole basin is 8 15 c spring 18 99 c summer 6 97 c autumn and 6 18 c winter in general summer and autumn are wet and rainy but winter and spring are cold and dry the xiaolangdi reservoir xldr which has the largest capacity on the river was completed in december 2001 the reservoir is mainly used to prevent floods and generate electricity it has a drainage area of 694 000 km2 accounting for 92 3 of the entire basin as a key reservoir it significantly alters the downstream flow regime the xiaolangdi hydrological station is located 4 km downstream of the dam and there are no tributaries between the dam and the station the available daily discharge time series at the station spans from 1956 to 2015 fig 8 shows the monthly mean discharge at the xiaolangdi hydrological station floods often occurred in late summer july and august and early autumn september and october low flows occurred in winter which is the dry season of the basin the whole time series is subdivided into two subseries 1956 to 2001 and 2002 to 2015 the period from 1956 to 2001 represents the natural status of the river the 25th percentile and 75th percentile dhs were obtained using daily discharge data from 1956 to 2001 4 results and discussion 4 1 impact of xldr previous studies have often displayed the eco flows for each month in figures which prevented clear interpretations of the long termchangetendencies and the impacts of reservoirs zhang et al 2015 2018 gao et al 2012 2018 here the cumulative monthly eco flows from 1956 to 2015 are shown in fig 9 in the cumulative monthly ed curves a very steep line segment indicates that the absolute monthly ed at the right endpoint is much larger than that at the left endpoint and a horizontal line segment indicates that the monthly ed at the right endpoint is zero the cumulative monthly es curves can be similarly interpreted the slopes of the curves before and after constructing the xldr are clearly different for the ed in may july august september october november and january the cumulative curves descended more quickly in the post impact period than in the preimpact period this change implies a negative impact of the xldr for the es in june and february the cumulative curves ascended more quickly in the post impact period than in the preimpact period implying a positive impact of the xldr to measure the impacts of the xldr quantitatively the increase rates of the cumulative monthly eco flows in the pre and post impact periods were calculated respectively for example the increase rate in the preimpact period was calculated as the difference in the cumulative values between 1956 and 2001 divided by 46 as there were 46 years in this period the impact of the xldr can be measured by the percentage change in the increase rate between the two periods table 2 for the monthly es a negative percentage change indicates that the xldr had an adverse impact and vice versa for the monthly ed a positive percentage change indicates an adverse impact and vice versa based on table 2 it is further confirmed that june was the most positively affected month with a 611 9 change in es and a 97 2 change in ed september was the most adversely affected month with a 100 0 change in es and a 334 4 change in ed the cumulative seasonal eco flows from 1956 to 2015 are shown in fig 10 for the cumulative es curves only the summer es curve ascended faster in the post impact period than in the preimpact period the cumulative spring summer and autumn eds descended faster in the post impact period than in the preimpact period table 3 shows the quantitative assessment of the impacts of the xldr on the seasonal eco flows the xldr had positive effects on only the summer es and winter ed regardless of the seasonal es or ed autumn was the most adverselyaffected season with a 94 6 change in es and a 200 7 change in ed the seasonal impacts were consistent with the monthly impacts the cumulative annual eco flows from 1956 to 2015 are shown in fig 11 the cumulative annual ed curve started to descend quickly in 1996 when the xldr was under construction the cumulative annual es curve in the post impact period showed a rising trend that was not significant table 4 shows that the xldr had adverse effects on both the annual es and ed and the annual ed was affected more seriously than the annual es 4 2 relationship between h and annual eco flows to demonstrate the superiority of the newly defined eco flows based on dhs the relationship between the annual eco flows and shannon diversity index h values was explored kuo et al 2001 h is a metric measuring the biodiversity of river ecosystems in this study h was calculated based on the relationships between some ihas and h yang et al 2008 the values of h and the annual eco flows calculated with fdcs are shown in fig 12 fig 13 shows h and the annual eco flows calculated with dhs the pearson s correlation coefficients between h and the annual eco flows showed that the annual ed calculated with dhs had a stronger correlation with h than the other three metrics the fréchet distance is the minimum length of a line that connects two points of each curve it is commonly used to measure the similarity between two curves the smaller the fréchet distance is the greater the similarity is between the two curves details about this approach can be found in the literature technische et al 1994 the results showed that the annual ed calculated with dhs had the smallest fréchet distance 2 6184 implying that the temporal variations in the annual ed from dhs were the most similar to those of h therefore the eco flows defined with dhs are more relevant to riverine ecosystems than those defined with fdcs moreover the strongest relevance between ed and h proves that adopting ed as the indicator to evaluate the risk of ecohydrological conditions is well founded 4 3 risk levels at different time scales river managers can intuitively understand the monthly seasonal and annual ecohydrological conditions presented in the risk graph fig 14 the annual risk graph indicates that 1997 and 2001 were the years with the highest risk levels this result is consistent with the facts since 1972 especially in the late 20th century the downstream of the xldr has frequently dried up in 1997 although the xiaolangdi hydrological station did not dry up the river downstream of the station had no flow for 226 days over a length of 104 km from the yellow riverestuary as the yellow river is the second longest river in china this drying event was a shock to the chinese people the consistency between the results and the facts validated the assessment method to some extent the changes in the four risk levels at different time scales before and after the construction of the xldr were further analyzed the frequencies at which each risk level occurred in the pre and post impact periods were calculated and compared fig 15 at the monthly scale taking june as an example after the construction of the xldr no risk instances occurred more frequently fig 15 a low risk instances occurred less frequently and moderate and high risk instances did not occur fig 15 b d this transformation of risk conditions suggests the positive effects of xldr on ecohydrological conditions in june at the seasonal scale taking autumn as an example one third of autumn seasons in the preimpact period were determined to show no risk after the construction of the xldr no risk instances stopped occurring low risk instances became less frequent and moderate and high risk instances occurred more often this transformation of risk conditions suggests the adverse effects of the xldr on ecohydrological conditions in autumn which is consistent with the relevant conclusions provided in section 4 1 at the yearly scale in the post impact period low risk instances became less frequent high risk instances stopped occurring and moderate risk instances occurred more often this transformation of risk conditions suggests the adverse effects of the xldr on annual ecohydrological conditions at each time scale the risk level with the highest proportion of occurrence in the pre or post impact period was considered the dominant risk level for the period table 5 table 5 shows that the risk in august and september increased by three levels with this information river managers could design individually targeted ecological regulation measures to improve conditions in august and september the effects of these measures can also be evaluated after their implementation with the method provided here 4 4 comparison between fdc and dh the above results indicate that the new eco flows based on dhs addressed the two limitations of eco flows based on fdcs however this does not mean that the former method can completely replace the latter and they have their own advantages and limitations previous studies have shown that fdcs can capture the variations of extreme flows very well such as the moving down of the head of an fdc and the moving up of the tail of an fdc which can intuitively mirror the effect of reservoir regulations zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 river managers can easily infer the changes in the magnitude and frequency of high and low flows from these change features of fdcs nevertheless as dh is squiggly rather than descending dhs can not present such obvious characteristics and reflect the effect as intuitively as fdcs do meanwhile the presented new method is also not perfect and conditional to be broadly adopted at the global scale for seasonal rivers that always have no flows through some months as the denominators in eqs 5 and 6 are zero the monthly eco flows in the months with no flows cannot be evaluated similarly eqs 7 and 8 cannot be applied to calculate the seasonal eco flows throughout seasons with no flows however eqs 9 and 10 are suitable for seasonal rivers therefore the eco flows at the three time scales can only be applied to rivers that do not dry in a year and the monthly and seasonal eco flows of seasonal rivers can only be evaluated for months and seasons with flows respectively 5 conclusions the newly defined es and ed based on dhs augment the potential uses of eco flows the values of the new es are limited to between 0 and 1 and those of the new ed are limited to between 1 and 0 from these es and ed values river managers can directly estimate how far the ecohydrological conditions are from the probable maximum es or the probable minimum ed respectively the risk assessment method presented here provides a new approach to assessing river health the case study of the yellow river shows that the annual eds based on dhs have the strongest correlativity to h and the inconsistencies in the eco flows calculated with fdcs cease to exist risk assessment shows that xldr had not only a positive impact on hydrological conditions in june but also an adverse effect on hydrological conditions in august and september in the future if river managers implement individually targeted ecological regulation measures

pairs of percentiles on eco flows in more rivers 6 data availability statement the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request

transport into and out of the regime reach is approximately equal over time the use of the regime channel concept to evaluate the stability of streams in urbanizing watersheds is explored in this study regime conditions refer to a dynamically stable state of existence of a watercourse for which the rate of energy expenditure approaches a minimum and the rate of sediment transport into and out of the regime reach is approximately equal over time a detailed discussion of regime channel concepts is described in lacey 1929 eaton et al 2004 and da silva and yalin 2017 to achieve regime conditions the watercourse must adjust its width depth and slope through processes of erosion and deposition the effective slope of a river may be defined as the actual slope of the river channel at any location rather than the corridor it flows within a river may adjust its effective slope by adjusting its planform by meandering in mild to moderately sloped valleys or by establishing riffles or drop structures in moderately to steeply sloped valleys urban stream syndrome walsh et al 2005 describes the effects of significant and unmitigated urbanization on stream systems the common symptoms include change in flow regime erosion and sedimentation and associated impact on pollutant loading and habitat health bonakdari et al 2020 bonakdari et al 2019 the hypothesis of this study is that appropriately developed regime conditions modelling may be used to identify the need for and type of mitigation required to effectively manage urban stream syndrome in watercourses contributing to inland waterbodies such as lake simcoe in southern ontario canada in this study a database of key channel morphology variables is constructed using published data from previous studies as described in the following sections the group method of data handling gmdh is used to analyze the channel morphology data and develop a regime channel model based on specific stream power to manage urbanizing stream systems gholami et al 2017 2019a b kazemian kale kale et al 2018 2020 2 background regime channels are often viewed as analogues to be mimicked in channel design in order to impart stability to the constructed channel streams in undisturbed watersheds and experiencing unchanged hydrology are typically dynamically stable or in regime ministry of the environment 2003 the sediment movement and sediment strength are in balance with the shear stress and stream slope affected by topographic slope and sinuosity stream flow rate and channel width finnegan et al 2007 stream stability is typically evaluated by observing geomorphic indices such as those included in the rapid geomorphic assessment rga toronto and region conservation authority 2012 or the qualitative habitat evaluation index a method to quantify the physical aquatic habitat components important to fish qhei rankin 1995 gazendam 2016 the altered hydrology and reduction in watershed sediment supply in urbanized streams often result in streams becoming sediment starved and out of balance kondolf 1997 church and rood 1983 credit valley conservation 2011 sediment starved water flowing from urbanized reaches to relatively undeveloped reaches lower in the watershed often results in instability in the lower reaches kondolf et al 2014 regime channel concepts have been used successfully in many applications but may not always be appropriate in the face of altered hydrologic flow regimes resulting from urbanization or climate change many researchers have developed empirical equations relating width depth and slope of stable channels to flow resistance and sediment transportation equations leopold et al 1964 and leopold and maddock 1953 were among the first authors to recognize the relative consistency of natural channel form and quantify channel geometric relationships these studies on stable channel geometry and its dominant parameters indicate that the flow or discharge q and median bed sediment size d50 play key roles in forming stable channel dimensions bray 1982 cao and knight 1996 hey and thorne 1986 kellerhals 1967 savenije 2003 afzalimehr et al 2009 2010 introduced the shields parameter τ as an influential factor in identifying channel stability that had been neglected in previous efforts of stable channel design they found that τ has a significant impact on the depth and especially slope prediction accuracy the sediment transport rate which is one of the critical factors in the channel s stability can be expressed as a function of the shields parameter knighton 1974 also notes that the downstream rate of width increase is principally a function of discharge while its at a station rate of change is largely controlled by bank material composition julien and wargadalam 1995 further developed theoretical regime channel relationships based on the solution of a set of four governing equations for discharge rate resistance to flow secondary flow and particle mobility the applicability of these empirical equations is typically limited by the setting size and range of the dataset used to develop the relationships gholami et al 2017 hawley 2018 shaghaghi et al 2019 shaghaghi et al 2018 eaton et al 2004 were one of the first studies that used non dimensional alluvial state space to develop scale independent rational regime models of alluvial channel morphology and response their model defines a dimensionless alluvial state space characterized by aspect ratio w h relative roughness d h and shields parameter τ or equivalently channel slope s in addition to these parameters huang and chang 2006 identified a dimensionless number defined as the ratio of the relative increment of shear stress to the increment of width depth ratio which they suggest needs to be adopted as a criterion of hydraulic similitude for modelling sediment bed load transport in alluvial channels bertoldi et al 2009 identified vegetation influence as a function of flow rate and river stage suggesting that vegetation may constrain the development of regime conditions while allmendinger et al 2005 and hession et al 2003 investigated the effects of different vegetation types on channel morphology finally eaton and millar 2017 emphasized setting based constraints on regime channel development as included in the ubc regime model ubcrm that constrain predictions of stable channel configuration using bank and pattern stability criteria 2 1 stream power stream power is the energy expended by flowing water per unit of time and was initially proposed as an essential metric for sediment transport by bagnold 1960 yang 1977 and yang and stall 1974 lammers and bledsoe 2018a b provided further analysis of sediment transport as a function of stream power and introduced the stream power per unit weight of flowing water stream power has also been used successfully to model geomorphic channel evolution yochum et al 2017 lammers and bledsoe 2018b however recent attempts to analyze regime conditions are often limited by regional and seasonal stream power training data callow and smettem 2007 dade and friend 1998 kaushal et al 2020 khan and fryirs 2020 li et al 2016 swarnkar et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 as discussed by rhoads 1987 many early researchers of stream power adopted different methods of normalizing stream flow and different terminology to describe each expression of particular interest is the use of unit stream power which yang 1979 described as the stream power per unit weight of water while many subsequent researchers use either unit stream power or specific stream power to describe the stream power dissipated per unit area of channel boundary in the current study we use the specific stream power after bagnold 1960 and petit et al 2005 3 objectives the objectives of this study are to construct a database of surveyed stable channel variables from existing published sources use machine learning to develop an empirical regime channel model which is readily applicable to assessing the stability of streams in urbanizing watersheds use the developed regime channel model to assess the stability of watercourses known to be both stable or in regime and with histories of disturbance in southern ontario canada 4 methods a database of channel morphology variables including width w depth h flow q2 bed material median particle diameter d50 and slope s for 733 regime channels was constructed from existing published sources the sources included 368 channels from church and rood 1983 253 channels from ackert 2000 37 channels from mnr and watershed science centre 2001 50 channels from afzalimehr et al 2010 and 78 channels from chitale 1970 1973 of the 78 channels included in chitale 1970 1973 53 did not include bed sediment grain size and were not used for model development approximately 90 of the church and rood 1983 dataset represented rivers from the western part of north america approximately 40 from canada and 50 from the united states of america and approximately 10 from british rivers the ackert 2000 data were collected in southwestern ontario canada the mnr and watershed science centre 2001 data were collected in southern ontario while afzalimehr et al 2010 collected their data in iran and chitale 1970 1973 collected his data primarily in india and the united states of america with some data from pakistan cambodia and western canada in addition to the 733 regime channels adopted into the database approximately 80 channels were not included because they were recorded with adverse slope conditions negative shear stress or they were suspected to include data entry errors a summary of the range and median values for w h q2 d50 and s is presented in table 1 4 1 group method of data handling gmdh the relationships between width depth slope and sediment size of a regime channel represent a complex multivariate system which is subject to local random variability and cannot be readily modelled theoretically to any significant degree of precision using the typically limited number of available input variables and theoretical modelling approaches xu et al 2020 eaton et al 2004 and da silva and yalin 2017 discuss the requirements for theoretically based models of regime conditions however the level of detail included in the assembled database of regime channels did not support the development of calibrated theoretical models for this study machine learning using gmdh was selected for use in this study and has been used previously to predict channel enlargement e g sengupta et al 2018 gmdh is a type of artificial neural network ann modelling approach that can be used to assess real world cases where there is no or incomplete theoretical experience regarding the association between the input variables and the outcome ebtehaj et al 2015 2016 gholami et al 2017 ivakhnenko and ivakhnenko 1995 schmidhuber 2015 shaghaghi et al 2017 2018 stajkowski et al 2021 initial modelling efforts explored the use other ann and gene expression programming ebtehaj et al 2019 langridge et al 2020 tabrizi et al 2021 but gmdh was ultimately selected for use in this study because it performed better than other ann models and converged faster than the initial gep model attempts using gmdh the modelled variable y for input vectors x1 x2 x3 xn with m observations i 1 2 3 m can be defined as follows 1 y i f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n gmdh was trained using two thirds of the dataset to estimate the outcome value y for given input variables as follows 2 y i f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n the objective function used for gmdh training was to minimize the square difference between the actual outcome y observed and the estimated y as follows 3 m i n i 1 m f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n 2 the gmdh algorithm constructs progressively higher order polynomials generically known as the volterra functional series as follows 4 y a 0 i 1 m a i x i i 1 m j 1 m a ij x i x j i 1 m j 1 m k 1 m a ijk x i x j x k the gmdh algorithm decomposes the volterra function series into quadratic binomials a simplified description of the quadratic binomials using two variables neurons may be expressed as shown in equation 5 5 y i f x i x j a 0 a 1 x i a 2 x j a 3 x i 2 a 4 x j 2 a 5 x i x j the regression polynomial expressed in equation 5 accounts for all possible polynomial functions of two independent variables and is used to find the best fit between the m observed values and the model estimates using the objective function equation 3 further descriptions of the gmdh methods are presented in gholami et al 2017 azimi et al 2018 and ebtehaj et al 2018 4 2 the goodness of fit criteria statistical indices used to evaluate the verification of the new gmdh models for regime channel conditions and previous traditional models are described below the coefficient of correlation r root mean square error rmse and the nash suttcliffe efficiency nse coefficient were

the data are not linearly correlated rmse is the standard deviation of the residual errors between the observed data and the model results it can assume values 0 with 0 indicating perfect agreement between the observed data and model results nse has a theoretical range from to 1 0 with values less than zero indicating that the mean of the observed data provides a better estimate than the model and a value of 1 0 indicating perfect agreement between the observed data and model results useful models typically have an nse value between 0 5 and 1 0 4 3 model development as a first step gmdh modelling was used to develop models of regime width and depth the resulting models produced useable relationships similar in form to previously published regime equations however the results failed to adequately explain the variability observed in the dataset and as a result the models were ineffective in distinguishing in regime channels from those out of regime to reduce uncertainty and scatter in the modelling the analysis was extended to include assessing stream power as a parameter for assessing regime conditions in urbanizing watersheds building from the geographical information system gis based stream power assessment methodology presented in vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 the current study focused on specific stream power for development of a regime channel model better suited to address the objective of developing an empirical regime channel model for assessing the stability of streams in urbanizing watersheds vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 focused on total stream power ω for assessment of erosion risk which avoids the need to accurately represent channel width and is appropriate for channels that are either within regime conditions or not for the identification of regime conditions width is an important variable typically adjusted by the river to achieve regime conditions the current study focused on specific stream power ω as shown in equation 9 9 ω γ q s w where ω is the specific stream power w m2 γ is the unit weight of water n m3 q is the discharge assumed in this study to be equal to the 2 year return period peak flow q2 m3 s s is the channel slope m m and w is the bankfull width m to develop the gmdh model the dataset was randomly divided into three two thirds of the data were used to train the gmdh model while the remaining third was used to verify the model performance the gmdh shell package was used to train and verify the model and the resulting model and verification statistics are provided in the results and discussion section 5 results and discussion a database of 733 previously published stream geometry observations was constructed from the historic datasets summarized in table 1 the data were used to develop a regime specific stream power model that identifies specific stream power during the q2 event that is appropriate for the regime channel slope s width w depth h and sediment size d50 the regime specific stream power model is shown in equation 10 the model is a complex function of w h s and d50 10 ω f d 50 s h w full representation of the regime specific stream power model and its sub functions is presented in box 1 following the text box 1 includes the regime specific stream power function in the top line followed by forty four 44 sub functions capturing each input variable s influence d50 s h w and their inter dependence while discharge data q were available in the regime channel database they were omitted from the regime specific stream power model training and verification datasets to avoid biasing the model performance as stream power is highly dependent on discharge 5 1 specific stream power model performance and diagnostic application the adopted model training approach allows for a diagnostic comparison of the existing channel geometry and the appropriate regime stream power equation 10 to the stream power currently dissipated in the channel during a two year return period discharge event equation 9 a calibration plot showing the specific stream power model predictions plotted against observed regime stream power calculated using equation 9 and data from the database is shown on fig 1 the figure illustrates model performance against observed data a log log plot was used to compress the data and illustrate the model agreement with observed data to recognize the significant natural variation in observed channel geometry the modelled regime specific stream power model shows good agreement over the whole range of observed data the gmdh model equation 10 had an r2 value of 0 77 and rmse of 47 46 for the model training dataset 2 3 of the data and an r2 of 0 80 and rmse of 55 20 for the model testing dataset 1 3 of the data as described above initial attempts to model individual regime stream geometry variables provided reasonable predictions still they failed to explain the observed variability of the parameters adequately to use the models to identify regime conditions in urbanizing watersheds consideration of the hydrological erosive and depositional processes that typically shape stream corridors allows channel variables to be ordered from those most likely to be modified first after a disturbance to those most resistant to change on the time scale of typical interest to managers of watercourses and related infrastructure as discussed in the following sections 5 2 effects of urbanization on flow distribution of the considered stream variables we consider discharge q2 to be an independent variable concerning channel processes and as the first variable expected to be modified as a result of changing land use in an urbanizing watershed the two year return period discharge q2 has been shown to increase due to hardening of watershed surfaces and increases in peak event runoff sheng and wilson 2009 bledsoe and watson 2001 and is an important indicator of flow distribution many previous models of regime channel geometry were primarily a function of discharge e g simons and albertson 1963 kellerhals 1967 hey and thorne 1986 of the dependent and interdependent channel variables s w h and d50 w and d50 would typically be expected to adjust first in response to a change in q2 hawley et al 2012 hawley and bledsoe 2013 in contrast downcutting to adjust h is likely to be limited in many ontario settings with low channel slopes and frequent hard points associated with crossings kaless et al 2014 weichert et al 2009 discuss the differing temporal scales at which each of these channel variables are adjusted in alluvial channels alluvial bed materials on the bed are likely to afford more protection against erosion to the bed than the bank materials the d50 of alluvial materials would initially be expected to coarsen with increases in q2 hawley et al 2013 kaless et al 2014 still the underlying bed materials may become exposed with further or sustained increases in q2 in the absence of a replacement source for alluvial bed material which is often lacking in hardened urban watersheds safari et al 2019 russell et al 2016 as noted by thayer et al 2016 and thayer 2017 s is often viewed as a dependent variable on geological time scales still models treating it as an independent variable tend to outperform models that treat it as a dependent variable thayer et al 2016 and thayer 2017 attribute this finding to slope being the variable most constrained by the geomorphological setting through which the channel passes and that many rivers may not have the stream power to readily and continuously adjust channel slope to allow a more detailed assessment of the interaction between channel variables and in particular the interaction between q and channel geometry variables the data analysis focused on the development of a regime specific stream power model given the often limited range of variables available in published data of regime channel morphology substrate grain size d50 serves two functions in model development it serves as an indicator of substrate resistance to erosion as well as a simple quantification of flow resistance which in turn affects depth for any given flow hawley 2018 since flow resistance is complex chow 1959 and affected by form roughness schippa et al 2019 planform and substrate grain size yen 2002 kaless et al 2014 its importance to regime models is likely variable depending on setting because of the limited number of measured variables available for each channel in the regime database a simplifying assumption was made that the channel cross sections represented in the database are rectangular this assumption is likely to result in a slight overestimate of the actual cross sectional area of flow and a corresponding small underestimate of the mean cross section velocity these introduced errors are expected to be minor especially for moderate to large rivers and may somewhat bias the modelled specific stream power downwards however this bias is not expected to affect the overall shape of the specific stream power model the large dataset used to develop the current model results in a useful additional analysis method for use in stream channel stability assessments a discussion of the example application of the new models is provided in the following section 6 showcasing model application the regime model for specific stream power developed in this study may be used as a tool for assessing the relative stability of a river channel with knowledge of the existing channel geometry expected flow frequency and substrate material composition but should be validated with local data if used outside the southern ontario study area the following text describes the procedure used to evaluate the stability of several existing river channels in southern ontario based on regime specific stream power fig 1 shows the developed model for regime specific stream power as well as upper and lower bounds used to identify outliers the upper and lower bounds are defined based on two standard deviations of residual errors between observed points and the model prediction during the two year return period flow event the observed specific stream power is plotted against the modelled regime specific stream power based on channel geometry and substrate size for each of the assessed southern ontario case studies red diamond symbols as shown in fig 1 several case study creeks fall very close to or within the upper and lower bounds around the regime specific stream power model these creeks spencer creek at dundas schomberg river near schomberg pefferlaw brook near udora beaver river at beaverton are deemed to be within regime based on this assessment conversely several case study creeks plot outside the upper and lower bounds and are considered to be outliers because of their disagreement with the modelled regime specific stream power the latter creeks highland creek near west hill black creek near weston redhill creek at hamilton etobicoke creek below qew are deemed to be out of regime based on this assessment the holland river east branch plots outside the confidence limits but closer to the modelled regime conditions than the other out of regime case studies the holland river east branch requires further investigation however it is feasible that careful management of urban development and stormwater controls could halt the progression of urban impacts to this river and potentially allow it to return to regime conditions in time a summary of the watershed characteristics flow conditions and existing channel geometry for each case study creeks is presented in table 2 catchment areas contributing to the assessment location on each of the case study creeks are shown on fig 2 supporting data were sourced from water survey of canada wsc records using the ontario flow assessment tool ofat gazendam et al 2016 and field measurements completed by the current study team in 2018 and 2019 in some cases the channel data available from previous studies did not include all the variables required to model regime conditions or complete the comparison of specific stream power at the form determining flow in such cases the missing data were infilled from other available sources including google earth path and elevation profile tools and a generic logarithmic relationship between the 85th percentile and 50th percentile river substrate grain size developed from data summarized by milukow et al 2019 6 1 out of regime case study creeks the following sections provide a brief overview of the case study creeks found to be out of regime based on the regime specific stream power model 6 1 1 red hill creek the red hill creek has a watershed area of 68 km2 and discharges into the western end of lake ontario via hamilton harbour burlington bay the red hill creek watershed is undergoing significant land use change associated with urbanization as hamilton is developed towards the east above and below the niagara escarpment the lower reaches of red hill creek at hamilton harbour have been dredged multiple times due to significant sediment accumulation from erosion of the channel upstream water regime investigations and simulations ltd 2002 6 1 2 highland creek highland creek is located within the greater toronto area gta near west hill scarborough ontario the creek descends the bluffs and flows into lake ontario this watercourse has experienced significant urbanization over the last 50 years and required routine work to address substantial instream erosion and risk to adjacent land uses all reaches within the highland creek watershed were out of regime and particularly stressed towards the lower reaches toronto and region conservation authority 2012 toronto and region conservation 2008 6 1 3 black creek black creek near weston drains a significantly urbanized area in the northwest part of toronto and contributes to the humber river before the latter flows to lake ontario many historic tributaries have been eliminated or lined channelized due to urban development they have resulted in larger and wider headwater channels than other watercourses with similar drainage areas in the region black creek is unstable and adjusting due to an increase in surface runoff from impervious surfaces associated with urban development toronto and region conservation 2008 6 2 etobickoke creek etobicoke creek is located between humber river and credit river watersheds it flows from its source near cheltenham in caledon township at an approximate elevation of 300 m asl to the mouth in southeastern mississauga at lake ontario at approximately 74 m asl the creek flows about 78 km from caledon through brampton peel etobicoke and mississauga to lake ontario and includes a significant floodway diversion bypassing downtown brampton watershed conditions range from rural agricultural near the headwaters to highly urbanized through the middle and lower watershed 6 2 1 in regime case study creeks by contrast spencer creek schomberg river beaver river and pefferlaw brook fig 1 are examples of channels that were found to be in regime using the methods described above beaver river is lake simcoe s eastern most subwatershed this subwatershed is largely undeveloped or used for pasture few issues were identified with the fluvial geomorphology in this subwatershed the reaches were all classified to be in regime or transitioning phase lake simcoe region conservation authority

river and uxbridge brook pefferlaw river subwatershed are located almost entirely in the region of durham and flow into the east of lake simcoe the pefferlaw river subwatershed is primarily agricultural with some recent urbanization land use changes have not significantly affected the pefferlaw river subwatershed and all reaches were found to be either in regime or transitioning lake

schomberg river schomberg river flows from a primarily agricultural catchment with some recent urban development in the town of schomberg moe 1985 completed a streambank erosion inventory supporting the lake simcoe environmental management strategy and found only one instance of natural bank erosion in schomberg creek holland river tributary d 7 conclusions in this study a large global database of 733 regime channel geometry was compiled from previous publications by church and rood 1983 ackert 2000 mnr and watershed science centre 2001 afzalimehr et al 2010 and chitale 1970 1973 the database was used to develop a regime channel model of specific stream power using machine learning techniques that reproduced the observations in the database well and accounted for natural variability this study identified specific stream power as a reliable early detection metric for the urban stream syndrome whereas previous regime channel models have focussed on the width depth median sediment particle size and slope however due to natural resilience of river channels and their resistance to perturbations comparing observed channel variables to regime channel models for width depth or slope is informative but not always conclusive in identifying unstable channel conditions previous regime models of channel geometry may fail to reliably identify channels that are experiencing the early impacts of urbanization as it would take decades for the bed and bank erosion and scour processes to reshape the channel to a new regime width depth and slope kaless et al 2014 weichert et al 2009 however this study showed that specific stream power is the clear indicator variable that is immediately and dramatically impacted by urbanization the regime specific stream power model was found to be a valuable tool for early detection of the urban stream syndrome in the study streams the application of the new model was showcased by quantitatively assessing the specific stream power of several channels in southern ontario known to be both within and out of regime conditions and comparing them to expected regime specific stream power the case studies demonstrated that the new model could reliably identify both the stable regime channels as well as channels that have been impacted by the urban syndrome including the redhill creek highland creek black creek etobicoke creek in southern ontario one further channel the holland river east branch was found to be in a state of transition with the observed specific stream power somewhat above the range of expected regime specific stream power the development of the new regime channel model using specific stream power provides a reliable early detection tool for the urban stream syndrome to allow the municipalities in the southern ontario study area to develop timely channel stability assessment and rehabilitation strategy for the degrading river channels based on the size and geographic distribution of the channel data included in the constructed database it is likely that the model may be used in other study areas however it should be validated with local data prior to use in design credit authorship

3813,unmitigated urbanization frequently alters the flow frequency distribution and changes the source and transport rates of sediments in previously in regime channels these changes may result in increased stream erosion changes in alluvial materials and degradation of water quality and habitat conditions called urban stream syndrome early identification of streams with the potential to develop urban stream syndrome may allow for additional implementation of watershed controls such as low impact development or within stream mitigation e g erosion controls regime theory applied to dynamically stable alluvial channels has identified empirical equations linking width w depth h slope s mean sediment particle size d50 and the 2 yr return bankfull discharge q2 this study examines the application of regime theory equations to urban streams as a means of identifying channels with urban stream syndrome to begin the assessment of the applicability of regime equations an extensive database of channel morphology variables for 733 in regime channels from north america britain and south asia was compiled from existing publications using this database a group method of data handling gmdh model was developed to predict specific stream power for comparison with observed values to determine whether a channel is in or out of regime the application of the gmdh model was showcased using regional flow and sediment data to predict channel conditions of several watercourses in southern ontario canada the gmdh model reliably identified channels both in and out of regime

transport into and out of the regime reach is approximately equal over time the use of the regime channel concept to evaluate the stability of streams in urbanizing watersheds is explored in this study regime conditions refer to a dynamically stable state of existence of a watercourse for which the rate of energy expenditure approaches a minimum and the rate of sediment transport into and out of the regime reach is approximately equal over time a detailed discussion of regime channel concepts is described in lacey 1929 eaton et al 2004 and da silva and yalin 2017 to achieve regime conditions the watercourse must adjust its width depth and slope through processes of erosion and deposition the effective slope of a river may be defined as the actual slope of the river channel at any location rather than the corridor it flows within a river may adjust its effective slope by adjusting its planform by meandering in mild to moderately sloped valleys or by establishing riffles or drop structures in moderately to steeply sloped valleys urban stream syndrome walsh et al 2005 describes the effects of significant and unmitigated urbanization on stream systems the common symptoms include change in flow regime erosion and sedimentation and associated impact on pollutant loading and habitat health bonakdari et al 2020 bonakdari et al 2019 the hypothesis of this study is that appropriately developed regime conditions modelling may be used to identify the need for and type of mitigation required to effectively manage urban stream syndrome in watercourses contributing to inland waterbodies such as lake simcoe in southern ontario canada in this study a database of key channel morphology variables is constructed using published data from previous studies as described in the following sections the group method of data handling gmdh is used to analyze the channel morphology data and develop a regime channel model based on specific stream power to manage urbanizing stream systems gholami et al 2017 2019a b kazemian kale kale et al 2018 2020 2 background regime channels are often viewed as analogues to be mimicked in channel design in order to impart stability to the constructed channel streams in undisturbed watersheds and experiencing unchanged hydrology are typically dynamically stable or in regime ministry of the environment 2003 the sediment movement and sediment strength are in balance with the shear stress and stream slope affected by topographic slope and sinuosity stream flow rate and channel width finnegan et al 2007 stream stability is typically evaluated by observing geomorphic indices such as those included in the rapid geomorphic assessment rga toronto and region conservation authority 2012 or the qualitative habitat evaluation index a method to quantify the physical aquatic habitat components important to fish qhei rankin 1995 gazendam 2016 the altered hydrology and reduction in watershed sediment supply in urbanized streams often result in streams becoming sediment starved and out of balance kondolf 1997 church and rood 1983 credit valley conservation 2011 sediment starved water flowing from urbanized reaches to relatively undeveloped reaches lower in the watershed often results in instability in the lower reaches kondolf et al 2014 regime channel concepts have been used successfully in many applications but may not always be appropriate in the face of altered hydrologic flow regimes resulting from urbanization or climate change many researchers have developed empirical equations relating width depth and slope of stable channels to flow resistance and sediment transportation equations leopold et al 1964 and leopold and maddock 1953 were among the first authors to recognize the relative consistency of natural channel form and quantify channel geometric relationships these studies on stable channel geometry and its dominant parameters indicate that the flow or discharge q and median bed sediment size d50 play key roles in forming stable channel dimensions bray 1982 cao and knight 1996 hey and thorne 1986 kellerhals 1967 savenije 2003 afzalimehr et al 2009 2010 introduced the shields parameter τ as an influential factor in identifying channel stability that had been neglected in previous efforts of stable channel design they found that τ has a significant impact on the depth and especially slope prediction accuracy the sediment transport rate which is one of the critical factors in the channel s stability can be expressed as a function of the shields parameter knighton 1974 also notes that the downstream rate of width increase is principally a function of discharge while its at a station rate of change is largely controlled by bank material composition julien and wargadalam 1995 further developed theoretical regime channel relationships based on the solution of a set of four governing equations for discharge rate resistance to flow secondary flow and particle mobility the applicability of these empirical equations is typically limited by the setting size and range of the dataset used to develop the relationships gholami et al 2017 hawley 2018 shaghaghi et al 2019 shaghaghi et al 2018 eaton et al 2004 were one of the first studies that used non dimensional alluvial state space to develop scale independent rational regime models of alluvial channel morphology and response their model defines a dimensionless alluvial state space characterized by aspect ratio w h relative roughness d h and shields parameter τ or equivalently channel slope s in addition to these parameters huang and chang 2006 identified a dimensionless number defined as the ratio of the relative increment of shear stress to the increment of width depth ratio which they suggest needs to be adopted as a criterion of hydraulic similitude for modelling sediment bed load transport in alluvial channels bertoldi et al 2009 identified vegetation influence as a function of flow rate and river stage suggesting that vegetation may constrain the development of regime conditions while allmendinger et al 2005 and hession et al 2003 investigated the effects of different vegetation types on channel morphology finally eaton and millar 2017 emphasized setting based constraints on regime channel development as included in the ubc regime model ubcrm that constrain predictions of stable channel configuration using bank and pattern stability criteria 2 1 stream power stream power is the energy expended by flowing water per unit of time and was initially proposed as an essential metric for sediment transport by bagnold 1960 yang 1977 and yang and stall 1974 lammers and bledsoe 2018a b provided further analysis of sediment transport as a function of stream power and introduced the stream power per unit weight of flowing water stream power has also been used successfully to model geomorphic channel evolution yochum et al 2017 lammers and bledsoe 2018b however recent attempts to analyze regime conditions are often limited by regional and seasonal stream power training data callow and smettem 2007 dade and friend 1998 kaushal et al 2020 khan and fryirs 2020 li et al 2016 swarnkar et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 as discussed by rhoads 1987 many early researchers of stream power adopted different methods of normalizing stream flow and different terminology to describe each expression of particular interest is the use of unit stream power which yang 1979 described as the stream power per unit weight of water while many subsequent researchers use either unit stream power or specific stream power to describe the stream power dissipated per unit area of channel boundary in the current study we use the specific stream power after bagnold 1960 and petit et al 2005 3 objectives the objectives of this study are to construct a database of surveyed stable channel variables from existing published sources use machine learning to develop an empirical regime channel model which is readily applicable to assessing the stability of streams in urbanizing watersheds use the developed regime channel model to assess the stability of watercourses known to be both stable or in regime and with histories of disturbance in southern ontario canada 4 methods a database of channel morphology variables including width w depth h flow q2 bed material median particle diameter d50 and slope s for 733 regime channels was constructed from existing published sources the sources included 368 channels from church and rood 1983 253 channels from ackert 2000 37 channels from mnr and watershed science centre 2001 50 channels from afzalimehr et al 2010 and 78 channels from chitale 1970 1973 of the 78 channels included in chitale 1970 1973 53 did not include bed sediment grain size and were not used for model development approximately 90 of the church and rood 1983 dataset represented rivers from the western part of north america approximately 40 from canada and 50 from the united states of america and approximately 10 from british rivers the ackert 2000 data were collected in southwestern ontario canada the mnr and watershed science centre 2001 data were collected in southern ontario while afzalimehr et al 2010 collected their data in iran and chitale 1970 1973 collected his data primarily in india and the united states of america with some data from pakistan cambodia and western canada in addition to the 733 regime channels adopted into the database approximately 80 channels were not included because they were recorded with adverse slope conditions negative shear stress or they were suspected to include data entry errors a summary of the range and median values for w h q2 d50 and s is presented in table 1 4 1 group method of data handling gmdh the relationships between width depth slope and sediment size of a regime channel represent a complex multivariate system which is subject to local random variability and cannot be readily modelled theoretically to any significant degree of precision using the typically limited number of available input variables and theoretical modelling approaches xu et al 2020 eaton et al 2004 and da silva and yalin 2017 discuss the requirements for theoretically based models of regime conditions however the level of detail included in the assembled database of regime channels did not support the development of calibrated theoretical models for this study machine learning using gmdh was selected for use in this study and has been used previously to predict channel enlargement e g sengupta et al 2018 gmdh is a type of artificial neural network ann modelling approach that can be used to assess real world cases where there is no or incomplete theoretical experience regarding the association between the input variables and the outcome ebtehaj et al 2015 2016 gholami et al 2017 ivakhnenko and ivakhnenko 1995 schmidhuber 2015 shaghaghi et al 2017 2018 stajkowski et al 2021 initial modelling efforts explored the use other ann and gene expression programming ebtehaj et al 2019 langridge et al 2020 tabrizi et al 2021 but gmdh was ultimately selected for use in this study because it performed better than other ann models and converged faster than the initial gep model attempts using gmdh the modelled variable y for input vectors x1 x2 x3 xn with m observations i 1 2 3 m can be defined as follows 1 y i f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n gmdh was trained using two thirds of the dataset to estimate the outcome value y for given input variables as follows 2 y i f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n the objective function used for gmdh training was to minimize the square difference between the actual outcome y observed and the estimated y as follows 3 m i n i 1 m f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n f x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x i n 2 the gmdh algorithm constructs progressively higher order polynomials generically known as the volterra functional series as follows 4 y a 0 i 1 m a i x i i 1 m j 1 m a ij x i x j i 1 m j 1 m k 1 m a ijk x i x j x k the gmdh algorithm decomposes the volterra function series into quadratic binomials a simplified description of the quadratic binomials using two variables neurons may be expressed as shown in equation 5 5 y i f x i x j a 0 a 1 x i a 2 x j a 3 x i 2 a 4 x j 2 a 5 x i x j the regression polynomial expressed in equation 5 accounts for all possible polynomial functions of two independent variables and is used to find the best fit between the m observed values and the model estimates using the objective function equation 3 further descriptions of the gmdh methods are presented in gholami et al 2017 azimi et al 2018 and ebtehaj et al 2018 4 2 the goodness of fit criteria statistical indices used to evaluate the verification of the new gmdh models for regime channel conditions and previous traditional models are described below the coefficient of correlation r root mean square error rmse and the nash suttcliffe efficiency nse coefficient were

theoretical range of r is from 1 0 to 1 0 with values of 1 0 and 1 0 indicating that the data are perfectly negatively or positively linearly correlated respectively an r value of zero indicates that the data are not linearly correlated rmse is the standard deviation of the residual errors between the observed data and the model results it can assume values 0 with 0 indicating perfect agreement between the observed data and model results nse has a theoretical range from to 1 0 with values less than zero indicating that the mean of the observed data provides a better estimate than the model and a value of 1 0 indicating perfect agreement between the observed data and model results useful models typically have an nse value between 0 5 and 1 0 4 3 model development as a first step gmdh modelling was used to develop models of regime width and depth the resulting models produced useable relationships similar in form to previously published regime equations however the results failed to adequately explain the variability observed in the dataset and as a result the models were ineffective in distinguishing in regime channels from those out of regime to reduce uncertainty and scatter in the modelling the analysis was extended to include assessing stream power as a parameter for assessing regime conditions in urbanizing watersheds building from the geographical information system gis based stream power assessment methodology presented in vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 the current study focused on specific stream power for development of a regime channel model better suited to address the objective of developing an empirical regime channel model for assessing the stability of streams in urbanizing watersheds vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 focused on total stream power ω for assessment of erosion risk which avoids the need to accurately represent channel width and is appropriate for channels that are either within regime conditions or not for the identification of regime conditions width is an important variable typically adjusted by the river to achieve regime conditions the current study focused on specific stream power ω as shown in equation 9 9 ω γ q s w where ω is the specific stream power w m2 γ is the unit weight of water n m3 q is the discharge assumed in this study to be equal to the 2 year return period peak flow q2 m3 s s is the channel slope m m and w is the bankfull width m to develop the gmdh model the dataset was randomly divided into three two thirds of the data were used to train the gmdh model while the remaining third was used to verify the model performance the gmdh shell package was used to train and verify the model and the resulting model and verification statistics are provided in the results and discussion section 5 results and discussion a database of 733 previously published stream geometry observations was constructed from the historic datasets summarized in table 1 the data were used to develop a regime specific stream power model that identifies specific stream power during the q2 event that is appropriate for the regime channel slope s width w depth h and sediment size d50 the regime specific stream power model is shown in equation 10 the model is a complex function of w h s and d50 10 ω f d 50 s h w full representation of the regime specific stream power model and its sub functions is presented in box 1 following the text box 1 includes the regime specific stream power function in the top line followed by forty four 44 sub functions capturing each input variable s influence d50 s h w and their inter dependence while discharge data q were available in the regime channel database they were omitted from the regime specific stream power model training and verification datasets to avoid biasing the model performance as stream power is highly dependent on discharge 5 1 specific stream power model performance and diagnostic application the adopted model training approach allows for a diagnostic comparison of the existing channel geometry and the appropriate regime stream power equation 10 to the stream power currently dissipated in the channel during a two year return period discharge event equation 9 a calibration plot showing the specific stream power model predictions plotted against observed regime stream power calculated using equation 9 and data from the database is shown on fig 1 the figure illustrates model performance against observed data a log log plot was used to compress the data and illustrate the model agreement with observed data to recognize the significant natural variation in observed channel geometry the modelled regime specific stream power model shows good agreement over the whole range of observed data the gmdh model equation 10 had an r2 value of 0 77 and rmse of 47 46 for the model training dataset 2 3 of the data and an r2 of 0 80 and rmse of 55 20 for the model testing dataset 1 3 of the data as described above initial attempts to model individual regime stream geometry variables provided reasonable predictions still they failed to explain the observed variability of the parameters adequately to use the models to identify regime conditions in urbanizing watersheds consideration of the hydrological erosive and depositional processes that typically shape stream corridors allows channel variables to be ordered from those most likely to be modified first after a disturbance to those most resistant to change on the time scale of typical interest to managers of watercourses and related infrastructure as discussed in the following sections 5 2 effects of urbanization on flow distribution of the considered stream variables we consider discharge q2 to be an independent variable concerning channel processes and as the first variable expected to be modified as a result of changing land use in an urbanizing watershed the two year return period discharge q2 has been shown to increase due to hardening of watershed surfaces and increases in peak event runoff sheng and wilson 2009 bledsoe and watson 2001 and is an important indicator of flow distribution many previous models of regime channel geometry were primarily a function of discharge e g simons and albertson 1963 kellerhals 1967 hey and thorne 1986 of the dependent and interdependent channel variables s w h and d50 w and d50 would typically be expected to adjust first in response to a change in q2 hawley et al 2012 hawley and bledsoe 2013 in contrast downcutting to adjust h is likely to be limited in many ontario settings with low channel slopes and frequent hard points associated with crossings kaless et al 2014 weichert et al 2009 discuss the differing temporal scales at which each of these channel variables are adjusted in alluvial channels alluvial bed materials on the bed are likely to afford more protection against erosion to the bed than the bank materials the d50 of alluvial materials would initially be expected to coarsen with increases in q2 hawley et al 2013 kaless et al 2014 still the underlying bed materials may become exposed with further or sustained increases in q2 in the absence of a replacement source for alluvial bed material which is often lacking in hardened urban watersheds safari et al 2019 russell et al 2016 as noted by thayer et al 2016 and thayer 2017 s is often viewed as a dependent variable on geological time scales still models treating it as an independent variable tend to outperform models that treat it as a dependent variable thayer et al 2016 and thayer 2017 attribute this finding to slope being the variable most constrained by the geomorphological setting through which the channel passes and that many rivers may not have the stream power to readily and continuously adjust channel slope to allow a more detailed assessment of the interaction between channel variables and in particular the interaction between q and channel geometry variables the data analysis focused on the development of a regime specific stream power model given the often limited range of variables available in published data of regime channel morphology substrate grain size d50 serves two functions in model development it serves as an indicator of substrate resistance to erosion as well as a simple quantification of flow resistance which in turn affects depth for any given flow hawley 2018 since flow resistance is complex chow 1959 and affected by form roughness schippa et al 2019 planform and substrate grain size yen 2002 kaless et al 2014 its importance to regime models is likely variable depending on setting because of the limited number of measured variables available for each channel in the regime database a simplifying assumption was made that the channel cross sections represented in the database are rectangular this assumption is likely to result in a slight overestimate of the actual cross sectional area of flow and a corresponding small underestimate of the mean cross section velocity these introduced errors are expected to be minor especially for moderate to large rivers and may somewhat bias the modelled specific stream power downwards however this bias is not expected to affect the overall shape of the specific stream power model the large dataset used to develop the current model results in a useful additional analysis method for use in stream channel stability assessments a discussion of the example application of the new models is provided in the following section 6 showcasing model application the regime model for specific stream power developed in this study may be used as a tool for assessing the relative stability of a river channel with knowledge of the existing channel geometry expected flow frequency and substrate material composition but should be validated with local data if used outside the southern ontario study area the following text describes the procedure used to evaluate the stability of several existing river channels in southern ontario based on regime specific stream power fig 1 shows the developed model for regime specific stream power as well as upper and lower bounds used to identify outliers the upper and lower bounds are defined based on two standard deviations of residual errors between observed points and the model prediction during the two year return period flow event the observed specific stream power is plotted against the modelled regime specific stream power based on channel geometry and substrate size for each of the assessed southern ontario case studies red diamond symbols as shown in fig 1 several case study creeks fall very close to or within the upper and lower bounds around the regime specific stream power model these creeks spencer creek at dundas schomberg river near schomberg pefferlaw brook near udora beaver river at beaverton are deemed to be within regime based on this assessment conversely several case study creeks plot outside the upper and lower bounds and are considered to be outliers because of their disagreement with the modelled regime specific stream power the latter creeks highland creek near west hill black creek near weston redhill creek at hamilton etobicoke creek below qew are deemed to be out of regime based on this assessment the holland river east branch plots outside the confidence limits but closer to the modelled regime conditions than the other out of regime case studies the holland river east branch requires further investigation however it is feasible that careful management of urban development and stormwater controls could halt the progression of urban impacts to this river and potentially allow it to return to regime conditions in time a summary of the watershed characteristics flow conditions and existing channel geometry for each case study creeks is presented in table 2 catchment areas contributing to the assessment location on each of the case study creeks are shown on fig 2 supporting data were sourced from water survey of canada wsc records using the ontario flow assessment tool ofat gazendam et al 2016 and field measurements completed by the current study team in 2018 and 2019 in some cases the channel data available from previous studies did not include all the variables required to model regime conditions or complete the comparison of specific stream power at the form determining flow in such cases the missing data were infilled from other available sources including google earth path and elevation profile tools and a generic logarithmic relationship between the 85th percentile and 50th percentile river substrate grain size developed from data summarized by milukow et al 2019 6 1 out of regime case study creeks the following sections provide a brief overview of the case study creeks found to be out of regime based on the regime specific stream power model 6 1 1 red hill creek the red hill creek has a watershed area of 68 km2 and discharges into the western end of lake ontario via hamilton harbour burlington bay the red hill creek watershed is undergoing significant land use change associated with urbanization as hamilton is developed towards the east above and below the niagara escarpment the lower reaches of red hill creek at hamilton harbour have been dredged multiple times due to significant sediment accumulation from erosion of the channel upstream water regime investigations and simulations ltd 2002 6 1 2 highland creek highland creek is located within the greater toronto area gta near west hill scarborough ontario the creek descends the bluffs and flows into lake ontario this watercourse has experienced significant urbanization over the last 50 years and required routine work to address substantial instream erosion and risk to adjacent land uses all reaches within the highland creek watershed were out of regime and particularly stressed towards the lower reaches toronto and region conservation authority 2012 toronto and region conservation 2008 6 1 3 black creek black creek near weston drains a significantly urbanized area in the northwest part of toronto and contributes to the humber river before the latter flows to lake ontario many historic tributaries have been eliminated or lined channelized due to urban development they have resulted in larger and wider headwater channels than other watercourses with similar drainage areas in the region black creek is unstable and adjusting due to an increase in surface runoff from impervious surfaces associated with urban development toronto and region conservation 2008 6 2 etobickoke creek etobicoke creek is located between humber river and credit river watersheds it flows from its source near cheltenham in caledon township at an approximate elevation of 300 m asl to the mouth in southeastern mississauga at lake ontario at approximately 74 m asl the creek flows about 78 km from caledon through brampton peel etobicoke and mississauga to lake ontario and includes a significant floodway diversion bypassing downtown brampton watershed conditions range from rural agricultural near the headwaters to highly urbanized through the middle and lower watershed 6 2 1 in regime case study creeks by contrast spencer creek schomberg river beaver river and pefferlaw brook fig 1 are examples of channels that were found to be in regime using the methods described above beaver river is lake simcoe s eastern most subwatershed this subwatershed is largely undeveloped or used for pasture few issues were identified with the fluvial geomorphology in this subwatershed the reaches were all classified to be in regime or transitioning phase lake simcoe region conservation authority

river and uxbridge brook pefferlaw river subwatershed are located almost entirely in the region of durham and flow into the east of lake simcoe the pefferlaw river subwatershed is primarily agricultural with some recent urbanization land use changes have not significantly affected the pefferlaw river subwatershed and all reaches were found to be either in regime or transitioning lake

schomberg river schomberg river flows from a primarily agricultural catchment with some recent urban development in the town of schomberg moe 1985 completed a streambank erosion inventory supporting the lake simcoe environmental management strategy and found only one instance of natural bank erosion in schomberg creek holland river tributary d 7 conclusions in this study a large global database of 733 regime channel geometry was compiled from previous publications by church and rood 1983 ackert 2000 mnr and watershed science centre 2001 afzalimehr et al 2010 and chitale 1970 1973 the database was used to develop a regime channel model of specific stream power using machine learning techniques that reproduced the observations in the database well and accounted for natural variability this study identified specific stream power as a reliable early detection metric for the urban stream syndrome whereas previous regime channel models have focussed on the width depth median sediment particle size and slope however due to natural resilience of river channels and their resistance to perturbations comparing observed channel variables to regime channel models for width depth or slope is informative but not always conclusive in identifying unstable channel conditions previous regime models of channel geometry may fail to reliably identify channels that are experiencing the early impacts of urbanization as it would take decades for the bed and bank erosion and scour processes to reshape the channel to a new regime width depth and slope kaless et al 2014 weichert et al 2009 however this study showed that specific stream power is the clear indicator variable that is immediately and dramatically impacted by urbanization the regime specific stream power model was found to be a valuable tool for early detection of the urban stream syndrome in the study streams the application of the new model was showcased by quantitatively assessing the specific stream power of several channels in southern ontario known to be both within and out of regime conditions and comparing them to expected regime specific stream power the case studies demonstrated that the new model could reliably identify both the stable regime channels as well as channels that have been impacted by the urban syndrome including the redhill creek highland creek black creek etobicoke creek in southern ontario one further channel the holland river east branch was found to be in a state of transition with the observed specific stream power somewhat above the range of expected regime specific stream power the development of the new regime channel model using specific stream power provides a reliable early detection tool for the urban stream syndrome to allow the municipalities in the southern ontario study area to develop timely channel stability assessment and rehabilitation strategy for the degrading river channels based on the size and geographic distribution of the channel data included in the constructed database it is likely that the model may be used in other study areas however it should be validated with local data prior to use in design credit authorship

3814,transpiration a key component of the hydrological cycle contributes greatly to the climate system by transferring large amount of water from soils to the atmosphere its correct representation within land surface schemes in climate models is crucial to provide accurate and reliable climate projections in this study transpiration simulated by the canadian land surface scheme class was compared to long term observations of sap flow measurements in two boreal forest sites of eastern canada dominated by balsam fir and black spruce in general class adequately models daily transpiration during the growing season for most of the years at both sites during the tree rehydration period preceding the growing season modeled transpiration was greatly underestimated because of overestimating the duration of the snowpack the latter restricting transpiration moreover class did not capture the impact of extreme events on tree physiology and maintained high transpiration rates during a heat stress and a drought during both observed and simulated drought events transpiration modeled using class was overestimated due to insensitivity to substantial decreases in soil water content modeled transpiration being strictly controlled by atmospheric variables vapour pressure deficit and radiations thus we also proposed and implemented a new equation that was able to increase the sensitivity of class to decreasing soil water content however this equation needs to be further tested on different sites and tree species keywords transpiration class drought rehydration boreal forest land surface scheme 1 introduction evapotranspiration is the combined process of transpiration and evaporation occurring on a vegetation covered land surface as per kramer 1983 transpiration is defined as the loss of water in the form of vapour from plants ward and trimble 2004 while evaporation is the loss of water from the soil surface and vegetation canopy following interception of water from precipitation the partitioning of evapotranspiration into soil evaporation canopy evaporation and tree transpiration over a land surface depends on the type of vegetation baldocchi et al 2004 and percentage of vegetation cover wang et al 2010 studies have shown transpiration to vary from 48 to 52 soil evaporation from 15 to 36 and canopy evaporation from 16 to 20 of the total evapotranspiration of land surfaces on a global scale using process based models choudhury and digirolamo 1998 choudhury et al 1998 dirmeyer et al 2005 in a boreal forest evaporation from the canopy and the forest floor were respectively 20 and 15 of the total forest evapotranspiration while tree transpiration accounted for 65 grelle et al 1997 transpiration is a function of many environmental factors such as solar radiation vapour pressure deficit air temperature and soil water bovard et al 2005 gartner et al 2009 lagergren and lindroth 2002 wang et al 2017 wullschleger et al 2000 transpiration can be measured via different approaches or modeled at regional to global scales with land surface models seneviratne et al 2010 land surface models also known as land surface schemes lsss exist in three generations among them only the 2nd dickinson et al 1986 sellers et al 1986 and 3rd generations collatz et al 1991 have a vegetation layer that enables the simulation of transpiration the 2nd generation lsss compute stomatal conductance based on the jarvis 1976 formulation where it is controlled by environmental stresses such as solar radiation humidity air temperature and soil water potential however the individual functions of these environmental stresses including the soil water stress function vary among the various lsss furthermore a hydraulic redistribution scheme is incorporated in some 2nd generation lss e g community land model version 4 5 in order to improve the simulation of evapotranspiration especially during dry seasons fu et al

verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 on the other hand 3rd generation lsss have a biochemical approach and are more complex in their input data requirements as they use a semi mechanistic photosynthesis model to compute stomatal conductance the latter is controlled by the net assimilation rate partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the leaf surface and relative humidity vapour pressure deficit in turn gross primary productivity is controlled by canopy photosynthesis canopy respiration and a moisture limiting factor soil water stress function pitman 2003 since stomatal conductance and photosynthesis are coupled the moisture limiting factor has an impact on stomatal conductance as well however the moisture limiting factor is calculated differently in all the existing 3rd generation lsss arora 2003 some examples of 3rd generation lsss are coupled class canadian terrestrial ecosystem model ctem arora 2003 the joint uk land environment simulator jules best et al 2011 and community land model clm oleson et al 2013 lsss have been used in many modeling studies to simulate evapotranspiration this includes for example the simple biosphere model lei et al 2011 the community land model gayler et al

al 2016 or multiple land surface schemes chen et al 2013 grippa et al 2011 ukkola et al 2016b while transpiration is an important component of the hydrological cycle it also has a crucial role in regulating climate as it is the largest continental water flux jasechko 2018 supported by both observations and modelling studies bala et al 2007 seneviratne et al 2012 swann et al 2010 baudena et al 2021 modelling studies of complete deforestation or conversion to grassland of the amazon forests using a general circulation model or earth system model have shown a decrease in evapotranspiration and an increase in surface temperature brovkin et al 2009 dickinson and henderson sellers 1988 garratt 1993 in temperate forests excessive evapotranspiration was identified as the cause of the extreme 2003 drought in europe seneviratne et al 2012 among all biomes the boreal forest has the most important biogeophysical impact on global mean annual temperature bonan 2008 its expansion towards the arctic for instance would increase air temperature bonan 2008 via increased transpiration swann et al 2010 and decreased surface albedo betts 2000 though increased evaporation transpiration has a cooling effect on the surface of the ground canopy the increase in water molecules in the atmosphere caused by increased transpiration absorbs long wave radiation and thus increases the atmospheric air temperature swann et al 2010 in this study since the focus is on transpiration instead of photosynthesis the 2nd generation lss class version 3 6 is used instead of the class ctem version the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 developed by the canadian climate centre is an lss that was specifically designed to be used within the canadian regional climate model crcm zadra et al 2008 brochu and laprise 2007 showed that simulated summer evapotranspiration in the crcm was greatly improved when class was used instead of the simple manabe bucket model 1st generation lss manabe 1969 emphasizing the importance of proper representation of transpiration within lsss to date a few studies have used class to quantitatively assess how it simulates evapotranspiration from forests these were conducted on a daily basis in the boreal forest in saskatchewan wang et al 2002 manitoba bartlett et al 2003 and quebec isabelle et al 2018 in temperate forests in british columbia yuan et al 2007 and ontario huang et al 2011 and in a sub alpine forest in western canada macdonald et al 2016 all of these studies used observations based on eddy covariance measurements to validate their findings none of these studies have however focused on the temporal evolution of simulated transpiration compared to observations of daily transpiration derived from sap flow velocity data measured on a daily time scale in various conditions while sap flow and eddy covariance techniques are comparable qualitatively eddy covariance techniques measure evapotranspiration over a large footprint area that varies with time making measurements highly unstable hogg et al 1997 wilson et al 2001 moreover the eddy covariance technique is applicable only in homogenous and flat terrain and is subject to errors when interpreting results during times of low turbulence wilson et al 2001 on the other hand sap flow techniques allow for the assessment of environmental and physiological controls on transpiration at the tree level and are considered more stable due to the fixed location of the sensor in the tree hogg et al 1997 furthermore sap flow techniques enable the study of intra and inter specific differences in tree transpiration even in heterogeneous and complex terrain where edaphic and microclimatic variation is greater wilson et al 2001 however the signal reading of sap flow probes installed in the same trees for multiple years will lead to some dampening of the signal from the second year of measurement onwards due to wounding and recovery effects peters et al 2018 while re installation of the sap flow probes every year will avoid signal dampening this may lead to problems of circumferential variability peters et al 2018 in addition complex extrapolations will be required in cases where sap flow measurements have to be up scaled from the tree to the model grid level in our study the temporal evolution of transpiration modeled by class is evaluated using sap flow velocity data the latter was measured in two tree species namely balsam fir and black spruce which are the most important conifers in the boreal forest region of central and eastern canada sap flow was measured over multiple growing seasons 10 for balsam fir and 4 for black spruce allowing us to validate the class model in many contrasting environmental conditions the period prior to the growing season is important for tree species in the boreal region as winter dehydrated trees must recharge during spring prior to the onset of tree growth turcotte et al 2009 however the mechanism of tree water uptake during this period is not well known important questions also remain regarding how trees regulate water uptake during droughts isohydric tree species normally reduce or even stop their transpiration as soil water decreases but anisohydric trees maintain transpiration rates during dry periods in this study we evaluate how well class represents tree transpiration during normal conditions during the rehydration period and during drought 2 materials methods 2 1 description of study area the two studied sites are in a balsam fir forest 47 19 41 n and 71 07 37 w and a black spruce forest 49 12 45 n and 73 39 00 w located in the province of quebec in canada their elevations are 771 864 m and 400 450 m above sea level respectively the mean annual temperature is 1 3 c at both the balsam fir and black spruce sites for the period from 2001 to 2016 mean annual precipitation is 1300 mm at the balsam fir site and 941 mm at the black spruce site for the period 2001 to 2016 the vegetation rests on precambrian charnockitic gneiss covered by loamy sand to sandy loam till at both sites approximately 32 2 7 4 and 29 3 4 7 balsam fir and black spruce sites of the annual precipitation is in the form of snow if we consider only the volume of precipitation when the air temperature is below the freezing point the ground is covered with snow on average about 193 19 and 183 10 days per year with mean maximum yearly snow of 0 95 0 25 m and 0 87 0 16 m at the balsam fir and the black spruce site respectively 2 2 measured

top of a straight tubular tower 11 m high at the balsam fir site and 8 5 m high at the black spruce site photosynthetically active radiation li190sb campbell scientific logan ut measured at a height

black spruce site air temperature within the canopy was measured by a shield protected temperature probe dc95f232v amphenol thermometrics st marys pa placed in the top quarter portion of the canopy of three co dominant trees one probe on each tree approximately 10 m distance between the probes at both sites the depth of snow cover was measured close to the instrumented trees with ultrasonic sensors sr50 type sonic distance sensor campbell scientific inc soil water content cs615 campbell scientific logan ut and soil temperature 401 ysi yellow springs oh were measured daily in 3 and 4 pedons at the black spruce and balsam fir sites respectively in the b horizon 22 cm below the mineral soil surface and c horizon 81 cm below the mineral soil surface both soil water and soil temperature were measured since 1997 at the black spruce site and since 1999 at the balsam fir site the mean values of the pedons were used to characterize both soil water and soil temperature at both study sites sap flow was measured in three co dominant trees of the main tree species two measurements one on the north and the other on the south side for each tree using 30 mm thermal dissipation probes tdp 30 dynamax houston tx instruments were positioned at breast height approximately 1 3 m above ground level trees were instrumented in 2003 for balsam fir and 2006 for black spruce sap flow was measured every 30 min throughout the day and was calculated based on the procedure explained in granier 1987 while only three trees per species were measured in our study there were two measurements per tree two probes per tree on opposite sides to follow sap flow variation around the stem the sap flow both hourly and daily variations data were highly correlated between the sun side and the shade side probes of each tree average r2 0 87 091 and 0 86 0 87 and between trees average r2 0 89 0 96 and 0 88 0 94 for both balsam fir black spruce species refer to tables s2 and s3 found in the supplementary material of oogathoo et al 2020 in this study sapwood area was not measured at either site while sapwood depth is generally assumed to be positively correlated with stem diameter there seems to be no relationship at all between sapwood area and stem diameter for some species ewers et al 2002 thus for this study stand transpiration was not calculated instead the standardized sap flow velocity was used to evaluate the temporal variation of sap flow against standardized modeled transpiration the standardized sap flow velocity and standardized modeled transpiration were obtained by dividing the absolute values by their respective maximum value during the growing season in each year separately sap flow velocity was available from 2004 to 2013 and 2006 to 2009 for balsam fir and for black spruce respectively and thus these long term observations were used to evaluate the performance of class for transpiration stem diameter variation was also measured at both sites in the same three trees with electronic strain gauge dendrometers dex70 dynamax inc houston tx these measurements were used to define rehydration periods and growing season further information on forest stand characteristics at both sites are presented in oogathoo et al 2020 2 3 canadian land surface scheme class class enables the exchange of water and energy with the atmospheric component of the crcm it models the hydrological cycle in a one dimensional column at a time step of 30 mins the model is comprised of a vegetation layer a snow layer of variable depth and multiple soil layers with varying thicknesses the vegetation in the model is grouped into four categories broadleaf conifer crops and grass each model grid is divided into four sub grids based on land cover types which are 1 bare soil 2 soil covered with snow 3 soil covered with vegetation 4 and vegetation over snow covered soil the energy and mass balances are calculated for each sub grid and composite energy and mass balance are determined for each grid using a weighted average based on the area occupied by each land cover type verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 2 3 1 mathematical representation of transpiration within class latent heat and sensible heat fluxes are determined based on gradient turbulent diffusion theory transpiration is calculated for each vegetation type where canopy is treated as a single big leaf with

saturation specific humidity at effective canopy temperature t c ra is aerodynamic resistance and rc is canopy resistance 1 q e c d r y l v ρ a q a q sat t c r a r c modeled transpiration occurs when water is present in the soil layers and it is controlled by the specific humidity deficit aerodynamic resistance and canopy resistance unstressed canopy resistance depends on the minimum stomatal resistance for each vegetation type incoming visible shortwave radiation and leaf area index the stressed canopy resistance rc i is a function of the unstressed canopy resistance rc u i and environmental stresses such as vapour pressure deficit f δe soil water potential f φs as a surrogate for leaf water potential and air temperature f ta as a surrogate for canopy temperature as shown in eqs 2 to 5 cv1 cv2 cφ1 and cφ2 are parameters that depend on vegetation categories composite canopy resistance is the weighted average of canopy resistance of the vegetation categories present in each model grid in the model transpiration ceases under two conditions 1 snow is present beneath the canopy and 2 incoming visible radiation is 2 w m2 whereby in all cases a very high canopy resistance is used in the model however when snow depth is less than 0 1 m in class the percent of snow cover over the model grid is not assigned to 100 thus allowing partial transpiration to occur in the model

properties for most of the parameters default values in the model were used except for certain parameters for which measured values were used table 1 the top layer was configured as a peat layer in order to represent the humus layer that is normally present on forest floors in class the peat layer can be modeled as fibric hemic or sapric based on their hydraulic conductivity letts et al 2000 the type of peat layer has an impact on both soil temperature and soil water in this study the peat layer was considered to be of the fibric type the roughness length was calculated as one tenth of the maximum tree canopy height the aboveground biomass was estimated from destructive sampling in a sample plot 50 m 50 m representative of the watershed as part of a previous study tremblay et al 2012 four pits up to 1 m depth were dug at the balsam fir site in 1998 and at the black spruce site in 1996 where the maximum rooting depth and soil properties were determined from soil samples taken in the different soil horizons ouimet and duchesne 2005 2 4 analyses the performance of the class model for the simulation of transpiration was tested against sap flow velocity of balsam fir and black spruce for the rehydration period and during the growing season the beginning of the growing season for each year was calculated based on dendrometer data while the end was fixed to august 31st the 4 parameter gompertz model was fitted to the daily average dendrometer data from may to september for each year separately the beginning of radial growth was determined when the modeled daily growth was above 5 μm d 1 duchesne et al 2012 the end of the growing season was fixed to august 31 in order to avoid the freeze thaw events that occurred in september for the rehydration period a fixed period of 21 days prior to the onset of the growing season was used to assess modeled transpiration we also tested the model during a short term drought that occurred during july 2012 at the balsam fir site where only 23 mm of rain fell compared to the long term average of 150 mm for this period houle et al 2016 moreover a forced zero precipitation simulation was also carried out in class starting from october 2006 and ending on september 2008 at the balsam fir site to test model behaviour in an extreme situation for comparison between modeled transpiration and sap flow velocity both were standardized by dividing by their maximum values during the growing season for each year separately where the beginning and the end of growing season was calculated based on dendrometer data since standardized values were used instead of absolute values for transpiration and sap flow velocity the performance of all model simulations was evaluated using regression coefficient r2 and slope of the simple linear regression of model simulations versus observations euclidean distance ed and dynamic time warping dtw dtw computes the optimal match between two time series sakoe and chiba 1978 the symmetric form of the dtw was used and the dtw normalized distance was calculated both for ed and dtw the smaller the values are the greater the match between the simulated and observed time series 3 results and discussion 3 1 transpiration during the rehydration period prior to growing season in the boreal forest spring is an important time prior to the growing season where water in the soil is fully replenished from snowmelt keeping the soil much above the permanent wilting point and thus allowing tree rehydration prior to the onset of tree growth turcotte et al 2009 our simulations in class showed that the standardized modeled transpiration trsim underestimated the measured standardized sap flow velocity sfobs during the spring rehydration period at both sites for most years fig 1 i s1 and s2 although r2 values were high and significant in some of the years slopes b values of their respective simple linear regression equations were quite small and far from unity during the rehydration period at both sites except in 2010 at the balsam fir site b 0 96 indicating a poor match between the model simulations and observations table 2 similarly the ed was above one in all years at both sites except for 2010 at the balsam fir site the dtw also indicates poor agreement between simulations and observations except for the rehydration period in balsam fir which was well simulated in 2010 fig 1 ii the only year during which the simulated snowpack disappeared in advance of observations fig 2 indeed the relatively weak performance of the model during the rehydration period is due to its poor simulation of snow cover depth and duration which are generally much greater than observations at both sites fig 2 in class model transpiration ceases when there is snow on the ground based on the assumption that there is no transpiration when air temperature is below 0 c however when the simulated snow depth in the model is less than 0 1 m the model reduces the snow coverage over each model grid into patches of snow that is some portion of the model grid has snow while the rest does not thus allowing transpiration to occur only on the portion of the model grid that has no snow similar to our results macdonald et al 2016 and munro et al 2000 also found the duration of snow cover to be longer in class compared to observations this may be due to higher surface albedo and upward shortwave radiation modeled by class leading to a prolonged presence of snow cover compared to the other snow albedo parameterizations malik et al 2014 suggesting that one possibility to improve the simulation of snow depth in class could be to adjust its surface albedo algorithm while it could be argued that the presence of frozen water in the soil in addition to snow on the ground could contribute to the low transpiration modeled this is not the case as there is still liquid water in the soil our results show that in 2010 trsim was not different from observed values at the balsam fir site despite the presence of simulated soil frozen water prior to the growing season fig 1 ii d 3 2 transpiration during the growing season despite the fact that other studies have used class to quantitatively assess the simulation of transpiration on a daily basis in many ecosystems bartlett et al 2003 huang et al 2011 isabelle et al 2018 macdonald et al 2016 wang et al 2002 yuan et al 2007 none of them have focused on the temporal evolution of transpiration based on sap flow velocity data on a daily time scale as mentioned above sap flow techniques are more stable enabling us to assess not only tree transpiration but also the influence of species environmental and physiological factors on transpiration this is not possible with eddy covariance techniques since they provide measures of evapotranspiration for an entire footprint area hogg et al 1997 wilson et al 2001 in this study during the growing season the temporal evolution of trsim corresponded closely to the sfobs for all years analysed 2006 to 2009 for black spruce and 2004 to 2013 for balsam fir fig 3 s1 and s2 the r2 values were high and the regression was statistically significant during the growing season in most years at both sites with b values being very close to unity which supports a good performance of the model in all years except 2006 with a slope much greater than unity b 1 91 table 3 likewise low ed less than 2 and dtw values below 0 1 in most years at both sites demonstrate the good performance of the model again except in 2006 at the balsam fir site which had highest values 3 16 for ed and 0 161 for dtw the beginning of the growing season in 2007 at the balsam fir site fell outside of the best fit line of the simple linear regression of trsim vs sfobs empty triangle compared to other years at both sites fig 4 this discrepancy at the beginning of the growing season in 2007 is due to snow on the ground in the model that restrained the modeled transpiration as explained above for the rehydration period fig s3 in 2006 at the balsam fir site the model performance was poor with high ed and dtw values while 2006 did not undergo a drought there was a short duration heat stress i e combination of high temperature high relative humidity low precipitation and low wind velocities even without a significant drop in soil water content i e drought stress and tree growth ceased around july 1st which is at least one month earlier than normal duchesne and houle 2011 the observations showed a reduced transpiration rate fig s1 2006 that began around mid june 2006 and ended up to the end of the growing season however modeled transpiration was maintained at high values throughout the 2006 growing season indeed the large discrepancy between simulated and observed transpiration values for the year 2006 is likely due to the fact that class did not capture the impact of the heat stress on tree physiology and transpiration 3 3 transpiration during observed and simulated drought at the balsam fir site 3 3 1 drought of july 2012 in the summer of 2012 there was a drought that began on july 1st and ended on august 4th at the balsam fir site houle et al 2016 the normal average precipitation during this period at this site is about 150 mm but in 2012 it was only 23 mm the low amount of precipitation led to a marked decrease in the soil water content in the horizon b and c fig 5 observed transpiration decreased during the second half of the drought period while simulated transpiration did not leading to a decrease r2 fig 5d this shows that class was driven by vapour pressure deficit and solar radiation during the drought and unresponsive to the decreased soil water content however the 2012 drought had a strong impact on tree physiology and not only on transpiration such that important nutrient losses nutrient base cations phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon occurred via both canopy throughfall and litterfall houle et al 2016 delage et al 1999 found that the discretization of soil layers in class led to an overestimation of transpiration even when a small portion of roots had access to water in deeper soil layers in the model the authors proposed that the rooting layer should coincide with soil layers in the model in order to ensure that roots occupy the entire model layer in this study root depth with maximum rooting depth of 0 98 m coincides with the total depth of the three top soil layers in the model 1 07 m moreover the permeable soil depth defined in the model is 1 m thus water cannot be extracted beyond 1 m in depth henceforth the overestimation of transpiration during the drought period is likely not due to the soil layer discretization in the model as roots are found in all three soil layers 3 3 2 simulated forced zero precipitation during the hydrological year 2006 2007 the apparent absence of an impact on simulated transpiration during july 2012 drought led us to further investigate class s sensitivity to drought conditions this was done by artificially stopping precipitation inputs starting in october 2006 i e to ensure that the summer drought was total and that there was no ground water recharge from melting snowpack in the spring 2007 the simulation showed that trsim was maintained during the entire 2007 growing season fig 6 c due in part to the quantity of water stored in the soils as frozen water that melts at the beginning of the growing season this is an artefact due to the absence of the insulating effect of the snowpack in the simulation this amount of water was in fact relatively small transpiration finally dropped to zero on september 11th 2007 when the simulated soil liquid water content reached 4 5 in hum 5 7 in horb and 5 in horc fig 6b thus very close to the soil water threshold of 4 assigned in class at which transpiration ceases horizontal black dashed line in fig 6b verseghy 2012 while the presence of a threshold value to cease transpiration in class is important to represent residual soil water that is not available for transpiration evaporation the fixed 4 value is too low and unrealistic class should thus incorporate an equation that calculates the soil water threshold residual soil water based on soil properties instead of using a fixed threshold value for all mineral soil our results also show that simulated transpiration did not decrease gradually with decreasing soil water prior to 11th september 2007 in reality when soil water decreases both canopy conductance and transpiration decrease granier et al 2000 lagergren and lindroth 2002 which was not reflected in our results there was an unrealistic control of transpiration by atmospheric variables in class despite the soil water content reaching critically low values as a consequence the overestimation of simulated transpiration in class during drought might feed greater amounts of water into the atmosphere when coupled with the crcm or any other climate model which will eventually result in greater modeled precipitation in turn an increased modeled precipitation might indirectly decrease air temperature further via evaporative cooling due to the presence of greater amount of water in the soil see soil moisture temperature coupling and soil moisture precipitation coupling in seneviratne et al 2010 and reduced solar radiation under overcast conditions dutton et al 1991 makowski et al 2009 in climate model projections presently several global climate models including the canadian climate model canadian centre for climate modeling and analysis were already found to underestimate persistent drought at both monthly and annual time scales moon et al 2018 as well as at decadal scale ault et al 2014 as a matter of fact future drought projections by global climate models will be underestimated as well underestimation of drought was found to be mostly due to model uncertainty and observational uncertainty blenkinsop and fowler 2007 moon et al 2018 our finding thus exposes a weakness of class to accurately model the effect of water stressed conditions on transpiration which will have an ultimate effect on its feedback process i e precipitation other studies have found most land surface schemes underestimate evapotranspiration and thus overestimate drought intensity and duration de kauwe et al 2015 ukkola et al 2016b transpiration was also found to be underestimated in earth system models lian et al 2018 however our study showed that class overestimates transpiration during drought periods due to the model s insensitivity to decreasing soil water nevertheless evaporation was not included in our analysis whereby an underestimation of modeled evaporation in class might lead to an underestimation for modeled evapotranspiration ukkola et al 2016b evaluated the performance of eight land surface schemes excluding class under water stress conditions across six sites which were evergreen needleleaf broadleaf deciduous broadleaf and grassland their study showed that all the land surface schemes underestimated evapotranspiration and thereby greatly overestimated drought in terms of both magnitude and frequency ukkola et al 2016b concluded that the proper representation of vertical soil water fluxes via the use of validated soil hydraulic properties and plant water stress within lss are critical for modelling transpiration during drought similarly the underestimated transpiration in earth system models was found to be caused by the misrepresentation of canopy light use interception loss and root water uptake processes lian et al 2018 wu et al 2020 used both soil moisture stress and plant water stress configurations in the clm5 model and found that transpiration was overestimated in all simulations they nevertheless observed that simulations using the plant water stress configuration better represent plant transpiration due to the incorporation of the hydraulic redistribution scheme thus class should include an equation similar to the plant water stress function present in clm5 or an improved soil moisture function verhoef and egea 2014 that will slow down transpiration when soil water decreases from field capacity to the permanent wilting point in order to increase the realism of the transpiration process in the lss 3 3 3 implementation of a new equation for soil moisture suction function in class the insensitivity of modeled transpiration in class to decreasing soil water content led us to propose a new soil moisture suction equation that considers the permanent wilting point while sun and verseghy 2019 recently proposed a way to increase the model s sensitivity to decreasing soil water they used the same soil moisture suction function in class and replaced the minimum liquid moisture suction of all soil layers currently used in class by the minimum liquid moisture suction of the topsoil layer only however in our study we propose a modified soil moisture suction function φ s eq 6 that varies with actual soil moisture suction φ s and soil moisture suction at the permanent wilting point φ pwp in order to increase stomatal resistance as the actual soil moisture suction approaches the permanent wilting point 6 f φ s 1 φ s 0 5 p w p f φ s 1 α e x p φ pwp φ s φ s 0 5 p w p where fc is the field capacity pwp is the permanent wilting point and α is a multiplying factor for the exponential increase this new equation eq 6 was applied in the model where multiple simulations with various alpha values were carried out finally an alpha value of 0 5 was chosen as it fits best the decrease in observed transpiration our result showed that modeled transpiration was greatly improved with the modified soil moisture suction equation during the july drought fig 7 the performance statistics were better with a higher r2 value 0 88 and a slope closer to unity 1 06 and smaller ed and dtw values 0 9 and 0 06 respectively compared to the previous simulation for the year 2012 table 3 since we used standardized observed transpiration we did not calibrate and further fine tune the alpha coefficient in the new equation henceforth we recommend that this new equation should be further tested and calibrated with absolute values of measured transpiration in future studies 4 conclusion transpiration is a key process in surface atmosphere interactions catchment hydrology irrigation scheduling and agronomy the long term in situ sap flow measurements that we used allows us to evaluate the transpiration component of evapotranspiration in class during many contrasting climatic conditions for two boreal forests which is not possible with eddy covariance evapotranspiration data overall our study showed that class modeled transpiration adequately during the growing season but not during the tree rehydration period where the modeled transpiration greatly underestimated the observations the poor performance of class during the latter period is due to its overestimation of snowpack depth and duration the presence of which artificially restrains transpiration class also overestimated transpiration during extreme events such as heat waves or droughts its poor performance during drought is due to its unrealistic insensitivity to low soil water content though the underestimation of transpiration during tree rehydration might not contribute substantially to the inaccuracy of the feedback process i e underestimation of precipitation when coupled with the crcm the overestimation of transpiration during heat stressed and water stressed conditions will lead to overestimation of precipitation and consequently to the underestimation of drought events in future climate projections this will also affect air temperature projections thus we proposed and implemented a new equation that was able to increase the sensitivity of class to decreasing soil water content however this equation needs to be further tested on different sites and tree species

3814,transpiration a key component of the hydrological cycle contributes greatly to the climate system by transferring large amount of water from soils to the atmosphere its correct representation within land surface schemes in climate models is crucial to provide accurate and reliable climate projections in this study transpiration simulated by the canadian land surface scheme class was compared to long term observations of sap flow measurements in two boreal forest sites of eastern canada dominated by balsam fir and black spruce in general class adequately models daily transpiration during the growing season for most of the years at both sites during the tree rehydration period preceding the growing season modeled transpiration was greatly underestimated because of overestimating the duration of the snowpack the latter restricting transpiration moreover class did not capture the impact of extreme events on tree physiology and maintained high transpiration rates during a heat stress and a drought during both observed and simulated drought events transpiration modeled using class was overestimated due to insensitivity to substantial decreases in soil water content modeled transpiration being strictly controlled by atmospheric variables vapour pressure deficit and radiations thus we also proposed and implemented a new equation that was able to increase the sensitivity of class to decreasing soil water content however this equation needs to be further tested on different sites and tree species keywords transpiration class drought rehydration boreal forest land surface scheme 1 introduction evapotranspiration is the combined process of transpiration and evaporation occurring on a vegetation covered land surface as per kramer 1983 transpiration is defined as the loss of water in the form of vapour from plants ward and trimble 2004 while evaporation is the loss of water from the soil surface and vegetation canopy following interception of water from precipitation the partitioning of evapotranspiration into soil evaporation canopy evaporation and tree transpiration over a land surface depends on the type of vegetation baldocchi et al 2004 and percentage of vegetation cover wang et al 2010 studies have shown transpiration to vary from 48 to 52 soil evaporation from 15 to 36 and canopy evaporation from 16 to 20 of the total evapotranspiration of land surfaces on a global scale using process based models choudhury and digirolamo 1998 choudhury et al 1998 dirmeyer et al 2005 in a boreal forest evaporation from the canopy and the forest floor were respectively 20 and 15 of the total forest evapotranspiration while tree transpiration accounted for 65 grelle et al 1997 transpiration is a function of many environmental factors such as solar radiation vapour pressure deficit air temperature and soil water bovard et al 2005 gartner et al 2009 lagergren and lindroth 2002 wang et al 2017 wullschleger et al 2000 transpiration can be measured via different approaches or modeled at regional to global scales with land surface models seneviratne et al 2010 land surface models also known as land surface schemes lsss exist in three generations among them only the 2nd dickinson et al 1986 sellers et al 1986 and 3rd generations collatz et al 1991 have a vegetation layer that enables the simulation of transpiration the 2nd generation lsss compute stomatal conductance based on the jarvis 1976 formulation where it is controlled by environmental stresses such as solar radiation humidity air temperature and soil water potential however the individual functions of these environmental stresses including the soil water stress function vary among the various lsss furthermore a hydraulic redistribution scheme is incorporated in some 2nd generation lss e g community land model version 4 5 in order to improve the simulation of evapotranspiration especially during dry seasons fu et al 2016 examples of 2nd generation lsss are biosphere atmosphere transfer scheme bats dickinson et al 1986 simple biosphere model sib sellers et al 1986 and the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 on the other hand 3rd generation lsss have a biochemical approach and are more complex in their input data requirements as they use a semi mechanistic photosynthesis model to compute stomatal conductance the latter is controlled by the net assimilation rate partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the leaf surface and relative humidity vapour pressure deficit in turn gross primary productivity is controlled by canopy photosynthesis canopy respiration and a moisture limiting factor soil water stress function pitman 2003 since stomatal conductance and photosynthesis are coupled the moisture limiting factor has an impact on stomatal conductance as well however the moisture limiting factor is calculated differently in all the existing 3rd generation lsss arora 2003 some examples of 3rd generation lsss are coupled class canadian terrestrial ecosystem model ctem arora 2003 the joint uk land environment simulator jules best et al 2011 and community land model clm oleson et al 2013 lsss have been used in many modeling studies to simulate evapotranspiration this includes for example the simple biosphere model lei et al 2011 the community land model gayler et al 2013 li et al 2013 the noah land surface model jaksa and sridhar 2015 ma et al 2017 malik et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the community atmosphere biosphere land exchange model ukkola et al 2016a zhag et al 2016 or multiple land surface schemes chen et al 2013 grippa et al 2011 ukkola et al 2016b while transpiration is an important component of the hydrological cycle it also has a crucial role in regulating climate as it is the largest continental water flux jasechko 2018 supported by both observations and modelling studies bala et al 2007 seneviratne et al 2012 swann et al 2010 baudena et al 2021 modelling studies of complete deforestation or conversion to grassland of the amazon forests using a general circulation model or earth system model have shown a decrease in evapotranspiration and an increase in surface temperature brovkin et al 2009 dickinson and henderson sellers 1988 garratt 1993 in temperate forests excessive evapotranspiration was identified as the cause of the extreme 2003 drought in europe seneviratne et al 2012 among all biomes the boreal forest has the most important biogeophysical impact on global mean annual temperature bonan 2008 its expansion towards the arctic for instance would increase air temperature bonan 2008 via increased transpiration swann et al 2010 and decreased surface albedo betts 2000 though increased evaporation transpiration has a cooling effect on the surface of the ground canopy the increase in water molecules in the atmosphere caused by increased transpiration absorbs long wave radiation and thus increases the atmospheric air temperature swann et al 2010 in this study since the focus is on transpiration instead of photosynthesis the 2nd generation lss class version 3 6 is used instead of the class ctem version the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 developed by the canadian climate centre is an lss that was specifically designed to be used within the canadian regional climate model crcm zadra et al 2008 brochu and laprise 2007 showed that simulated summer evapotranspiration in the crcm was greatly improved when class was used instead of the simple manabe bucket model 1st generation lss manabe 1969 emphasizing the importance of proper representation of transpiration within lsss to date a few studies have used class to quantitatively assess how it simulates evapotranspiration from forests these were conducted on a daily basis in the boreal forest in saskatchewan wang et al 2002 manitoba bartlett et al 2003 and quebec isabelle et al 2018 in temperate forests in british columbia yuan et al 2007 and ontario huang et al 2011 and in a sub alpine forest in western canada macdonald et al 2016 all of these studies used observations based on eddy covariance measurements to validate their findings none of these studies have however focused on the temporal evolution of simulated transpiration compared to observations of daily transpiration derived from sap flow velocity data measured on a daily time scale in various conditions while sap flow and eddy covariance techniques are comparable qualitatively eddy covariance techniques measure evapotranspiration over a large footprint area that varies with time making measurements highly unstable hogg et al 1997 wilson et al 2001 moreover the eddy covariance technique is applicable only in homogenous and flat terrain and is subject to errors when interpreting results during times of low turbulence wilson et al 2001 on the other hand sap flow techniques allow for the assessment of environmental and physiological controls on transpiration at the tree level and are considered more stable due to the fixed location of the sensor in the tree hogg et al 1997 furthermore sap flow techniques enable the study of intra and inter specific differences in tree transpiration even in heterogeneous and complex terrain where edaphic and microclimatic variation is greater wilson et al 2001 however the signal reading of sap flow probes installed in the same trees for multiple years will lead to some dampening of the signal from the second year of measurement onwards due to wounding and recovery effects peters et al 2018 while re installation of the sap flow probes every year will avoid signal dampening this may lead to problems of circumferential variability peters et al 2018 in addition complex extrapolations will be required in cases where sap flow measurements have to be up scaled from the tree to the model grid level in our study the temporal evolution of transpiration modeled by class is evaluated using sap flow velocity data the latter was measured in two tree species namely balsam fir and black spruce which are the most important conifers in the boreal forest region of central and eastern canada sap flow was measured over multiple growing seasons 10 for balsam fir and 4 for black spruce allowing us to validate the class model in many contrasting environmental conditions the period prior to the growing season is important for tree species in the boreal region as winter dehydrated trees must recharge during spring prior to the onset of tree growth turcotte et al 2009 however the mechanism of tree water uptake during this period is not well known important questions also remain regarding how trees regulate water uptake during droughts isohydric tree species normally reduce or even stop their transpiration as soil water decreases but anisohydric trees maintain transpiration rates during dry periods in this study we evaluate how well class represents tree transpiration during normal conditions during the rehydration period and during drought 2 materials methods 2 1 description of study area the two studied sites are in a balsam fir forest 47 19 41 n and 71 07 37 w and a black spruce forest 49 12 45 n and 73 39 00 w located in the province of quebec in canada their elevations are 771 864 m and 400 450 m above sea level respectively the mean annual temperature is 1 3 c at both the balsam fir and black spruce sites for the period from 2001 to 2016 mean annual precipitation is 1300 mm at the balsam fir site and 941 mm at the black spruce site for the period 2001 to 2016 the vegetation rests on precambrian charnockitic gneiss covered by loamy sand to sandy loam till at both sites approximately 32 2 7 4 and 29 3 4 7 balsam fir and black spruce sites of the annual precipitation is in the form of snow if we consider only the volume of precipitation when the air temperature is below the freezing point the ground is covered with snow on average about 193 19 and 183 10 days per year with mean maximum yearly snow of 0 95 0 25 m and 0 87 0 16 m at the balsam fir and the black spruce site respectively 2 2 measured data climate variables were measured on an hourly basis at both forest sites and were used as inputs for class these climate variables are wind speed 013a campbell scientific logan ut measured at the top of a straight tubular tower 11 m high at the balsam fir site and 8 5 m high at the black spruce site photosynthetically active radiation li190sb campbell scientific logan ut measured at a height

height of 2 3 m with a rain gauge 35 1558 fisher and porter albany ny located nearby the tower all climate data were available from 1999 to 2016 at the balsam fir site and from 1997 to 2016 at the black spruce site air temperature within the canopy was measured by a shield protected temperature probe dc95f232v amphenol thermometrics st marys pa placed in the top quarter portion of the canopy of three co dominant trees one probe on each tree approximately 10 m distance between the probes at both sites the depth of snow cover was measured close to the instrumented trees with ultrasonic sensors sr50 type sonic distance sensor campbell scientific inc soil water content cs615 campbell scientific logan ut and soil temperature 401 ysi yellow springs oh were measured daily in 3 and 4 pedons at the black spruce and balsam fir sites respectively in the b horizon 22 cm below the mineral soil surface and c horizon 81 cm below the mineral soil surface both soil water and soil temperature were measured since 1997 at the black spruce site and since 1999 at the balsam fir site the mean values of the pedons were used to characterize both soil water and soil temperature at both study sites sap flow was measured in three co dominant trees of the main tree species two measurements one on the north and the other on the south side for each tree using 30 mm thermal dissipation probes tdp 30 dynamax houston tx instruments were positioned at breast height approximately 1 3 m above ground level trees were instrumented in 2003 for balsam fir and 2006 for black spruce sap flow was measured every 30 min throughout the day and was calculated based on the procedure explained in granier 1987 while only three trees per species were measured in our study there were two measurements per tree two probes per tree on opposite sides to follow sap flow variation around the stem the sap flow both hourly and daily variations data were highly correlated between the sun side and the shade side probes of each tree average r2 0 87 091 and 0 86 0 87 and between trees average r2 0 89 0 96 and 0 88 0 94 for both balsam fir black spruce species refer to tables s2 and s3 found in the supplementary material of oogathoo et al 2020 in this study sapwood area was not measured at either site while sapwood depth is generally assumed to be positively correlated with stem diameter there seems to be no relationship at all between sapwood area and stem diameter for some species ewers et al 2002 thus for this study stand transpiration was not calculated instead the standardized sap flow velocity was used to evaluate the temporal variation of sap flow against standardized modeled transpiration the standardized sap flow velocity and standardized modeled transpiration were obtained by dividing the absolute values by their respective maximum value during the growing season in each year separately sap flow velocity was available from 2004 to 2013 and 2006 to 2009 for balsam fir and for black spruce respectively and thus these long term observations were used to evaluate the performance of class for transpiration stem diameter variation was also measured at both sites in the same three trees with electronic strain gauge dendrometers dex70 dynamax inc houston tx these measurements were used to define rehydration periods and growing season further information on forest stand characteristics at both sites are presented in oogathoo et al 2020 2 3 canadian land surface scheme class class enables the exchange of water and energy with the atmospheric component of the crcm it models the hydrological cycle in a one dimensional column at a time step of 30 mins the model is comprised of a vegetation layer a snow layer of variable depth and multiple soil layers with varying thicknesses the vegetation in the model is grouped into four categories broadleaf conifer crops and grass each model grid is divided into four sub grids based on land cover types which are 1 bare soil 2 soil covered with snow 3 soil covered with vegetation 4 and vegetation over snow covered soil the energy and mass balances are calculated for each sub grid and composite energy and mass balance are determined for each grid using a weighted average based on the area occupied by each land cover type verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 2 3 1 mathematical representation of transpiration within class latent heat and sensible heat fluxes are determined based on gradient turbulent diffusion theory transpiration is calculated for each vegetation type where canopy is treated as a single big leaf with no differentiation between sunlit and shaded leaves transpiration is calculated using eq 1 where lv is latent heat of vaporation ρa is air density qa is the actual specific humidity qsat t c is the saturation specific humidity at effective canopy temperature t c ra is aerodynamic resistance and rc is canopy resistance 1 q e c d r y l v ρ a q a q sat t c r a r c modeled transpiration occurs when water is present in the soil layers and it is controlled by the specific humidity deficit aerodynamic resistance and canopy resistance unstressed canopy resistance depends on the minimum stomatal resistance for each vegetation type incoming visible shortwave radiation and leaf area index the stressed canopy resistance rc i is a function of the unstressed canopy resistance rc u i and environmental stresses such as vapour pressure deficit f δe soil water potential f φs as a surrogate for leaf water potential and air temperature f ta as a surrogate for canopy temperature as shown in eqs 2 to 5 cv1 cv2 cφ1 and cφ2 are parameters that depend on vegetation categories composite canopy resistance is the weighted average of canopy resistance of the vegetation categories present in each model grid in the model transpiration ceases under two conditions 1 snow is present beneath the canopy and 2 incoming visible radiation is 2 w m2 whereby in all cases a very high canopy resistance is used in the model however when snow depth is less than 0 1 m in class the percent of snow cover over the model grid is not assigned to 100 thus allowing partial transpiration to occur in the model

radiation was estimated using the equation of sugita and brutsaert 1993 r ldc ε ac σ t a 4 where εac is atmospheric emissivity under clear skies σ is the stefan boltzmann constant ta is air

properties for most of the parameters default values in the model were used except for certain parameters for which measured values were used table 1 the top layer was configured as a peat layer in order to represent the humus layer that is normally present on forest floors in class the peat layer can be modeled as fibric hemic or sapric based on their hydraulic conductivity letts et al 2000 the type of peat layer has an impact on both soil temperature and soil water in this study the peat layer was considered to be of the fibric type the roughness length was calculated as one tenth of the maximum tree canopy height the aboveground biomass was estimated from destructive sampling in a sample plot 50 m 50 m representative of the watershed as part of a previous study tremblay et al 2012 four pits up to 1 m depth were dug at the balsam fir site in 1998 and at the black spruce site in 1996 where the maximum rooting depth and soil properties were determined from soil samples taken in the different soil horizons ouimet and duchesne 2005 2 4 analyses the performance of the class model for the simulation of transpiration was tested against sap flow velocity of balsam fir and black spruce for the rehydration period and during the growing season the beginning of the growing season for each year was calculated based on dendrometer data while the end was fixed to august 31st the 4 parameter gompertz model was fitted to the daily average dendrometer data from may to september for each year separately the beginning of radial growth was determined when the modeled daily growth was above 5 μm d 1 duchesne et al 2012 the end of the growing season was fixed to august 31 in order to avoid the freeze thaw events that occurred in september for the rehydration period a fixed period of 21 days prior to the onset of the growing season was used to assess modeled transpiration we also tested the model during a short term drought that occurred during july 2012 at the balsam fir site where only 23 mm of rain fell compared to the long term average of 150 mm for this period houle et al 2016 moreover a forced zero precipitation simulation was also carried out in class starting from october 2006 and ending on september 2008 at the balsam fir site to test model behaviour in an extreme situation for comparison between modeled transpiration and sap flow velocity both were standardized by dividing by their maximum values during the growing season for each year separately where the beginning and the end of growing season was calculated based on dendrometer data since standardized values were used instead of absolute values for transpiration and sap flow velocity the performance of all model simulations was evaluated using regression coefficient r2 and slope of the simple linear regression of model simulations versus observations euclidean distance ed and dynamic time warping dtw dtw computes the optimal match between two time series sakoe and chiba 1978 the symmetric form of the dtw was used and the dtw normalized distance was calculated both for ed and dtw the smaller the values are the greater the match between the simulated and observed time series 3 results and discussion 3 1 transpiration during the rehydration period prior to growing season in the boreal forest spring is an important time prior to the growing season where water in the soil is fully replenished from snowmelt keeping the soil much above the permanent wilting point and thus allowing tree rehydration prior to the onset of tree growth turcotte et al 2009 our simulations in class showed that the standardized modeled transpiration trsim underestimated the measured standardized sap flow velocity sfobs during the spring rehydration period at both sites for most years fig 1 i s1 and s2 although r2 values were high and significant in some of the years slopes b values of their respective simple linear regression equations were quite small and far from unity during the rehydration period at both sites except in 2010 at the balsam fir site b 0 96 indicating a poor match between the model simulations and observations table 2 similarly the ed was above one in all years at both sites except for 2010 at the balsam fir site the dtw also indicates poor agreement between simulations and observations except for the rehydration period in balsam fir which was well simulated in 2010 fig 1 ii the only year during which the simulated snowpack disappeared in advance of observations fig 2 indeed the relatively weak performance of the model during the rehydration period is due to its poor simulation of snow cover depth and duration which are generally much greater than observations at both sites fig 2 in class model transpiration ceases when there is snow on the ground based on the assumption that there is no transpiration when air temperature is below 0 c however when the simulated snow depth in the model is less than 0 1 m the model reduces the snow coverage over each model grid into patches of snow that is some portion of the model grid has snow while the rest does not thus allowing transpiration to occur only on the portion of the model grid that has no snow similar to our results macdonald et al 2016 and munro et al 2000 also found the duration of snow cover to be longer in class compared to observations this may be due to higher surface albedo and upward shortwave radiation modeled by class leading to a prolonged presence of snow cover compared to the other snow albedo parameterizations malik et al 2014 suggesting that one possibility to improve the simulation of snow depth in class could be to adjust its surface albedo algorithm while it could be argued that the presence of frozen water in the soil in addition to snow on the ground could contribute to the low transpiration modeled this is not the case as there is still liquid water in the soil our results show that in 2010 trsim was not different from observed values at the balsam fir site despite the presence of simulated soil frozen water prior to the growing season fig 1 ii d 3 2 transpiration during the growing season despite the fact that other studies have used class to quantitatively assess the simulation of transpiration on a daily basis in many ecosystems bartlett et al 2003 huang et al 2011 isabelle et al 2018 macdonald et al 2016 wang et al 2002 yuan et al 2007 none of them have focused on the temporal evolution of transpiration based on sap flow velocity data on a daily time scale as mentioned above sap flow techniques are more stable enabling us to assess not only tree transpiration but also the influence of species environmental and physiological factors on transpiration this is not possible with eddy covariance techniques since they provide measures of evapotranspiration for an entire footprint area hogg et al 1997 wilson et al 2001 in this study during the growing season the temporal evolution of trsim corresponded closely to the sfobs for all years analysed 2006 to 2009 for black spruce and 2004 to 2013 for balsam fir fig 3 s1 and s2 the r2 values were high and the regression was statistically significant during the growing season in most years at both sites with b values being very close to unity which supports a good performance of the model in all years except 2006 with a slope much greater than unity b 1 91 table 3 likewise low ed less than 2 and dtw values below 0 1 in most years at both sites demonstrate the good performance of the model again except in 2006 at the balsam fir site which had highest values 3 16 for ed and 0 161 for dtw the beginning of the growing season in 2007 at the balsam fir site fell outside of the best fit line of the simple linear regression of trsim vs sfobs empty triangle compared to other years at both sites fig 4 this discrepancy at the beginning of the growing season in 2007 is due to snow on the ground in the model that restrained the modeled transpiration as explained above for the rehydration period fig s3 in 2006 at the balsam fir site the model performance was poor with high ed and dtw values while 2006 did not undergo a drought there was a short duration heat stress i e combination of high temperature high relative humidity low precipitation and low wind velocities even without a significant drop in soil water content i e drought stress and tree growth ceased around july 1st which is at least one month earlier than normal duchesne and houle 2011 the observations showed a reduced transpiration rate fig s1 2006 that began around mid june 2006 and ended up to the end of the growing season however modeled transpiration was maintained at high values throughout the 2006 growing season indeed the large discrepancy between simulated and observed transpiration values for the year 2006 is likely due to the fact that class did not capture the impact of the heat stress on tree physiology and transpiration 3 3 transpiration during observed and simulated drought at the balsam fir site 3 3 1 drought of july 2012 in the summer of 2012 there was a drought that began on july 1st and ended on august 4th at the balsam fir site houle et al 2016 the normal average precipitation during this period at this site is about 150 mm but in 2012 it was only 23 mm the low amount of precipitation led to a marked decrease in the soil water content in the horizon b and c fig 5 observed transpiration decreased during the second half of the drought period while simulated transpiration did not leading to a decrease r2 fig 5d this shows that class was driven by vapour pressure deficit and solar radiation during the drought and unresponsive to the decreased soil water content however the 2012 drought had a strong impact on tree physiology and not only on transpiration such that important nutrient losses nutrient base cations phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon occurred via both canopy throughfall and litterfall houle et al 2016 delage et al 1999 found that the discretization of soil layers in class led to an overestimation of transpiration even when a small portion of roots had access to water in deeper soil layers in the model the authors proposed that the rooting layer should coincide with soil layers in the model in order to ensure that roots occupy the entire model layer in this study root depth with maximum rooting depth of 0 98 m coincides with the total depth of the three top soil layers in the model 1 07 m moreover the permeable soil depth defined in the model is 1 m thus water cannot be extracted beyond 1 m in depth henceforth the overestimation of transpiration during the drought period is likely not due to the soil layer discretization in the model as roots are found in all three soil layers 3 3 2 simulated forced zero precipitation during the hydrological year 2006 2007 the apparent absence of an impact on simulated transpiration during july 2012 drought led us to further investigate class s sensitivity to drought conditions this was done by artificially stopping precipitation inputs starting in october 2006 i e to ensure that the summer drought was total and that there was no ground water recharge from melting snowpack in the spring 2007 the simulation showed that trsim was maintained during the entire 2007 growing season fig 6 c due in part to the quantity of water stored in the soils as frozen water that melts at the beginning of the growing season this is an artefact due to the absence of the insulating effect of the snowpack in the simulation this amount of water was in fact relatively small transpiration finally dropped to zero on september 11th 2007 when the simulated soil liquid water content reached 4 5 in hum 5 7 in horb and 5 in horc fig 6b thus very close to the soil water threshold of 4 assigned in class at which transpiration ceases horizontal black dashed line in fig 6b verseghy 2012 while the presence of a threshold value to cease transpiration in class is important to represent residual soil water that is not available for transpiration evaporation the fixed 4 value is too low and unrealistic class should thus incorporate an equation that calculates the soil water threshold residual soil water based on soil properties instead of using a fixed threshold value for all mineral soil our results also show that simulated transpiration did not decrease gradually with decreasing soil water prior to 11th september 2007 in reality when soil water decreases both canopy conductance and transpiration decrease granier et al 2000 lagergren and lindroth 2002 which was not reflected in our results there was an unrealistic control of transpiration by atmospheric variables in class despite the soil water content reaching critically low values as a consequence the overestimation of simulated transpiration in class during drought might feed greater amounts of water into the atmosphere when coupled with the crcm or any other climate model which will eventually result in greater modeled precipitation in turn an increased modeled precipitation might indirectly decrease air temperature further via evaporative cooling due to the presence of greater amount of water in the soil see soil moisture temperature coupling and soil moisture precipitation coupling in seneviratne et al 2010 and reduced solar radiation under overcast conditions dutton et al 1991 makowski et al 2009 in climate model projections presently several global climate models including the canadian climate model canadian centre for climate modeling and analysis were already found to underestimate persistent drought at both monthly and annual time scales moon et al 2018 as well as at decadal scale ault et al 2014 as a matter of fact future drought projections by global climate models will be underestimated as well underestimation of drought was found to be mostly due to model uncertainty and observational uncertainty blenkinsop and fowler 2007 moon et al 2018 our finding thus exposes a weakness of class to accurately model the effect of water stressed conditions on transpiration which will have an ultimate effect on its feedback process i e precipitation other studies have found most land surface schemes underestimate evapotranspiration and thus overestimate drought intensity and duration de kauwe et al 2015 ukkola et al 2016b transpiration was also found to be underestimated in earth system models lian et al 2018 however our study showed that class overestimates transpiration during drought periods due to the model s insensitivity to decreasing soil water nevertheless evaporation was not included in our analysis whereby an underestimation of modeled evaporation in class might lead to an underestimation for modeled evapotranspiration ukkola et al 2016b evaluated the performance of eight land surface schemes excluding class under water stress conditions across six sites which were evergreen needleleaf broadleaf deciduous broadleaf and grassland their study showed that all the land surface schemes underestimated evapotranspiration and thereby greatly overestimated drought in terms of both magnitude and frequency ukkola et al 2016b concluded that the proper representation of vertical soil water fluxes via the use of validated soil hydraulic properties and plant water stress within lss are critical for modelling transpiration during drought similarly the underestimated transpiration in earth system models was found to be caused by the misrepresentation of canopy light use interception loss and root water uptake processes lian et al 2018 wu et al 2020 used both soil moisture stress and plant water stress configurations in the clm5 model and found that transpiration was overestimated in all simulations they nevertheless observed that simulations using the plant water stress configuration better represent plant transpiration due to the incorporation of the hydraulic redistribution scheme thus class should include an equation similar to the plant water stress function present in clm5 or an improved soil moisture function verhoef and egea 2014 that will slow down transpiration when soil water decreases from field capacity to the permanent wilting point in order to increase the realism of the transpiration process in the lss 3 3 3 implementation of a new equation for soil moisture suction function in class the insensitivity of modeled transpiration in class to decreasing soil water content led us to propose a new soil moisture suction equation that considers the permanent wilting point while sun and verseghy 2019 recently proposed a way to increase the model s sensitivity to decreasing soil water they used the same soil moisture suction function in class and replaced the minimum liquid moisture suction of all soil layers currently used in class by the minimum liquid moisture suction of the topsoil layer only however in our study we propose a modified soil moisture suction function φ s eq 6 that varies with actual soil moisture suction φ s and soil moisture suction at the permanent wilting point φ pwp in order to increase stomatal resistance as the actual soil moisture suction approaches the permanent wilting point 6 f φ s 1 φ s 0 5 p w p f φ s 1 α e x p φ pwp φ s φ s 0 5 p w p where fc is the field capacity pwp is the permanent wilting point and α is a multiplying factor for the exponential increase this new equation eq 6 was applied in the model where multiple simulations with various alpha values were carried out finally an alpha value of 0 5 was chosen as it fits best the decrease in observed transpiration our result showed that modeled transpiration was greatly improved with the modified soil moisture suction equation during the july drought fig 7 the performance statistics were better with a higher r2 value 0 88 and a slope closer to unity 1 06 and smaller ed and dtw values 0 9 and 0 06 respectively compared to the previous simulation for the year 2012 table 3 since we used standardized observed transpiration we did not calibrate and further fine tune the alpha coefficient in the new equation henceforth we recommend that this new equation should be further tested and calibrated with absolute values of measured transpiration in future studies 4 conclusion transpiration is a key process in surface atmosphere interactions catchment hydrology irrigation scheduling and agronomy the long term in situ sap flow measurements that we used allows us to evaluate the transpiration component of evapotranspiration in class during many contrasting climatic conditions for two boreal forests which is not possible with eddy covariance evapotranspiration data overall our study showed that class modeled transpiration adequately during the growing season but not during the tree rehydration period where the modeled transpiration greatly underestimated the observations the poor performance of class during the latter period is due to its overestimation of snowpack depth and duration the presence of which artificially restrains transpiration class also overestimated transpiration during extreme events such as heat waves or droughts its poor performance during drought is due to its unrealistic insensitivity to low soil water content though the underestimation of transpiration during tree rehydration might not contribute substantially to the inaccuracy of the feedback process i e underestimation of precipitation when coupled with the crcm the overestimation of transpiration during heat stressed and water stressed conditions will lead to overestimation of precipitation and consequently to the underestimation of drought events in future climate projections this will also affect air temperature projections thus we proposed and implemented a new equation that was able to increase the sensitivity of class to decreasing soil water content however this equation needs to be further tested on different sites and tree species finally class still needs to be improved during the rehydration period credit authorship contribution statement shalini oogathoo data curation investigation visualization software formal analysis
