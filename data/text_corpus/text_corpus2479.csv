fumatech gmbh and pca 100 from pc cell were screened in batch donnan dialysis experiments with nitrate and or sulfate using chloride as the driving ion fad fas and fab showed similar nitrate flux while pca 100 produced significantly lesser nitrate flux under experimental conditions based on the higher selectivity for nitrate over sulfate fas was preferred over fad membrane a spiral wound

eliminating an average nitrate loading rate of 5 0 kg no3 m3 d and producing 30 5 mg l nitrate nitrate transport modeling using matlab was performed to predict exit nitrate concentration at any point

contamination by nitrate is a potential environmental problem in many parts of the world abusive use of nitrate rich fertilizers disposal of untreated sewage fossil fuel burning and change in land use patterns are some of the major causes of elevated level of nitrate in the aquatic environment 1 2 nearly half of the applied nitrogenous fertilizers drain from crop fields to contaminate the available water resources including surface and ground water 3 4 the high solubility of nitrate in water favors its easy percolation into ground and surface water after its discharge the release of nitrogenous waste into the water bodies produces damaging effects by inducing eutrophication and algal bloom the direct impact of nitrate poisoning in infants is linked to the development of methaemoglobinaemia in infants and the development of potential carcinogens in the digestive tract 5 6 in adults nitrate enters through both exogenous and endogenous routes and produces a toxic effect meningioma s high blood pressure stomach cancer nasopharyngeal and thyroid disorders after its conversion into nitrite 4 consequently the world health organization limited the tolerance level of nitrate in drinking water to 50 mg l 7 several conventional techniques coagulation flocculation filtration disinfection including reverse osmosis 8 electrodialysis 9 ion exchange resins 10 adsorption 11 and biological treatment 12 have restricted use for the removal of nitrate due to several associated limitations production of concentrates and regenerated brines is associated with ion exchange membrane separation in contrast high operating costs and the risk of the contamination of treated water are related to electrochemical reduction and biological treatment respectively 13 14 velizarov et al 15 demonstrated the successful application of an ion exchange membrane bioreactor iemb for the efficient removal of ionic pollutants from water and wastewater at a laboratory scale 16 17 including nitrate 18 19 the iemb encompasses the benefits of donnan ion exchange through ion exchange membrane and stimulated anoxic bioreactor as schematically displayed in fig 1 physical removal of such target ions nitrate in present work is accomplished through an anion exchange membrane which gets concentrated in the receiver solution as a result of continuous diffusive transport of the driving counter ion chloride in present work leading to the establishment of electrochemical potential or concentration gradient 13 the concentrated nitrate in the receiving solution is then reduced by the biological treatment step which converts it into nitrogen gas in the presence of a suitable electron donor carbon source under anoxic conditions such arrangement permits the physical separation of the microbial culture and other pollutants from the treated water thus preventing the major problems of secondary contamination associated with the practice of biological treatment for the production of drinking water 13 15 therefore the process has the potential to be environmentally sustainable and economically viable provided that sufficiently high nitrate fluxes can be attained for a given concentration driving force the flux of nitrate across the membrane depends on the total mass transfer resistance which is the sum of diffusion boundary layer resistance and membrane resistance the effective mass transfer at high and low feed concentration is controlled by membrane resistance and the resistance of the diffusion boundary layer respectively however the transport of target ions is least affected by membrane properties when the boundary layer diffusion is dominant 21 22 while the relative contribution of boundary layer and membrane diffusive resistance have been evaluated in slit flow systems 21 23 they have not been evaluated in pilot scale contactors certain studies also demonstrated the increased transport of target ions by enhancing the concentration of driving counter ions 24 such approach prevents the competition between the transport of a higher concentration of counter ion and a relatively low concentration of target ion this effect has also not been evaluated in pilot scale contactors until recently the pilot scale application of iemb to eliminate nitrate and other oxyanions was not explored the successful operation of up scaled iemb treating large quantities of nitrate contaminated water entails major challenges ideally the scaled up contactor with entrance and exit ports on the feed side and the receiving solution side must be fabricated with considerable enough membrane area long enough path length and high enough nitrate permeability to allow once through treatment of large enough flow rates per module a spiral wound anion exchange membrane contactor has been reported for acid dialysis that answers these requirements when operated in concurrent flow and using a thicker flow channel on the receiver side where bioreduction occurs 25 our recently published work successfully established process incorporating such a module with a treatment capacity of 1 5 m3 d of nitrate contaminated groundwater 20 however further scale up of the iemb process needs thorough understanding regarding the behavior of the spiral contactor in donnan dialysis mode in this article modeling the spiral wound module as a donnan dialysis contactor is reported the contactor was characterized for donann dialysis of nitrate and it was further modelled to understand the impact of variation of operating parameters boundary conditions and membrane parameters on the contactor performance 2 theoretical framework for analyzing data from different types of donnan contactors 2 1 analysis of donnan exchange rates in slit flow cells to successfully model the spiral contactor we must have an accurate evaluation of the diffusive resistance of the membrane towards the different ions this can be done with a slit cell donnan exchange contactor for a donnan dialysis contactor the target ions move from the feed to receiver sides through the following regions i boundary layer at the feed side ii anion exchange membrane matrix and iii boundary layer at the receiving side transport of the driving ions follows the same regions but in reverse order the flux equation of the target ion is given by hasson et al 26 as under 1 j no 3 p s c ta f na f c ta r na r the

refer to appendix b matlab script to integrate and solve eqs 7 10 aiming to generate the output in the form of nitrate chloride and flux variation along the length of contactor for fad and fas under the given conditions listed in table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 membrane characterization using a stirred diffusion cell and a slit flow cell setup the membranes types fad fas and fab by fumatech gmbh and pca100 by pca gmbh were screened in batch donnan dialysis experiments and characterized based on nitrate or sulfate transport from feed 0 005 m nacl 100 mg l no3 or so4 2 to receiver 0 05 m nacl compartment the primary characteristics of the membranes as provided by the manufacturers are summarized in table 2 these experiments were conducted in a cylindrical diffusion cell containing two compartments of 18 ml capacity each with an effective membrane area of 7 1 cm2 a magnetic bar in each chamber was used for stirring feed side and receiver side solutions were sampled at distinctive time intervals all the membranes were equilibrated with the above solutions before performing the donnan experiments the donnan slit flow cell setup was operated in recycling mode to determine the membrane resistance for feed solution tap water spiked with 100 mg l nitrate against a receiving solution of chloride 0 1 m tap water in the feed solution was used to mimic the real field situations and the operating conditions of spiral wound membrane contactor membranes fad pet75 and fas pet75 onward referred as fad and fas respectively were tested on a donnan slit plexiglass with plastic net spacers appendix fig a 1 at the operating conditions mentioned in table 3 each experimental run was for at least 2 h with equal volumes at the feed and receiver compartment of the dialyzer the solutions were maintained at 25 c using a water bath 3 2 donnan dialysis with anion exchange membrane spiral wound module donnan exchange spiral wound membrane modules containing fad and fas anion exchange membranes were procured from spiraltec gmbh germany the module configuration included a path length of 6 m a width of 0 45 m and an effective membrane area of 2 75 m2 feed and receiving side spacers were 0 72 and 5 2 mm thick respectively the membrane module was operated in co current mode with feed nitrate spiked tap water and receiver flows di water containing chloride the donnan contactor setup was operated at room temperature 25 5 c with stainless steel rotary vane pumps fluid o tech model no mg209xd1pt00000 on the feed and receiver side bioside digital flow meters tecfluid model no e 08960 were used at feed and bioside to indicate the flow all the required sensors and flow meter transmitters were connected to a data logger novus fieldlogger brazil with remote transmission via internet connection to record and transmit the various operating parameters such as flow rates l h individual as well as differential pressure millibars and temperature c desired parameters such as nitrate and chloride and sulfate were measured according to the requirements during the investigation nitrate was measured using the ultraviolet spectroscopic screening method 4500 no3 b while turbidimetric method 4500 so4 2 e was adapted to measure sulfate 27 all the experimental data in the paper are based on the average value of replicate runs 4 results and discussion 4 1 screening of different membranes using stirred diffusion cell the membranes under study were screened in small scale stirred batch donnan dialysis experiments and characterized on the basis of nitrate transport from feed to receiver compartment all the membranes except pca 100 produced substantial nitrate flux which was largely linearly dependent on nitrate concentration to a great extent the highest nitrate flux of 151 meq h m2 was shown by fad based on initial flux fig 2a whereas pca 100 showed only 2 meq h m2 nitrate flux at similar experimental conditions similar experiments were also conducted to characterize these membranes for sulfate transport from the feed compartment pca 100 membrane was excluded in these experiments since it already had much lower nitrate permeability in line with the nitrate flux the fad membrane also produced significant sulfate flux which linearly increased up to 15 mins and then became constant fig 2b such property of fad membrane possessing comparatively larger flux for sulfate is not desirable for the prospect of iemb operation since the transmembrane sulfate flux would be transferred to bioside leading to the accumulation and subsequent reduction of sulfate in fbbr leading to suppress nitrate biodegradation 20 on the other hand fab and fas membranes were observed to produce comparatively similar nitrate flux and at the same time significantly lesser sulfate flux fig 2b therefore spiral wound contactor equipped with fas as the anion exchange membrane with revised dimensions aiming to operate at higher flow rates were considered for the further pilot scale experiments with these modules the transfer rate of sulfate from feed to bioside is negligible at the same time they can provide higher nitrate loadings without reaching to the differential pressure limit set to 200 millibars by the manufacturer 4 2 batch kinetic analysis of nitrate and sulfate transport 4 2 1 stirred diffusion cell the batch kinetic modeling of fad and fas was established for nitrate and sulfate decay from the feed side according to the following flux eq 11 22 23 11 ln y p s 1 c f 1 c r s v f t where y c ta f c ta 0 1 c r c f 1 1 1 c r c f 1 the plot of ln y vs time t according to eq 11 gives the slope which is used to calculate overall mass transfer coefficient the batch kinetic modeling plots for nitrate and sulfate decay from the feed side are represented by fig 3a and b respectively membrane fas and fab showed a very marginal sulfate flux during the first 5 mins which prevailed almost constant as no significant change in the sulfate removal was observed for the extended time of sampling therefore only a few initial data points were considered for the kinetic modeling of these membranes kinetic coefficient ps was evaluated for nitrate and sulfate decay and presented in table 4 based on the nitrate and sulfate flux data the values of ps for all the membranes were considerably high 738 meq h m2 to 930 meq h m2 for nitrate whereas fad only produced a significant value of ps for sulfate membrane fas and fab showed a similar magnitude of ps 0 6 meq h m2 to 0 7 meq h m2 which was negligible compared to the fad membrane table 4 the kinetic coefficient and flux values suggest that membrane fad fas and fab can be considered for donnan nitrate removal in contrast only fad based membrane is suitable for both nitrate and sulfate removal from water and wastewater in contrast if the purpose is the selective removal of either nitrate or sulfate the data presented in table 4 may be utilized to decide the suitability of different membranes further we can surmise that those ps values that are significantly smaller sulfate for fas and fab and nitrate for pca100 indicating that the anion transport in those cases is controlled by the membrane diffusive resistance see eq 2 4 2 2 batch kinetic analysis slit cell typical plots for nitrate transport with slit cell for fad and fas are represented in fig 4 and are also found to obey eq 11 from the slopes obtained at the different flow rates plotting 1 ps vs 1 q0 875 was linear and the membrane diffusive resistance 1 pso was obtained see fig a 2 the experimental data indicated that the nitrate transport is influenced by both boundary layer mass transfer resistance and well as membrane resistance consequently membrane resistance 1 pso was determined for both the membrane types and utilized to measure the overall kinetic coefficient ps see fig a 2 a larger membrane resistance for nitrate was observed for fas 1942 m2 s eq as compared to fad 1618 m2 s eq consistent with the results for the stirred cell section 4 2 1 with fad being a more open type anion exchange membrane in addition if the results in table 4 are converted into resistances with the same units we find that the overall resistance in the stirred cell is on the order of 4000 m2 s eq so the boundary layer resistance in the stirred cell was significant 4 3 donnan dialysis with spiral wound contactor for nitrate removal donnan dialysis experiments with the fad spiral module nitrate as a targeted pollutant and chloride as a counter ion in the co current mode were conducted with distinctive feed flow rates of 60 l h and 80 l h the feed nitrate concentration and the receiver flow were kept constant at 200 mg l and 100 l h respectively while chloride concentration and therefore the driving force in the receiver side was varied fig 5a shows that the transport rate of nitrate across the membrane increased with the increase of chloride concentration in the receiver side with both the flow rates however no significant increase in the nitrate transport rate was observed beyond a chloride concentration of 100 meq l this indicated that 100 meq l chloride was sufficient to induce the adequate driving force and extract the maximum amount of nitrate through the membrane furthermore receiver side chloride concentration of 50 meq l also appeared to be adequate resulting in only a slightly lower nitrate transport rate fig 5a experimental results also indicated that mass transfer coefficient varied from 40 to 70 meq h m2 while varying the feed flow from 60 to 80 l h along with the variation of chloride concentration fig 5b and fig 5c at both the flow rates the average value of mass transfer coefficient measured at steady state conditions increased with increase in chloride concentration this can be attributed to the higher receiver side chloride concentration generating higher driving force for fixed nitrate concentration similarly higher flow rates contribute to the large fluxes enabling the increasing value of mass transfer coefficients this shows that at the conditions tested the feed boundary layer mass transfer resistance is a significant part of the overall resistance as discussed above in conjunction with fig 2b higher sulfate transmembrane transport with fad may lead to its accumulation and subsequent reduction in as well as suppressing nitrate degradation in the bioside of the iemb this warranted using fas which resists sulfate transport 20 therefore a spiral wound contactor equipped with this anion exchange membrane was fabricated with revised channel heights using varying layers of 1 3 mm net spacers 1 1 3 mm on the feed side and 3 1 3 mm on the bioside the path length and membrane area were unchanged donnan dialysis experiments on the fas spiral module in the co current mode were conducted with feed flow rates of 60 l h 80 l h and 100 l h the nitrate concentration in feed chloride in the receiver and receiver flow rate were kept constant at 180 10 mg l 50 meq l and 100 l h respectively nitrate transport was observed to increase with an increase in feed flow rate producing maximum average nitrate cross membrane transport of 94 5 meq h m2 fig 6a higher flow also contributed to increase in the feed flux reflecting an enhanced mass transfer coefficient as depicted in fig 6b fas membrane being less permeable for sulfate was found to have approximately half the overall mass transfer coefficient to that of fad membrane fig 6c in addition lesser permeability of sulfate compared to nitrate can be attributed to its diffusion coefficient in the membrane which is approximately half that of nitrate 28 29 such membrane contactor appeared suitable and has been further adopted in iemb operation to remove nitrate 4 4 matlab based simulation for donnan dialysis membrane contactor the simulation of mechanistic behavior of spiral wound membrane contactors fad and fas was aimed to calculate the decay of nitrate from feed side chloride from the receiver side and nitrate flux from feed side over the membrane path length at different feed flow rates and compare to the experimental results the overall mass transfer coefficients for both membrane contactors were evaluated from batch donnan slit flow experiments with recycled solutions see sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 and used to simulate nitrate transport in donnan dialysis using a spiral wound membrane contactor see section 2 2 the detailed calculation of the predominant resistance using donnan slit experiments for both membranes are given in the appendix file two key assumptions were made in developing the simulation equations a chloride concentration in the membrane is proportional to the equivalent fraction of chloride in solution adjacent to membrane membrane ion exchange capacity b the interference of possible competing anions in feed such as sulfate and bicarbonate is ignored the output of fad and fas simulation are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively while matlab scripts are available as appendix files nitrate from the feed side decreased along the path length leaving 0 37 0 56 0 74 and 0 90 meq l of nitrate at the exit at the feed flow rates of 40 60 80 and 100 l h respectively consequently the nitrate transported across the membrane during donnan exchange accumulated on the receiver side and exited the module at a concentration of 1 14 1 6 1 99 and 2 33 meq l at the feed flow rates of 40 60 80 and 100 l h respectively fig 7a similarly chloride from receiver side decayed from 50 meq l to 47 66 meq l 100 l h in comparision the same appeared at the feed side with a maximum magnitude of 4 55 meq l 40 l h at the exit of the membrane fig 7b decrease in the feed side nitrate concentration along the path length reduces the driving force leading to a continuous decrease in the nitrate flux along the path length fig 7c at different designated flow rates the remaining feed side nitrate flux at the exit increased with increasing feed flow rates producing a maximum flux of 8 58 10 6 eq m2 s at a feed flow of 100 l h the exit fluxes predicted by the simulation showed that some driving force remained even at the exit of the membrane module and increased with an increase in the feed flow rates much of these effects can be understood by plotting results in terms of space time instead of distance the greater the flow rate the smaller will be the space time for a fixed path length and the less opportunity to remove nitrate fig 7d the closer that exit nitrate concentration vs space time plots fall on the same line for different flow rates the greater extent to which the predominant resistance will be the membrane mass transfer resistance in such a case the exit nitrate shows higher dependency on the operated flow rates as shown in fig 7d since the lines do not fall on each other the model simulation shows that boundary layer mass transfer resistances are not negligible in this system as the highest flow rate generates a space time plot with the lowest nitrate profile the differences between simulation results of fas nitrate and chloride transport and those of the fad module were marginal fig 8a fig 8b initial fluxes at different flow rates were smaller in the case of fas since it has a smaller pso value as compared to fad fig 8c a noticeable difference is that the nitrate space time plots for fas are more strongly separated than for the fad module compare fig 7d to fig 8d according to the simulation this implies that feed side boundary layer resistance is a more significant proportion of the overall mass transfer resistance for the fas module than the fad module for the experiments with the slit cell membrane fas had a somewhat higher membrane diffusive resistance table a 2 than fad making the spacetime simulation result surprising however it can be explained by the difference in module geometries as the feed side channel thickness is significantly higher for the fas module than the fad module 1 3 mm vs 0 72 mm calculated mass transfer resistances of the different membranes are shown in table a 3 for a given flow rate it can be seen that membrane resistance 1 pso is 30 of the feed side mass transfer resistance for fad while it is even less 25 for fas supporting the above conclusion that the ratio of feed side boundary layer mass transfer resistance to membrane diffusive resistance was higher for fas the model was validated by comparing the output nitrate concentration from the simulation with the experimental observations at different flow rates table 5 experimental exit nitrate concentrations for both membranes were in reasonable agreement with theoretically predicted concentrations within 10 20 discrepancy the marginal discrepancy may be due to the differences in the hydrodynamic conditions of slit flow system versus the spiral wound membrane contactor and possible structural artifacts in the assembly of the spiral wound membrane contactor it should be noted that spiral wound contactors are physically constructed using a specific type of membrane and may possess certain structural uncertainties while the geometry for the spiral wound contactors is somewhat similar to that of commercial spiral wound modules for pressure driven processes the construction and path characteristics are strikingly different the construction as shown in the relevant patent weimer 2017 involves 4 entrances instead of 3 a cocurrent counter current flow pattern instead of cross flow of pressure driven longitudinal feed and spiral permeate flow and a much longer path length 6 m instead of 1 m the possibility of non uniformity in such a module which is manually constructed is much greater in contrast the donnan slit flow experiments were conducted under better controlled conditions with accurately measured membrane area these differences in operating conditions may also be a contributing factor to such discrepancies observed in the output the robustness of the modeling can be substantiated by adjusting the values of counter ions chloride and target ions nitrate to forecast the exit concentrations of nitrate and chloride as well as the nitrate flux this in turn demonstrates its usefulness in designing a membrane contactor with the desired fluxes 5 conclusions the present work showed that a donnan dialysis contactor for iemb could be scaled up and provides 70 80 nitrate removal in a single pass of 1 2 5 m3 d the donnan dialysis experiments on the fas membrane based spiral contactor revealed effective mass transfer for nitrate while inhibiting the undesired sulfate transport from the feed the experimental data indicated that nitrate transport is influenced by both boundary layer mass transfer and membrane resistance matlab based simulation of the donnan dialysis process has demonstrated its usefulness in predicting the nitrate chloride and feed nitrate flux at any point along the path length results of such mechanistic modeling also revealed that the process has a scope to be scaled up further to exploit the available driving force if the donnan contactor can be operated at higher feed flow rates overall this work showed the potential for its applicability in the design and scale up of iemb for selective nitrate removal with the desired efficiency declaration of competing interest

refer to appendix b matlab script to integrate and solve eqs 7 10 aiming to generate the output in the form of nitrate chloride and flux variation along the length of contactor for fad and fas under the given conditions listed in table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 membrane characterization using a stirred diffusion cell and a slit flow cell setup the membranes types fad fas and fab by fumatech gmbh and pca100 by pca gmbh were screened in batch donnan dialysis experiments and characterized based on nitrate or sulfate transport from feed 0 005 m nacl 100 mg l no3 or so4 2 to receiver 0 05 m nacl compartment the primary characteristics of the membranes as provided by the manufacturers are summarized in table 2 these experiments were conducted in a cylindrical diffusion cell containing two compartments of 18 ml capacity each with an effective membrane area of 7 1 cm2 a magnetic bar in each chamber was used for stirring feed side and receiver side solutions were sampled at distinctive time intervals all the membranes were equilibrated with the above solutions before performing the donnan experiments the donnan slit flow cell setup was operated in recycling mode to determine the membrane resistance for feed solution tap water spiked with 100 mg l nitrate against a receiving solution of chloride 0 1 m tap water in the feed solution was used to mimic the real field situations and the operating conditions of spiral wound membrane contactor membranes fad pet75 and fas pet75 onward referred as fad and fas respectively were tested on a donnan slit plexiglass with plastic net spacers appendix fig a 1 at the operating conditions mentioned in table 3 each experimental run was for at least 2 h with equal volumes at the feed and receiver compartment of the dialyzer the solutions were maintained at 25 c using a water bath 3 2 donnan dialysis with anion exchange membrane spiral wound module donnan exchange spiral wound membrane modules containing fad and fas anion exchange membranes were procured from spiraltec gmbh germany the module configuration included a path length of 6 m a width of 0 45 m and an effective membrane area of 2 75 m2 feed and receiving side spacers were 0 72 and 5 2 mm thick respectively the membrane module was operated in co current mode with feed nitrate spiked tap water and receiver flows di water containing chloride the donnan contactor setup was operated at room temperature 25 5 c with stainless steel rotary vane pumps fluid o tech model no mg209xd1pt00000 on the feed and receiver side bioside digital flow meters tecfluid model no e 08960 were used at feed and bioside to indicate the flow all the required sensors and flow meter transmitters were connected to a data logger novus fieldlogger brazil with remote transmission via internet connection to record and transmit the various operating parameters such as flow rates l h individual as well as differential pressure millibars and temperature c desired parameters such as nitrate and chloride and sulfate were measured according to the requirements during the investigation nitrate was measured using the ultraviolet spectroscopic screening method 4500 no3 b while turbidimetric method 4500 so4 2 e was adapted to measure sulfate 27 all the experimental data in the paper are based on the average value of replicate runs 4 results and discussion 4 1 screening of different membranes using stirred diffusion cell the membranes under study were screened in small scale stirred batch donnan dialysis experiments and characterized on the basis of nitrate transport from feed to receiver compartment all the membranes except pca 100 produced substantial nitrate flux which was largely linearly dependent on nitrate concentration to a great extent the highest nitrate flux of 151 meq h m2 was shown by fad based on initial flux fig 2a whereas pca 100 showed only 2 meq h m2 nitrate flux at similar experimental conditions similar experiments were also conducted to characterize these membranes for sulfate transport from the feed compartment pca 100 membrane was excluded in these experiments since it already had much lower nitrate permeability in line with the nitrate flux the fad membrane also produced significant sulfate flux which linearly increased up to 15 mins and then became constant fig 2b such property of fad membrane possessing comparatively larger flux for sulfate is not desirable for the prospect of iemb operation since the transmembrane sulfate flux would be transferred to bioside leading to the accumulation and subsequent reduction of sulfate in fbbr leading to suppress nitrate biodegradation 20 on the other hand fab and fas membranes were observed to produce comparatively similar nitrate flux and at the same time significantly lesser sulfate flux fig 2b therefore spiral wound contactor equipped with fas as the anion exchange membrane with revised dimensions aiming to operate at higher flow rates were considered for the further pilot scale experiments with these modules the transfer rate of sulfate from feed to bioside is negligible at the same time they can provide higher nitrate loadings without reaching to the differential pressure limit set to 200 millibars by the manufacturer 4 2 batch kinetic analysis of nitrate and sulfate transport 4 2 1 stirred diffusion cell the batch kinetic modeling of fad and fas was established for nitrate and sulfate decay from the feed side according to the following flux eq 11 22 23 11 ln y p s 1 c f 1 c r s v f t where y c ta f c ta 0 1 c r c f 1 1 1 c r c f 1 the plot of ln y vs time t according to eq 11 gives the slope which is used to calculate overall mass transfer coefficient the batch kinetic modeling plots for nitrate and sulfate decay from the feed side are represented by fig 3a and b respectively membrane fas and fab showed a very marginal sulfate flux during the first 5 mins which prevailed almost constant as no significant change in the sulfate removal was observed for the extended time of sampling therefore only a few initial data points were considered for the kinetic modeling of these membranes kinetic coefficient ps was evaluated for nitrate and sulfate decay and presented in table 4 based on the nitrate and sulfate flux data the values of ps for all the membranes were considerably high 738 meq h m2 to 930 meq h m2 for nitrate whereas fad only produced a significant value of ps for sulfate membrane fas and fab showed a similar magnitude of ps 0 6 meq h m2 to 0 7 meq h m2 which was negligible compared to the fad membrane table 4 the kinetic coefficient and flux values suggest that membrane fad fas and fab can be considered for donnan nitrate removal in contrast only fad based membrane is suitable for both nitrate and sulfate removal from water and wastewater in contrast if the purpose is the selective removal of either nitrate or sulfate the data presented in table 4 may be utilized to decide the suitability of different membranes further we can surmise that those ps values that are significantly smaller sulfate for fas and fab and nitrate for pca100 indicating that the anion transport in those cases is controlled by the membrane diffusive resistance see eq 2 4 2 2 batch kinetic analysis slit cell typical plots for nitrate transport with slit cell for fad and fas are represented in fig 4 and are also found to obey eq 11 from the slopes obtained at the different flow rates plotting 1 ps vs 1 q0 875 was linear and the membrane diffusive resistance 1 pso was obtained see fig a 2 the experimental data indicated that the nitrate transport is influenced by both boundary layer mass transfer resistance and well as membrane resistance consequently membrane resistance 1 pso was determined for both the membrane types and utilized to measure the overall kinetic coefficient ps see fig a 2 a larger membrane resistance for nitrate was observed for fas 1942 m2 s eq as compared to fad 1618 m2 s eq consistent with the results for the stirred cell section 4 2 1 with fad being a more open type anion exchange membrane in addition if the results in table 4 are converted into resistances with the same units we find that the overall resistance in the stirred cell is on the order of 4000 m2 s eq so the boundary layer resistance in the stirred cell was significant 4 3 donnan dialysis with spiral wound contactor for nitrate removal donnan dialysis experiments with the fad spiral module nitrate as a targeted pollutant and chloride as a counter ion in the co current mode were conducted with distinctive feed flow rates of 60 l h and 80 l h the feed nitrate concentration and the receiver flow were kept constant at 200 mg l and 100 l h respectively while chloride concentration and therefore the driving force in the receiver side was varied fig 5a shows that the transport rate of nitrate across the membrane increased with the increase of chloride concentration in the receiver side with both the flow rates however no significant increase in the nitrate transport rate was observed beyond a chloride concentration of 100 meq l this indicated that 100 meq l chloride was sufficient to induce the adequate driving force and extract the maximum amount of nitrate through the membrane furthermore receiver side chloride concentration of 50 meq l also appeared to be adequate resulting in only a slightly lower nitrate transport rate fig 5a experimental results also indicated that mass transfer coefficient varied from 40 to 70 meq h m2 while varying the feed flow from 60 to 80 l h along with the variation of chloride concentration fig 5b and fig 5c at both the flow rates the average value of mass transfer coefficient measured at steady state conditions increased with increase in chloride concentration this can be attributed to the higher receiver side chloride concentration generating higher driving force for fixed nitrate concentration similarly higher flow rates contribute to the large fluxes enabling the increasing value of mass transfer coefficients this shows that at the conditions tested the feed boundary layer mass transfer resistance is a significant part of the overall resistance as discussed above in conjunction with fig 2b higher sulfate transmembrane transport with fad may lead to its accumulation and subsequent reduction in as well as suppressing nitrate degradation in the bioside of the iemb this warranted using fas which resists sulfate transport 20 therefore a spiral wound contactor equipped with this anion exchange membrane was fabricated with revised channel heights using varying layers of 1 3 mm net spacers 1 1 3 mm on the feed side and 3 1 3 mm on the bioside the path length and membrane area were unchanged donnan dialysis experiments on the fas spiral module in the co current mode were conducted with feed flow rates of 60 l h 80 l h and 100 l h the nitrate concentration in feed chloride in the receiver and receiver flow rate were kept constant at 180 10 mg l 50 meq l and 100 l h respectively nitrate transport was observed to increase with an increase in feed flow rate producing maximum average nitrate cross membrane transport of 94 5 meq h m2 fig 6a higher flow also contributed to increase in the feed flux reflecting an enhanced mass transfer coefficient as depicted in fig 6b fas membrane being less permeable for sulfate was found to have approximately half the overall mass transfer coefficient to that of fad membrane fig 6c in addition lesser permeability of sulfate compared to nitrate can be attributed to its diffusion coefficient in the membrane which is approximately half that of nitrate 28 29 such membrane contactor appeared suitable and has been further adopted in iemb operation to remove nitrate 4 4 matlab based simulation for donnan dialysis membrane contactor the simulation of mechanistic behavior of spiral wound membrane contactors fad and fas was aimed to calculate the decay of nitrate from feed side chloride from the receiver side and nitrate flux from feed side over the membrane path length at different feed flow rates and compare to the experimental results the overall mass transfer coefficients for both membrane contactors were evaluated from batch donnan slit flow experiments with recycled solutions see sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 and used to simulate nitrate transport in donnan dialysis using a spiral wound membrane contactor see section 2 2 the detailed calculation of the predominant resistance using donnan slit experiments for both membranes are given in the appendix file two key assumptions were made in developing the simulation equations a chloride concentration in the membrane is proportional to the equivalent fraction of chloride in solution adjacent to membrane membrane ion exchange capacity b the interference of possible competing anions in feed such as sulfate and bicarbonate is ignored the output of fad and fas simulation are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively while matlab scripts are available as appendix files nitrate from the feed side decreased along the path length leaving 0 37 0 56 0 74 and 0 90 meq l of nitrate at the exit at the feed flow rates of 40 60 80 and 100 l h respectively consequently the nitrate transported across the membrane during donnan exchange accumulated on the receiver side and exited the module at a concentration of 1 14 1 6 1 99 and 2 33 meq l at the feed flow rates of 40 60 80 and 100 l h respectively fig 7a similarly chloride from receiver side decayed from 50 meq l to 47 66 meq l 100 l h in comparision the same appeared at the feed side with a maximum magnitude of 4 55 meq l 40 l h at the exit of the membrane fig 7b decrease in the feed side nitrate concentration along the path length reduces the driving force leading to a continuous decrease in the nitrate flux along the path length fig 7c at different designated flow rates the remaining feed side nitrate flux at the exit increased with increasing feed flow rates producing a maximum flux of 8 58 10 6 eq m2 s at a feed flow of 100 l h the exit fluxes predicted by the simulation showed that some driving force remained even at the exit of the membrane module and increased with an increase in the feed flow rates much of these effects can be understood by plotting results in terms of space time instead of distance the greater the flow rate the smaller will be the space time for a fixed path length and the less opportunity to remove nitrate fig 7d the closer that exit nitrate concentration vs space time plots fall on the same line for different flow rates the greater extent to which the predominant resistance will be the membrane mass transfer resistance in such a case the exit nitrate shows higher dependency on the operated flow rates as shown in fig 7d since the lines do not fall on each other the model simulation shows that boundary layer mass transfer resistances are not negligible in this system as the highest flow rate generates a space time plot with the lowest nitrate profile the differences between simulation results of fas nitrate and chloride transport and those of the fad module were marginal fig 8a fig 8b initial fluxes at different flow rates were smaller in the case of fas since it has a smaller pso value as compared to fad fig 8c a noticeable difference is that the nitrate space time plots for fas are more strongly separated than for the fad module compare fig 7d to fig 8d according to the simulation this implies that feed side boundary layer resistance is a more significant proportion of the overall mass transfer resistance for the fas module than the fad module for the experiments with the slit cell membrane fas had a somewhat higher membrane diffusive resistance table a 2 than fad making the spacetime simulation result surprising however it can be explained by the difference in module geometries as the feed side channel thickness is significantly higher for the fas module than the fad module 1 3 mm vs 0 72 mm calculated mass transfer resistances of the different membranes are shown in table a 3 for a given flow rate it can be seen that membrane resistance 1 pso is 30 of the feed side mass transfer resistance for fad while it is even less 25 for fas supporting the above conclusion that the ratio of feed side boundary layer mass transfer resistance to membrane diffusive resistance was higher for fas the model was validated by comparing the output nitrate concentration from the simulation with the experimental observations at different flow rates table 5 experimental exit nitrate concentrations for both membranes were in reasonable agreement with theoretically predicted concentrations within 10 20 discrepancy the marginal discrepancy may be due to the differences in the hydrodynamic conditions of slit flow system versus the spiral wound membrane contactor and possible structural artifacts in the assembly of the spiral wound membrane contactor it should be noted that spiral wound contactors are physically constructed using a specific type of membrane and may possess certain structural uncertainties while the geometry for the spiral wound contactors is somewhat similar to that of commercial spiral wound modules for pressure driven processes the construction and path characteristics are strikingly different the construction as shown in the relevant patent weimer 2017 involves 4 entrances instead of 3 a cocurrent counter current flow pattern instead of cross flow of pressure driven longitudinal feed and spiral permeate flow and a much longer path length 6 m instead of 1 m the possibility of non uniformity in such a module which is manually constructed is much greater in contrast the donnan slit flow experiments were conducted under better controlled conditions with accurately measured membrane area these differences in operating conditions may also be a contributing factor to such discrepancies observed in the output the robustness of the modeling can be substantiated by adjusting the values of counter ions chloride and target ions nitrate to forecast the exit concentrations of nitrate and chloride as well as the nitrate flux this in turn demonstrates its usefulness in designing a membrane contactor with the desired fluxes 5 conclusions the present work showed that a donnan dialysis contactor for iemb could be scaled up and provides 70 80 nitrate removal in a single pass of 1 2 5 m3 d the donnan dialysis experiments on the fas membrane based spiral contactor revealed effective mass transfer for nitrate while inhibiting the undesired sulfate transport from the feed the experimental data indicated that nitrate transport is influenced by both boundary layer mass transfer and membrane resistance matlab based simulation of the donnan dialysis process has demonstrated its usefulness in predicting the nitrate chloride and feed nitrate flux at any point along the path length results of such mechanistic modeling also revealed that the process has a scope to be scaled up further to exploit the available driving force if the donnan contactor can be operated at higher feed flow rates overall this work showed the potential for its applicability in the design and scale up of iemb for selective nitrate removal with the desired efficiency declaration of competing interest

12396,wastewater treatment plants wwtps optimal operation is vital for sustainable wastewater management nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs and architectures optimized by genetic

importance to the modern society reliable water and power supply are crucial elements for national security and human sustainable development by the year of 2025 water supply might turn out to be one of the most serious national concerns based on reported predictions 1 one of the typical cases for water energy interactions are the wastewater treatment plants wwtps at present environmental and climatic changes are in the focus of worldwide attention 2 in recent years focus has shifted from improving effluent quality to addressing challenges concerning energy management greenhouse gas ghg emissions of wwtps 3 and resources recovery 4 these plants consume considerable amounts of energy estimated to be responsible for 1 to 3 of the global energy consumption 5 the energy usage of the wastewater treatment process is also the main contributor to the of wwtp operation costs 6 of the total energy consumption the aeration process of wwtps accounts for 45 75 consequently being a major portion of the overall operational costs 7 for example in greece wwtps the share of aeration process from the total energy requirements was reported as 67 2 on average 8 demonstrating the importance of improving the operation of the aerated process in terms of energy efficiency additionally the aeration unit process accounts for the majority of on site ghg emissions according to 9 as a result several studies aiming the improvement of wwtp operation focused on the aerobic digestion process decreasing energy consumption for aeration being one of the main strategies with high perspectives for achieving carbon neutral wwtps 10 the most common approach is the performance enhancement of the dissolved oxygen do control system or optimization of its associated controller s setpoint qambar al khalidy used machine learning methods to dynamically optimize the do setpoint concluding that energy savings of 23 could be achieved by implementing the optimized do setpoints in a wwtp 11 piotrowski et al optimized the do controller parameters in case of a batch type biological treatment plant using stochastic optimization algorithm they obtained lower do setpoints values than with the employment of a nonoptimized pid controller 12 meaning a reduction in the energy consumption for the aeration process in parallel with reducing energy consumption ghg emissions should also be evaluated while energy savings for the aeration process can be achieved by lowering the do controller s setpoint at a certain point it can result in the incomplete nitrification 13 this leads to the build up of no2 and nh4 ensuing in the increase of concentration for these undesired chemical components 14 at do setpoint setting of lower value than 1 mg l the increase in n2o cannot be ignored 15 as in these circumstances the growth in greenhouse gas emissions can counterbalance the ghgs emissions reduction associated to the 25 saving in aeration energy consumption 16 as such it is important to investigate alternative operation strategies of the aeration process leading to energy savings without a severe increase in ghg emissions one of the possibilities is the uneven distribution of compressed air along the aerated bioreactor 17 several studies approached the operation optimization of wwtps using artificial intelligence ai methods and relying on the development of data driven models prediction of effluent parameters is a typical example of such applications in the study of wwtps successful implementations of steady state artificial neural network ann models were used for predictions of biological oxygen demand bod5 and total suspended solids tss 18 or suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand cod 19 dynamic models such as nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs narx were also applied with good results for effluent quality prediction of cod and total nitrogen tn levels 20 similar ann models were found efficient for prediction of wwtp performance indices such as aeration energy ae effluent quality eq and pumping energy pe which were further employed in the optimization of setpoint values for the do and nitrate and nitrite concentration no control loops resulting in reduced energy consumption and improved effluent quality 21 furthermore prediction of gaseous emissions h2s in the influent chamber of wwtps was accomplished using multivariate narx model 22 a hybrid model employing ann was utilized in prediction of liquid n2o production in a nitrifying sequencing batch reactor 23 however no studies focused on predicting ghg emissions of wwtps with the support of such networks in other fields of study ai techniques were applied with success in development of data driven models for ghg emission predictions emissions for buildings construction were predicted using explainable ai 24 while another data driven model predicted ghg emissions of high speed rail stations 25 a neural network model was used to predict the effects of climate change on emissions of ghg under climatic scenarios by modelling energy demand forecasting an increase of ghg emissions 26 anns were also employed in modelling and predicting ghg emissions in wheat production of iran with the best topology showing a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 998 for ghg emissions 27 ghg intensity and emissions in europe were predicted using ann models with a mean absolute percentage error mape value of 6 4 in case of ghg emission predictions for eu members 28 d z antanasijević et al coupled principal component analysis with ann resulting in a model forecasting ghg emissions at the national level with a mape value of only 3 6 29 the mentioned studies illustrate the possibility of developing accurate ann models for ghg emission predictions which is one of the aims of the current research while approaching the case of municipal wwtps and using narx models one of the challenges in ann development and a determining factor for the ann s prediction performance is the selection of ann optimal hyperparameters for the investigated dataset 30 as such optimization is required to find the best fit for the given dataset 31 as a result hybrid intelligent models were developed they bring an improvement in both accuracy and generalization ability of the single intelligent models 32 as the hybrid intelligent models demonstrate an advantage over single intelligent models 33 in recent studies on performance of predictions for wwtps by hybrid intelligent models evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga were applied in a collaborative fashion for optimizing the hyperparameters of different ann models water quality prediction in drinking water treatment plants was achieved by a hybrid artificial neural network that used a genetic algorithm to optimize the ann structure 34 similarly a multi layer perceptron network whose optimal topology was searched for by genetic algorithm was used in effluent quality prediction for a municipal wwtp 32 this study aims to find optimal aeration parameters i e three gain factors steering the air flowrate distribution for an operation strategy of the aeration unit process conducting to an optimized distribution of air flow to the aerated bioreactor and to evaluate it in terms of energy consumption effluent quality and ghg emissions in the current study ghg emissions were considered for the biological reactors and associated settlers of the water line as they represent the most important source of ghgs the computation of the optimal operation parameters for the proposed aeration strategy was relying on the predictions of the wwtp performance indices effluent quality and ghg emissions using dynamic hybrid intelligent models based on simulated data these dynamic neural network narx models for which the optimal topology was searched for by means of ga will be further referred to as ga narx to the authors knowledge there are no studies associated with hybrid intelligent modelling based on ga optimized narx models aimed at simulating the wwtp processes furthermore the dynamic modelling of ghg emissions in wwtps by means of ann models is also a novelty of the present work the main steps of the current paper were i generation of the representative dataset by using the calibrated analytical model of the municipal wwtp considered as case study and by taking into account the specifically and multiple designed scenarios of operational parameters ii development of ga narx methodology for searching the optimal ann topology in terms of structure of narx network at training number of hidden layers nhl number of neurons in each hidden layer nnehl and transfer functions tfs iii employment of the ann developed models in a multi objective optimization step for finding the optimal operational aeration parameters iv testing the optimal operational parameters on the analytical model and comparison of energy consumption effluent quality and ghg emissions performance with the standard wwtp operation 2 methodology the ga narx model development and multi objective optimization processes were performed in matlab 2021a 35 2 1 data generation an analytical model based on activated sludge model no 1 was utilized for the generation of the dataset required for the development of ga narx models the dynamic simulator based on the benchmark simulation model no 1 bsm1 was previously built in simulink software environment and calibrated using dynamic data collected at the local municipal wwtp with a 420 000 population equivalents p e capacity as detailed in 36 the studied wwtp has an anaerobic anoxic oxic layout where the aerated bioreactor was divided in three smaller equally dimensioned reactors and features two control loops responsible for the carbon removal and nitrogen removal nitrification and denitrification are controlled by manipulating the aeration and nitrate recycling flowrates of the bioreactors for each of the aerated reactors the air flowrate can be distributed unevenly using three gain factors g1 g3 as can be seen in fig 1 in order to obtain a comprehensive dataset of 64 different scenarios corresponding to differently designed air flowrates the associated gain combinations were chosen based on full factorial design with each gain factor having 4 levels for the first 10 days of the simulation a standard scenario for the air flowrate gains was employed and data from these days was excluded in the ga narx development process in order to diminish the effect of initial conditions on the dataset to be further used for ann training following these 10 days each combination of gain factors was introduced and kept constant for the next 7 days interval it was succeeded by the next scenario of 7 days for new combination of the gain factors until the last scenario was reached consequently a total of 458 days of simulated data without the 10 initialization days was collected with a temporal resolution of 30 min i e a total of 21 984 datapoints this entire dataset was randomly divided into training validation and testing datasets in a 70 15 15 ratio for the ann model development the input and output features used in the development of the models are shown in table 1 additional information on the input and output features such as variance or correlation between inputs and outputs can be found in the supplementary material 2 2 ga narx model development narx networks represent the type of feed forward neural network that employ in their architecture a tapped delay line block between the ann model time series inputs and the first hidden layer the line allows data from several past time moments of both input and target datasets to be utilized in the prediction of the target variable value at the proximate sampling moment of time due to this construction narx models are suitable for applications requiring time series prediction these neural networks can be developed in two fashions the open structure feeds from the original target dataset the ann inputs standing for the past values of the targets while the closed structure utilizes the ann self simulated past target values to compute the target value at the subsequent moment of time finding the optimal architecture is crucial in the development of ann models influencing the model s prediction accuracy generalization ability and nonetheless the required computational time this challenging optimization task becomes unfeasible by classical optimization methods when considering the complex dependency between the training objective function and the ann hyperparameters such as nhehl nhl and tf considered as decision variables population based algorithms such as gas provide appropriate means for finding the global optimum in the ann architecture optimization 33 genetic algorithm is one of the most frequently used evolutionary algorithms being a stochastic global search and optimization method based on a population set of searching points its incentives rely on not necessitating computation of objective function derivatives or having no need of considering restricting preconditions for the objective function while the performed global search approaches well or even reaches the global minimum several constraints on the decision variables for the narx architecture were considered in case of nhl ann hyperparameter only models with 1 or 2 hidden layers were considered nhehl was bound between 2 and 15 for each hidden layer tf at each hidden layer was taken either as a logistic sigmoid logsig function or as a tangent sigmoid tansig function the optimal structure of the narx model was searched both for the open and closed structures training with validation was employed in order to avoid overfitting the training process was performed with the levenberg marquardt algorithm as it is the most frequently used optimization algorithm in wwtp applications 37 the tapped delay line horizons for the ann input and output data were taken with the time length of 12 sampling intervals meaning that input and target data from the previous 6 h were employed in the computation of the output value at the next sampling moment this is described in a general form by eq 1 1 x t f x t 1 x t 2 x t n y u t 1 u t 2 u t n u where x is the output signal u represents the input signal while n y and n u are tapped delay line horizons for the two signals both equal to 12 the decision criteria for selecting the best ga narx model was the mean absolute percentage error mape between the target and output values of the testing dataset eq 2 2 mape i 1 n data y i x i y i n data 100 here n data is the number of data points y i is the desired output at data point i and x i is the ann model simulated or predicted output at the same data point i y i and x i are non scaled values the anns were developed using as exogenous inputs the following 7 input variables of the wwtp influent cod organic nitrogen concentration flowrate qi and temperature te supplemented with the three gain aeration factors g1 to g3 ga narx models were developed for output variables aeration energy pumping energy effluent quality ghg emissions for effluent concentrations of total suspended solids chemical oxygen demand biological oxygen demand total kjeldahl nitrogen nitrates and nitrites and for effluent wastewater flowrate only models with a single output were considered as these were previously found to offer superior accuracy and generalization ability compared to multiple output models 21 details of the wwtp influent and ranges for the air flow gain settings that were used as ann model inputs are presented in table 2 2 3 estimation of ghg emissions evaluation of the ghg emissions was performed at the water line level of the wwtp due to the limitations of an bsm1 type model on site and off site emissions of co2 and n2o were considered other than co2 the emissions of n2o gases had been included as their global warming potential gwp is 265 298 times higher than co2 considered for an average residence time of 100 years 47 emissions due to n2o can constitute half or even more of the total ghg emissions when on site co2 is not considered 38 the contribution of on site ch4 emission was not considered as the studied plant benefits of a biogas recovery and reuse system in which case the on site ch4 emissions reach a neglectable contribution to the total on site emissions 9 furthermore the use of the biogas can reduce costs and ghg emissions by utilization to generate electrical energy 39 or by biogas upgrade to transport fuel 40 in order to facilitate the comparison with other results and over a larger variety of wwtp dimensions in the present study the ghg emissions were related per cubic meter of processed wastewater kg co2 eq m3 ww the assessment of the on site co2 emissions released due to the aerobic biological processes

time taken as 15 days for the current municipal wwtp case the on site n2o emissions kg n2o m3 ww were estimated using the following formula 4 p n 2 o on site e f n 2 o tn where e f n 2 o is the emission factor kg n2o kg n with the value of 0 005 related to n2o production based on influent n loading 43 and δtn is the specific difference tn mass between wwtp influent and effluent kg n m3 ww in the off site co2 emissions kg co2 m3 ww generation of the electricity was taken into consideration related to the energy consumption of the wwtp the following relationship was used for the estimation of these off site co2 emissions based on 44 5 p co 2 off site k pg e d q i where k pg is the emission factor per unit of generated energy to be consumed in the wwtp its value was taken as 0 323 kg co2

transfer coefficient in aerated bioreactor i q nr is the flowrate of the nitrate recirculation q ras the flowrate of the return activated sludge and q waste the flowrate of waste from the secondary

emissions 8 p n 2 o off site n e ef e where n e is the load of n discharged into the receiving water body and ef e is the emission factor of n2o from the wastewater discharged with a value of 7 857 10

then summed with the co2 emissions eq 9 9 ghg p co 2 on site p co 2 off site gwp n 2 o p n 2 o on site p n 2 o off site the value for gwp n 2 o was taken as 298 47 for obtaining the ghg emissions in kg co2 eq m3 ww unit 2 4 optimization of airflow distribution the optimal values of the gain factors determining the distribution of air in the three aerated bioreactors were searched for by taking into account a 7 days duration scenario several performance indices had to be considered in the optimization process although the focus was the reduction of energy consumption other aspects such as ghg emissions and effluent quality ought to be considered as well the values for the considered performance indices were obtained by predictions made with the specially designed and trained ga narx models effluent quality eq was taken in consideration as a performance index describing the daily discharged mass of pollution encompassing pollutions based on effluent components total suspended solids tss cod bod5 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nitrate and nitrite nitrogen no and effluent flowrate qe as shown in eq 10 10 eq 1 t 1000 0 t pu tss t pu cod t pu bod t pu tkn t pu no t q e t dt the daily discharged mass of pollution in units of kg pollution unit d kgpu d was calculated by converting the pollution from different sources to comprehensive pollution units based on the weighting factors described in 48 combining directly the previously mentioned wwtp performance indices energy consumption ghg emissions and effluent quality into a single objective function was not plausible as their values are orders of magnitude apart due to their units of measurements consequently arbitrarily chosen weighting factors would have to be applied to bring the mentioned performance indices to a similar importance in the single objective function accordingly a multi objective optimization method was employed based on ga that computes a set of non dominated solutions called the pareto front in this front each point represents a solution that fulfils the objectives as best as possible and no further improvement could be made in one of the objectives without a simultaneous deterioration of the other objectives 49 the objective functions taking into account the energy consumption and ghg emissions were chosen as shown in eqs 11 12 and quantify the energy demand and the total ghg emissions of the plant 11 f min 1 e d 12 f min 2 ghg for the objective function concerning effluent quality two distinct cases were considered in case 1 the third objective function was considered equal to the ann predicted eq 13 f min 3 eq in this case a ga narx model was used to directly predict the effluent quality index however in this manner concentrations of the individual chemical components different pollution sources remain unrevealed and it is worthy to note that although unlikely an optimal solution where the overall eq is reduced could result in one of the pollutants exceeding its regulated loading limit and negatively affect the receiving water body in case 2 the eq was computed based on eq 10 meaning that 6 distinct ga narx models were developed to predict the individual concentrations of the 5 different chemical indicators and the effluent flowrate this approach allowed the investigation and consider penalizations due to violations of the regulated loading limits the third objective function in case 2 was calculated as eq if no loading limits were violated at any moment in time while in the opposite situation a penalty was applied by multiplying the eq value with a factor between 1 1 and 2 this factor was computed based on the fraction of timeframe any of the loading limits were breached during to the period of observation eq 14 14 f min 3 eq eq 1 1 0 9 t p t if cod 125 tn 10 bod 25 if cod 125 or tn 10 or bod 25 here t p is the period of time any of the pollutant concentrations were above the following limits for cod 125 g o2 m3 for tn 10 g n m3 and for bod5 25 g o2 m3 these limits were considered according to the national specific values for romania h g nr 352 2005 3 results and discussion on site ghg emissions due to biochemical reactions and off site ghg emissions generated by electricity consumption were estimated as co2 equivalent ga narx models were developed for a variety of output features by the method developed in this study and their performance was compared to results obtained in other studies these neural network models were further used for the optimization of the airflow distribution in the aerated bioreactors the most promising values obtained from the airflow distribution optimization were tested on the first principle model and compared to the results obtained in the base case 3 1 ghg emissions the removal efficiencies for cod and tn in the studied system were 92 5 and 90 6 respectively based on the data obtained from simulations with the calibrated bsm1 model the amount of ghg emissions produced on site and off site for the base case settings i e g1 to g3 equal to 1 are shown in units of kg co2 eq mm3 ww in table 3 the results showed that on site emissions make up around 79 of the total ghg emissions which is in line with previous findings that in case of wwtps serving 100 000 population equivalents the on site emissions contribute with 70 to the total ghg emissions 43 at the same time the aeration unit proved to be the major contributor from all units of the plant to the on site ghg emissions this is in line with reported values of up to 86 9 and is revealing the need and importance of optimizing the aeration process the ratio of co2 to n2o on site emissions in the current study is larger than in the previously mentioned research almost 4 1 compared to 1 23 1 this can be partially explained by the difference in the e f n 2 o values used i e 0 005 kg n2o kg n in this study while in the other research the value of 0 0754 kg n2o kg n was obtained based on the provided data 9 significant variations can be observed in the literature in terms of values of specific ghg emissions the results obtained in the current study are in the range of 0 02 to 0 29 kg co2 eq p e d as reported by 50 from the total ghg emissions 63 2 come from biogenic emissions showing that not taking into account these types of emissions would lead to an underestimation of the wwtp ghg emissions 3 2 ga narx models a total of 10 multiple input single output ga narx models were developed to predict energy consumption ghg emissions and effluent quality of the studied wwtp fig 2 these networks used the previously presented 7 input features codi organic n qi te g1 g2 and g3 plus the output feature in a recurrent fashion to model each targeted parameter for the ga settings a population size of 50 was considered and the number of maximum generations was set to 50 as in most cases no significant improvement was observed at larger generation values similar to the findings in case of a more complex ann hyperparameters optimization tasks 32 the models that showed the best accuracy for the testing dataset were further evaluated and additionally tested by using the ga narx to predict a 7 days scenario with a previously unseen combination of aeration gain factors in order to perform the predictions the models had to be used in the closed loop structure using predictions from previous time steps as inputs for making the proximate time step prediction the optimal network hyperparameters and mape prediction results for this new scenario are shown in table 4 in most cases the optimal ga narx model for single output prediction was found to possesses two hidden layers commonly with the tangent sigmoid tf for the first hidden layer the number of neurons was typically found to be situated in the upper region of the assumed bounded range of values for both the first and second hidden layers this confirms the non linearity and complexity of the modelling tasks the mape values for the developed ga narx models were placed between 1 14 and 21 5 when the anns were fed with previously unseen input data the outstanding result when predicting the effluent flowrate can be attributed to the strong linear correlation to the influent flowrate despite the more or less regular daily cyclic behaviour the ga narx responsible for modelling the ghg emissions was one of the most accurate networks developed in the current study based on the novel approach the ghg emissions model performed remarkably well when used for predictions the similarity between targeted and predicted series can be observed in fig 3 the mentioned ga narx revealed a slightly lower mape value of 1 24 compared to ann based ghg models found in the literature e g an artificial neural network coupled with principle component analysis reached a mape value of 3 60 when forecasting ghg emissions at the national level 29 while in another study generalized regression neural network models were used for ghg intensity and energy consumption predictions but reaching mape of 6 40 for the ghg emission predictions at the national level for european countries 28 the developed model could serve as an efficient tool in evaluating plant operation strategies for reducing ghg emissions of wwtps 3 3 implications the models were developed with synthetic data based on a first principle model calibrated with real data and as a result the developed ga narx can be considered to be pre trained for utilization in the real facility however based on measured of inferred data an adaptation of the network weight and biases would be required when employing the models at the same time a data pre processing step should be added in order to filter the measured data fed to the model the accuracy of the ga narx models was found to be comparable to the results reported in the literature for ann models predicting wwtp effluent table 5 it should also be noted that the presented literature results were obtained using real data the least accurate predictions mape 21 5 were obtained in case of eq owing to the intricacy of the different factors that make up the studied index the utilization as input data of only the variables that would be available by measurements and at a temporal resolution of at least 30 min at the municipal wwtp also increases the difficulty of describing this output as the selection of input and output features also influences the model performance 51 although it presents a larger mape value the coefficient of determination r2 of the ga narx model in question is equal to 0 94 similar to the bod model developed by 52 the proposed approach of using ga for the optimization of narx hyperparameters facilitates the development of such dynamic network models by offering an automatic process for the search of optimal network topology in comparison to methods such as trial and error at the same time it also requires less computational time then the trial of all possible combinations of the studied hyperparameters and results in models with similar accuracy to those reported in the literature the mentioned studies focused on the development of different ann models to predict one or more process parameters and concluded on their applicability based on the model s performance the current study took a step further and employed these models in multi objective optimization of a proposed wwtp operation strategy showing the possible benefits of using the ga narx models 3 4 airflow distribution optimization the optimization of the airflow to the aerated bioreactors was performed for the two presented cases regarding the prediction of the eq index fig 2 in the first case the eq values were predicted by ga narx model with eq as its output variable while in the second case the eq was calculated as described in eq 10 based on the predicted values of tss cod bod tkn no and qe provided by the models that had these wwtp effluent variables as ann outputs table 4 in order to find the optimal values for the three airflow gain factors g1 g3 which best satisfy all three objectives a multi objective optimization was performed using ga the population size for the ga was selected as 50 the maximum number of generations was set to 600 and the pareto set fraction value was chosen as 0 35 in this fashion the optimizations resulted in pareto fronts of 18 points the results of the first optimization case are presented in table 6 they show the optimal settings for the gain factors g1 to g3 related to the airflow distribution for each aerated reactor as well as the obtained performance indices in terms of energy demand ghg emissions and effluent quality in order to select the most promising combination of gain factors a scoring system was applied in case of each of the three objectives scores were given in ascending order from 1 to 18 to every combination of gains these scores were then be summed in order to determine the final ranking between the 18 pareto front points and the three combinations with the lowest scores were selected to be evaluated the latter are highlighted in the tables below the final decision on the values considered as the most favourable gain factors was taken by analysing the selected combinations the scores for the points of both pareto fronts can be found in the supplementary material for a better visualization of the interdependencies between the three objectives the pareto front resulting from the first optimization case is presented in two 2d graphics instead of a single 3d illustration shown in fig 4 the location of the three best solutions highlighted in tables 6 and 7 were also pinpointed with arrows in the pareto front i e points 1 3 and 16 for fig 4 a in fig 4 a it can be observed that both objectives i e ghg emissions and energy consumption can be minimized at the same time and that was expected due the off site co2 emissions estimation eq 5 on the other hand fig 4 b shows that there is a conflicting situation when trying to optimize both ghg emissions and effluent quality this was also expected as the on site ghg emissions depend on differences between the wwtp influent and effluent concentrations of the relevant chemical components as such the slight increase of eq due to larger values of the component concentration in effluent is associated to the reduction in ghg emissions the concern in the first optimization case is that although the changes in eq are not significant the concentrations of the individual chemical components are not revealed and they might exceed the regulated limitations in the second optimization case for the aeration gain factors g1 g3 the possibility of the chemical indicators breaching the allowed concentrations is taken into account in the specially designed third objective function the pareto front results obtained in this case are presented in table 7 and fig 5 similarly to the first optimization case based on the predicted results of this case the trade off solution between ghg emissions and effluent quality is also needed but this can be accomplished in more reliable way when comparison is made to case 1 this is due to the change of the pareto front for the ghg emissions v s energy consumption indices while the front of ghg emissions v s energy demand remained similar to the first optimization case the three most promising solutions i e 2 10 and 18 are located exactly in the mentioned region where both ghg and eq objectives are best satisfied it can also be observed that there are no abrupt increases in the eq values meaning that the optimal gain combinations do not lead to the increase of any effluent chemical component above its limit the three most promising airflow distribution settings obtained from both optimization cases were evaluated by implementing them in a 7 days long simulation scenario that utilized the wwtp first principle extensive model for assessing the plant performance the obtained results were compared to the base case where the three gain factors were set to 1 and the same 7 days scenario was used the wwtp operation performance values obtained for energy demand ghg emissions and effluent quality in these selected cases are presented in table 8 it can be observed that all combinations of gain factors g1 g3 chosen with the proposed approach bring improvements for of all three performance indices studied at the same time it is noticeable that the energy consumption and ghg emissions reductions are closely related off site co2 emissions accompanied by the decrease in effluent quality values the results signify that the reduction of energy consumption related to aeration does not lead to the increase of effluent concentrations which is also expected due to maintaining the setpoint of the control loop i e original value of 2 responsible for the dissolved oxygen level at the outlet of the last aerated bioreactor the most savings in terms of energy consumption were achieved in optimization case 1 number 1 where the results show savings of approximatively 2 relative to the base case simultaneously leading to the lowest ghg emissions accounting for an improvement of 0 28 coupled with a decrease of almost 1 in effluent quality for the effluent quality the best result was obtained in optimization case 1 number 16 characterized by a decrease of 1 14 in eq together with a reduction of 1 85 in energy requirements and 0 25 less ghg emissions the contributions of co2 and n2o emissions to total ghg emissions and of the different pollution sources to eq during the studied 7 days scenario for these two optimized cases optimization case 1 number 1 and number 16 were investigated and compared to the base case they are shown in fig 6 it can be observed that the highest change of the effluent quality index when it is compared to the base case shown in fig 6 a can be assigned to tkn the decrease observed for this contributor can be attributed to the more abundant distribution of air at the beginning of the aerated bioreactor and facilitating the nitrification process which results in the increase of pollution due to no this is shown for both optimized cases in fig 6 b and c at the same time the increase in no concentration positively affects the energy consumption by enabling the achievement of the no concentration setpoint in the anoxic bioreactor which is the goal of the denitrification control loop with a lower flowrate of the nitrate recycling stream the decrease of this flowrate has an impact on reducing the pumping energy the results for ghg emissions show that although biogenic the on site co2 emissions remain the predominant contributor and approaches such as carbon capture could be considered for the diminution of these emissions the very slight increase in the on site co2 emissions can be explained by the improved removal of cod and bod which is also confirmed by the effluent quality results while the change of on site and off site n2o emissions balance each other the largest change and reduction in ghg emissions can be attributed to the off site co2 emissions revealing that the proposed strategy results in a lower energy demand for pumping and aeration based on the presented results the most advantageous combination of gain factors g1 g3 for the proposed strategy of uneven air flowrate distribution optimisation case 1 and point number 16 found through multi objective optimization utilizing the developed ga narx models led to improvements in all three investigated objectives when wwtp performance is compared to the classical operation base case the presented optimization method is suitable for searching for optimal distribution factors in case of both longer and shorter timeframes such as seasonal or short event based strategies according to the slow or quick changes in weather conditions another important aspect and advantage of employing the ga narx models was the reduced computational requirements as can be expected of the ann models compared to the first principal mathematical model the multi objective optimization process was finalized in almost 250 s in the first case while close to 1700 s were required in the second case in comparison a single run of the 7 day scenario on the first principle mathematical model finished in 205 s on the same processing unit taking into consideration optimization case 2 the slower of the two and assuming that the optimization on the mathematical model would require the same number of iterations to finalize i e 18 950 iterations or 379 generations results in a processing time of almost 45 days based on these numbers there is at least a four orders of magnitude difference in processing time of the multi objective optimization task in favour of the ga narx models consequently these models could also be of interest for real time optimization applications 4 conclusions the development of a new ga optimized narx model was performed to describe the complex wwtp processes predicting the wwtp water line effluents and performance indicators the narx architecture optimization by ga enables automatizing the ann design and training while reducing the reliance on experts experience the models developed succeeded to predict wwtp effluent concentrations with mape values between 1 136 and 16 196 while prediction of wwtp performance indices presented mape values of 1 226 to 21 460 the prediction performance of the novel ga narx model for ghg emissions was the third best at forecasting amongst the ten developed models mape 1 244 the ga narx models were further utilized in a multi objective optimization task of the proposed uneven aeration strategy in the nitrification bioreactor the optimization objectives consisted of wwtp energy consumption ghg emissions and effluent quality two multi objective optimization cases were considered and the best points from the pareto fronts were tested on the mathematical model revealing improvements for all three objectives the largest improvements for energy consumption and for reduction of ghg emissions were of 2 01 and 0 28 compared to the base case these were obtained at airflow distribution rates of 0 80 0 60 0 40 the effluent quality index was reduced the most for the distribution rounded factors of 0 91 0 61 0 43 and demonstrated a 1 14 decrease compared to the base case characterized by the 1 0 1 0 1 0 factors it can be concluded that this was the most optimal combination of aeration weight factors as it also ranked third best in energy consumption and ghg emissions the investigation of the contributing constituent s importance to the effluent quality and the ghg emissions improvement showed that the highest change for effluent quality index and reduction of pollution was due to tkn while the lower ghg emissions values were due to the decrease in off site co2 emissions the proposed modelling and optimization approach is of interest to decision makers as prediction instrument to assess the wwtp main variables or plant performance and improve regular operation of wwtps the models could also be relevant in planning for scenarios of changes in environmental ghg emission standards or wastewater quality and as a result increasing the operation flexibility and efficiency of wwtps

12396,wastewater treatment plants wwtps optimal operation is vital for sustainable wastewater management nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs and architectures optimized by genetic algorithms ga narx were used to model energy consumption effluent quality eq and greenhouse gas ghg emissions the ga narx were fed with 7 influent and operational variables and were individually

importance to the modern society reliable water and power supply are crucial elements for national security and human sustainable development by the year of 2025 water supply might turn out to be one of the most serious national concerns based on reported predictions 1 one of the typical cases for water energy interactions are the wastewater treatment plants wwtps at present environmental and climatic changes are in the focus of worldwide attention 2 in recent years focus has shifted from improving effluent quality to addressing challenges concerning energy management greenhouse gas ghg emissions of wwtps 3 and resources recovery 4 these plants consume considerable amounts of energy estimated to be responsible for 1 to 3 of the global energy consumption 5 the energy usage of the wastewater treatment process is also the main contributor to the of wwtp operation costs 6 of the total energy consumption the aeration process of wwtps accounts for 45 75 consequently being a major portion of the overall operational costs 7 for example in greece wwtps the share of aeration process from the total energy requirements was reported as 67 2 on average 8 demonstrating the importance of improving the operation of the aerated process in terms of energy efficiency additionally the aeration unit process accounts for the majority of on site ghg emissions according to 9 as a result several studies aiming the improvement of wwtp operation focused on the aerobic digestion process decreasing energy consumption for aeration being one of the main strategies with high perspectives for achieving carbon neutral wwtps 10 the most common approach is the performance enhancement of the dissolved oxygen do control system or optimization of its associated controller s setpoint qambar al khalidy used machine learning methods to dynamically optimize the do setpoint concluding that energy savings of 23 could be achieved by implementing the optimized do setpoints in a wwtp 11 piotrowski et al optimized the do controller parameters in case of a batch type biological treatment plant using stochastic optimization algorithm they obtained lower do setpoints values than with the employment of a nonoptimized pid controller 12 meaning a reduction in the energy consumption for the aeration process in parallel with reducing energy consumption ghg emissions should also be evaluated while energy savings for the aeration process can be achieved by lowering the do controller s setpoint at a certain point it can result in the incomplete nitrification 13 this leads to the build up of no2 and nh4 ensuing in the increase of concentration for these undesired chemical components 14 at do setpoint setting of lower value than 1 mg l the increase in n2o cannot be ignored 15 as in these circumstances the growth in greenhouse gas emissions can counterbalance the ghgs emissions reduction associated to the 25 saving in aeration energy consumption 16 as such it is important to investigate alternative operation strategies of the aeration process leading to energy savings without a severe increase in ghg emissions one of the possibilities is the uneven distribution of compressed air along the aerated bioreactor 17 several studies approached the operation optimization of wwtps using artificial intelligence ai methods and relying on the development of data driven models prediction of effluent parameters is a typical example of such applications in the study of wwtps successful implementations of steady state artificial neural network ann models were used for predictions of biological oxygen demand bod5 and total suspended solids tss 18 or suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand cod 19 dynamic models such as nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs narx were also applied with good results for effluent quality prediction of cod and total nitrogen tn levels 20 similar ann models were found efficient for prediction of wwtp performance indices such as aeration energy ae effluent quality eq and pumping energy pe which were further employed in the optimization of setpoint values for the do and nitrate and nitrite concentration no control loops resulting in reduced energy consumption and improved effluent quality 21 furthermore prediction of gaseous emissions h2s in the influent chamber of wwtps was accomplished using multivariate narx model 22 a hybrid model employing ann was utilized in prediction of liquid n2o production in a nitrifying sequencing batch reactor 23 however no studies focused on predicting ghg emissions of wwtps with the support of such networks in other fields of study ai techniques were applied with success in development of data driven models for ghg emission predictions emissions for buildings construction were predicted using explainable ai 24 while another data driven model predicted ghg emissions of high speed rail stations 25 a neural network model was used to predict the effects of climate change on emissions of ghg under climatic scenarios by modelling energy demand forecasting an increase of ghg emissions 26 anns were also employed in modelling and predicting ghg emissions in wheat production of iran with the best topology showing a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 998 for ghg emissions 27 ghg intensity and emissions in europe were predicted using ann models with a mean absolute percentage error mape value of 6 4 in case of ghg emission predictions for eu members 28 d z antanasijević et al coupled principal component analysis with ann resulting in a model forecasting ghg emissions at the national level with a mape value of only 3 6 29 the mentioned studies illustrate the possibility of developing accurate ann models for ghg emission predictions which is one of the aims of the current research while approaching the case of municipal wwtps and using narx models one of the challenges in ann development and a determining factor for the ann s prediction performance is the selection of ann optimal hyperparameters for the investigated dataset 30 as such optimization is required to find the best fit for the given dataset 31 as a result hybrid intelligent models were developed they bring an improvement in both accuracy and generalization ability of the single intelligent models 32 as the hybrid intelligent models demonstrate an advantage over single intelligent models 33 in recent studies on performance of predictions for wwtps by hybrid intelligent models evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga were applied in a collaborative fashion for optimizing the hyperparameters of different ann models water quality prediction in drinking water treatment plants was achieved by a hybrid artificial neural network that used a genetic algorithm to optimize the ann structure 34 similarly a multi layer perceptron network whose optimal topology was searched for by genetic algorithm was used in effluent quality prediction for a municipal wwtp 32 this study aims to find optimal aeration parameters i e three gain factors steering the air flowrate distribution for an operation strategy of the aeration unit process conducting to an optimized distribution of air flow to the aerated bioreactor and to evaluate it in terms of energy consumption effluent quality and ghg emissions in the current study ghg emissions were considered for the biological reactors and associated settlers of the water line as they represent the most important source of ghgs the computation of the optimal operation parameters for the proposed aeration strategy was relying on the predictions of the wwtp performance indices effluent quality and ghg emissions using dynamic hybrid intelligent models based on simulated data these dynamic neural network narx models for which the optimal topology was searched for by means of ga will be further referred to as ga narx to the authors knowledge there are no studies associated with hybrid intelligent modelling based on ga optimized narx models aimed at simulating the wwtp processes furthermore the dynamic modelling of ghg emissions in wwtps by means of ann models is also a novelty of the present work the main steps of the current paper were i generation of the representative dataset by using the calibrated analytical model of the municipal wwtp considered as case study and by taking into account the specifically and multiple designed scenarios of operational parameters ii development of ga narx methodology for searching the optimal ann topology in terms of structure of narx network at training number of hidden layers nhl number of neurons in each hidden layer nnehl and transfer functions tfs iii employment of the ann developed models in a multi objective optimization step for finding the optimal operational aeration parameters iv testing the optimal operational parameters on the analytical model and comparison of energy consumption effluent quality and ghg emissions performance with the standard wwtp operation 2 methodology the ga narx model development and multi objective optimization processes were performed in matlab 2021a 35 2 1 data generation an analytical model based on activated sludge model no 1 was utilized for the generation of the dataset required for the development of ga narx models the dynamic simulator based on the benchmark simulation model no 1 bsm1 was previously built in simulink software environment and calibrated using dynamic data collected at the local municipal wwtp with a 420 000 population equivalents p e capacity as detailed in 36 the studied wwtp has an anaerobic anoxic oxic layout where the aerated bioreactor was divided in three smaller equally dimensioned reactors and features two control loops responsible for the carbon removal and nitrogen removal nitrification and denitrification are controlled by manipulating the aeration and nitrate recycling flowrates of the bioreactors for each of the aerated reactors the air flowrate can be distributed unevenly using three gain factors g1 g3 as can be seen in fig 1 in order to obtain a comprehensive dataset of 64 different scenarios corresponding to differently designed air flowrates the associated gain combinations were chosen based on full factorial design with each gain factor having 4 levels for the first 10 days of the simulation a standard scenario for the air flowrate gains was employed and data from these days was excluded in the ga narx development process in order to diminish the effect of initial conditions on the dataset to be further used for ann training following these 10 days each combination of gain factors was introduced and kept constant for the next 7 days interval it was succeeded by the next scenario of 7 days for new combination of the gain factors until the last scenario was reached consequently a total of 458 days of simulated data without the 10 initialization days was collected with a temporal resolution of 30 min i e a total of 21 984 datapoints this entire dataset was randomly divided into training validation and testing datasets in a 70 15 15 ratio for the ann model development the input and output features used in the development of the models are shown in table 1 additional information on the input and output features such as variance or correlation between inputs and outputs can be found in the supplementary material 2 2 ga narx model development narx networks represent the type of feed forward neural network that employ in their architecture a tapped delay line block between the ann model time series inputs and the first hidden layer the line allows data from several past time moments of both input and target datasets to be utilized in the prediction of the target variable value at the proximate sampling moment of time due to this construction narx models are suitable for applications requiring time series prediction these neural networks can be developed in two fashions the open structure feeds from the original target dataset the ann inputs standing for the past values of the targets while the closed structure utilizes the ann self simulated past target values to compute the target value at the subsequent moment of time finding the optimal architecture is crucial in the development of ann models influencing the model s prediction accuracy generalization ability and nonetheless the required computational time this challenging optimization task becomes unfeasible by classical optimization methods when considering the complex dependency between the training objective function and the ann hyperparameters such as nhehl nhl and tf considered as decision variables population based algorithms such as gas provide appropriate means for finding the global optimum in the ann architecture optimization 33 genetic algorithm is one of the most frequently used evolutionary algorithms being a stochastic global search and optimization method based on a population set of searching points its incentives rely on not necessitating computation of objective function derivatives or having no need of considering restricting preconditions for the objective function while the performed global search approaches well or even reaches the global minimum several constraints on the decision variables for the narx architecture were considered in case of nhl ann hyperparameter only models with 1 or 2 hidden layers were considered nhehl was bound between 2 and 15 for each hidden layer tf at each hidden layer was taken either as a logistic sigmoid logsig function or as a tangent sigmoid tansig function the optimal structure of the narx model was searched both for the open and closed structures training with validation was employed in order to avoid overfitting the training process was performed with the levenberg marquardt algorithm as it is the most frequently used optimization algorithm in wwtp applications 37 the tapped delay line horizons for the ann input and output data were taken with the time length of 12 sampling intervals meaning that input and target data from the previous 6 h were employed in the computation of the output value at the next sampling moment this is described in a general form by eq 1 1 x t f x t 1 x t 2 x t n y u t 1 u t 2 u t n u where x is the output signal u represents the input signal while n y and n u are tapped delay line horizons for the two signals both equal to 12 the decision criteria for selecting the best ga narx model was the mean absolute percentage error mape between the target and output values of the testing dataset eq 2 2 mape i 1 n data y i x i y i n data 100 here n data is the number of data points y i is the desired output at data point i and x i is the ann model simulated or predicted output at the same data point i y i and x i are non scaled values the anns were developed using as exogenous inputs the following 7 input variables of the wwtp influent cod organic nitrogen concentration flowrate qi and temperature te supplemented with the three gain aeration factors g1 to g3 ga narx models were developed for output variables aeration energy pumping energy effluent quality ghg emissions for effluent concentrations of total suspended solids chemical oxygen demand biological oxygen demand total kjeldahl nitrogen nitrates and nitrites and for effluent wastewater flowrate only models with a single output were considered as these were previously found to offer superior accuracy and generalization ability compared to multiple output models 21 details of the wwtp influent and ranges for the air flow gain settings that were used as ann model inputs are presented in table 2 2 3 estimation of ghg emissions evaluation of the ghg emissions was performed at the water line level of the wwtp due to the limitations of an bsm1 type model on site and off site emissions of co2 and n2o were considered other than co2 the emissions of n2o gases had been included as their global warming potential gwp is 265 298 times higher than co2 considered for an average residence time of 100 years 47 emissions due to n2o can constitute half or even more of the total ghg emissions when on site co2 is not considered 38 the contribution of on site ch4 emission was not considered as the studied plant benefits of a biogas recovery and reuse system in which case the on site ch4 emissions reach a neglectable contribution to the total on site emissions 9 furthermore the use of the biogas can reduce costs and ghg emissions by utilization to generate electrical energy 39 or by biogas upgrade to transport fuel 40 in order to facilitate the comparison with other results and over a larger variety of wwtp dimensions in the present study the ghg emissions were related per cubic meter of processed wastewater kg co2 eq m3 ww the assessment of the on site co2 emissions released due to the aerobic biological processes calculated in kg co2 m3 ww was based on the relationship described in eq 3 41 3 p co 2 on site 0 99 1 y h η asp bcod 1 03 y h η asp bcod k d h mcrt 1 k d h mcrt here 0 99 kg co2 eq kg cod is the

time taken as 15 days for the current municipal wwtp case the on site n2o emissions kg n2o m3 ww were estimated using the following formula 4 p n 2 o on site e f n 2 o tn where e f n 2 o is the emission factor kg n2o kg n with the value of 0 005 related to n2o production based on influent n loading 43 and δtn is the specific difference tn mass between wwtp influent and effluent kg n m3 ww in the off site co2 emissions kg co2 m3 ww generation of the electricity was taken into consideration related to the energy consumption of the wwtp the following relationship was used for the estimation of these off site co2 emissions based on 44 5 p co 2 off site k pg e d q i where k pg is the emission factor per unit of generated energy to be consumed in the wwtp its value was taken as 0 323 kg co2 eq kwh which is the reported ghg emission intensity of electricity generation for romania in 2021 45 e d kwh d is the energy demand which was calculated as the sum of the aeration and pumping energies and q i is the influent flowrate the aeration energy ae and pumping energy pe were computed based on the equations given in 42 6 ae so sat t 1 8 1000 0 t i 1 3 v i k l a i t dt 7 pe 1 t 0 t 0 004 q nr

transfer coefficient in aerated bioreactor i q nr is the flowrate of the nitrate recirculation q ras the flowrate of the return activated sludge and q waste the flowrate of waste from the secondary settler off site n2o emissions were considered due to the biological degradation in the downstream systems of the wwtp resulting in additional n2o release the following equation describes these emissions 8 p n 2 o off site n e ef e where n e is the load of n discharged into the receiving water body and ef e is the emission factor of n2o from the wastewater discharged with a value of 7 857 10

then summed with the co2 emissions eq 9 9 ghg p co 2 on site p co 2 off site gwp n 2 o p n 2 o on site p n 2 o off site the value for gwp n 2 o was taken as 298 47 for obtaining the ghg emissions in kg co2 eq m3 ww unit 2 4 optimization of airflow distribution the optimal values of the gain factors determining the distribution of air in the three aerated bioreactors were searched for by taking into account a 7 days duration scenario several performance indices had to be considered in the optimization process although the focus was the reduction of energy consumption other aspects such as ghg emissions and effluent quality ought to be considered as well the values for the considered performance indices were obtained by predictions made with the specially designed and trained ga narx models effluent quality eq was taken in consideration as a performance index describing the daily discharged mass of pollution encompassing pollutions based on effluent components total suspended solids tss cod bod5 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nitrate and nitrite nitrogen no and effluent flowrate qe as shown in eq 10 10 eq 1 t 1000 0 t pu tss t pu cod t pu bod t pu tkn t pu no t q e t dt the daily discharged mass of pollution in units of kg pollution unit d kgpu d was calculated by converting the pollution from different sources to comprehensive pollution units based on the weighting factors described in 48 combining directly the previously mentioned wwtp performance indices energy consumption ghg emissions and effluent quality into a single objective function was not plausible as their values are orders of magnitude apart due to their units of measurements consequently arbitrarily chosen weighting factors would have to be applied to bring the mentioned performance indices to a similar importance in the single objective function accordingly a multi objective optimization method was employed based on ga that computes a set of non dominated solutions called the pareto front in this front each point represents a solution that fulfils the objectives as best as possible and no further improvement could be made in one of the objectives without a simultaneous deterioration of the other objectives 49 the objective functions taking into account the energy consumption and ghg emissions were chosen as shown in eqs 11 12 and quantify the energy demand and the total ghg emissions of the plant 11 f min 1 e d 12 f min 2 ghg for the objective function concerning effluent quality two distinct cases were considered in case 1 the third objective function was considered equal to the ann predicted eq 13 f min 3 eq in this case a ga narx model was used to directly predict the effluent quality index however in this manner concentrations of the individual chemical components different pollution sources remain unrevealed and it is worthy to note that although unlikely an optimal solution where the overall eq is reduced could result in one of the pollutants exceeding its regulated loading limit and negatively affect the receiving water body in case 2 the eq was computed based on eq 10 meaning that 6 distinct ga narx models were developed to predict the individual concentrations of the 5 different chemical indicators and the effluent flowrate this approach allowed the investigation and consider penalizations due to violations of the regulated loading limits the third objective function in case 2 was calculated as eq if no loading limits were violated at any moment in time while in the opposite situation a penalty was applied by multiplying the eq value with a factor between 1 1 and 2 this factor was computed based on the fraction of timeframe any of the loading limits were breached during to the period of observation eq 14 14 f min 3 eq eq 1 1 0 9 t p t if cod 125 tn 10 bod 25 if cod 125 or tn 10 or bod 25 here t p is the period of time any of the pollutant concentrations were above the following limits for cod 125 g o2 m3 for tn 10 g n m3 and for bod5 25 g o2 m3 these limits were considered according to the national specific values for romania h g nr 352 2005 3 results and discussion on site ghg emissions due to biochemical reactions and off site ghg emissions generated by electricity consumption were estimated as co2 equivalent ga narx models were developed for a variety of output features by the method developed in this study and their performance was compared to results obtained in other studies these neural network models were further used for the optimization of the airflow distribution in the aerated bioreactors the most promising values obtained from the airflow distribution optimization were tested on the first principle model and compared to the results obtained in the base case 3 1 ghg emissions the removal efficiencies for cod and tn in the studied system were 92 5 and 90 6 respectively based on the data obtained from simulations with the calibrated bsm1 model the amount of ghg emissions produced on site and off site for the base case settings i e g1 to g3 equal to 1 are shown in units of kg co2 eq mm3 ww in table 3 the results showed that on site emissions make up around 79 of the total ghg emissions which is in line with previous findings that in case of wwtps serving 100 000 population equivalents the on site emissions contribute with 70 to the total ghg emissions 43 at the same time the aeration unit proved to be the major contributor from all units of the plant to the on site ghg emissions this is in line with reported values of up to 86 9 and is revealing the need and importance of optimizing the aeration process the ratio of co2 to n2o on site emissions in the current study is larger than in the previously mentioned research almost 4 1 compared to 1 23 1 this can be partially explained by the difference in the e f n 2 o values used i e 0 005 kg n2o kg n in this study while in the other research the value of 0 0754 kg n2o kg n was obtained based on the provided data 9 significant variations can be observed in the literature in terms of values of specific ghg emissions the results obtained in the current study are in the range of 0 02 to 0 29 kg co2 eq p e d as reported by 50 from the total ghg emissions 63 2 come from biogenic emissions showing that not taking into account these types of emissions would lead to an underestimation of the wwtp ghg emissions 3 2 ga narx models a total of 10 multiple input single output ga narx models were developed to predict energy consumption ghg emissions and effluent quality of the studied wwtp fig 2 these networks used the previously presented 7 input features codi organic n qi te g1 g2 and g3 plus the output feature in a recurrent fashion to model each targeted parameter for the ga settings a population size of 50 was considered and the number of maximum generations was set to 50 as in most cases no significant improvement was observed at larger generation values similar to the findings in case of a more complex ann hyperparameters optimization tasks 32 the models that showed the best accuracy for the testing dataset were further evaluated and additionally tested by using the ga narx to predict a 7 days scenario with a previously unseen combination of aeration gain factors in order to perform the predictions the models had to be used in the closed loop structure using predictions from previous time steps as inputs for making the proximate time step prediction the optimal network hyperparameters and mape prediction results for this new scenario are shown in table 4 in most cases the optimal ga narx model for single output prediction was found to possesses two hidden layers commonly with the tangent sigmoid tf for the first hidden layer the number of neurons was typically found to be situated in the upper region of the assumed bounded range of values for both the first and second hidden layers this confirms the non linearity and complexity of the modelling tasks the mape values for the developed ga narx models were placed between 1 14 and 21 5 when the anns were fed with previously unseen input data the outstanding result when predicting the effluent flowrate can be attributed to the strong linear correlation to the influent flowrate despite the more or less regular daily cyclic behaviour the ga narx responsible for modelling the ghg emissions was one of the most accurate networks developed in the current study based on the novel approach the ghg emissions model performed remarkably well when used for predictions the similarity between targeted and predicted series can be observed in fig 3 the mentioned ga narx revealed a slightly lower mape value of 1 24 compared to ann based ghg models found in the literature e g an artificial neural network coupled with principle component analysis reached a mape value of 3 60 when forecasting ghg emissions at the national level 29 while in another study generalized regression neural network models were used for ghg intensity and energy consumption predictions but reaching mape of 6 40 for the ghg emission predictions at the national level for european countries 28 the developed model could serve as an efficient tool in evaluating plant operation strategies for reducing ghg emissions of wwtps 3 3 implications the models were developed with synthetic data based on a first principle model calibrated with real data and as a result the developed ga narx can be considered to be pre trained for utilization in the real facility however based on measured of inferred data an adaptation of the network weight and biases would be required when employing the models at the same time a data pre processing step should be added in order to filter the measured data fed to the model the accuracy of the ga narx models was found to be comparable to the results reported in the literature for ann models predicting wwtp effluent table 5 it should also be noted that the presented literature results were obtained using real data the least accurate predictions mape 21 5 were obtained in case of eq owing to the intricacy of the different factors that make up the studied index the utilization as input data of only the variables that would be available by measurements and at a temporal resolution of at least 30 min at the municipal wwtp also increases the difficulty of describing this output as the selection of input and output features also influences the model performance 51 although it presents a larger mape value the coefficient of determination r2 of the ga narx model in question is equal to 0 94 similar to the bod model developed by 52 the proposed approach of using ga for the optimization of narx hyperparameters facilitates the development of such dynamic network models by offering an automatic process for the search of optimal network topology in comparison to methods such as trial and error at the same time it also requires less computational time then the trial of all possible combinations of the studied hyperparameters and results in models with similar accuracy to those reported in the literature the mentioned studies focused on the development of different ann models to predict one or more process parameters and concluded on their applicability based on the model s performance the current study took a step further and employed these models in multi objective optimization of a proposed wwtp operation strategy showing the possible benefits of using the ga narx models 3 4 airflow distribution optimization the optimization of the airflow to the aerated bioreactors was performed for the two presented cases regarding the prediction of the eq index fig 2 in the first case the eq values were predicted by ga narx model with eq as its output variable while in the second case the eq was calculated as described in eq 10 based on the predicted values of tss cod bod tkn no and qe provided by the models that had these wwtp effluent variables as ann outputs table 4 in order to find the optimal values for the three airflow gain factors g1 g3 which best satisfy all three objectives a multi objective optimization was performed using ga the population size for the ga was selected as 50 the maximum number of generations was set to 600 and the pareto set fraction value was chosen as 0 35 in this fashion the optimizations resulted in pareto fronts of 18 points the results of the first optimization case are presented in table 6 they show the optimal settings for the gain factors g1 to g3 related to the airflow distribution for each aerated reactor as well as the obtained performance indices in terms of energy demand ghg emissions and effluent quality in order to select the most promising combination of gain factors a scoring system was applied in case of each of the three objectives scores were given in ascending order from 1 to 18 to every combination of gains these scores were then be summed in order to determine the final ranking between the 18 pareto front points and the three combinations with the lowest scores were selected to be evaluated the latter are highlighted in the tables below the final decision on the values considered as the most favourable gain factors was taken by analysing the selected combinations the scores for the points of both pareto fronts can be found in the supplementary material for a better visualization of the interdependencies between the three objectives the pareto front resulting from the first optimization case is presented in two 2d graphics instead of a single 3d illustration shown in fig 4 the location of the three best solutions highlighted in tables 6 and 7 were also pinpointed with arrows in the pareto front i e points 1 3 and 16 for fig 4 a in fig 4 a it can be observed that both objectives i e ghg emissions and energy consumption can be minimized at the same time and that was expected due the off site co2 emissions estimation eq 5 on the other hand fig 4 b shows that there is a conflicting situation when trying to optimize both ghg emissions and effluent quality this was also expected as the on site ghg emissions depend on differences between the wwtp influent and effluent concentrations of the relevant chemical components as such the slight increase of eq due to larger values of the component concentration in effluent is associated to the reduction in ghg emissions the concern in the first optimization case is that although the changes in eq are not significant the concentrations of the individual chemical components are not revealed and they might exceed the regulated limitations in the second optimization case for the aeration gain factors g1 g3 the possibility of the chemical indicators breaching the allowed concentrations is taken into account in the specially designed third objective function the pareto front results obtained in this case are presented in table 7 and fig 5 similarly to the first optimization case based on the predicted results of this case the trade off solution between ghg emissions and effluent quality is also needed but this can be accomplished in more reliable way when comparison is made to case 1 this is due to the change of the pareto front for the ghg emissions v s energy consumption indices while the front of ghg emissions v s energy demand remained similar to the first optimization case the three most promising solutions i e 2 10 and 18 are located exactly in the mentioned region where both ghg and eq objectives are best satisfied it can also be observed that there are no abrupt increases in the eq values meaning that the optimal gain combinations do not lead to the increase of any effluent chemical component above its limit the three most promising airflow distribution settings obtained from both optimization cases were evaluated by implementing them in a 7 days long simulation scenario that utilized the wwtp first principle extensive model for assessing the plant performance the obtained results were compared to the base case where the three gain factors were set to 1 and the same 7 days scenario was used the wwtp operation performance values obtained for energy demand ghg emissions and effluent quality in these selected cases are presented in table 8 it can be observed that all combinations of gain factors g1 g3 chosen with the proposed approach bring improvements for of all three performance indices studied at the same time it is noticeable that the energy consumption and ghg emissions reductions are closely related off site co2 emissions accompanied by the decrease in effluent quality values the results signify that the reduction of energy consumption related to aeration does not lead to the increase of effluent concentrations which is also expected due to maintaining the setpoint of the control loop i e original value of 2 responsible for the dissolved oxygen level at the outlet of the last aerated bioreactor the most savings in terms of energy consumption were achieved in optimization case 1 number 1 where the results show savings of approximatively 2 relative to the base case simultaneously leading to the lowest ghg emissions accounting for an improvement of 0 28 coupled with a decrease of almost 1 in effluent quality for the effluent quality the best result was obtained in optimization case 1 number 16 characterized by a decrease of 1 14 in eq together with a reduction of 1 85 in energy requirements and 0 25 less ghg emissions the contributions of co2 and n2o emissions to total ghg emissions and of the different pollution sources to eq during the studied 7 days scenario for these two optimized cases optimization case 1 number 1 and number 16 were investigated and compared to the base case they are shown in fig 6 it can be observed that the highest change of the effluent quality index when it is compared to the base case shown in fig 6 a can be assigned to tkn the decrease observed for this contributor can be attributed to the more abundant distribution of air at the beginning of the aerated bioreactor and facilitating the nitrification process which results in the increase of pollution due to no this is shown for both optimized cases in fig 6 b and c at the same time the increase in no concentration positively affects the energy consumption by enabling the achievement of the no concentration setpoint in the anoxic bioreactor which is the goal of the denitrification control loop with a lower flowrate of the nitrate recycling stream the decrease of this flowrate has an impact on reducing the pumping energy the results for ghg emissions show that although biogenic the on site co2 emissions remain the predominant contributor and approaches such as carbon capture could be considered for the diminution of these emissions the very slight increase in the on site co2 emissions can be explained by the improved removal of cod and bod which is also confirmed by the effluent quality results while the change of on site and off site n2o emissions balance each other the largest change and reduction in ghg emissions can be attributed to the off site co2 emissions revealing that the proposed strategy results in a lower energy demand for pumping and aeration based on the presented results the most advantageous combination of gain factors g1 g3 for the proposed strategy of uneven air flowrate distribution optimisation case 1 and point number 16 found through multi objective optimization utilizing the developed ga narx models led to improvements in all three investigated objectives when wwtp performance is compared to the classical operation base case the presented optimization method is suitable for searching for optimal distribution factors in case of both longer and shorter timeframes such as seasonal or short event based strategies according to the slow or quick changes in weather conditions another important aspect and advantage of employing the ga narx models was the reduced computational requirements as can be expected of the ann models compared to the first principal mathematical model the multi objective optimization process was finalized in almost 250 s in the first case while close to 1700 s were required in the second case in comparison a single run of the 7 day scenario on the first principle mathematical model finished in 205 s on the same processing unit taking into consideration optimization case 2 the slower of the two and assuming that the optimization on the mathematical model would require the same number of iterations to finalize i e 18 950 iterations or 379 generations results in a processing time of almost 45 days based on these numbers there is at least a four orders of magnitude difference in processing time of the multi objective optimization task in favour of the ga narx models consequently these models could also be of interest for real time optimization applications 4 conclusions the development of a new ga optimized narx model was performed to describe the complex wwtp processes predicting the wwtp water line effluents and performance indicators the narx architecture optimization by ga enables automatizing the ann design and training while reducing the reliance on experts experience the models developed succeeded to predict wwtp effluent concentrations with mape values between 1 136 and 16 196 while prediction of wwtp performance indices presented mape values of 1 226 to 21 460 the prediction performance of the novel ga narx model for ghg emissions was the third best at forecasting amongst the ten developed models mape 1 244 the ga narx models were further utilized in a multi objective optimization task of the proposed uneven aeration strategy in the nitrification bioreactor the optimization objectives consisted of wwtp energy consumption ghg emissions and effluent quality two multi objective optimization cases were considered and the best points from the pareto fronts were tested on the mathematical model revealing improvements for all three objectives the largest improvements for energy consumption and for reduction of ghg emissions were of 2 01 and 0 28 compared to the base case these were obtained at airflow distribution rates of 0 80 0 60 0 40 the effluent quality index was reduced the most for the distribution rounded factors of 0 91 0 61 0 43 and demonstrated a 1 14 decrease compared to the base case characterized by the 1 0 1 0 1 0 factors it can be concluded that this was the most optimal combination of aeration weight factors as it also ranked third best in energy consumption and ghg emissions the investigation of the contributing constituent s importance to the effluent quality and the ghg emissions improvement showed that the highest change for effluent quality index and reduction of pollution was due to tkn while the lower ghg emissions values were due to the decrease in off site co2 emissions the proposed modelling and optimization approach is of interest to decision makers as prediction instrument to assess the wwtp main variables or plant performance and improve regular operation of wwtps the models could also be relevant in planning for scenarios of changes in environmental ghg emission standards or wastewater quality and as a result increasing the operation flexibility and efficiency of wwtps

discharged into the aquatic environment for that reason many researchers have attempted to remove mps via several approaches including advanced oxidation processes however there have been a number of occasions when the size of mps was reduced at best which is not the ultimate solution herein we demonstrated that mps could be efficiently removed via near dissolved organic matter microfiltration ndom mf coupled with cold plasma cp treatment cp treatment increased the particle size of mps from 1 1 μm to 3 5 μm by setting off a chain of coagulation process including the increased nitrate concentration increased ionic strength and reduced thickness of the electrical double layer such coagulated mps enabled ndom mf to exhibit 124 higher water flux than the existing mf while maintaining a 99 9 removal rate furthermore given that the performance improvement was achieved without secondary contamination arising from adding coagulants it was expected that ndom mf coupled with the cp process could provide a sustainable and eco friendly approach to removing mps keywords microplastics polystyrene cold plasma coagulation microfiltration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it is not too much to say that this is an era of plastics in that our routine life is full of countless industrial products made of a variety of plastics prime examples are polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene pe polyurethane pu and polyethylene terephthalate pet the demand for them is growing thanks to their excellent mechanical properties including toughness and elasticity light weight and flexible design at a low price 1 4 as a result global plastic production has recently increased to 368 million metric tons 5 6 however as two sides of the same coin too much consumption of plastics ended up in an incredible amount of plastic waste especially the disposal of plastic waste has become even more pronounced since the covid 19 pandemic because the need for medical and packaging plastics increased by 370 and 40 respectively 7 unfortunately only 6 26 of plastic waste is recycled and the rest is landfilled or discharged into the environment 8 9 discarded plastics have often been found in the form of degraded plastic particles in various aquatic systems such as oceans lakes rivers and municipal wastewater 1 10 12 some of them are weathered into microplastic mp debris of which the size falls between 100 nm and 5 mm 1 13 15 notably since mps are likely to pass through the widely used filters in wastewater treatment plants regardless of the type of filter coarse filter 6 mm fine filter 1 5 6 mm 2 16 18 it is necessary to develop water treatment technologies capable of coping with the leakage of mps into the environment another point worthy of note is that the degree of harm to human health depends strongly on the size of mps in detail mps smaller than 1 μm i e 100 nm mp 1 μm not only adsorb hydrophobic toxic pollutants but can also negatively affect immune responses causing cytotoxicity 18 20 unfortunately it is rare to find practical information about removing mps smaller than 1 μm to remove mps smaller than 1 μm we can look for a way from the previously used advanced treatment techniques e g oxidation coagulation membrane filtration biochar adsorption etc to remove mps 21 26 among the aforementioned technologies to remove mps from water advanced oxidation processes aops could be considered the best if they can successfully mineralize mps and thereby guarantee their thorough removal however it is quite challenging to completely make it to the cleavage of carbon carbon bonds of the above mentioned plastic polymers via aops furthermore if aops or other degradation processes of mps leave much smaller nano plastics nps 100 nm 15 behind without mineralizing mps the attempts to break them down can be self defeating in stark contrast membrane filtration physically separates mp debris based on size exclusion without causing particle size reduction accordingly it could exclude the risk in terms of np generation in the middle of a process and provide a more reliable solution to remove mps from water instead there is room for further productivity i e water flux improvement per unit time and area while maintaining a high mp removal rate since bigger matters than 0 45 μm have been regarded as particulates 27 people have used mf membranes with a smaller mean pore size than 0 45 μm to remove mps despite the low water flux meanwhile it is undesirable to recklessly increase the pore size without attention to the influence of increasing pore size on a removal rate due to the trade off between the water flux and removal rate 4 28 30 on the other hand if the removal rate is kept within absolute retention over the left shoulder increasing the mean pore size can also be considered effective in improving the productivity of a membrane based mp removal process without compromising the quality of the treated water note that absolute retention could be achieved when particle size is 2 3 times larger than a mean pore size at minimum 31 in this regard one can combine coagulation and near dissolved organic matter microfiltration ndom mf which uses membranes with a mean pore size greater than but close to doms 32 as an excellent strategy to enhance the water flux without compromising mp removal ndom mf features a larger mean pore size than 0 45 μm but a smaller nominal mean pore size than 1 μm to efficiently remove particulates from water while going beyond the water flux of the existing mf as for the removal rate to ensure absolute retention it can be achieved by coupling coagulation with ndom mf despite the large mean pore size of membranes used for ndom mf herein we came up with the idea of utilizing cold plasma cp which is known as one of the aops with strong oxidizing power and eco friendliness 33 34 for the coagulation of mps specifically cp can be used to produce reactive nitrogen and oxygen species rns and ros 3 35 independently of ph temperature and catalyst 3 36 38 the generated rns could contribute to coagulation without coagulants by increasing the ionic strength of a feed solution and thereby reducing the electrical double layer s thickness on top of that cp treatment could change the surface chemical characteristics of mps 39 41 and lead to the interaction between cp treated mps which is favorable for coagulation these benefits obtainable from cp treatment can be achieved without concerns about the potential risks that can harm living organisms and the environment by the reactive species produced by cp treatment since the reactive species activities cannot last in the first place after being discharged into the environment due to their short life span 34 42 43 we hope this work provides insights into mp removal by making the most of the advantage of ndom mf coupled with cp treatment while avoiding the concern of secondary contaminants in aquatic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials used for mf and cp treatment considering that ps is one of the most commonly found plastics in the water body 44 a ps latex bead stock solution sigma aldrich 10 ml 10 wt 89904 10ml f with a nominal average size of 1 μm was used as a model foulant a ps stock solution was diluted in di water to prepare a specific concentration for cp treatment or mf test the feed solution containing a diluted 1 μm bead solution was labeled as a 1 μm bead solution the membrane used in the mf test was a commercial mixed cellulose ester mce membrane advantec japen featuring a nominal mean pore size of 0 8 μm and hydrophilic properties 2 2 characterizations we used a particle size analyzer laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer partica mini la 350 horiba japan and a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd uk to check the particle size zeta potential and electrical conductivity of a ps bead solution containing cp treated ps mps respectively the laser wavelengths applied to the particle size analyzer and zeta potential analyzer were 650 nm and 633 nm respectively the ps refractive index was 1 6 upon consideration of measurement at room temperature 45 46 the removal rate was estimated based on the counting method using the images obtained with a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem gemini 500 carl zeiss germany installed in the center for university wide research facilities curf at jeonbuk national university as reported previously 32 the fesem was also utilized to observe a fouling layer formed on the membrane surface after mf a uv visible spectrophotometer sp uv1100 dlab china was used to confirm the variation in the methylene blue mb concentration at different cp treatment times as reported previously 47 the mb concentration was measured at 664 nm a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc lch shimadzu japan was used to analyze the toc concentration of mb solutions cp treated for different times fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis was investigated using a spectrometer 6300fv irt5000 jasco japan to investigate the surface functional groups of ps mps that vary with the cp treatment a turbidity meter orion aq4500 thermo scientific usa was used to double check the coagulation of ps beads induced by cp treatment the nitrate concentration which increased proportionally with cp treatment time was measured using an ion chromatograph ic dionex aquion thermofisher usa lastly the mean pore size and bubble point pore size of the membranes used for mf were measured using a capillary flow porometer cfp cfp 34rtf8a x 6 l4 porous materials inc usa and a fluid galwick solution with low surface tension 0 0159 n m 1 48 based on the wet up dry up method and the following relationship 49 1 d 4 γcos θ p where d is the measured internal pore length μm of the membrane γ is the surface tension n m 1 of the fluid that wets the membrane θ is the contact angle between the inner pore and the wetting fluid and p is the pressure psi where the gas penetrates through the fluid 2 3 mf coupled with cp treatment for ps mp removal a lab scale cp groon co ltd korea system featured a threshold current of the maximum output power of 40 56 w the cp system can convert 220 v input ac voltage into 10 000 v dc voltage to produce reactive radical species based on the patents of us 10 032 593 b1 european no 18160887 8 korean no 10 1295349 and no 10 1295350 35 also the cp process consisted of an air pump maximum output power of 19 w shinhwahightech zp 25 korea gas flow meter dwyer rma 22 ssv usa and glass reactor fig 1 a ambient air was sent to a cp system at 5 l min 1 which was known to be an optimal condition from the perspective of energy efficiencies 50 and converted into reactive oxygen nitrogen species via a cp system the aforementioned cp treatment process was applied to a ps bead solution to prepare cp treated ps mps in detail 0 5 ml of ps stock solution was diluted in 400 ml of di water to adjust the concentration to 125 ppm and the 125 ppm solution was sonicated for 20 min to minimize unintended coagulation cp treatment was performed for up to 8 h while stirring a bead solution at 200 rpm subsequently 20 ml of the cp treated ps bead solution was collected every 2 h 2 4 6 and 8 h and diluted in 980 ml of di water to prepare a feed solution with a concentration of 2 5 ppm afterward an mf process was carried out to remove mps since the coagulation state of cp treated ps mps should remain until they were applied to an mf test cp treated ps mps did not go through sonication on the other hand non treated ps mps were dispersed via ultrasonic treatment using a bath sonicator sk7200bt youngjin corporation china for 15 min to prevent unintended aggregation ahead of an mf test table 1 shows a brief summary of an mf test a laboratory scale crossflow mf system fig 1 b was used to evaluate the water flux l m 2 h 1 lmh and ps bead removal rate the mf system comprised a gear pump emg 4000 scist korea a pressure gauge a pulse damper a square membrane module and 1 l of feed tank the initial water flux and mp removal rate were evaluated by collecting a permeate solution for 5 min after 30 min long membrane compaction 2 4 evaluation of mp removal rate by mf since the turbidity of the microfiltration filtrate of a given 2 5 ppm feed solution was all measured as 0 ntu it was necessary to apply another method to accurately estimate the removal efficiency the particle number estimation of the prepared feed solution is derived from the intrinsic density of ps particles 1 05 g cm 3 and the particle size distribution of the feed solution specifically it started with counting the number of particles based on their volume fraction which varies with each size table 2 the particle size distribution of the commercial bead solution ranged somewhat from the average value and had many particles larger or smaller than the average value therefore rather than indiscriminately calculating the number of particles with only the average particle size and density we tried to estimate the total number of particles by estimating the number of individual particles by reflecting the volume ratio that varies depending on the particle size thus we tried to estimate the removal rate using the microscopic counting method using fesem first after the mf test 30 ml of microfiltration filtrate was collected from the filtrate 30 ml of this filtrate had a low concentration of 0 ntu but contained a small number of ps beads after 15 min sonication and thorough vortexing the filtrate was filtered using a 0 1 μm nominal pore membrane mce advantec japen by vacuum rocker 300 gaeseong science korea in this case the effective membrane area of the vacuum filtration unit corresponded to 12 56 cm2 eventually the ps beads could not pass through because they were larger than 0 1 μm in size and consequently they were dispersed and located on the 0 1 μm nominal pore size membrane s surface after making 3 fesem specimens randomly from the specimens made in this way 15 sem images per fesem specimen were taken to obtain 45 images for each sample at this time 800 was selected because the magnification was sufficient to count beads of about 1 μm therefore 45 sem images were converted to an area of 0 0063 cm2 corresponding to 0 05 of the effective membrane area of the vacuum filtration device in this way the mf test according to the cp processing time was conducted three times each on treatment time and 675 images were used as a database the ps beads in each image were counted based on the counting method in person as reported previously however 0 51 0 584 μm particles 0 8 of the total bead volume were smaller than about 50 of the average particle size 1 16 0 32 μm of the 1 μm bead solution for that reason it was hard to clearly identify them at a given 800 magnification therefore it was appropriate not to include the number of particles ranging from 0 51 to 0 584 μm in the denominator used to calculate the removal efficiency as a result the total number of particles in the 2 5 ppm solution was calculated to be approximately 3 4 billion table 3 the formula for calculating the removal rate is identical to that used in previous studies 32 2 n p n p a e a s n s where np is the expected total number of particles of the permeate solution and np is the number of particles observed using the fesem image of the membrane surface ae is the effective area cm2 of the

treatment in the condition including other foulants for 24 h synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing mb a representative organic pollutant in the water treatment system 51 with ps beads the long term filtration tests were classified based on the types of used feed solutions as follows i the 24 h long filtration test using the mixture comprising pristine mps of 2 5 ppm and 10 ppm mb ps mb filtration ii the 24 h filtration test using the mixture consisting of 8 h cp treated mps 2 5 ppm and pristine mb 10 ppm cp ps mb filtration and iii the 24 h filtration test conducted after the simultaneous cp treatment of mps 2 5 ppm and mb 10 ppm for 8 h cp ps mb filtration each mf test was conducted for 24 h under 300 rpm stirring and permeate solutions were collected at 0 5 5 10 and 24 h to evaluate the water flux and removal rate the mps removal rates were calculated using 1440 sem images obtained from the filter surfaces used for filtrating permeate solutions by the microscopic counting method as described in section 2 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation of ps mps by cp treatment fig 2 a shows the change in particle size by cp treatment interestingly for a given 8 h cp treatment time the size of the microplastics increased cp treatment did not drastically change the physical properties e g shape and size of individual ps mps accordingly this dramatic size increase was likely to arise from coagulation specifically it was confirmed that the particle size increased linearly as the cp treatment time increased as a result of the 8 h treatment the particle size increased 3 2 times 3 5 0 3 μm compared to the initial control group 1 1 μm considering that pretreatment using coagulation could improve mf performance 52 53 the coagulation effect imparted by cp treatment was meaningful this coagulation effect can be generated by a change in the interparticle interaction between particles in colloidal mps 54 and the colloidal size of mps has been reported to be 60 nm 7 μm 55 the behavior of colloidal mps particles may change due to various potential interactions in the solution and an attractive force may appear depending on several factors encompassing the media s chemical composition and the particles shape and size 56 in addition the colloidal mps depending on particle size surface properties and physicochemical properties can combine into agglomeration form 57 therefore the behavior of colloidal mps can be significantly influenced by the environment e g electrostatic repulsion surrounding mps the most relevant interaction here is electrical double layer repulsion which is commonly described by the theory of derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo 58 in detail when the ion concentration becomes higher the thickness of the electrical double layer decreases leading to double layer compression 56 the decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer reduces the electrostatic repulsive force between the colloidal mps particles further increasing the possibility of coagulation between the mps fig 3 in this regard we tried to investigate the correlation between the mp s coagulation and an increase in ionic strength based on the change in electrical conductivity fig 2 b shows a dramatic increase in the electrical conductivity as cp treatment time increased by 8 h in the case of the control group in which only agitation was performed without cp treatment the electrical conductivity did not increase significantly in contrast the conductivity after cp treatment increased about 14 times from 0 003 ms cm 1 to 0 041 ms cm 1 the increased conductivity i e increased ionic strength was found to be related to a continuous increase in the nitrate concentration with cp treatment as shown in fig 2 c from the data we could conclude that the increased nitrate concentration by cp treatment was accompanied by an increase in the ionic strength of the ps mp solution ending up with the reduced electrical double layer and the resulting significant coagulation of ps mps furthermore ftir analysis was performed to confirm the functional group change of mps by oxidation fig 2 d shows the ftir spectra of mps before and after cp treatment the peak intensity at the wavenumber range from 3000 to 4000 cm 1 which is assigned to the oh group 59 63 became prominent significantly as cp treatment time increased since ps mps are aromatic polymers with a benzene ring in which a hydroxyl group could be formed by ros attack 64 65 hydroxyl functional groups were presumed to be probably introduced by ros attacking the benzene ring as such the hydroxyl group generated by cp treatment means the possibility of hydrogen bonding of ps mps possibly causing coagulation of mps as reported previously 66 67 overall cp treatment was assumed to induce double layer compression by the increased ionic strength and hydrogen bonding stemming from the nitrates and hydroxyl groups generated by cp treatment respectively effectively enhancing mps coagulation such coagulation between ps mps was also revealed in the fesem images of ps mps before and after cp treatment fig 2 e exhibits that ps mps prepared without cp treatment were individually accumulated while cp treated ps mps formed agglomerates fig 2 f another point worthy of note is that cp treated ps mps exclusively revealed the neck region between ps mps as marked with a red box in fig 2 f and formed the coalescence of cointegrated individual particles this evidence also strongly supports that ps mps were likely to be agglomerated by cp treatment 3 2 ps mp removal by mf coupled with cp treatment fig 4 a and b display the surface sem image of the commercial mf membrane with a nominal mean pore size of approximately 0 8 μm and a magnified sem image of the same membrane respectively the mf process was operated at 1 bar and 1 2 1 3 l min 1 of flow rate the pure water flux measured using di water was about 32 116 1179 l m 2 h 1 table 1 subsequently after the cp treatment the membrane was compacted for 30 min using the ps mp bead solution in which the coagulation effect remained as a feed solution afterward the compacted membrane was applied to evaluate the mp removal efficiency under the same conditions as described above mf tests were performed using feed solutions containing coagulated ps mps by cp treatment fig 5 a reveals the turbidity of the feed solutions prepared for the mf test after cp treatment was conducted during different time periods intriguingly the ps mp solution s turbidity which was 6 1 0 2 ntu before cp treatment was significantly reduced to 3 7 0 2 ntu almost 40 after 8 h treatment this phenomenon is also in line with the result of the particle size considering it signifies that the reduction in the number of particles could result from ps mps coagulation while their particle size increased with cp treatment accordingly the reduced turbidity also suggests that the coagulation effect stemming from cp treatment was still present until the treated bead solution was used for the mf test after cp treatment was finished thereby enhancing mf performance the mf test using a bead solution prepared without cp treatment exhibited a permeate flux of about 8800 956 lmh fig 5 b in stark contrast the water flux consistently increased with increasing cp treatment time reaching 19 800 4140 lmh after 8 h cp treatment the 124 higher water flux was thought to be attributable to a more porous fouling layer consisting of the increased particle size by cp treatment accompanied by ps mps coagulation this assumption is supported by the fesem images of fouling layers formed by non treated and cp treated ps mps to be specific non treated ps mps were densely packed as shown in fig 5 c since individual particles were deposited on the membrane surface unlike non treated ps mps cp treated ps mps resulted in a much rougher fouling layer fig 5 d because they formed aggregates ahead of fouling layer formation ultimately the agglomerated ps mps were bound to allow a fouling layer to possess larger gaps between particles as described in fig 5 f improving the water flux on the other hand there was no significant change 0 05 difference at best in the particle removal rate regardless of cp treatment time first of all as for the similar removal rates it boils down to the used membranes same mean pore size i e nominal mean pore size of 0 8 μm which was the right dimension to separate ps mps of 1 μm as such since the more porous fouling layer formed by the coagulated ps mps only influenced the water flux independently of the particle removal rate it was possible to overcome the trade off between the water flux and particle removal rate in short the mf process coupled with cp treatment achieved a water flux higher than twice of the control mf while maintaining a 3 log reduction of ps mp of 1 μm fig 5 b 3 3 long term ps mp removal by mf coupled with cp treatment under real world conditions we carried out the long term ps mp removal by mf coupled with cp treatment using synthetic wastewater consisting of a mixture of ps mps and mb for 24 h in order to determine the potential limitations of the proposed approach in the presence of other contaminants under real world conditions according to the ps mb filtration fig 6 a the initial water flux was found to be reduced from about 10 000 to 5000 lmh as compared to the water flux obtained from the filtration performed only with 0 h treated mps fig 5 b this initial flux decline was considered due to the denser fouling layer fig 7 a than the secondary layer formed without mb fig 5 c the denser fouling layer could be attributable to the severe membrane fouling due to the interaction between negatively charged mps 26 9 mv zeta potential and positively charged mb molecules afterward the ps mb filtration was accompanied by a 36 flux decline for 24 h as for the mp removal rate over a 3 log reduction 99 9 was maintained for the 24 h long filtration unlike the ps mb filtration the cp ps mb filtration revealed 1 6 times higher initial water flux about 8000 lmh than the ps mb filtration fig 6 a the higher initial water flux could be achieved owing to the particle size increased by cp treatment however it was not necessarily mean that the larger particles were beneficial for efficient filtration from the perspective of the long term filtration of the mixture consisting of mps and other foulants to be specific the cp ps mb filtration revealed a steeper flux decline throughout 24 h ending up with a 73 flux decline and 32 lower water flux at 24 h than the ps mb filtration fig 6 a the more severe flux decline was assumed to arise from the rougher surface formed by the larger particles given that rougher membranes are likely susceptible to solute adsorption and membrane fouling 68 however regardless of the more significant flux decline the cp ps mb filtration also kept the mp removal higher than 99 9 throughout 24 h upon consideration of the fact that the larger mps could entail more severe membrane fouling we tried to remove mb molecules along with mps by cp treatment the cp treatment of the mixture of mps and mb was found to be able to attain mp coagulation and mb degradation at the same time specifically cp treatment successfully increased the size of ps beads in the mixture from about 1 2 to 5 6 μm for 8 h fig 8 a meanwhile cp was effective in degrading nascent mb molecules which was evidenced by the uv absorbance dropped to zero within 2 h fig 8 b however the cp ps mb filtration rather exhibited 17 lower initial water flux than the ps mb filtration which was also the case for the 24 h filtration the cp ps mb filtration showed the most pronounced flux decline 85 decline such that the final water flux was also the lowest among the three types of mixture filtration fig 6 a to clarify the root cause of the severe flux decline observed in the cp ps mb filtration we examined a toc concentration during the 8 h cp treatment of a 10 ppm mb solution according to the toc analysis the toc concentration of the 8 h cp treated mb solution varied from 4 4 to 7 0 ppm this result means that degraded mb molecules with low molecular weights remained unmineralized over a certain level even after 8 h cp treatment although nascent mb molecules were found to be degraded in the uv absorption analysis considering that a fouling layer could retain small molecular weight organic contaminants 69 leading to greater irreversible membrane fouling 70 it is presumed that low molecular weight mb derivatives generated by cp treatment exacerbated membrane fouling and thereby resulted in the most significant flux decline these results signify that it is more advisable to apply ndom mf coupled with cp treatment to water treatment processes where organic foulants are relatively scarce rather than wastewater treatment processes more likely to be exposed to various kinds of pollutants 3 4 comparison of the mp removal efficiency of ndom mf coupled with cp treatment with other approaches table 4 shows various approaches to removing mps and their performances the most eye catching point was that most cases aimed to separate much larger mps 75 5000 μm than 1 μm which means that the existing studies have not yet investigated their technologies feasibility for potentially harmful mps i e 1 μm to human health indeed there was a lack of studies dealing with small mps including 1 μm size although a couple of papers handling small mps including 1 μm size were found in our literature search they did not provide their methodologies removal efficiencies which is not enough to guide future mp removal strategies in this regard our study could provide insights into a useful method to address small mps threatening our health in particular a high removal rate i e 99 9 obtained from this study is substantially meaningful in that it was achieved despite quite a small particle size another selling point of the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment is the much higher productivity per unit time and membrane area than the other membrane filtration processes addressing mps including 1 μm size thanks to the pore size guaranteeing high water flux and high removal rate of 1 μm mps simultaneously note that the other mp removal processes including membrane filtration used membranes with small pores of 0 03 to 0 22 μm although the mps sizes ranged from 1 to 5000 μm 24 71 73 lastly the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment has several benefits from the perspective of facile and environmentally friendly processes for example conventional coagulation processes have to factor in and control various conditions such as ph oxygen saturation stirring speed etc 24 72 74 76 which is quite a contrast to the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment relatively free from the aforementioned constraints furthermore unlike conventional coagulation processes the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment does not require the addition of chemicals e g coagulants this is one of the biggest selling points of the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment because it makes the new process more in accord with carbon neutrality by minimizing concomitant carbon emission in the whole process encompassing material production and transportation to coagulation treatment specifically conventional coagulation requires the production and transportation of coagulants while possibly leaving the residual metal ions e g aluminum behind the coagulation process in stark contrast cp treatment can produce coagulating agents i e nitrate ions only with air on the spot which does not require any costly materials or transportation on top of that mp coagulation can be achieved with only a small amount of ions such as about 1 2 ppm nitrate ions at best which is much lower than the permissible level established by the world health organization who 50 and 15 ppm for adults and children respectively 77 accordingly cp treatment is highly likely to be freer from the environmental burden caused by residual chemicals overall the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment could contribute to realizing an economic and environmentally friendly mp removal process without additional operating costs and environmental burdens imposed by the use of chemicals 3 5 future issues mp removal by membrane filtration is at a very early stage for that reason the experts working in the relevant field are doubling down on establishing a standardized method to evaluate the mp removal efficiency by membrane filtration however many issues regarding membrane based mp removal still remain unanswered for example it is impossible to determine the amount of mps in a permeate solution by using a turbidity meter because the particle concentration is too low to detect with a turbidity meter accordingly it is challenging to measure the mp removal rate by membrane filtration based on turbidity however since it should be better to give it a try to find a new method to estimate the mp removal efficiency than leaving membrane based mp removal in an area of uncertainty we have designed the counting method in an effort to assess the mp removal rate using the sem images including mps in permeate solutions in our previous study although the counting method allowed us to weigh up the mp removal efficiency complementary measures are needed to improve the accuracy reliability and simplicity of the evaluation method to examine the mp removal efficiency beyond the first proposed method meanwhile particle shape is known to influence particle dynamics such as particle absorption cake formation i e particle accumulation and particle transportation during the membrane filtration process 80 as an example the cross sectional area of particles can vary with particle shape affecting the particle drag force and the resulting particle transportation during the filtration process in this regard it is worth noting that mps in reality should have a variety of shapes unlike ps mps with spherical shapes in other words it is required to take account of mps shapes to predict the membrane filtration efficiency during mp removal and address the inherent limitation stemming from real world factors such as various shapes of mps lastly this study zeroed in on membrane based mp removal using 1 μm ps stock solutions with a size range between 0 51 and 2 976 μm corresponding to mps however it is a fact that plastic weathering entails not only mps but also nps which are also likely to have a negative impact on human health therefore it is advisable to investigate the feasibility of an mf process for np removal and optimize the membranes and membrane processes for np removal down the road 4 conclusions this study demonstrates the efficient removal of 1 μm mps by an ndom mf process coupled with cp treatment cp treatment was effective in increasing the particle size of mps by supplying nitrate ions thereby increasing the ionic strength while reducing the electrical double layer s thickness indeed the particle size increased by about 3 2 times from 1 1 μm to 3 5 μm after 8 h cp treatment we also checked that the ftir peak intensity of an oh functional group became more prominent as ros attack on the surface of ps mps increased with cp treatment time contributing to the interaction between cp treated mps and the resulting coagulation thanks to the increased particle size it was possible to utilize an ndom mf process to remove coagulated mps leading to a 124 increase in the water flux compared to the existing mf process while maintaining 99 9 removal efficiency furthermore as a result of increasing the mp size by cp treatment the mp size could also meet the requirement for absolute retention which is known to be theoretically achievable when the particle size is 2 to 3 times larger than the membrane pore size 32 as such the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment can help us find a more efficient approach for mp removal from the perspective of productivity while theoretically and empirically guaranteeing the quality of the treated water we hope this study could provide insights into an efficient membrane based mp removal process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

ndom mf coupled with cold plasma cp treatment cp treatment increased the particle size of mps from 1 1 μm to 3 5 μm by setting off a chain of coagulation process including the increased nitrate concentration increased ionic strength and reduced thickness of the electrical double layer such coagulated mps enabled ndom mf to exhibit 124 higher water flux than the existing mf while maintaining a 99 9 removal rate furthermore given that the performance improvement was achieved without secondary contamination arising from adding coagulants it was expected that ndom mf coupled with the cp process could provide a sustainable and eco friendly approach to removing mps keywords microplastics polystyrene cold plasma coagulation microfiltration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it is not too much to say that this is an era of plastics in that our routine life is full of countless industrial products made of a variety of plastics prime examples are polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene pe polyurethane pu and polyethylene terephthalate pet the demand for them is growing thanks to their excellent mechanical properties including toughness and elasticity light weight and flexible design at a low price 1 4 as a result global plastic production has recently increased to 368 million metric tons 5 6 however as two sides of the same coin too much consumption of plastics ended up in an incredible amount of plastic waste especially the disposal of plastic waste has become even more pronounced since the covid 19 pandemic because the need for medical and packaging plastics increased by 370 and 40 respectively 7 unfortunately only 6 26 of plastic waste is recycled and the rest is landfilled or discharged into the environment 8 9 discarded plastics have often been found in the form of degraded plastic particles in various aquatic systems such as oceans lakes rivers and municipal wastewater 1 10 12 some of them are weathered into microplastic mp debris of which the size falls between 100 nm and 5 mm 1 13 15 notably since mps are likely to pass through the widely used filters in wastewater treatment plants regardless of the type of filter coarse filter 6 mm fine filter 1 5 6 mm 2 16 18 it is necessary to develop water treatment technologies capable of coping with the leakage of mps into the environment another point worthy of note is that the degree of harm to human health depends strongly on the size of mps in detail mps smaller than 1 μm i e 100 nm mp 1 μm not only adsorb hydrophobic toxic pollutants but can also negatively affect immune responses causing cytotoxicity 18 20 unfortunately it is rare to find practical information about removing mps smaller than 1 μm to remove mps smaller than 1 μm we can look for a way from the previously used advanced treatment techniques e g oxidation coagulation membrane filtration biochar adsorption etc to remove mps 21 26 among the aforementioned technologies to remove mps from water advanced oxidation processes aops could be considered the best if they can successfully mineralize mps and thereby guarantee their thorough removal however it is quite challenging to completely make it to the cleavage of carbon carbon bonds of the above mentioned plastic polymers via aops furthermore if aops or other degradation processes of mps leave much smaller nano plastics nps 100 nm 15 behind without mineralizing mps the attempts to break them down can be self defeating in stark contrast membrane filtration physically separates mp debris based on size exclusion without causing particle size reduction accordingly it could exclude the risk in terms of np generation in the middle of a process and provide a more reliable solution to remove mps from water instead there is room for further productivity i e water flux improvement per unit time and area while maintaining a high mp removal rate since bigger matters than 0 45 μm have been regarded as particulates 27 people have used mf membranes with a smaller mean pore size than 0 45 μm to remove mps despite the low water flux meanwhile it is undesirable to recklessly increase the pore size without attention to the influence of increasing pore size on a removal rate due to the trade off between the water flux and removal rate 4 28 30 on the other hand if the removal rate is kept within absolute retention over the left shoulder increasing the mean pore size can also be considered effective in improving the productivity of a membrane based mp removal process without compromising the quality of the treated water note that absolute retention could be achieved when particle size is 2 3 times larger than a mean pore size at minimum 31 in this regard one can combine coagulation and near dissolved organic matter microfiltration ndom mf which uses membranes with a mean pore size greater than but close to doms 32 as an excellent strategy to enhance the water flux without compromising mp removal ndom mf features a larger mean pore size than 0 45 μm but a smaller nominal mean pore size than 1 μm to efficiently remove particulates from water while going beyond the water flux of the existing mf as for the removal rate to ensure absolute retention it can be achieved by coupling coagulation with ndom mf despite the large mean pore size of membranes used for ndom mf herein we came up with the idea of utilizing cold plasma cp which is known as one of the aops with strong oxidizing power and eco friendliness 33 34 for the coagulation of mps specifically cp can be used to produce reactive nitrogen and oxygen species rns and ros 3 35 independently of ph temperature and catalyst 3 36 38 the generated rns could contribute to coagulation without coagulants by increasing the ionic strength of a feed solution and thereby reducing the electrical double layer s thickness on top of that cp treatment could change the surface chemical characteristics of mps 39 41 and lead to the interaction between cp treated mps which is favorable for coagulation these benefits obtainable from cp treatment can be achieved without concerns about the potential risks that can harm living organisms and the environment by the reactive species produced by cp treatment since the reactive species activities cannot last in the first place after being discharged into the environment due to their short life span 34 42 43 we hope this work provides insights into mp removal by making the most of the advantage of ndom mf coupled with cp treatment while avoiding the concern of secondary contaminants in aquatic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials used for mf and cp treatment considering that ps is one of the most commonly found plastics in the water body 44 a ps latex bead stock solution sigma aldrich 10 ml 10 wt 89904 10ml f with a nominal average size of 1 μm was used as a model foulant a ps stock solution was diluted in di water to prepare a specific concentration for cp treatment or mf test the feed solution containing a diluted 1 μm bead solution was labeled as a 1 μm bead solution the membrane used in the mf test was a commercial mixed cellulose ester mce membrane advantec japen featuring a nominal mean pore size of 0 8 μm and hydrophilic properties 2 2 characterizations we used a particle size analyzer laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer partica mini la 350 horiba japan and a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd uk to check the particle size zeta potential and electrical conductivity of a ps bead solution containing cp treated ps mps respectively the laser wavelengths applied to the particle size analyzer and zeta potential analyzer were 650 nm and 633 nm respectively the ps refractive index was 1 6 upon consideration of measurement at room temperature 45 46 the removal rate was estimated based on the counting method using the images obtained with a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem gemini 500 carl zeiss germany installed in the center for university wide research facilities curf at jeonbuk national university as reported previously 32 the fesem was also utilized to observe a fouling layer formed on the membrane surface after mf a uv visible spectrophotometer sp uv1100 dlab china was used to confirm the variation in the methylene blue mb concentration at different cp treatment times as reported previously 47 the mb concentration was measured at 664 nm a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc lch shimadzu japan was used to analyze the toc concentration of mb solutions cp treated for different times fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis was investigated using a spectrometer 6300fv irt5000 jasco japan to investigate the surface functional groups of ps mps that vary with the cp treatment a turbidity meter orion aq4500 thermo scientific usa was used to double check the coagulation of ps beads induced by cp treatment the nitrate concentration which increased proportionally with cp treatment time was measured using an ion chromatograph ic dionex aquion thermofisher usa lastly the mean pore size and bubble point pore size of the membranes used for mf were measured using a capillary flow porometer cfp cfp 34rtf8a x 6 l4 porous materials inc usa and a fluid galwick solution with low surface tension 0 0159 n m 1 48 based on the wet up dry up method and the following relationship 49 1 d 4 γcos θ p where d is the measured internal pore length μm of the membrane γ is the surface tension n m 1 of the fluid that wets the membrane θ is the contact angle between the inner pore and the wetting fluid and p is the pressure psi where the gas penetrates through the fluid 2 3 mf coupled with cp treatment for ps mp removal a lab scale cp groon co ltd korea system featured a threshold current of the maximum output power of 40 56 w the cp system can convert 220 v input ac voltage into 10 000 v dc voltage to produce reactive radical species based on the patents of us 10 032 593 b1 european no 18160887 8 korean no 10 1295349 and no 10 1295350 35 also the cp process consisted of an air pump maximum output power of 19 w shinhwahightech zp 25 korea gas flow meter dwyer rma 22 ssv usa and glass reactor fig 1 a ambient air was sent to a cp system at 5 l min 1 which was known to be an optimal condition from the perspective of energy efficiencies 50 and converted into reactive oxygen nitrogen species via a cp system the aforementioned cp treatment process was applied to a ps bead solution to prepare cp treated ps mps in detail 0 5 ml of ps stock solution was diluted in 400 ml of di water to adjust the concentration to 125 ppm and the 125 ppm solution was sonicated for 20 min to minimize unintended coagulation cp treatment was performed for up to 8 h while stirring a bead solution at 200 rpm subsequently 20 ml of the cp treated ps bead solution was collected every 2 h 2 4 6 and 8 h and diluted in 980 ml of di water to prepare a feed solution with a concentration of 2 5 ppm afterward an mf process was carried out to remove mps since the coagulation state of cp treated ps mps should remain until they were applied to an mf test cp treated ps mps did not go through sonication on the other hand non treated ps mps were dispersed via ultrasonic treatment using a bath sonicator sk7200bt youngjin corporation china for 15 min to prevent unintended aggregation ahead of an mf test table 1 shows a brief summary of an mf test a laboratory scale crossflow mf system fig 1 b was used to evaluate the water flux l m 2 h 1 lmh and ps bead removal rate the mf system comprised a gear pump emg 4000 scist korea a pressure gauge a pulse damper a square membrane module and 1 l of feed tank the initial water flux and mp removal rate were evaluated by collecting a permeate solution for 5 min after 30 min long membrane compaction 2 4 evaluation of mp removal rate by mf since the turbidity of the microfiltration filtrate of a given 2 5 ppm feed solution was all measured as 0 ntu it was necessary to apply another method to accurately estimate the removal efficiency the particle number estimation of the prepared feed solution is derived from the intrinsic density of ps particles 1 05 g cm 3 and the particle size distribution of the feed solution specifically it started with counting the number of particles based on their volume fraction which varies with each size table 2 the particle size distribution of the commercial bead solution ranged somewhat from the average value and had many particles larger or smaller than the average value therefore rather than indiscriminately calculating the number of particles with only the average particle size and density we tried to estimate the total number of particles by estimating the number of individual particles by reflecting the volume ratio that varies depending on the particle size thus we tried to estimate the removal rate using the microscopic counting method using fesem first after the mf test 30 ml of microfiltration filtrate was collected from the filtrate 30 ml of this filtrate had a low concentration of 0 ntu but contained a small number of ps beads after 15 min sonication and thorough vortexing the filtrate was filtered using a 0 1 μm nominal pore membrane mce advantec japen by vacuum rocker 300 gaeseong science korea in this case the effective membrane area of the vacuum filtration unit corresponded to 12 56 cm2 eventually the ps beads could not pass through because they were larger than 0 1 μm in size and consequently they were dispersed and located on the 0 1 μm nominal pore size membrane s surface after making 3 fesem specimens randomly from the specimens made in this way 15 sem images per fesem specimen were taken to obtain 45 images for each sample at this time 800 was selected because the magnification was sufficient to count beads of about 1 μm therefore 45 sem images were converted to an area of 0 0063 cm2 corresponding to 0 05 of the effective membrane area of the vacuum filtration device in this way the mf test according to the cp processing time was conducted three times each on treatment time and 675 images were used as a database the ps beads in each image were counted based on the counting method in person as reported previously however 0 51 0 584 μm particles 0 8 of the total bead volume were smaller than about 50 of the average particle size 1 16 0 32 μm of the 1 μm bead solution for that reason it was hard to clearly identify them at a given 800 magnification therefore it was appropriate not to include the number of particles ranging from 0 51 to 0 584 μm in the denominator used to calculate the removal efficiency as a result the total number of particles in the 2 5 ppm solution was calculated to be approximately 3 4 billion table 3 the formula for calculating the removal rate is identical to that used in previous studies 32 2 n p n p a e a s n s where np is the expected total number of particles of the permeate solution and np is the number of particles observed using the fesem image of the membrane surface ae is the effective area cm2 of the

treatment in the condition including other foulants for 24 h synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing mb a representative organic pollutant in the water treatment system 51 with ps beads the long term filtration tests were classified based on the types of used feed solutions as follows i the 24 h long filtration test using the mixture comprising pristine mps of 2 5 ppm and 10 ppm mb ps mb filtration ii the 24 h filtration test using the mixture consisting of 8 h cp treated mps 2 5 ppm and pristine mb 10 ppm cp ps mb filtration and iii the 24 h filtration test conducted after the simultaneous cp treatment of mps 2 5 ppm and mb 10 ppm for 8 h cp ps mb filtration each mf test was conducted for 24 h under 300 rpm stirring and permeate solutions were collected at 0 5 5 10 and 24 h to evaluate the water flux and removal rate the mps removal rates were calculated using 1440 sem images obtained from the filter surfaces used for filtrating permeate solutions by the microscopic counting method as described in section 2 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation of ps mps by cp treatment fig 2 a shows the change in particle size by cp treatment interestingly for a given 8 h cp treatment time the size of the microplastics increased cp treatment did not drastically change the physical properties e g shape and size of individual ps mps accordingly this dramatic size increase was likely to arise from coagulation specifically it was confirmed that the particle size increased linearly as the cp treatment time increased as a result of the 8 h treatment the particle size increased 3 2 times 3 5 0 3 μm compared to the initial control group 1 1 μm considering that pretreatment using coagulation could improve mf performance 52 53 the coagulation effect imparted by cp treatment was meaningful this coagulation effect can be generated by a change in the interparticle interaction between particles in colloidal mps 54 and the colloidal size of mps has been reported to be 60 nm 7 μm 55 the behavior of colloidal mps particles may change due to various potential interactions in the solution and an attractive force may appear depending on several factors encompassing the media s chemical composition and the particles shape and size 56 in addition the colloidal mps depending on particle size surface properties and physicochemical properties can combine into agglomeration form 57 therefore the behavior of colloidal mps can be significantly influenced by the environment e g electrostatic repulsion surrounding mps the most relevant interaction here is electrical double layer repulsion which is commonly described by the theory of derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo 58 in detail when the ion concentration becomes higher the thickness of the electrical double layer decreases leading to double layer compression 56 the decrease in the thickness of the electrical double layer reduces the electrostatic repulsive force between the colloidal mps particles further increasing the possibility of coagulation between the mps fig 3 in this regard we tried to investigate the correlation between the mp s coagulation and an increase in ionic strength based on the change in electrical conductivity fig 2 b shows a dramatic increase in the electrical conductivity as cp treatment time increased by 8 h in the case of the control group in which only agitation was performed without cp treatment the electrical conductivity did not increase significantly in contrast the conductivity after cp treatment increased about 14 times from 0 003 ms cm 1 to 0 041 ms cm 1 the increased conductivity i e increased ionic strength was found to be related to a continuous increase in the nitrate concentration with cp treatment as shown in fig 2 c from the data we could conclude that the increased nitrate concentration by cp treatment was accompanied by an increase in the ionic strength of the ps mp solution ending up with the reduced electrical double layer and the resulting significant coagulation of ps mps furthermore ftir analysis was performed to confirm the functional group change of mps by oxidation fig 2 d shows the ftir spectra of mps before and after cp treatment the peak intensity at the wavenumber range from 3000 to 4000 cm 1 which is assigned to the oh group 59 63 became prominent significantly as cp treatment time increased since ps mps are aromatic polymers with a benzene ring in which a hydroxyl group could be formed by ros attack 64 65 hydroxyl functional groups were presumed to be probably introduced by ros attacking the benzene ring as such the hydroxyl group generated by cp treatment means the possibility of hydrogen bonding of ps mps possibly causing coagulation of mps as reported previously 66 67 overall cp treatment was assumed to induce double layer compression by the increased ionic strength and hydrogen bonding stemming from the nitrates and hydroxyl groups generated by cp treatment respectively effectively enhancing mps coagulation such coagulation between ps mps was also revealed in the fesem images of ps mps before and after cp treatment fig 2 e exhibits that ps mps prepared without cp treatment were individually accumulated while cp treated ps mps formed agglomerates fig 2 f another point worthy of note is that cp treated ps mps exclusively revealed the neck region between ps mps as marked with a red box in fig 2 f and formed the coalescence of cointegrated individual particles this evidence also strongly supports that ps mps were likely to be agglomerated by cp treatment 3 2 ps mp removal by mf coupled with cp treatment fig 4 a and b display the surface sem image of the commercial mf membrane with a nominal mean pore size of approximately 0 8 μm and a magnified sem image of the same membrane respectively the mf process was operated at 1 bar and 1 2 1 3 l min 1 of flow rate the pure water flux measured using di water was about 32 116 1179 l m 2 h 1 table 1 subsequently after the cp treatment the membrane was compacted for 30 min using the ps mp bead solution in which the coagulation effect remained as a feed solution afterward the compacted membrane was applied to evaluate the mp removal efficiency under the same conditions as described above mf tests were performed using feed solutions containing coagulated ps mps by cp treatment fig 5 a reveals the turbidity of the feed solutions prepared for the mf test after cp treatment was conducted during different time periods intriguingly the ps mp solution s turbidity which was 6 1 0 2 ntu before cp treatment was significantly reduced to 3 7 0 2 ntu almost 40 after 8 h treatment this phenomenon is also in line with the result of the particle size considering it signifies that the reduction in the number of particles could result from ps mps coagulation while their particle size increased with cp treatment accordingly the reduced turbidity also suggests that the coagulation effect stemming from cp treatment was still present until the treated bead solution was used for the mf test after cp treatment was finished thereby enhancing mf performance the mf test using a bead solution prepared without cp treatment exhibited a permeate flux of about 8800 956 lmh fig 5 b in stark contrast the water flux consistently increased with increasing cp treatment time reaching 19 800 4140 lmh after 8 h cp treatment the 124 higher water flux was thought to be attributable to a more porous fouling layer consisting of the increased particle size by cp treatment accompanied by ps mps coagulation this assumption is supported by the fesem images of fouling layers formed by non treated and cp treated ps mps to be specific non treated ps mps were densely packed as shown in fig 5 c since individual particles were deposited on the membrane surface unlike non treated ps mps cp treated ps mps resulted in a much rougher fouling layer fig 5 d because they formed aggregates ahead of fouling layer formation ultimately the agglomerated ps mps were bound to allow a fouling layer to possess larger gaps between particles as described in fig 5 f improving the water flux on the other hand there was no significant change 0 05 difference at best in the particle removal rate regardless of cp treatment time first of all as for the similar removal rates it boils down to the used membranes same mean pore size i e nominal mean pore size of 0 8 μm which was the right dimension to separate ps mps of 1 μm as such since the more porous fouling layer formed by the coagulated ps mps only influenced the water flux independently of the particle removal rate it was possible to overcome the trade off between the water flux and particle removal rate in short the mf process coupled with cp treatment achieved a water flux higher than twice of the control mf while maintaining a 3 log reduction of ps mp of 1 μm fig 5 b 3 3 long term ps mp removal by mf coupled with cp treatment under real world conditions we carried out the long term ps mp removal by mf coupled with cp treatment using synthetic wastewater consisting of a mixture of ps mps and mb for 24 h in order to determine the potential limitations of the proposed approach in the presence of other contaminants under real world conditions according to the ps mb filtration fig 6 a the initial water flux was found to be reduced from about 10 000 to 5000 lmh as compared to the water flux obtained from the filtration performed only with 0 h treated mps fig 5 b this initial flux decline was considered due to the denser fouling layer fig 7 a than the secondary layer formed without mb fig 5 c the denser fouling layer could be attributable to the severe membrane fouling due to the interaction between negatively charged mps 26 9 mv zeta potential and positively charged mb molecules afterward the ps mb filtration was accompanied by a 36 flux decline for 24 h as for the mp removal rate over a 3 log reduction 99 9 was maintained for the 24 h long filtration unlike the ps mb filtration the cp ps mb filtration revealed 1 6 times higher initial water flux about 8000 lmh than the ps mb filtration fig 6 a the higher initial water flux could be achieved owing to the particle size increased by cp treatment however it was not necessarily mean that the larger particles were beneficial for efficient filtration from the perspective of the long term filtration of the mixture consisting of mps and other foulants to be specific the cp ps mb filtration revealed a steeper flux decline throughout 24 h ending up with a 73 flux decline and 32 lower water flux at 24 h than the ps mb filtration fig 6 a the more severe flux decline was assumed to arise from the rougher surface formed by the larger particles given that rougher membranes are likely susceptible to solute adsorption and membrane fouling 68 however regardless of the more significant flux decline the cp ps mb filtration also kept the mp removal higher than 99 9 throughout 24 h upon consideration of the fact that the larger mps could entail more severe membrane fouling we tried to remove mb molecules along with mps by cp treatment the cp treatment of the mixture of mps and mb was found to be able to attain mp coagulation and mb degradation at the same time specifically cp treatment successfully increased the size of ps beads in the mixture from about 1 2 to 5 6 μm for 8 h fig 8 a meanwhile cp was effective in degrading nascent mb molecules which was evidenced by the uv absorbance dropped to zero within 2 h fig 8 b however the cp ps mb filtration rather exhibited 17 lower initial water flux than the ps mb filtration which was also the case for the 24 h filtration the cp ps mb filtration showed the most pronounced flux decline 85 decline such that the final water flux was also the lowest among the three types of mixture filtration fig 6 a to clarify the root cause of the severe flux decline observed in the cp ps mb filtration we examined a toc concentration during the 8 h cp treatment of a 10 ppm mb solution according to the toc analysis the toc concentration of the 8 h cp treated mb solution varied from 4 4 to 7 0 ppm this result means that degraded mb molecules with low molecular weights remained unmineralized over a certain level even after 8 h cp treatment although nascent mb molecules were found to be degraded in the uv absorption analysis considering that a fouling layer could retain small molecular weight organic contaminants 69 leading to greater irreversible membrane fouling 70 it is presumed that low molecular weight mb derivatives generated by cp treatment exacerbated membrane fouling and thereby resulted in the most significant flux decline these results signify that it is more advisable to apply ndom mf coupled with cp treatment to water treatment processes where organic foulants are relatively scarce rather than wastewater treatment processes more likely to be exposed to various kinds of pollutants 3 4 comparison of the mp removal efficiency of ndom mf coupled with cp treatment with other approaches table 4 shows various approaches to removing mps and their performances the most eye catching point was that most cases aimed to separate much larger mps 75 5000 μm than 1 μm which means that the existing studies have not yet investigated their technologies feasibility for potentially harmful mps i e 1 μm to human health indeed there was a lack of studies dealing with small mps including 1 μm size although a couple of papers handling small mps including 1 μm size were found in our literature search they did not provide their methodologies removal efficiencies which is not enough to guide future mp removal strategies in this regard our study could provide insights into a useful method to address small mps threatening our health in particular a high removal rate i e 99 9 obtained from this study is substantially meaningful in that it was achieved despite quite a small particle size another selling point of the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment is the much higher productivity per unit time and membrane area than the other membrane filtration processes addressing mps including 1 μm size thanks to the pore size guaranteeing high water flux and high removal rate of 1 μm mps simultaneously note that the other mp removal processes including membrane filtration used membranes with small pores of 0 03 to 0 22 μm although the mps sizes ranged from 1 to 5000 μm 24 71 73 lastly the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment has several benefits from the perspective of facile and environmentally friendly processes for example conventional coagulation processes have to factor in and control various conditions such as ph oxygen saturation stirring speed etc 24 72 74 76 which is quite a contrast to the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment relatively free from the aforementioned constraints furthermore unlike conventional coagulation processes the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment does not require the addition of chemicals e g coagulants this is one of the biggest selling points of the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment because it makes the new process more in accord with carbon neutrality by minimizing concomitant carbon emission in the whole process encompassing material production and transportation to coagulation treatment specifically conventional coagulation requires the production and transportation of coagulants while possibly leaving the residual metal ions e g aluminum behind the coagulation process in stark contrast cp treatment can produce coagulating agents i e nitrate ions only with air on the spot which does not require any costly materials or transportation on top of that mp coagulation can be achieved with only a small amount of ions such as about 1 2 ppm nitrate ions at best which is much lower than the permissible level established by the world health organization who 50 and 15 ppm for adults and children respectively 77 accordingly cp treatment is highly likely to be freer from the environmental burden caused by residual chemicals overall the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment could contribute to realizing an economic and environmentally friendly mp removal process without additional operating costs and environmental burdens imposed by the use of chemicals 3 5 future issues mp removal by membrane filtration is at a very early stage for that reason the experts working in the relevant field are doubling down on establishing a standardized method to evaluate the mp removal efficiency by membrane filtration however many issues regarding membrane based mp removal still remain unanswered for example it is impossible to determine the amount of mps in a permeate solution by using a turbidity meter because the particle concentration is too low to detect with a turbidity meter accordingly it is challenging to measure the mp removal rate by membrane filtration based on turbidity however since it should be better to give it a try to find a new method to estimate the mp removal efficiency than leaving membrane based mp removal in an area of uncertainty we have designed the counting method in an effort to assess the mp removal rate using the sem images including mps in permeate solutions in our previous study although the counting method allowed us to weigh up the mp removal efficiency complementary measures are needed to improve the accuracy reliability and simplicity of the evaluation method to examine the mp removal efficiency beyond the first proposed method meanwhile particle shape is known to influence particle dynamics such as particle absorption cake formation i e particle accumulation and particle transportation during the membrane filtration process 80 as an example the cross sectional area of particles can vary with particle shape affecting the particle drag force and the resulting particle transportation during the filtration process in this regard it is worth noting that mps in reality should have a variety of shapes unlike ps mps with spherical shapes in other words it is required to take account of mps shapes to predict the membrane filtration efficiency during mp removal and address the inherent limitation stemming from real world factors such as various shapes of mps lastly this study zeroed in on membrane based mp removal using 1 μm ps stock solutions with a size range between 0 51 and 2 976 μm corresponding to mps however it is a fact that plastic weathering entails not only mps but also nps which are also likely to have a negative impact on human health therefore it is advisable to investigate the feasibility of an mf process for np removal and optimize the membranes and membrane processes for np removal down the road 4 conclusions this study demonstrates the efficient removal of 1 μm mps by an ndom mf process coupled with cp treatment cp treatment was effective in increasing the particle size of mps by supplying nitrate ions thereby increasing the ionic strength while reducing the electrical double layer s thickness indeed the particle size increased by about 3 2 times from 1 1 μm to 3 5 μm after 8 h cp treatment we also checked that the ftir peak intensity of an oh functional group became more prominent as ros attack on the surface of ps mps increased with cp treatment time contributing to the interaction between cp treated mps and the resulting coagulation thanks to the increased particle size it was possible to utilize an ndom mf process to remove coagulated mps leading to a 124 increase in the water flux compared to the existing mf process while maintaining 99 9 removal efficiency furthermore as a result of increasing the mp size by cp treatment the mp size could also meet the requirement for absolute retention which is known to be theoretically achievable when the particle size is 2 to 3 times larger than the membrane pore size 32 as such the ndom mf coupled with cp treatment can help us find a more efficient approach for mp removal from the perspective of productivity while theoretically and empirically guaranteeing the quality of the treated water we hope this study could provide insights into an efficient membrane based mp removal process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

unlabelled image keywords valorisation electrodeposition lead oxide thin film pesticide aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine c3h8no5p is one of the most used herbicides for agricultural forestry and urban setting in the world that is why this molecule is largely found in environment and particularly in surface and ground waters 1 2 moreover glyphosate can be accumulated in soils with a long half life due to its strong adsorption on minerals 3 but it can be also degraded indeed aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa which is more toxic and persistent than glyphosate is commonly found in soils as a metabolite of microbial degradation of this widely used herbicide most studies that have analysed both glyphosate and ampa in environmental water samples have assumed that the ampa is derived at least mainly from degradation of glyphosate 4 5 a study performed by struger and byer between 2009 and 2011 on 219 sites on the world shows that 77 2 among them are contaminated by glyphosate and 76 7 by ampa 5 in 2015 the international agency for research on cancer classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans due to its suspected toxicity this molecule is controlled and regulated in water for instance the concentration of glyphosate found in surface or ground water is in the range of 2 430 μg l 1 in the usa higher than in europe 0 59 165 μg l 1 these values exceed the maximum contaminant level goal of 0 7 μg l 1 for drinking water 1 therefore it is always necessary to improve and or to develop processes able to degrade glyphosate contained in wastewaters coming from urban industrial or agricultural and ideally with no production of ampa total mineralisation several review papers have compiled the main treatment technologies applied for the elimination of glyphosate 3 6 the most conventional methods are i adsorption 7 9 ii biological treatment 10 11 iii advanced oxidation processes aops 12 13 and iv electro chemical oxidation process of glyphosate or ampa by different types of materials 14 17 this latter method appears very promising for future applications for example pure birnessite a manganese oxide as electrodeposited thin films used as material electrodes is an eco friendly and efficient technique for the degradation of glyphosate and ampa until mineralisation of 80 in very soft conditions room temperature and at low costs very low electric inputs no production of radicals although long interaction durations may be required for concentrated solutions this material can self regenerating which is a real asset for applications 14 this low electric input is a very easy way to improve the spontaneous degradation capacities of the thin films of manganese oxides e g oxidation processes via spontaneous electronic transfers and their self regenerating capacities 14 in the literature other materials used as electrodes are reported to degrade glyphosate with more or less complex compositions i e ti ir0 30sn0 70o2 ti ruo2 0 70 ta2o5 0 30 ti ru0 30pb0 70o2 15 for example neto and de andrade 15 have studied glyphosate oxidation by using complexes anodes in chloride medium after 4 h of electrolysis with an anode ti ir0 30sn0 70o2 a complete glyphosate removal from the electrolysed solution was achieved in the chloride matrix the application of 50 ma cm 2 allowed to reach nearly total mineralisation release of phosphate ions close to 91 however chlorination can be inappropriate notably from the associated risk of forming toxic by products such as organochlorinated compounds as far as we know only two studies in the literature have investigated the electro degradation of glyphosate by pure pbo2 one on 3d anodes boron doped diamond bdd electrodes 16 and the other one on ti 17 the degradation performed by electro oxidation following the application of current with high intensities seems efficient to degrade glyphosate with high mineralisation rates nam tran et al 17 provide by measurement of total organic carbon toc a degradation of 95 of glyphosate by using ti pbo2 anode in sulphate medium with a current intensity equal to 4 77 a and a treatment time fixed to 173 min however it is important to mention that lead released in solution was not measured during the degradation while this point could be essential for applications therefore it appears that the degradation was performed only by electro oxidation following the application of current with high intensities in contrary no study has yet investigated the possible spontaneous degradation of pbo2 by oxidation processes as far as we know in the present article we studied different thin films of pure lead oxides with original nanostructures for testing their electro chemical oxidation capacities towards glyphosate the synthesis conditions of these materials were determined previously in relation with an innovating electrochemical process of water depollution containing soluble lead 18 19 they were electrodeposited by varying the potential the ph and the medium containing soluble lead the crystalline structures of these films never reported in the literature appear originals for such oxides and could be very interesting for these semiconductor materials which can be used in numerous applications catalysis energy photovoltaic and particularly for electro catalytic reactions towards organic pollutants indeed pbo2 is known in the literature for having good properties to degrade pharmaceuticals pollutants for example 20 the first part of this paper describes the synthesis of these films and their particular crystalline structures and the second part is devoted to the study of their degradation capacities towards glyphosate in first by spontaneous interaction and in second one by coupling with electrochemistry we have chosen to study the behaviour of these materials towards the degradation of glyphosate because we have already developed its very efficient electro degradation by thin films of manganese oxides with very low energy inputs in this context we have developed a systematic and rigorous experimental procedure based on analyses of solution in addition to the characterisation of materials 14 21 which was similarly applied in the present paper finally some information about possible applications are given and discussed 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals reagents glyphosate 1000 μg ml 1 pestanal analytical standard sigma aldrich 100 naoh 1 m fluka 97 nacl acs

electrochemical synthesis of lead oxides thin films the electrodeposition of lead oxide thin films were done by using 50 ml of pb ii solution prepared at 27 mg l 1 in different media such as pure water milli q or in the presence of nacl 1 m or nano3 1 m or na2so4 1 m the ph of the solution was adjusted by naoh 1 m if necessary chronoamperometry method was used for the electrodeposition of lead oxide thin film by imposing a constant potential with a fixed electrical charge q coulomb c the choice of the synthesis potential according to the chemical medium for each thin film was made according to the depollution process already patented and published 18 19 a classical electrochemical cell with three electrodes was used a reference electrode of mercurous sulphate type a platinum wire as a

electrodeposition was performed at room temperature with gentle stirring of solution by a magnetic stirrer 250 rpm 2 3 electro chemical oxidation experiments degradation studies were performed with one sample of electrodeposited lead oxide introduced into a cell containing 20 ml of milli q water with glyphosate no electrolyte at different concentrations from 25 μm 4 2 mg l 1 to 200 μm 33 8 mg l 1 different parameters were studied and optimised for an efficient degradation of glyphosate until mineralisation initial ph of solution lead oxide sample type value of the imposed potential at the end of the interactions the ph was systematically measured and no change was noted whatever the conditions 2 4 analyses of solution the solutions being always clear whatever the conditions the analyses were performed directly without filtration to determine the concentrations of glyphosate and ampa nitrate and phosphate ions the solutions were analysed by ion chromatography thermo fisher scientific dionex integrion hpic before and after interaction the column type is dionex ionpac as19 4μm ic columns and hydroxide was the eluent used with a gradient method nevertheless it is well known that orthophosphate ions generated by cp bond cleavage are the better indicator of mineralisation rates of glyphosate 14 21 22 that is why for determining the degradation and or mineralisation of glyphosate we based on the determination of the remained concentrations of glyphosate in addition to the concentrations of ampa and phosphate ions produced therefore after interaction of lead oxide

absorbance measurements were performed at wavelength λ 520 nm by a spectrophotometer varian cary 50 uv visible agilent in an optical cell 1 cm 19 2 5 characterisation of thin films all characterisations were carried out before and after interactions directly without any preparation step since the thin films were sufficient conductive and adherent the crystal structure of the recovered films was determined by x ray diffraction xrd with classical measurements θ 2θ by a bruker θ θ diffractometer equipped with a copper anode λ cu 1 540600 å and a lynxeye detector the texture of the thin films was observed by a meb feg merlin zeiss scanning electron microscopy sem these observations were supplemented by energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses eds to determine the chemical composition 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrodeposition of lead oxide thin films influence of the medium the electrodeposition of lead oxides thin films was performed from a pb ii solution under different conditions depending of the ph and the medium either in pure milli q water either in the presence of ionic species and based to our previous study focused on the total depollution of aqueous solutions containing soluble lead 18 19 the experimental conditions of the six different types of samples are regrouped in table 1 in the aim to study its eventual effect on the nanostructure different values of electric charges were imposed during the electrodeposition 0 45c and 0 9c in complement to the free electric charge q corresponding to the total removal of lead containing in the starting solution 27 mg l 1 this latter value varying in function of the experimental conditions for each case the adherent films electrodeposited on the conductive substrate sno2 were characterized by xrd sem and eds 3 1 1 in pure milli q water fig 1 reports the three diffractograms of the films electrodeposited in pure milli q water for the different values of ph and potentials as indicated in table 1 in all cases the solids are well crystallized with the presence of many peaks and the crystallinity increases with the electric charge in link to an increase of the electrodeposited amount faraday s law eq 3 the main diffraction peaks observed for the three diffractograms at 25 4 32 0 36 2 49 1 52 2 62 5 and 74 5 belong to the β pbo2 planes 110 101 200 211 220 301 and 321 respectively by comparison with the standard diffraction peaks jcpds 89 2805 but for an electrodeposition performed at ph 4 2 and a potential of 0 7 v pb3o4 is also detected according to jcpds 85 0859 card however as a few amount due to the very low intensity of the characteristic peaks observed at 23 2 and 30 8 planes 100 and 110 respectively these results are in good coherence with the diagram of pourbaix 23 fig 2 presents the sem observations of the deposits obtained for q 0 9c and the free electrical charges corresponding to the total elimination of soluble lead with the associated analyses by eds in all cases lead and oxygen are detected with percentages in good agreement with the xrd measurements which report the formation of pure oxides the presence of sn corresponding to the substrate i e sno2 was not detected for these values of electric charges indicating that the amount and or covering of the surface were important it appears also that the morphology of the crystals varies considerably in function of the conditions potential and ph for a solution at ph 4 2 and under a potential of 0 7 v crystals present irregular morphologies no defined shape which is the most common morphology found in the literature 24 25 by increasing the electric charge q the morphology was preserved as well as the size of the crystals but the covered surface becomes more important when the electrodeposition occurred at 1 0 v at ph 2 the crystals present the same irregular morphology and when the electric charge q increases the surface coverage stayed identical with the preservation of such morphology in contrary under a potential of 1 2 v at ph 2 the crystals have the appearance of branches which become more and more dendritic with the increase of the electric charge q while the irregular morphology is the most common found in the literature 24 25 conversely no study in the literature mentions the electrodeposition of lead oxide as β pbo2 under other morphologies such as branches or dendritic branches as reported in this study 3 1 2 in presence of ionic species the electrodeposition of lead oxide films was performed by imposing a potential of 0 7 v at ph 4 2 in the presence of nacl 1 m or nano3 1 m or na2so4 1 m for different values of electrical charges as previously the adherent films obtained were characterized by xrd observed by sem and analysed by eds the x ray diffractograms of these films show that the solids are well crystallized and that their crystallinity increases with the electric charge q fig 3 in the presence of nacl 1 m or na2so4 1 m an adherent film of pure β pbo2 is obtained while in the presence of nano3 1 m the deposit is composed of a mixture of lead oxides similarly as in pure water for this value of ph β pbo2 as a main compound with a small amount of pb3o4 furthermore a significant preferential orientation was observed in the case of nacl and nano3 according to the plane 101 at 32 0 and 200 at 36 2 respectively the deposits obtained for q 0 9c and the free electrical charges corresponding to the total elimination of soluble lead were also observed by sem and analysed by eds fig 4 according to the eds analyses lead and oxygen are detected in all cases with the percentages of oxygen and lead in good agreement with xrd results confirming the formation of pure lead oxides as previously the presence of sn corresponding to the substrate i e sno2 was not detected for these values of electric charges indicating that the amount and or covering of the surface were important moreover it also appears on fig 4 that the morphology of the crystals varies considerably depending of the ions present in solution and also according to the electric charge q proportionally related to the amount of material electrodeposited according to faraday s law eq 3 for example in the presence of nacl 1 m crystals of pure β pbo2 are in the form of needles for an electric charge equal to 0 9c and when the electric charge raises the needles growth as cubic form in the presence of nano3 1 m lead was electrodeposited as a mixture of β pbo2 and pb3o4 according to xrd measurements and the morphology of the crystals is irregular for an electric charge fixed to 0 9c however for a quantity of electricity equal to 1 97c corresponding to a total elimination of lead one obtains a morphology in the shape of pyramid which is in good coherence with the preferential orientation observed on diffractogram for this specific value of electric charge in contrary in presence of na2so4 1 m lead oxide electrodeposited as pure β pbo2 presents always an irregular and classical morphology for both amounts of electricity 0 9c and 1 25c these different morphologies can be due to that following the nucleation phase some ions in solution nacl or na2so4 or nano3 can poison certain surfaces and then induce the growth of particles in specific directions indeed some molecules can be adsorbed and modified the growth process even blocking the active sites inhibiting 26 table 1 summarizes the conditions of the six electrodeposited lead oxide samples with the duration and the mass for an electric charge fixed to 0 9c and the associated composition and morphology the choice of this electric charge value allows having the minimum possible mass of pbo2 electrodeposited with a good repeatability of synthesis furthermore in all cases thin films were well adherent and visually very homogeneous it appears also that in all cases the synthesis of the films is performed by the formation of 3d islands during the electrochemical process this observation is relatively classical for electrodeposition process that begins generally from surface or nucleation site defects 18 19 26 according to faraday s law eq 3 the theoretical mass of the electrodeposited lead oxide as pbo2 for an electrical charge fixed to q 0 9c is equal to 1 11 10 3 g with n 2 and m 239 2 g mol 1 3 m theo q n f m with q the electrical charge n the number of electrons required for the formation of one mole of the studied chemical compound f faraday s constant 96 485c mol 1 m molecular weight of the studied chemical compound it appears that the faradic and precipitation yields vary for each electrodeposition condition which is not surprising due to the difference of morphologies table 1 few studies in the literature describe the mechanism of lead oxide formation and all these studies have the objective of synthesizing this compound for various applications and not in the aim to depollute aqueous solutions 27 29 that is why these original morphologies in the form of branches needles pyramids and cubes are not classical and were never reported in the literature as far as we know hence knowing if these samples are interesting for applications and particularly for electro catalytic applications seemed pertinent for that we have studied their degradation capacity towards glyphosate as organic pollutant by spontaneous and electrochemical ways 3 2 degradation of glyphosate and expected by products the mineralisation of glyphosate has been largely studied in the literature by different processes such as via microbial degradation 30 birnessite powder 22 or as electrodeposited thin films 14 21 or by advanced oxidation process 3 two mains degradation pathways for glyphosate are reported in the literature one by cn bond cleavage in first via the production of ampa which can be also degraded into phosphate ions eqs 4 1 and 4 2 respectively and the other one by a direct mineralisation into phosphate ions by cp bond cleavage eq 5 unlabelled image glyphosate degradation via ampa production cn bond cleavage 4 1 c 3 h 8 npo 5 2 h 2 o ch 6 npo 3 2 co 2 6h 6 e 4 2 ch 6 npo 3 6 h 2 o co 2 no 3 po 4 3 18 h 14 e direct mineralisation of glyphosate cp bond cleavage 5 c 3 h 8 npo 5 8 h 2 o 3 co 2 no 3 po 4 3 24 h 20 e as far as we know only two studies in the literature report the degradation of glyphosate by pure lead oxide and only under the effect of high applied currents and not by a simple direct contact e g spontaneous reaction or with very few electrical inputs like performed with thin films of manganese oxides 14 21 according to these two studies the degradation was done through the generation of physically adsorbed hydroxyl radicals and the oxidation of glyphosate may be total it is important to mention also that no studies in the literature have measured the release of lead in solution during the degradation while this point could be essential for applications in this study the option of direct electronic transfers was supposed due to the strong oxidant properties of lead oxides for that the degradation of glyphosate could be similar to that observed in the case of manganese oxide thin films 14 21 either in spontaneous way either coupled to electrochemistry however in this latter case the formation of radicals can be excluded since the intensity of currents will be very low only few μa cm 2 if glyphosate is partially degraded into ampa or totally mineralised then in parallel lead oxide must be reduced with the production of pb iii and or pb ii species by spontaneous electronic transfers however pb iii being very unstable 31 it is more likely that pb iv will be reduced into soluble pb ii eq 6 reduction of lead pb iv contained in lead oxide 6 pb iv 2 e pb ii for proving that glyphosate was degraded and or mineralised with lead oxides thin films by spontaneous reactions and or with a low electrical inputs the concentrations of glyphosate and by products such as ampa nitrate and phosphate ions were systematically quantified by ion chromatography and the release of lead in solution was measured after each interaction by uv visible measurements using the spectroquant kit in complement to the characterisation of the solids by xrd sem and eds after interaction experiments 3 3 studies of the degradation ability of these electrodeposited lead oxide thin films towards glyphosate by spontaneous interaction the influence of different parameters such as the initial ph of the solution the initial concentration of glyphosate the type of sample was studied nevertheless in a first step for studying the optimal parameters of degradation the conditions were researched with the sample pb 01 electrodeposited with an electrical charge fixed to 0 9c which corresponds to a classical morphology for a mixture of lead oxides a majority of ß pbo2 with small amount of pb3o4 table 1 3 3 1 effect of ph the effect of ph was studied for a solution containing glyphosate with a concentration of 100 μm 16 9 mg l 1 the ph of the solution was adjusted by the addition of naoh 1 m ranging from 4 1 free to 10 one sample of lead oxide pb 01 s 3 cm2 was introduced into 20 ml of this solution the interactions were carried out in a thermostatically controlled oven at 25 c for 24 h under stirring at 250 rpm fig 5 shows that after 24 h for a ph equal to 4 1 50 μm of glyphosate were detected in solution corresponding to 50 of degradation calculated according to eq 1 in contrary for ph 7 2 and ph 10 glyphosate was largely detected in solution with 90 μm and 100 μm respectively corresponding only to 10 of degradation and no degradation moreover the degradation of glyphosate occurred via the cn bond cleavage with the formation of ampa as the major product in addition to the formation of a small amount of phosphate and nitrate ions in parallel a significant release of lead in solution was observed 40 μm particularly at ph 4 1 when the most amount of glyphosate was degraded according to the literature lead oxide β pbo2 has a zero charge point 4 8 7 4 31 the zero charge point corresponds to the ph for which the lead oxide surface has a neutral charge below this ph value the lead oxide surface is positively charged and above the ph value the surface charge is negative on the other hand glyphosate has three functions a carboxylic acid function a phosphoric acid function and an amine function it can exist in five different ionisation states depending on ph with pka values equal to 0 8 2 6 5 6 and 10 6 21 32 the pka values of 0 8 and 5 6 are attributed to the phosphoric acid function the pka value of 2 6 to the carboxylic acid function and the pka value of 10 6 to the amine function with increasing ph the acid functions release their hydrogens leading to a negatively charged molecule 33 in the ph range when the maximum degradation was obtained the solid pbo2 is positively charged while the overall charge of the glyphosate is negative which explains an optimal attraction between the two allowing to promote the degradation and in good coherence with the presence of soluble lead the observations of pb 01 thin film by sem after the interaction at ph 4 1 and 10 are reported on fig 6 the sample with the degradation performed at ph 4 1 has a much less covered surface in amount of material compared to the sample before interaction fig 2 which is consistent with the glyphosate degradation rate and the release of lead in solution conversely the sample that did not allow degradation interaction at ph 10 appears intact in good coherence with the absence of lead in solution according to these results the free ph of solution containing glyphosate ph 4 1 was chosen for further studies 3 3 2 effect of sample type the effect of sample type was studied for a solution containing glyphosate at a concentration of 100 μm 16 9 mg l 1 in a volume of 20 ml the ph of the solution was 4 1 free one sample of each type of lead oxide electrodeposited with an electrical charge of 0 9c s 3 cm2 was introduced into the solution as previously the interactions were carried out in a thermostatically controlled oven at 25 c for 24 h with stirring at 250 rpm in all cases glyphosate was degraded with the main formation of ampa and some phosphate and nitrate ions in addition to a significant and equivalent release of lead in solution independently of the sample type fig 7 however the most important spontaneous degradations were obtained with samples of type pb 03 and pb 04 whose morphologies of pure β pbo2 are branches and cubic needles respectively sem observations of these six samples after their interaction and degradation of glyphosate show little modifications fig 8 compared to samples before interaction figs 2 and 4 indeed any change in the morphology of the materials was observed but only a less covered surface following a loss of the amount of electrodeposited material in good coherence with the presence of lead in solution in all cases after 24 h the concentrations of glyphosate detected in solution comprised between 40 and 50 μm according to the type of samples were significantly decreased compared to the initial concentration 100 μm fig 7 indicating degradation rates close to 50 in these experimental conditions glyphosate was mainly degraded into ampa via spontaneous electronic transfers that occurs at the surface of lead oxide thin film this degradation was accompanied by a release of lead in solution 40 μm but the quantity found in solution is largely lower than the expected amount 10 experimental vs 50 theoretical expected considering the experimental degradation rates of glyphosate into ampa according to these equations eqs 4 1 4 2 and 6 this result supposes a possible adsorption of pb ii onto lead oxides surfaces as already observed for spontaneous degradation of organic compounds with manganese oxides thin films 21 34 35 however even if the amount of soluble lead is lower than expected this release can be problematic for resolving this problem we thought to couple the spontaneous degradation under the effect of applied of fixed potential indeed in our previous studies performed with manganese oxide thin films 14 the imposition of a potential leads to a significant increase of the degradation capacity but also to a total regeneration of the materials via electrodeposition in continuous 14 in a similar way the imposition of a potential in the case of lead oxides thin films could increase the degradation rates but also the electrodeposition of pb ii released in continuous according the same principle than reported in our innovating depollution process 18 19 3 4 effect of electrochemical coupling on degradation ability and release of lead in solution for these electrochemistry experiments lead oxide thin films electrodeposited onto the sno2 were used as working electrodes in a classical electrochemical set up with the same electrodes used previously for the synthesis i e a platinum wire and a mercurous sulphate electrode as the counter electrode and reference electrode respectively the other interaction conditions were the same that during spontaneous interactions for better comparison i e volume of 20 ml free ph 4 1 under fixed stirring at 250 rpm the influence of different parameters such as the value of the applied potential the type of sample studied and the concentration of the pollutant in solution were studied as previously the concentrations of glyphosate and the main by products were determined by ion chromatography the release of lead in solution was measured after each interaction by uv visible measurements using the spectroquant kit and the solids were characterized by xrd sem and eds after interaction experiments 3 4 1 choice of the value of potential applied during interaction it was important that the value of applied potential did not modify the materials during interaction and that no parasite electrochemical reactions occurred e g oxidation of water for that two potentials were chosen in order to study the influence of electrochemistry 0 7 v which is the value used for the electrodeposition of lead oxide at this ph and 0 8 v which is slightly more oxidising value this preliminary study was carried out using one sample of pb 01 as a reference after 24 h and under a potential of 0 7 v the concentration of glyphosate determined was equal to 40 μm corresponding to a degradation rate of 60 with the formation of ampa as the major compound 45 μm cn bond cleavage fig 9 a with a slight amount of nitrate and phosphate ions 5 μm for each specie respectively whereas under a potential of 0 8 v glyphosate was mainly mineralised by forming phosphate ions as the major product cp bond cleavage with a concentration equal to 55 μm accompanied by a significant amount of nitrate ions 18 μm and a low amount of ampa 10 μm in both cases the amount of lead released in solution compared to spontaneous reactions is reduced and more particularly for 0 8 v 30 μm and 5 μm for 0 7 v and 0 8 v respectively as discussed previously and for comparison glyphosate was degraded into ampa after 24 h without electrochemistry with a degradation rate equal to 50 and a significant release of lead in solution 40 μm fig 7 the effect of the electrochemistry being particularly significant for e 0 8 v with a significant mineralisation by cp bond cleavage high production of phosphate ions that is why the interaction experiments were only performed by fixing this value moreover it is important to mention that the maximal current intensity measured was 6 6 μa cm 2 graph not shown which is very low and largely inferior to the intensities values reported in the literature for the degradation of glyphosate by pure pbo2 electrode 50 ma cm 2 for example 15 17 3 4 2 effect of the sample type the same study was performed during 24 h in similar conditions 0 8 v with the different types of samples in comparison to the substrate alone sno2 in absence of lead oxide films sno2 alone glyphosate was not degraded in comparison to the all other samples fig 9 b moreover the results obtained show clearly that after 24 h the glyphosate was completely mineralised without any production of ampa only phosphate ions by using the pb 03 and pb 04 samples fig 9 b the two types of samples with particular morphologies compared to the literature branch and cubic needles respectively in addition pb ii was not detected in solution according to the analyses performed by the spectroquant kit this result is in good agreement with the hypothesis that the applied potential can allow in continuous the electrodeposition of pb ii released in solution due to the reduction of pb iv to pb ii during the degradation of glyphosate indeed the total mineralisation of glyphosate at 100 μm in 20 ml of solution at free ph 4 1 occurred after 24 h under an imposed potential of 0 8 v using a lead oxide sample pb 03 or pb 04 however based on equations eqs 5 and 6 in order to degrade one mole of glyphosate 10 mol of lead were needed for the production of 20 mol of electrons therefore to degrade spontaneous 100 μm into 20 ml 2 10 6 mol 2 10 5 mol of lead are needed to have sufficient electrons and then in consequent the release of soluble lead should be equal to 2 10 5 mol corresponding to 4 14 mg l 1 however the amount of lead released in solution after 24 h was not detected by the spectroquant kit 0 1 mg l 1 with the electrochemical coupling confirming an efficient re electrodeposition as lead oxide in complement a typical example of the current variation during the degradation of glyphosate by pb 04 sample as a function of time with the electrical charge recorded during the degradation is presented insert fig 9 b by applying the faraday s law eq 3 the theoretical electric charge should be equal to q theo 3 85c for this initial concentration of glyphosate if the total degradation was carried out only under the effect of the electrochemistry according to eq 5 however the experimental electric charge was equal to q exp 1 66c this difference can be explained probably by the fact that the electrochemistry is mainly used for the regeneration of lead oxide and that the degradation of glyphosate would be spontaneous i e by direct interaction with lead oxide thin film as reported previously the x ray diffractograms of the three types of samples pb 01 pb 03 and pb 04 show that the crystallinity of the lead oxide thin films increases after their use for the degradation of glyphosate under the effect of the potential fixed at 0 8 v compared to the samples after spontaneous interactions fig 10 these results confirm that the regeneration of the lead oxide by electrodeposition was performed by keeping the same crystal structure in addition the characterisation of these three samples by sem and their analysis by eds after the degradation of glyphosate under the effect of the potential show clearly that no modification was observed texture and covering of the substrate surface moreover the percentages of o and pb remain identical without any other chemical species fig 11 3 4 3 effect of the initial concentration of glyphosate the effect of glyphosate concentration on the degradation ability of the samples was studied using the three types of samples pb 01 pb 03 and pb 04 the solutions contained different concentrations of glyphosate 25 50 100 and 200 μm corresponding to 4 2 8 4 16 9 and 33 8 mg l 1 respectively in a volume of 20 ml with free ph these concentrations are high compared to those found in polluted waters but can correspond to real cases of polluted solutions 36 the interactions were carried out at room temperature during 24 h under stirring of 250 rpm with an applied potential equal to 0 8 v from these results presented on fig 12 we can conclude clearly that the lead oxide thin film pb 04 keeps its remarkable degradation capacities whatever the quantity of glyphosate present in solution from 25 μm to 200 μm by forming only mineral products the lead oxide thin film pb 03 also keeps the same degradation capacities towards glyphosate in solution by forming mineral products for initial concentrations ranging from 25 to 100 μm nevertheless for a higher concentration 200 μm although glyphosate is completely degraded a small amount of ampa was produced 7 μm therefore pb 03 and pb 04 samples which present original nanostructures are largely more efficient for the degradation of glyphosate compared to the sample pb 01 which presents the classical morphology however for the three types of sample it is important to highlight that we did not encounter the problem of lead release in solution regardless of the initial concentration of glyphosate to be degraded confirming the real interest of coupling spontaneous reaction with electrochemistry the x ray diffractograms of pb 04 sample before and after glyphosate degradation with different initial concentrations confirm that the thin film is still in the form of pure ß pbo2 with in addition of a significant gain in crystallinity fig 13 a these results support our hypothesis that the lead released in solution during the spontaneous degradation of glyphosate is then re electrodeposited under the effect of the imposed potential moreover the crystallinity can be improved because this value of potential is slightly higher than the value of the synthesis potential 0 7 v thus the more glyphosate is degraded in solution the more lead released is re electrodeposited with a higher crystallinity the observation of the sample pb 04 by sem fig 13 b after the total degradation of 200 μm of glyphosate under a potential of 0 8 v shows no change in the texture of the material it keeps its very particular morphology in the form of cubic needles fig 14 resumes schematically the global mechanism of glyphosate degradation in the best conditions by coupling to electrochemistry with the specific nanostructured pb 03 and pb 04 type samples 3 4 4 calculation of efficacy and energy costs for the best pb 04 sample based on these experimental results and as already reported in our previous studies concerning the degradation of glyphosate and ampa by electrodeposited thin films of manganese oxides 14 we can calculate for the highest concentration studied 200 μm the mineralisation capacity mc corresponding to the mass of glyphosate which can be mineralised by 1 g of studied material mg of glyphosate g of studied material of the best pb 04 sample according to eq 7 7 mc gly initial x v x m gly m pb 04 with gly initial 200 μm v 20 10 3 l m gly 169 07 g mol 1 m pb 04 0 6 10 3 g in these conditions the mineralisation capacity of pb 04 sample is equal to 1127 mg of glyphosate g of pb 04 which is very high and without detection of lead released in solution this capacity is probably not the maximum since higher concentrations have not been studied nevertheless this value of mineralisation capacity is widely superior to the values reported in the literature for glyphosate removed for either sorption or degradation 3 moreover the degradation was performed in very soft conditions at room temperature and ambient pressure in a classical electrochemical set up without adding reagents and or production of wastes and requiring no regeneration of the material in complement the maximum energy consumption for the degradation reaction was estimated for the best pb 04 sample based on laboratory experiments and on registered current insert fig 9 b by using the following equation eq 8 8 e consumed i v t 1000 with e the energy consumed kwh i the maximal intensity of the measured current a v the imposed potential v t the duration applied to have a total degradation of glyphosate into mineral species h taking into consideration the maximum recorded current a power consumption of 1 07 10 6 kwh was required to degrade 100 μm 16 9 mg l 1 of glyphosate until the total mineralisation this energy consumption is much lower than that reported in the literature for electrochemical oxidation of glyphosate based on the production of radicals 16 37 while the mineralisation rates obtained in this study are also very high consequently such samples with original nanostructures could certainly resolve one of the disadvantages reported generally for the electrochemical oxidations techniques based on the production of radicals 3 4 conclusions there are several effective techniques for the degradation of glyphosate but it is important to improve continuously their capabilities by avoiding and or limiting undesirable effects in this study we have reported a simple electrochemical oxidation process for the degradation and mineralisation of glyphosate performed at room temperature with very low energy inputs without the addition of electrolyte by using lead oxide thin films with particular morphologies in relation to our innovating electrochemical process of water depollution containing soluble lead the sample pb 04 a pure β pbo2 with an original cubic needles morphology seems particularly interesting when a potential equal to 0 8 v was applied indeed it allowed a total electro degradation of glyphosate without the production of ampa aminomethylphosphonic acid with a mineralisation capacity worth to 1127 mg of glyphosate g of pb 04 without pb ii released in solution due to a very efficient re electrodeposition with the same crystalline structure these results are particularly encouraging for future applications performed at low costs for the efficient degradation until mineralisation of organic pollutants such as glyphosate with no production of ampa the main by product more toxic and persistent than glyphosate moreover it is a very interesting way for valorisation of heavy metal

12398,glyphosate is a very problematic pollutant in the world this study presents a simple treatment to degrade it until total mineralisation with no production of ampa aminomethylphosphonic acid its main by product more toxic and persistent by using original nanostructured lead oxides thin films the synthesis conditions of these materials were determined previously in relation to an innovating electrochemical depollution process of water polluted by soluble lead different parameters were evaluated such as ph initial concentration lead oxide type and consequently its particular morphology the solutions were systematically analysed by ion chromatography to determine the concentrations of organic pollutants and ionic species produced and by uv visible spectroscopy to quantify released lead during process the thin films were characterized by xrd sem and eds before and after interaction the pb 04 sample type pure β pbo2 with cubic needles nanostructures seems particularly efficient to obtain a total mineralisation with a mineralisation capacity equal to 1127 56 mg of glyphosate g of material moreover lead was not released in solution due to a total regeneration with the similar crystalline structure these results are very promising for potential valorisation of heavy metals wastes for future applications at room temperature and very low electrical inputs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords valorisation electrodeposition lead oxide thin film pesticide aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine c3h8no5p is one of the most used herbicides for agricultural forestry and urban setting in the world that is why this molecule is largely found in environment and particularly in surface and ground waters 1 2 moreover glyphosate can be accumulated in soils with a long half life due to its strong adsorption on minerals 3 but it can be also degraded indeed aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa which is more toxic and persistent than glyphosate is commonly found in soils as a metabolite of microbial degradation of this widely used herbicide most studies that have analysed both glyphosate and ampa in environmental water samples have assumed that the ampa is derived at least mainly from degradation of glyphosate 4 5 a study performed by struger and byer between 2009 and 2011 on 219 sites on the world shows that 77 2 among them are contaminated by glyphosate and 76 7 by ampa 5 in 2015 the international agency for research on cancer classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans due to its suspected toxicity this molecule is controlled and regulated in water for instance the concentration of glyphosate found in surface or ground water is in the range of 2 430 μg l 1 in the usa higher than in europe 0 59 165 μg l 1 these values exceed the maximum contaminant level goal of 0 7 μg l 1 for drinking water 1 therefore it is always necessary to improve and or to develop processes able to degrade glyphosate contained in wastewaters coming from urban industrial or agricultural and ideally with no production of ampa total mineralisation several review papers have compiled the main treatment technologies applied for the elimination of glyphosate 3 6 the most conventional methods are i adsorption 7 9 ii biological treatment 10 11 iii advanced oxidation processes aops 12 13 and iv electro chemical oxidation process of glyphosate or ampa by different types of materials 14 17 this latter method appears very promising for future applications for example pure birnessite a manganese oxide as electrodeposited thin films used as material electrodes is an eco friendly and efficient technique for the degradation of glyphosate and ampa until mineralisation of 80 in very soft conditions room temperature and at low costs very low electric inputs no production of radicals although long interaction durations may be required for concentrated solutions this material can self regenerating which is a real asset for applications 14 this low electric input is a very easy way to improve the spontaneous degradation capacities of the thin films of manganese oxides e g oxidation processes via spontaneous electronic transfers and their self regenerating capacities 14 in the literature other materials used as electrodes are reported to degrade glyphosate with more or less complex compositions i e ti ir0 30sn0 70o2 ti ruo2 0 70 ta2o5 0 30 ti ru0 30pb0 70o2 15 for example neto and de andrade 15 have studied glyphosate oxidation by using complexes anodes in chloride medium after 4 h of electrolysis with an anode ti ir0 30sn0 70o2 a complete glyphosate removal from the electrolysed solution was achieved in the chloride matrix the application of 50 ma cm 2 allowed to reach nearly total mineralisation release of phosphate ions close to 91 however chlorination can be inappropriate notably from the associated risk of forming toxic by products such as organochlorinated compounds as far as we know only two studies in the literature have investigated the electro degradation of glyphosate by pure pbo2 one on 3d anodes boron doped diamond bdd electrodes 16 and the other one on ti 17 the degradation performed by electro oxidation following the application of current with high intensities seems efficient to degrade glyphosate with high mineralisation rates nam tran et al 17 provide by measurement of total organic carbon toc a degradation of 95 of glyphosate by using ti pbo2 anode in sulphate medium with a current intensity equal to 4 77 a and a treatment time fixed to 173 min however it is important to mention that lead released in solution was not measured during the degradation while this point could be essential for applications therefore it appears that the degradation was performed only by electro oxidation following the application of current with high intensities in contrary no study has yet investigated the possible spontaneous degradation of pbo2 by oxidation processes as far as we know in the present article we studied different thin films of pure lead oxides with original nanostructures for testing their electro chemical oxidation capacities towards glyphosate the synthesis conditions of these materials were determined previously in relation with an innovating electrochemical process of water depollution containing soluble lead 18 19 they were electrodeposited by varying the potential the ph and the medium containing soluble lead the crystalline structures of these films never reported in the literature appear originals for such oxides and could be very interesting for these semiconductor materials which can be used in numerous applications catalysis energy photovoltaic and particularly for electro catalytic reactions towards organic pollutants indeed pbo2 is known in the literature for having good properties to degrade pharmaceuticals pollutants for example 20 the first part of this paper describes the synthesis of these films and their particular crystalline structures and the second part is devoted to the study of their degradation capacities towards glyphosate in first by spontaneous interaction and in second one by coupling with electrochemistry we have chosen to study the behaviour of these materials towards the degradation of glyphosate because we have already developed its very efficient electro degradation by thin films of manganese oxides with very low energy inputs in this context we have developed a systematic and rigorous experimental procedure based on analyses of solution in addition to the characterisation of materials 14 21 which was similarly applied in the present paper finally some information about possible applications are given and discussed 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals reagents glyphosate 1000 μg ml 1 pestanal analytical standard sigma aldrich 100 naoh 1 m fluka 97 nacl acs

oxide thin film by imposing a constant potential with a fixed electrical charge q coulomb c the choice of the synthesis potential according to the chemical medium for each thin film was made according to the depollution process already patented and published 18 19 a classical electrochemical cell with three electrodes was used a reference electrode of mercurous sulphate type a platinum wire as a

electrodeposition was performed at room temperature with gentle stirring of solution by a magnetic stirrer 250 rpm 2 3 electro chemical oxidation experiments degradation studies were performed with one sample of electrodeposited lead oxide introduced into a cell containing 20 ml of milli q water with glyphosate no electrolyte at different concentrations from 25 μm 4 2 mg l 1 to 200 μm 33 8 mg l 1 different parameters were studied and optimised for an efficient degradation of glyphosate until mineralisation initial ph of solution lead oxide sample type value of the imposed potential at the end of the interactions the ph was systematically measured and no change was noted whatever the conditions 2 4 analyses of solution the solutions being always clear whatever the conditions the analyses were performed directly without filtration to determine the concentrations of glyphosate and ampa nitrate and phosphate ions the solutions were analysed by ion chromatography thermo fisher scientific dionex integrion hpic before and after interaction the column type is dionex ionpac as19 4μm ic columns and hydroxide was the eluent used with a gradient method nevertheless it is well known that orthophosphate ions generated by cp bond cleavage are the better indicator of mineralisation rates of glyphosate 14 21 22 that is why for determining the degradation and or mineralisation of glyphosate we based on the determination of the remained concentrations of glyphosate in addition to the concentrations of ampa and phosphate ions produced therefore after interaction of lead oxide

characterisations were carried out before and after interactions directly without any preparation step since the thin films were sufficient conductive and adherent the crystal structure of the recovered films was determined by x ray diffraction xrd with classical measurements θ 2θ by a bruker θ θ diffractometer equipped with a copper anode λ cu 1 540600 å and a lynxeye detector the texture of the thin films was observed by a meb feg merlin zeiss scanning electron microscopy sem these observations were supplemented by energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses eds to determine the chemical composition 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrodeposition of lead oxide thin films influence of the medium the electrodeposition of lead oxides thin films was performed from a pb ii solution under different conditions depending of the ph and the medium either in pure milli q water either in the presence of ionic species and based to our previous study focused on the total depollution of aqueous solutions containing soluble lead 18 19 the experimental conditions of the six different types of samples are regrouped in table 1 in the aim to study its eventual effect on the nanostructure different values of electric charges were imposed during the electrodeposition 0 45c and 0 9c in complement to the free electric charge q corresponding to the total removal of lead containing in the starting solution 27 mg l 1 this latter value varying in function of the experimental conditions for each case the adherent films electrodeposited on the conductive substrate sno2 were characterized by xrd sem and eds 3 1 1 in pure milli q water fig 1 reports the three diffractograms of the films electrodeposited in pure milli q water for the different values of ph and potentials as indicated in table 1 in all cases the solids are well crystallized with the presence of many peaks and the crystallinity increases with the electric charge in link to an increase of the electrodeposited amount faraday s law eq 3 the main diffraction peaks observed for the three diffractograms at 25 4 32 0 36 2 49 1 52 2 62 5 and 74 5 belong to the β pbo2 planes 110 101 200 211 220 301 and 321 respectively by comparison with the standard diffraction peaks jcpds 89 2805 but for an electrodeposition performed at ph 4 2 and a potential of 0 7 v pb3o4 is also detected according to jcpds 85 0859 card however as a few amount due to the very low intensity of the characteristic peaks observed at 23 2 and 30 8 planes 100 and 110 respectively these results are in good coherence with the diagram of pourbaix 23 fig 2 presents the sem observations of the deposits obtained for q 0 9c and the free electrical charges corresponding to the total elimination of soluble lead with the associated analyses by eds in all cases lead and oxygen are detected with percentages in good agreement with the xrd measurements which report the formation of pure oxides the presence of sn corresponding to the substrate i e sno2 was not detected for these values of electric charges indicating that the amount and or covering of the surface were important it appears also that the morphology of the crystals varies considerably in function of the conditions potential and ph for a solution at ph 4 2 and under a potential of 0 7 v crystals present irregular morphologies no defined shape which is the most common morphology found in the literature 24 25 by increasing the electric charge q the morphology was preserved as well as the size of the crystals but the covered surface becomes more important when the electrodeposition occurred at 1 0 v at ph 2 the crystals present the same irregular morphology and when the electric charge q increases the surface coverage stayed identical with the preservation of such morphology in contrary under a potential of 1 2 v at ph 2 the crystals have the appearance of branches which become more and more dendritic with the increase of the electric charge q while the irregular morphology is the most common found in the literature 24 25 conversely no study in the literature mentions the electrodeposition of lead oxide as β pbo2 under other morphologies such as branches or dendritic branches as reported in this study 3 1 2 in presence of ionic species the electrodeposition of lead oxide films was performed by imposing a potential of 0 7 v at ph 4 2 in the presence of nacl 1 m or nano3 1 m or na2so4 1 m for different values of electrical charges as previously the adherent films obtained were characterized by xrd observed by sem and analysed by eds the x ray diffractograms of these films show that the solids are well crystallized and that their crystallinity increases with the electric charge q fig 3 in the presence of nacl 1 m or na2so4 1 m an adherent film of pure β pbo2 is obtained while in the presence of nano3 1 m the deposit is composed of a mixture of lead oxides similarly as in pure water for this value of ph β pbo2 as a main compound with a small amount of pb3o4 furthermore a significant preferential orientation was observed in the case of nacl and nano3 according to the plane 101 at 32 0 and 200 at 36 2 respectively the deposits obtained for q 0 9c and the free electrical charges corresponding to the total elimination of soluble lead were also observed by sem and analysed by eds fig 4 according to the eds analyses lead and oxygen are detected in all cases with the percentages of oxygen and lead in good agreement with xrd results confirming the formation of pure lead oxides as previously the presence of sn corresponding to the substrate i e sno2 was not detected for these values of electric charges indicating that the amount and or covering of the surface were important moreover it also appears on fig 4 that the morphology of the crystals varies considerably depending of the ions present in solution and also according to the electric charge q proportionally related to the amount of material electrodeposited according to faraday s law eq 3 for example in the presence of nacl 1 m crystals of pure β pbo2 are in the form of needles for an electric charge equal to 0 9c and when the electric charge raises the needles growth as cubic form in the presence of nano3 1 m lead was electrodeposited as a mixture of β pbo2 and pb3o4 according to xrd measurements and the morphology of the crystals is irregular for an electric charge fixed to 0 9c however for a quantity of electricity equal to 1 97c corresponding to a total elimination of lead one obtains a morphology in the shape of pyramid which is in good coherence with the preferential orientation observed on diffractogram for this specific value of electric charge in contrary in presence of na2so4 1 m lead oxide electrodeposited as pure β pbo2 presents always an irregular and classical morphology for both amounts of electricity 0 9c and 1 25c these different morphologies can be due to that following the nucleation phase some ions in solution nacl or na2so4 or nano3 can poison certain surfaces and then induce the growth of particles in specific directions indeed some molecules can be adsorbed and modified the growth process even blocking the active sites inhibiting 26 table 1 summarizes the conditions of the six electrodeposited lead oxide samples with the duration and the mass for an electric charge fixed to 0 9c and the associated composition and morphology the choice of this electric charge value allows having the minimum possible mass of pbo2 electrodeposited with a good repeatability of synthesis furthermore in all cases thin films were well adherent and visually very homogeneous it appears also that in all cases the synthesis of the films is performed by the formation of 3d islands during the electrochemical process this observation is relatively classical for electrodeposition process that begins generally from surface or nucleation site defects 18 19 26 according to faraday s law eq 3 the theoretical mass of the electrodeposited lead oxide as pbo2 for an electrical charge fixed to q 0 9c is equal to 1 11 10 3 g with n 2 and m 239 2 g mol 1 3 m theo q n f m with q the electrical charge n the number of electrons required for the formation of one mole of the studied chemical compound f faraday s constant 96 485c mol 1 m molecular weight of the studied chemical compound it appears that the faradic and precipitation yields vary for each electrodeposition condition which is not surprising due to the difference of morphologies table 1 few studies in the literature describe the mechanism of lead oxide formation and all these studies have the objective of synthesizing this compound for various applications and not in the aim to depollute aqueous solutions 27 29 that is why these original morphologies in the form of branches needles pyramids and cubes are not classical and were never reported in the literature as far as we know hence knowing if these samples are interesting for applications and particularly for electro catalytic applications seemed pertinent for that we have studied their degradation capacity towards glyphosate as organic pollutant by spontaneous and electrochemical ways 3 2 degradation of glyphosate and expected by products the mineralisation of glyphosate has been largely studied in the literature by different processes such as via microbial degradation 30 birnessite powder 22 or as electrodeposited thin films 14 21 or by advanced oxidation process 3 two mains degradation pathways for glyphosate are reported in the literature one by cn bond cleavage in first via the production of ampa which can be also degraded into phosphate ions eqs 4 1 and 4 2 respectively and the other one by a direct mineralisation into phosphate ions by cp bond cleavage eq 5 unlabelled image glyphosate degradation via ampa production cn bond cleavage 4 1 c 3 h 8 npo 5 2 h 2 o ch 6 npo 3 2 co 2 6h 6 e 4 2 ch 6 npo 3 6 h 2 o co 2 no 3 po 4 3 18 h 14 e direct mineralisation of glyphosate cp bond cleavage 5 c 3 h 8 npo 5 8 h 2 o 3 co 2 no 3 po 4 3 24 h 20 e as far as we know only two studies in the literature report the degradation of glyphosate by pure lead oxide and only under the effect of high applied currents and not by a simple direct contact e g spontaneous reaction or with very few electrical inputs like performed with thin films of manganese oxides 14 21 according to these two studies the degradation was done through the generation of physically adsorbed hydroxyl radicals and the oxidation of glyphosate may be total it is important to mention also that no studies in the literature have measured the release of lead in solution during the degradation while this point could be essential for applications in this study the option of direct electronic transfers was supposed due to the strong oxidant properties of lead oxides for that the degradation of glyphosate could be similar to that observed in the case of manganese oxide thin films 14 21 either in spontaneous way either coupled to electrochemistry however in this latter case the formation of radicals can be excluded since the intensity of currents will be very low only few μa cm 2 if glyphosate is partially degraded into ampa or totally mineralised then in parallel lead oxide must be reduced with the production of pb iii and or pb ii species by spontaneous electronic transfers however pb iii being very unstable 31 it is more likely that pb iv will be reduced into soluble pb ii eq 6 reduction of lead pb iv contained in lead oxide 6 pb iv 2 e pb ii for proving that glyphosate was degraded and or mineralised with lead oxides thin films by spontaneous reactions and or with a low electrical inputs the concentrations of glyphosate and by products such as ampa nitrate and phosphate ions were systematically quantified by ion chromatography and the release of lead in solution was measured after each interaction by uv visible measurements using the spectroquant kit in complement to the characterisation of the solids by xrd sem and eds after interaction experiments 3 3 studies of the degradation ability of these electrodeposited lead oxide thin films towards glyphosate by spontaneous interaction the influence of different parameters such as the initial ph of the solution the initial concentration of glyphosate the type of sample was studied nevertheless in a first step for studying the optimal parameters of degradation the conditions were researched with the sample pb 01 electrodeposited with an electrical charge fixed to 0 9c which corresponds to a classical morphology for a mixture of lead oxides a majority of ß pbo2 with small amount of pb3o4 table 1 3 3 1 effect of ph the effect of ph was studied for a solution containing glyphosate with a concentration of 100 μm 16 9 mg l 1 the ph of the solution was adjusted by the addition of naoh 1 m ranging from 4 1 free to 10 one sample of lead oxide pb 01 s 3 cm2 was introduced into 20 ml of this solution the interactions were carried out in a thermostatically controlled oven at 25 c for 24 h under stirring at 250 rpm fig 5 shows that after 24 h for a ph equal to 4 1 50 μm of glyphosate were detected in solution corresponding to 50 of degradation calculated according to eq 1 in contrary for ph 7 2 and ph 10 glyphosate was largely detected in solution with 90 μm and 100 μm respectively corresponding only to 10 of degradation and no degradation moreover the degradation of glyphosate occurred via the cn bond cleavage with the formation of ampa as the major product in addition to the formation of a small amount of phosphate and nitrate ions in parallel a significant release of lead in solution was observed 40 μm particularly at ph 4 1 when the most amount of glyphosate was degraded according to the literature lead oxide β pbo2 has a zero charge point 4 8 7 4 31 the zero charge point corresponds to the ph for which the lead oxide surface has a neutral charge below this ph value the lead oxide surface is positively charged and above the ph value the surface charge is negative on the other hand glyphosate has three functions a carboxylic acid function a phosphoric acid function and an amine function it can exist in five different ionisation states depending on ph with pka values equal to 0 8 2 6 5 6 and 10 6 21 32 the pka values of 0 8 and 5 6 are attributed to the phosphoric acid function the pka value of 2 6 to the carboxylic acid function and the pka value of 10 6 to the amine function with increasing ph the acid functions release their hydrogens leading to a negatively charged molecule 33 in the ph range when the maximum degradation was obtained the solid pbo2 is positively charged while the overall charge of the glyphosate is negative which explains an optimal attraction between the two allowing to promote the degradation and in good coherence with the presence of soluble lead the observations of pb 01 thin film by sem after the interaction at ph 4 1 and 10 are reported on fig 6 the sample with the degradation performed at ph 4 1 has a much less covered surface in amount of material compared to the sample before interaction fig 2 which is consistent with the glyphosate degradation rate and the release of lead in solution conversely the sample that did not allow degradation interaction at ph 10 appears intact in good coherence with the absence of lead in solution according to these results the free ph of solution containing glyphosate ph 4 1 was chosen for further studies 3 3 2 effect of sample type the effect of sample type was studied for a solution containing glyphosate at a concentration of 100 μm 16 9 mg l 1 in a volume of 20 ml the ph of the solution was 4 1 free one sample of each type of lead oxide electrodeposited with an electrical charge of 0 9c s 3 cm2 was introduced into the solution as previously the interactions were carried out in a thermostatically controlled oven at 25 c for 24 h with stirring at 250 rpm in all cases glyphosate was degraded with the main formation of ampa and some phosphate and nitrate ions in addition to a significant and equivalent release of lead in solution independently of the sample type fig 7 however the most important spontaneous degradations were obtained with samples of type pb 03 and pb 04 whose morphologies of pure β pbo2 are branches and cubic needles respectively sem observations of these six samples after their interaction and degradation of glyphosate show little modifications fig 8 compared to samples before interaction figs 2 and 4 indeed any change in the morphology of the materials was observed but only a less covered surface following a loss of the amount of electrodeposited material in good coherence with the presence of lead in solution in all cases after 24 h the concentrations of glyphosate detected in solution comprised between 40 and 50 μm according to the type of samples were significantly decreased compared to the initial concentration 100 μm fig 7 indicating degradation rates close to 50 in these experimental conditions glyphosate was mainly degraded into ampa via spontaneous electronic transfers that occurs at the surface of lead oxide thin film this degradation was accompanied by a release of lead in solution 40 μm but the quantity found in solution is largely lower than the expected amount 10 experimental vs 50 theoretical expected considering the experimental degradation rates of glyphosate into ampa according to these equations eqs 4 1 4 2 and 6 this result supposes a possible adsorption of pb ii onto lead oxides surfaces as already observed for spontaneous degradation of organic compounds with manganese oxides thin films 21 34 35 however even if the amount of soluble lead is lower than expected this release can be problematic for resolving this problem we thought to couple the spontaneous degradation under the effect of applied of fixed potential indeed in our previous studies performed with manganese oxide thin films 14 the imposition of a potential leads to a significant increase of the degradation capacity but also to a total regeneration of the materials via electrodeposition in continuous 14 in a similar way the imposition of a potential in the case of lead oxides thin films could increase the degradation rates but also the electrodeposition of pb ii released in continuous according the same principle than reported in our innovating depollution process 18 19 3 4 effect of electrochemical coupling on degradation ability and release of lead in solution for these electrochemistry experiments lead oxide thin films electrodeposited onto the sno2 were used as working electrodes in a classical electrochemical set up with the same electrodes used previously for the synthesis i e a platinum wire and a mercurous sulphate electrode as the counter electrode and reference electrode respectively the other interaction conditions were the same that during spontaneous interactions for better comparison i e volume of 20 ml free ph 4 1 under fixed stirring at 250 rpm the influence of different parameters such as the value of the applied potential the type of sample studied and the concentration of the pollutant in solution were studied as previously the concentrations of glyphosate and the main by products were determined by ion chromatography the release of lead in solution was measured after each interaction by uv visible measurements using the spectroquant kit and the solids were characterized by xrd sem and eds after interaction experiments 3 4 1 choice of the value of potential applied during interaction it was important that the value of applied potential did not modify the materials during interaction and that no parasite electrochemical reactions occurred e g oxidation of water for that two potentials were chosen in order to study the influence of electrochemistry 0 7 v which is the value used for the electrodeposition of lead oxide at this ph and 0 8 v which is slightly more oxidising value this preliminary study was carried out using one sample of pb 01 as a reference after 24 h and under a potential of 0 7 v the concentration of glyphosate determined was equal to 40 μm corresponding to a degradation rate of 60 with the formation of ampa as the major compound 45 μm cn bond cleavage fig 9 a with a slight amount of nitrate and phosphate ions 5 μm for each specie respectively whereas under a potential of 0 8 v glyphosate was mainly mineralised by forming phosphate ions as the major product cp bond cleavage with a concentration equal to 55 μm accompanied by a significant amount of nitrate ions 18 μm and a low amount of ampa 10 μm in both cases the amount of lead released in solution compared to spontaneous reactions is reduced and more particularly for 0 8 v 30 μm and 5 μm for 0 7 v and 0 8 v respectively as discussed previously and for comparison glyphosate was degraded into ampa after 24 h without electrochemistry with a degradation rate equal to 50 and a significant release of lead in solution 40 μm fig 7 the effect of the electrochemistry being particularly significant for e 0 8 v with a significant mineralisation by cp bond cleavage high production of phosphate ions that is why the interaction experiments were only performed by fixing this value moreover it is important to mention that the maximal current intensity measured was 6 6 μa cm 2 graph not shown which is very low and largely inferior to the intensities values reported in the literature for the degradation of glyphosate by pure pbo2 electrode 50 ma cm 2 for example 15 17 3 4 2 effect of the sample type the same study was performed during 24 h in similar conditions 0 8 v with the different types of samples in comparison to the substrate alone sno2 in absence of lead oxide films sno2 alone glyphosate was not degraded in comparison to the all other samples fig 9 b moreover the results obtained show clearly that after 24 h the glyphosate was completely mineralised without any production of ampa only phosphate ions by using the pb 03 and pb 04 samples fig 9 b the two types of samples with particular morphologies compared to the literature branch and cubic needles respectively in addition pb ii was not detected in solution according to the analyses performed by the spectroquant kit this result is in good agreement with the hypothesis that the applied potential can allow in continuous the electrodeposition of pb ii released in solution due to the reduction of pb iv to pb ii during the degradation of glyphosate indeed the total mineralisation of glyphosate at 100 μm in 20 ml of solution at free ph 4 1 occurred after 24 h under an imposed potential of 0 8 v using a lead oxide sample pb 03 or pb 04 however based on equations eqs 5 and 6 in order to degrade one mole of glyphosate 10 mol of lead were needed for the production of 20 mol of electrons therefore to degrade spontaneous 100 μm into 20 ml 2 10 6 mol 2 10 5 mol of lead are needed to have sufficient electrons and then in consequent the release of soluble lead should be equal to 2 10 5 mol corresponding to 4 14 mg l 1 however the amount of lead released in solution after 24 h was not detected by the spectroquant kit 0 1 mg l 1 with the electrochemical coupling confirming an efficient re electrodeposition as lead oxide in complement a typical example of the current variation during the degradation of glyphosate by pb 04 sample as a function of time with the electrical charge recorded during the degradation is presented insert fig 9 b by applying the faraday s law eq 3 the theoretical electric charge should be equal to q theo 3 85c for this initial concentration of glyphosate if the total degradation was carried out only under the effect of the electrochemistry according to eq 5 however the experimental electric charge was equal to q exp 1 66c this difference can be explained probably by the fact that the electrochemistry is mainly used for the regeneration of lead oxide and that the degradation of glyphosate would be spontaneous i e by direct interaction with lead oxide thin film as reported previously the x ray diffractograms of the three types of samples pb 01 pb 03 and pb 04 show that the crystallinity of the lead oxide thin films increases after their use for the degradation of glyphosate under the effect of the potential fixed at 0 8 v compared to the samples after spontaneous interactions fig 10 these results confirm that the regeneration of the lead oxide by electrodeposition was performed by keeping the same crystal structure in addition the characterisation of these three samples by sem and their analysis by eds after the degradation of glyphosate under the effect of the potential show clearly that no modification was observed texture and covering of the substrate surface moreover the percentages of o and pb remain identical without any other chemical species fig 11 3 4 3 effect of the initial concentration of glyphosate the effect of glyphosate concentration on the degradation ability of the samples was studied using the three types of samples pb 01 pb 03 and pb 04 the solutions contained different concentrations of glyphosate 25 50 100 and 200 μm corresponding to 4 2 8 4 16 9 and 33 8 mg l 1 respectively in a volume of 20 ml with free ph these concentrations are high compared to those found in polluted waters but can correspond to real cases of polluted solutions 36 the interactions were carried out at room temperature during 24 h under stirring of 250 rpm with an applied potential equal to 0 8 v from these results presented on fig 12 we can conclude clearly that the lead oxide thin film pb 04 keeps its remarkable degradation capacities whatever the quantity of glyphosate present in solution from 25 μm to 200 μm by forming only mineral products the lead oxide thin film pb 03 also keeps the same degradation capacities towards glyphosate in solution by forming mineral products for initial concentrations ranging from 25 to 100 μm nevertheless for a higher concentration 200 μm although glyphosate is completely degraded a small amount of ampa was produced 7 μm therefore pb 03 and pb 04 samples which present original nanostructures are largely more efficient for the degradation of glyphosate compared to the sample pb 01 which presents the classical morphology however for the three types of sample it is important to highlight that we did not encounter the problem of lead release in solution regardless of the initial concentration of glyphosate to be degraded confirming the real interest of coupling spontaneous reaction with electrochemistry the x ray diffractograms of pb 04 sample before and after glyphosate degradation with different initial concentrations confirm that the thin film is still in the form of pure ß pbo2 with in addition of a significant gain in crystallinity fig 13 a these results support our hypothesis that the lead released in solution during the spontaneous degradation of glyphosate is then re electrodeposited under the effect of the imposed potential moreover the crystallinity can be improved because this value of potential is slightly higher than the value of the synthesis potential 0 7 v thus the more glyphosate is degraded in solution the more lead released is re electrodeposited with a higher crystallinity the observation of the sample pb 04 by sem fig 13 b after the total degradation of 200 μm of glyphosate under a potential of 0 8 v shows no change in the texture of the material it keeps its very particular morphology in the form of cubic needles fig 14 resumes schematically the global mechanism of glyphosate degradation in the best conditions by coupling to electrochemistry with the specific nanostructured pb 03 and pb 04 type samples 3 4 4 calculation of efficacy and energy costs for the best pb 04 sample based on these experimental results and as already reported in our previous studies concerning the degradation of glyphosate and ampa by electrodeposited thin films of manganese oxides 14 we can calculate for the highest concentration studied 200 μm the mineralisation capacity mc corresponding to the mass of glyphosate which can be mineralised by 1 g of studied material mg of glyphosate g of studied material of the best pb 04 sample according to eq 7 7 mc gly initial x v x m gly m pb 04 with gly initial 200 μm v 20 10 3 l m gly 169 07 g mol 1 m pb 04 0 6 10 3 g in these conditions the mineralisation capacity of pb 04 sample is equal to 1127 mg of glyphosate g of pb 04 which is very high and without detection of lead released in solution this capacity is probably not the maximum since higher concentrations have not been studied nevertheless this value of mineralisation capacity is widely superior to the values reported in the literature for glyphosate removed for either sorption or degradation 3 moreover the degradation was performed in very soft conditions at room temperature and ambient pressure in a classical electrochemical set up without adding reagents and or production of wastes and requiring no regeneration of the material in complement the maximum energy consumption for the degradation reaction was estimated for the best pb 04 sample based on laboratory experiments and on registered current insert fig 9 b by using the following equation eq 8 8 e consumed i v t 1000 with e the energy consumed kwh i the maximal intensity of the measured current a v the imposed potential v t the duration applied to have a total degradation of glyphosate into mineral species h taking into consideration the maximum recorded current a power consumption of 1 07 10 6 kwh was required to degrade 100 μm 16 9 mg l 1 of glyphosate until the total mineralisation this energy consumption is much lower than that reported in the literature for electrochemical oxidation of glyphosate based on the production of radicals 16 37 while the mineralisation rates obtained in this study are also very high consequently such samples with original nanostructures could certainly resolve one of the disadvantages reported generally for the electrochemical oxidations techniques based on the production of radicals 3 4 conclusions there are several effective techniques for the degradation of glyphosate but it is important to improve continuously their capabilities by avoiding and or limiting undesirable effects in this study we have reported a simple electrochemical oxidation process for the degradation and mineralisation of glyphosate performed at room temperature with very low energy inputs without the addition of electrolyte by using lead oxide thin films with particular morphologies in relation to our innovating electrochemical process of water depollution containing soluble lead the sample pb 04 a pure β pbo2 with an original cubic needles morphology seems particularly interesting when a potential equal to 0 8 v was applied indeed it allowed a total electro degradation of glyphosate without the production of ampa aminomethylphosphonic acid with a mineralisation capacity worth to 1127 mg of glyphosate g of pb 04 without pb ii released in solution due to a very efficient re electrodeposition with the same crystalline structure these results are particularly encouraging for future applications performed at low costs for the efficient degradation until mineralisation of organic pollutants such as glyphosate with no production of ampa the main by product more toxic and persistent than glyphosate moreover it is a very interesting way for valorisation of heavy metal

12399,oxidation reduction potential orp feedback control by ethanol dosing was recently proved effective in facilitating a two stage fluidized bed reactor fbr process to remove selenate nitrate and sulfate from wastewater and recover high purity elemental se without the formation of carcinogenic ses however further optimization requires knowledge on the relationship between microbial community composition and process performance here changes of microbial communities during the reduction of selenate and nitrate in the first fbr fbr1 under various orp conditions 240 to 520 mv vs ag agcl sulfate reduction in subsquent fbr fbr2 and sulfide oxidation in sulfide oxidation reactor sor were examined based on 16s rrna gene sequencing high orp stage i without sulfate 360 mv stage ii with sulfate 440 mv and elevated sulfate at orp 480 mv stage iii in fbr1 altered the microbial communities both on fluidized carrier and bulk liquor selenate reducers geoalkalibacter and geovibrio genera were impacted at orp 360 mv stage i or 440 mv stage ii when selenate removal in fbr1 declined however nitrate reducers caenispirillum and paracoccus genera were not affected in the fbr1 and facilitated 100 nitrate removal at orp 480 mv selenate reducers were readily enriched in fbr1 in the fbr2 the major sulfate reducing genera were desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio and desulfuromonas whereas the dominant sulfide oxidating genera in sor were paracoccus thiobacillus and acholeplasma this study suggested that both nitrate and selenate reducing communities could remain active under elevated sulfate concentrations enabling sequential oxyanions removal and elemental se recovery from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords feedback control microbial community oxidation reduction potential oxyanion reduction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction selenium se is an essential trace element for human beings and animals but the safe dosage range for daily intake is very narrow 40 μg day 1 beneficial dosage 400 μg day 1 toxic dosage 1 industrial activities such as mining coal combustion and metal and oil refining can generate se containing waste streams e g wastewater mine drainage discharge of these waste streams may increase selenium concentration in aquatic environments and cause selenium pollution 2 3 soluble inorganic selenium in water has two major forms selenate seo4 2 and selenite seo3 2 among which selenate is typically more abundant in oxic environments 4 selenate may accumulate in aquatic ecosystems via food chains leading to reproductive and teratogenic defects in aquatic animals 2 to ensure the safety of humans a guideline value of 40 μg l 1 for the maximum se concentration in drinking water has been set by the world health organization 5 bioreduction is considered as an effective method to facilitate selenate removal from wastewater 6 9 selenate reducing microorganisms can reduce selenate to elemental se se0 when supplied with a suitable electron donor such as hydrogen 10 methane 11 ethanol 12 or lactate 13 elemental se is a valuable product which is less bioavailable and that can be used for various applications such as nanotechnology photovoltaic and semiconductor technology 14 the solid elemental se can be recovered from bioreactor effluents via filtering and centrifugation in the past few decades many microbial species have been reported to reduce selenate for example comamonas testosteroni s44 15 pelobacter seleniigenes 16 thauera selenatis 17 and enterobacter cloacae sld1a 1 18 have been described to be capable of selenate or selenite reduction selenate reduction can be catalyzed by specific selenate reductases or non specific reductases involved in denitrification and sulfate reducing pathways 19 suggesting that the electron transfer pathways of selenate reduction are diverse 15 20 apart from pure cultures a mixed consortium consisting of aerobic methanotrophs and selenate reducing bacteria has been reported to have a synergistic effect for selenate reduction via methane oxidation coupled to selenate reduction pathway 21 nitrate and sulfate often coexist with selenate in wastewater 4 13 22 both oxyanions cause environmental issues nitrate can cause eutrophication of water bodies ultimately leading to excessive growth of aquatic organisms and destruction of the aquatic ecosystem 23 sulfate as an electron acceptor can be biologically reduced to hydrogen sulfide h2s in environments lacking oxygen or nitrate this h2s can cause stench and corrosion problems 24 in addition excessive sulfate in the environment impacts drinking water supplies since sulfate in drinking water can result in gastrointestinal disorders for human beings 5 25 26 thus nitrate and sulfate need to be removed along with selenate before effluent discharge to minimize their impact on environment the use of mixed consortia of microorganisms may be a good option for biological reduction of selenate nitrate and sulfate as compared with pure cultures mixed microbial consortia can support syntrophic metabolic pathways and a simultaneous reduction of selenate nitrate and sulfate 2 more importantly mixed consortia have a higher resilience to adapt to possible changes in bioreactor conditions 27 therefore mixed consortia are likely more robust and suited for oxyanion removal in bioreactors than pure cultures although some microbial consortia have been reported to simultaneously reduce the three oxyanions nitrate selenate and sulfate in various bioreactors poor sulfate reduction and recovery of low purity elemental se are conceivable drawbacks for single stage bioreactor processes 8 22 28 the main reason for the poor sulfate reduction may be that the reduction of nitrate and selenate reduction is thermodynamically more favorable than sulfate reduction 22 thus when electron donor availability is limited sulfate reducers may be outcompeted by nitrate and selenate reducers simultaneous reduction of sulfate and selenate can lead to the production of sexsy molecules or a mixture of selenium and sulfides 2 decreasing the purity of elemental se for recovery to effectively remove the three oxyanions from wastewater and recover high purity elemental se a two stage fluidized bed reactor fbr process based on orp feedback control was recently developed for the sequential removal of selenate nitrate and sulfate from acidic wastewater 29 in the first stage of the process fbr1 orp feedback control was used to optimize ethanol dosage for selective and efficient selenate and nitrate removal over sulfate reduction allowing the recovery of elemental se with high purity of 71 29 30 effective removal of the residual sulfate in the effluent of the first bioreactor was achieved with a subsequent bioreactor fbr2 followed by excess sulfide oxidation in a sulfide oxidizing reactor sor 30 the performance of this multi stage bioreactor process under various orp setpoints in fbr1 was examined by yan et al 27 who found that at optimum orp setpoint of 480 mv the fbr1 enabled near complete reduction of selenate and nitrate at a removal rate of 0 40 mm h here elemental se was the main product of selenate reduction and the recovery efficiency of elemental se in fbr1 effluent was 37 5 with 71 se purity 29 however the composition of the microbial communities in the bioreactors as well as their responses to the changes of orp setpoints and elevated influent sulfate concentration have not been reported therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to characterize the composition of microbial communities in fbr1 fbr2 and sor 2 to investigate the effect of orp setpoint and elevated sulfate concentration on the changes in the composition and diversity of microbial communities in the fbr1 and 3 to explore the relationship between the fbr1 operational parameters microbial communities and performance this study provides crucial insights for further optimization of the bioprocess performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum bioreactor operation and sampling the constructions and operation of all bioreactors used in this study have been reported in previous studies 30 32 the original inoculum for the fbr1 was taken from the effluent tank of a 4 l lab scale selenate reducing inverse fluidized bed reactor ifbr 31 the ifbr was continuously fed with selenate containing wastewater at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 5 days for over 590 days with ethanol as the sole electron donor for selenate reduction 31 the fbr2 was originally inoculated with a mixed sulfate reducing consortium 32 the fbr2 effluent was collected as inoculum for the start up of the sulfide oxidizing reactor sor 30 the fbr1 was continuously operated for 223 days at an hrt of 12 h for treating acidic wastewater ph 4 0 containing selenate nitrate or sulfate table 1 the overall operation period was divided into three stages and at each stage fbr1 was operated for at least 8 hrts to ensure a stable performance of reactor would be recorded in stage i the fbr1 was operated to remove selenate and nitrate 5 mm each with electron donor ethanol dosing based on orp feedback control 30 the fbr1 performance was evaluated at various orp set points mv vs ag agcl days 407 497 namely 520 mv 480 mv 440 mv 400 mv 360 mv 300 mv 240 mv and 520 mv the first process recovery from electron shortage in stage ii the fbr1 was operated for the treatment of selenate nitrate and sulfate contained wastewater days 498 573 based on the developed ethanol dosing strategy in fbr1 to determine at which orp sulfate reduction would happen in the presence of nitrate and selenate in fbr1 various orp setpoints mv vs ag agcl namely 520 mv 480 mv 440 mv 400 mv 360 mv and 480 mv the second process recovery were tested at each oxyanion concentration of 5 mm 29 the orp setpoint for process recovery in stages i ii of fbr1 should ensure enough ethanol dosage for the complete reduction of selenate and nitrate in stage iii in order to investigate the effect of elevated sulfate concentration on the effective feedback control of orp at 480 mv for the reduction of both selenate and nitrate 5 mm each sulfate concentration in fbr1 influent was increased from 5 mm to 21 mm 2016 mg l 1 days 574 636 29 this high concentration was based on the actual sulfate concentration in a real acid mine drainage tested in our previous study 32 in this stage as no noticeable sulfate reduction was detected in fbr1 the residual sulfate in fbr1 effluent was treated by subsequent sulfate reducing fbr2 with ethanol as electron donor followed by sor 29 sulfate ethanol molar ratio in fbr2 was set as 1 0 to ensure enough electron donor for sulfate reducing bacteria srb the fbr2 was operated at a longer hrt of 96 h to ensure enough time for the sulfate reducing bacteria to react with the substrates ethanol addition to fbr1 was controlled by using labview feedback controlling software national instruments usa that compared the real time orp signals against an orp setpoint when the real time orp value in fbr1 was above the setpoint ethanol dosing to fbr1 was triggered the weight of the ethanol stock solution was measured at regular intervals for calculating the actual ethanol loading rate of fbr1 at various redox setpoints biomass samples including carrier and effluent samples were collected from the fbr1 at each orp setpoint in stages i iii after combining the fbr1 to fbr2 and sor biomass samples from fbr2 carrier and effluent from fbr2 and sor were collected on days 0 and 55 on biomass sampling days an aliquot 2 ml of the carrier sample with attached biomass was withdrawn from the centre of the fbrs using a sterile tygon tubing attached to a sterile 50 ml plastic syringe under anaerobic condition at each orp setpoint biomass was collected from the reactors as at least duplicate samples after separation of free liquid by decanting 0 25 g of the carrier was directly used for dna extraction suspended cells from 10 ml of the reactor effluents were concentrated by filtering on a 0 2 μm gtbp membrane isopore millipore the membrane with concentrated biomass was then directly used for dna extraction 2 2 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing microbial communities in the biomass samples collected from the fbr1 fbr2 and sor were characterized using next generation sequencing targeting the partial 16s rrna genes fig 1 the dna was extracted from biomass carrier and cells harvested from effluent using power soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc according to the manufacturer s protocol except that the duration for the last incubation with elution buffer on the filter member was extended to 15 min the extracted dna was quantified using a fluorometer qubit invitrogen and stored at 80 c in order to stabilize the dna during shipment at ambient temperature dna samples were mixed with dna stable plus biometrica supplied by diagnostic technology at volume ratio of 4 1 the stabilized dna samples were then submitted to mcgill university and genome quebec innovation center for sequencing of the partial 16s rrna genes in prokaryotes with the primer set 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaatwgrcgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgwgtrc 3 using the illumina miseq pe300 technology 33 2 3 processing of raw sequencing reads the qiime2 pipeline version 2019 4 was adopted to process the raw sequence reads the raw sequences after removing the primer regions using the trim paired command were denoised using the dada2 package to perform quality check dereplicate them merge the forward and reverse paired reads and filter chimeras with the default setting except that p trunc len f and p trunc len r were set to 260 and 240 respectively a feature table was generated to summarize the clustered reads based on amplicon sequence variation asv sequences were considered to represent different asvs if they had at least 1 bp difference the representative sequence for each asv was also determined which then was passed through the silva classifier version 132 99 34 trained specifically for the 926f and 1392r primers for taxonomy determination the feature tables were exported in biom format which then was converted into a csv file to be processed with microsoft excel to compute relative abundance of taxa in the microbial communities and to perform downstream ordination analysis see next section the taxa diversity and richness in the cultures were also assessed by conducting alpha diversity analysis in qiime2 to evaluate the impact of different environmental factors 2 4 statistical analysis the differences of microbial communities between biomass samples were visualized by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds using bray curtis distance and principal component analysis pca via canoco version 5 0 software redundancy analysis rda were performed to evaluate the relationship between the microbial communities and operational parameters orp setpoint and influent sulfate concentration and chemical performance data detected orp selenate removal efficiency ethanol removal rate alkalinity production effluent ph and ammonium concentration by using canoco version 5 0 software 3 results and discussion the performance of the multi stage bioprocess was characterized and detailed in yan et al 27 the fbr1 performance for the reduction of selenate nitrate and sulfate during stages i iii were as summarized in table 1 this section describes and discusses the results obtained from the characterization of the microbial community dynamics during the operation of fbr1 fbr2 and sor 3 1 changes in the alpha diversity of the microbial community in fbr1 during stages i to iii a total of 9 357 671 high quality miseq reads of the partial 16s rrna gene were generated from 56 samples obtained from fbr1 including biofilm carrier and effluent samples and over 48 000 sequences were obtained from each sample fig 2 b these sequences were clustered into asvs in each sample ranging between 46 and 114 fig 2c d high good s coverage value 99 99 fig 2e f of each sample indicated that sufficient sequencing depth was achieved for all samples 35 the shannon and simpson diversity indexes were used to evaluate the alpha diversity of carrier and effluent biomass in fbr1 in stage i iii fig 2g j asv evenness was evaluated with simpson evenness and asv richness with chao1 and ace indexes fig 2k p the results suggested that the changes in orp setpoints had a great influence on the alpha diversity for effluent biomass in fbr1 fig 2g j by affecting the evenness fig 2k l particularly at orp 360 mv and richness fig 2m p high orp setpoints 360 mv in stage i and 400 mv in stage ii had a prolonged effect on the diversity of microbial communities in the effluent while the diversity of microbial communities on carrier had good resilience during the changes of orp setpoints in fbr1 fig 2g j the presence of sulfate at low orp of 480 mv may have stimulated the growth of more microbial taxa in fbr1 additionally microbial diversity for microbes on carrier was higher than that for the effluent throughout the fbr1 process suggesting that the microbial community in the carrier biomass may be less susceptible to the changes in redox condition than the suspended biomass 3 2 orp setpoint and elevated sulfate concentration influenced the microbial communities in fbr1 given that bacteria represented near 100 of the relative abundance of all classified prokaryote taxa in both carrier and effluent biomass in fbr1 the changes of bacterial communities were considered for further studies the cluster analysis using pca revealed a distinct difference between the bacterial communities in carrier and effluent biomass in the fbr1 fig 3a the dissimilarity between bacterial communities of carrier and effluent during the changes of reactor conditions were further determined by nmds fig 3b c the results showed that in stage i at orp ranging between 520 and 360 mv the related communities on the carrier and in the effluent were relatively similar and clustered together however orp higher than 360 mv in fbr1 resulted in a shift of bacterial communities both on the carrier and in the effluent in stage ii when the fbr1 influent was amended with sulfate 5 mm bacterial communities both on the carrier and in the effluent shifted again the carrier communities showed similar structure at orp values between 520 and 360 mv however effluent communities shifted at orp values higher than 440 mv the results suggested that effluent communities were more influenced by the changes of orp setpoint in presence the of sulfate than the carrier communities in stage iii the microbial communities in both carrier and effluent acclimatized were closely assembling those in stage ii given their relatively close distances to their related stage ii clusters as shown in fig 3b and c respectively 3 3 the composition of microbial communities during fbr1 start up during the start up of the fbr1 stage i at orp setpoint of 520 mv the fbr1 was fed with synthetic wastewater containing 5 mm selenate and 5 mm nitrate at hrt of 12 h the fbr1 removed selenate and nitrate nearly completely with no notable selenite and nitrite production table 1 during this period the bacterial communities on the carrier mainly consisted of members from genera geoalkalibacter 37 2 2 4 relative abundance geovibrio 6 1 1 5 soehngenia 2 8 0 2 geobacter 1 9 0 2 paracoccus 1 8 0 1 and caenispirillum 1 5 0 2 fig 4a the suspended communities in frb1 contained members from genera geovibrio 55 0 0 3 caenispirillum 16 6 3 3 pseudomonas 3 3 1 1 paracoccus 3 1 0 0 pandoraea 2 6 1 6 geobacter 2 0 0 4 and geoalkalibacter 1 6 0 5 fig 4b therefore the predominant bacterial members on the carrier were quite different from the suspended cells in the effluent of the fbr1 members from genera geoalkalibacter geovibrio and geobacter have been reported to prefer growing in anaerobic conditions and play important roles in degrading a wide range of organic compounds 36 38 many members in these genera are selenate or selenite reducers and some can also reduce nitrate sulfate or metals i e fe3 mn4 36 38 for instance geobacter sulfurreducens strain pca has been reported to respire selenite to elemental selenium coupled with hydrogen or acetate oxidation 39 it can also respire nitrate anthraquinone disulfonate fumarate fe3 and elemental sulfur geovibrio ferrireducens is an obligately anaerobic selenate respiring bacterium 40 however this species has a very poor capacity to further reduce selenite to elemental selenium although no study has reported that geoalkalibacter members can reduce selenate c type cytochrome in cell membrane of geoalkalibacter ferrihydriticus sp nov strain z 0531 may be responsible for selenate reduction via extracellular electron transfer mechanisms in the fbr1 6 20 41 43 therefore members from genera geoalkalibacter geovibrio and geobacter may have contributed to the reduction of selenate and ethanol oxidation during the start up of fbr1 members from genera caenispirillum paracoccus pseudomonas and pandoraea are common nitrate reducers often found in soil and aquatic environments and play important roles in nitrogen cycling among the members of caenispirillum only caenispirillum bisanense is known to reduce nitrate and is facultatively anaerobic 44 45 species in genus paracoccus can respire oxygen or nitrate as terminal electron acceptors and use a wide range of organic substrates such as alcohols organic acids amino acids and carbohydrates 46 paracoccus denitrificans can also reduce selenate by nitrate reductases but a study found that selenate reduction v max by this species was 40 fold slower than nitrate reduction 19 members of genera pseudomonas and pandoraea have also been reported to be involved in selenate reduction 6 47 48 apart from selenate and nitrate reducing bacteria also fermenting bacteria were detected on the carrier and in the effluent of the fbr1 soehngenia 2 8 0 2 was the predominant fermenting genus which can form syntrophic relationships with hydrogenotrophs 21 49 51 the overall relative abundance of fermentative bacteria in fbr1 was below 4 0 6 3 9 for carrier communities and 0 2 9 for effluent communities which was notably lower than that of selenate and nitrate reducing bacteria the fermentative bacteria in fbr1 may scavenge organic compounds released from other microbial cells 3 4 dynamic changes in bacterial community in fbr1 at various orp conditions 3 4 1 selenate reducers and nitrate reducers had different responses to orp setpoints in stage i in stage i the fbr1 was continuously fed with an influent containing 5 mm selenate and 5 mm nitrate but without sulfate the tested orp setpoints mv vs ag agcl were 520 mv 480 mv 440 mv 400 mv and 360 mv 300 mv and 240 mv the results suggested that as the orp setpoint was increased from 520 mv to 360 mv the relative abundance of genera geoalkalibacter and geovibrio i e the likely selenate reducing bacteria 40 42 43 on the carrier decreased from 37 2 2 4 and 6 1 1 4 to 22 9 6 5 and 4 6 3 2 respectively fig 4a b simultaneously the relative abundance of genus geovibrio in the effluent decreased from 55 0 0 3 to 17 1 1 1 the decreased relative abundance of selenate reducers may have been caused by the decreased ethanol dosage fig 4 table 1 resulting in competition between selenate reducers and other bacteria i e nitrate reducers and fermenting bacteria the relative abundance of geobacter genus remained below 2 in both carrier and effluent in the stage i nevertheless the overall relative abundance of selenate reducing bacteria was still high both on the carrier 29 and in the effluent 19 at orp setpoint of 360 mv fig 4c 4d the abundance of selenate reducing bacteria in fbr1 was consistent with the efficient removal of selenate near 100 in fbr1 at orp setpoints ranging from 520 mv to 360 mv in stage i however as the orp setpoint increased from 360 mv to 240 mv the relative abundance of genera geoalkalibacter and geovibrio on carrier decreased sharply to below 7 and 1 during this period the relative abundance of selenate reducing bacteria decreased to the very low value of 8 on the carrier and 2 in the effluent fig 4c d such low relative abundance of selenate reducing bacteria at high orp setpoints 240 mv may be ascribed to poor competition for limited ethanol by selenate reducers as compared to other bacteria in fbr1 table 1 according to previous studies geoalkalibacter geobacter and geovibrio prefer to grow anaerobically 36 38 thus the high redox condition in fbr1 may have inhibited the growth of selenate reducing bacteria further leading to the decline of fbr1 performance selenate removal efficiency decreased to 10 0 3 5 at orp setpoint of 240 mv table 1 in addition the decline of relative abundance of selenate reducers may also be the result of better growth of denitrifiers at high orp selenate reducing bacteria on carrier had always higher relative abundance than those in the effluent at each tested orp setpoint indicating that selenate reducers on the carrier were more resistant to the changes of ethanol dosing and redox conditions in fbr1 than suspended cells as compared to selenate reducers the predominant nitrate reducers i e genus caenispirillum in fbr1 showed a positive response to the increase of orp setpoint for both the carrier and the effluent members from genus caenispirillum became predominant at a higher orp setpoint of 300 mv on the carrier and 480 mv in the effluent with the relative abundances of 29 7 3 7 and 62 7 3 7 respectively fig 4 this suggested that over the 180 mv window i e 480 mv to 300 mv much of the denitrification activity would likely be attributed to the suspended microorganisms in the bulk water i e the effluent the members of paracoccus genus reached a peak value of 30 5 6 4 on the carrier at orp setpoint of 300 mv fig 4a whereas its relative abundance in the effluent remained at 3 6 fig 4b at a higher orp setpoint of 240 mv caenispirillum was the most abundant genus in the fbr1 with relative abundance of 45 8 0 3 on the carrier and 86 7 2 9 in the effluent however the increase of orp setpoint to 240 mv resulted in the apparent decrease of the relative abundance of paracoccus genus to 16 5 1 1 on the carrier and close to 1 in the effluent which may have been caused by the decreased ethanol dosage leading to the competition between nitrate reducers members from genus pandoraea were with low relative abundance of 1 4 in effluent at all tested orp setpoints in stage i members from genus azoarcus were enriched at orp setpoint of 480 mv and reached a peak value of 7 at orp setpoint between 400 mv and 360 mv at orp setpoint of 240 mv the overall relative abundance of nitrate reducers reached the highest values of 62 on carrier and 94 in the effluent which were much higher than those of selenate reducers 8 4 and 1 7 on the carrier and in the effluent respectively fig 4c d the results suggested that nitrate reducers may have higher affinities to ethanol at high redox conditions than selenate reducers and other bacteria the nitrate reducers could also adequately respond and adapt to environmental changes in fbr1 thus having higher competitiveness for substrates than selenate reducers at high orp conditions the fbr1 achieved efficient nitrate removal even when the supply of ethanol was not sufficient to enable complete reduction of selenate i e at high orp conditions therefore orp setpoint and electron dosage notably influenced the composition of microbial communities on the carrier and in the effluent i e in suspension after the fbr1 was challenged for a period of a high orp 240 mv operation the fbr1 was again operated at a low orp setpoint of 520 mv to reinstate its selenate reducing ability as expected with the increased ethanol loading at orp setpoint of 520 mv the relative abundance of genera geoalkalibacter geobacter and geovibrio on the carrier increased to 17 2 2 3 6 0 0 6 and 5 5 1 5 respectively whereas their relative abundance in the effluent were 0 5 1 0 0 and 14 9 0 4 respectively although the relative abundance of nitrate reducers decreased for both the carrier and the effluent during the enrichment of selenate reducers fig 4c d the predominant nitrate reducers from genus caenispirillum remained abundant on the carrier 31 7 2 6 and in the effluent 71 5 4 0 therefore low redox potential could facilitate the enrichment of selenate reducing bacteria in fbr1 which in turn improved selenate removal overall given the flexible response of selenate and nitrate reducers to redox changes in stage i the online ethanol dosing strategy based on orp feedback was considered an effective method for optimizing the reduction of selenate and nitrate in the fbr1 3 4 2 sulfate influenced the bacterial communities in stages ii and iii after the recovery of fbr1 performance from electron donor shortage 5 mm sulfate was introduced to the fbr1 influent in stage ii the tested orp setpoints in stage ii mv vs ag agcl were 520 mv 480 mv 440 mv 400 mv and 360 mv table 1 with the addition of 5 mm sulfate at orp setpoint of 520 mv in stage ii the relative abundances of dominant selenate reducing bacteria from genera geoalkalibacter and geovibrio increased to 32 2 3 6 and 9 5 0 6 on the carrier and 5 2 0 01 and 27 6 6 6 in the effluent respectively fig 4a b in contrast the relative abundance of dominant nitrate reducing bacteria from genus caenispirillum decreased to 20 9 2 3 on the carrier and 47 1 9 0 in the effluent as the orp setpoint was increased from 520 mv to 440 mv in stage ii the relative abundance of genus geoalkalibacter on the carrier increased to 53 3 3 2 while that of genus geovibrio on the carrier decreased to 2 8 0 2 however the relative abundance of genus geoalkalibacter on the carrier decreased to 26 7 4 0 as orp setpoint increased to 360 mv the relative abundance of genus geovibrio on the carrier remained at 2 4 at orp ranging between 440 mv and 360 mv overall the relative abundance of suspended selenate reducing bacteria decreased from 33 to 3 fig 4d which was mainly associated with the decrease of geovibrio population from 27 6 to 2 2 the decrease in the relative abundance of the dominant selenate reducing bacteria in the fbr1 at orp higher than 440 mv was in line with the decrease of total cell number on the carrier data shown in yan et al 29 and selenate removal efficiency 88 7 9 0 at orp of 400 mv and 79 4 18 1 at orp of 360 mv thus it is likely that the orp setpoint higher than 440 mv in stage ii had impacted the growth of selenate reducing bacteria in the presence of sulfate further impacting the fbr1 performance in terms of nitrate reducers as orp setpoint was increased from 520 mv to 440 mv the dominant bacteria from caenispirillum genus on the carrier decreased in relative abundance from 20 9 0 6 to 13 7 1 9 whereas the caenispirillum still dominated the effluent communities with 58 0 6 6 relative abundance since the ethanol demand gradually decreased to stoichiometric value when the orp setpoint was increased from 520 mv to 440 mv table 1 the slight decrease of caenispirillum on the carrier may be related to competition for ethanol with selenate reducers and other bacteria in the presence of sulfate the decrease of the relative abundance of caenispirillum on the carrier in stage ii was opposite to the trend detected at orp ranging between 520 mv and 440 mv in stage i suggesting that sulfate may have negatively influenced the growth of caenispirillum in fbr1 further increase of orp from 440 mv to 400 mv and beyond resulted in the increase of the relative abundance of caenispirillum on the carrier and in the effluent at orp setpoint of 360 mv members from caenispirillum genus reached their highest relative abundance in stage ii contributing to 32 1 6 6 on the carrier and 87 8 4 2 in the effluent the increase in the relative abundance of caenispirillum at orp setpoints higher than 440 mv in fbr1 may have been caused by decreased population of selenate reducing bacteria which were sensitive to high orp being consistent with phase i additionally other nitrate reducers with small population in stage ii showed different response to the changes of ethanol dose in the presence of sulfate at various orp setpoints in stage ii as compared to stage i for instance the relative abundance of genus paracoccus decreased from 13 5 1 4 to 4 1 1 4 on the carrier and from 6 2 2 6 to 1 in the effluent as orp setpoint was increased from 520 mv to 360 mv the relative abundance of suspended pandoraea reached a peak value of 8 7 0 2 at orp setpoint of 480 mv in stage ii given that nitrate reducers in fbr1 were abundant and could flexibly adapt to the changes of electron donor dosage at all tested orp setpoints in stage ii nitrate removal efficiency was near 100 with no nitrite accumulation table 1 as the orp setpoint was decreased from 360 mv to 480 mv during the second process recovery period in stage ii the relative abundance of genus geoalkalibacter increased to 51 1 0 6 on the carrier and 3 6 1 9 in the effluent suggesting that the low orp setpoint facilitated the enrichment of geoalkalibacter however the members of genera geovibrio and geobacter were not recovered during this period geovibrio genus was still with low relative abundance in carrier 2 4 and effluent 6 geobacter population was below 1 both on the carrier and in the effluent the results indicated that the members of the genus geoalkalibacter were more resilient than the other two selenate reducing genera at orp setpoint of 480 mv which may have contributed to the improvement of selenate removal efficiency during process recovery period caenispirillum population decreased both on the carrier and in the effluent but still remained abundant in the fbr1 26 5 1 5 on the carrier and 79 9 7 6 in the effluent in stage iii fbr1 influent sulfate concentration was increased from 5 mm to 21 mm at orp setpoint of 480 mv to study the effect of elevated sulfate concentration on the changes of microbial communities the relative abundances of genera geoalkalibacter and geovibrio in the effluent increased to 14 7 7 7 and 13 1 2 6 respectively at the elevated sulfate condition while their relative abundances on the carrier remained stable 47 1 4 0 and 3 1 0 4 respectively fig 3 however the relative abundance of genus caenispirillum decreased to 21 0 2 8 on the carrier and 53 5 14 5 in the effluent similarly the relative abundances of genus pandoraea in effluent and paracoccus in carrier were impacted with relative abundance decreased to 1 although elevated sulfate concentration can influence selenate and nitrate reducer populations the fbr1 performance and cell numbers on the carrier and in the effluent were not impacted suggesting a robust microbial community in the fbr1 data shown in yan et al 29 shi et al 6 reported an inhibitory effect of sulfate on selenate reduction at a s se molar ratio of 1 25 or higher in their methane fed membrane biofilm reactor in which no sulfate reduction occurred they found that the inhibition of selenate reduction by sulfate was most likely via the direct competition with molybdate for the transport system resulting in the lack of available mo for mo dependent selenate reductases for selenate reduction however in the present study no inhibitory effect of sulfate on selenate reduction was observed at s se molar ratios of 1 or 4 the reason may be that the selenate reduction was carried out by selenate reductases that do not rely on mo for instance species in genus geoalkalibacter have an extensive array of outer membrane cytochromes 6 39 which may account for extracellular selenate reduction 3 4 3 other microorganisms detected in fbr1 members from genus thiobacillus relative abundance 4 were detected mainly in the effluent during stages ii and iii suggesting that sulfate may have facilitated their enrichment in the fbr1 the members of this genus are strictly chemolithotrophic and capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite or gaseous nitrogen coupling to the oxidization of reduced sulfur compounds such as sulfide sulfur and thiosulfate with sulfate as a product 52 in addition the members from genus soehngenia 1 3 detected in all stages have been reported to be fermentative and acidogenic with formate h2 co2 acetate and ethanol as by products 49 50 they may contribute to the removal of organic compounds released from other microbial cells in the fbr1 other fermenting bacteria with low populations 1 3 such as lentimicrobium aminivibrio candidatus dichloromethanomonas erysipelothrix and acholeplasma were also detected in the fbr1 the possible utilisation of organic compounds released from microbial cells may explain why a higher electron transfer efficiency could be achieved as actual electron consumption rate was lower than theoretical electron consumption rate at orp setpoints higher than 440 mv in stage ii data shown in yan et al 29 the overall relative abundance of fermenting bacteria detected at genus level was approximately 4 both on the carrier and in the effluent in all stages fig 4c d overall throughout the fbr1 operation fermenting bacteria co existed with selenate and nitrate reducers some of which may have putative commensalistic and mutualistic relationships with the fermenting bacteria methanogens 1 i e acetoclastic family methanosarcinaceae and hydrogenotrophic order methanobacteriales were also detected in the fbr1 at orp setpoints ranging between 520 mv and 360 mv in stage i 360 mv in stage ii and 480 in stage iii suggesting that high redox potential can inhibit methanogens their presence in fbr1 indicated that the bioreactor may have produced small amounts of methane the possible production of acetate and hydrogen from ethanol oxidation or fermentation processes in the fbr1 may promote the growth of methanogens 3 5 the relationship between microbial communities and operational parameters and the performance of fbr1 the relationship between operational parameters and microbial communities was explored with rda analysis the results showed that bacteria on the carrier and in the effluent had different responses to the changes of the orp setpoints and sulfate concentration in fbr1 fig 5a b the relative abundances of genus geoalkalibacter geobacter and acholeplasma on the carrier were negatively correlated with orp setpoint both on the carrier and in the effluent while caenispirillum azoarcus erysipelothrix lentimicrobium and candidatus dichloromethanomonas both on the carrier and in the effluent were positively correlated with orp setpoints elevated sulfate concentration in fbr1 resulted in a positive response of geoalkalibacter and lentimicrobium and negative response of geobacter paracoccus azoarcus erysipelothrix acholeplasma and candidatus dichloromethanomonas both on the carrier and in the effluent however elevated sulfate concentration in fbr1 had a much weaker correlation with geovibrio on the carrier and effluent suspended members of genus thiobacillus had a stronger relationship with elevated sulfate than those on the biofilm carrier of the fbr1 suggesting that sulfate might facilitate the enrichment of suspended thiobacillus in reactor liquid here thiobacillus and srb i e desulfovibrio 1 may have syntrophic relationship 53 in which srb may reduce a small fraction of sulfate below detection limit of 6 5 μm to dissolved sulfide subsequently utilized by thiobacillus coupled with the reduction of nitrate or selenate 52 thus the changes of orp setpoint and sulfate concentration resulted in the shifts of microbial communities both on the carrier and in the effluent of the fbr1 from stage i to stage iii selenate reducers had a higher relative abundance on the carrier than in the effluent of the fbr1 process suggesting that selenate reducing organisms i e geoalkalibacter and geovibrio mainly live on the biofilm carrier and biofilm may be the dominant place for selenate reduction however nitrate reducer i e caenispirillum was more abundant in the effluent than that on the carrier suggesting that nitrate reducers prefered living in suspension and denitrification may mainly happen in the liquid phase rda analysis was also used to study the relationship between the microbial communities and bioreactor performance the results from rda analysis suggested that selenate removal efficiency ethanol removal rate alkalinity production effluent ph and ammonium concentration in effluent were positively correlated with each other and these all showed negative correlations to the real orp values in reactor fig 5c d the relative abundances of the genus geoalkalibacter and geovibrio both on the carrier and in the effluent were negatively correlated with the detected orp values in fbr1 and positively correlated with selenate removal efficiency ethanol removal rate alkalinity production and effluent ph suggesting selenate respiration by those bacteria coupled with ethanol oxidation might result in low redox conditions in the fbr1 the relative abundance of nitrate reducers including genus caenispirillum and azoarcus on the carrier and in the effluent and paracoccus on the carrier were positively correlated with the real orp values in the fbr1 and negatively correlated with ethanol removal rate selenate removal and abundance of selenate reducers i e geoalkalibacter and geovibrio the results indicated that high redox potential setpoint benefited the growth of nitrate reducers but impacted the activities of selenate reducers and decreased the demand of ethanol in the fbr1 the relative abundance of suspended nitrate reducers including paracoccus and pseudomonas were negatively correlated with real orp values in fbr1 while the suspended caenispirillum had a positive response the result suggested that caenispirillum may outcompete paracoccus for substrates at high redox potential the production of selenite and ammonium from selenate and nitrate reduction in the fbr1 had a positive correlation with acholeplasma lentimicrobium and thiobacillus on the carrier and in the effluent 3 6 overloading of ethanol stimulated the shift of microbial communities in sulfate reducing reactor fbr2 and sulfide oxidizing reactor sor in stage iii the fbr1 effluent was treated in fbr2 to remove the residual sulfate followed by excess dissolved sulfide oxidation in the subsequent sor based on pca analysis the bacterial communities in fbr2 carrier fbr2 effluent and sor effluent were distinct from each other fig 6 suggesting different communities were responsible for sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation the results also suggested that overloading electron donor here ethanol to the fbr2 during days 44 55 fig 8 caused a notable shift in the microbial community compositions of both the carrier biomass and the effluent biomass over this ethanol overloading period when ethanol sulfate molar ratio was 1 acetate accumulation was detected in the fbr2 fig 8e suggesting the paucity of acetate oxidizers 54 on day 0 of fbr2 operation srb mainly consisted of desulfovibrio 27 5 1 7 relative abundance desulfomicrobium 1 4 0 0 desulfarculus 1 2 1 2 desulfobacca 1 and desulfotomaculum 1 on the carrier fig 7a and desulfovibrio 8 4 0 1 in the effluent fig 7b on day 55 with the increase of ethanol dosing the relative abundances of members from genera desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio and desulfuromonas increased to 4 5 0 3 36 6 2 3 and 2 8 0 3 on carrier and members of desulfomicrobium were enriched 6 2 0 4 in the effluent fig 7a b resulting in the increase of srb relative abundance from 31 6 to 44 7 on the carrier and from 8 4 to 12 4 in the effluent the increase of srb population stimulated by the increased ethanol dosing may be responsible for the increase of sulfate removal efficiency in the fbr2 from 63 to 73 fig 8c alkalinity produced in the complete oxidation of ethanol in the fbr2 maintained the reactor ph at approximately 7 8 in both the fbr2 and the sor fig 8f g due to the high redox potential 100 mv in the sor srb members originated from fbr2 were outcompeted by sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob fig 8h the major sob on day 0 included azonexus 49 1 3 7 paracoccus 10 3 1 1 and thiobacillus 9 9 1 1 fig 7c which may contribute to hydrogen sulfide oxidation the overall average dissolved sulfide removal efficiency was 90 in the sor fig 8b 55 56 on day 55 the overall sulfate removal of the integrated process increased from 53 to 62 as less sulfate was regenerated from the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide or sulfur in the sor fig 8c meanwhile acetate consumption in the sor was increased from 6 09 mm to 15 02 mm fig 8e which was accompanied by the enrichment of bacteria from genera acholeplasma 22 5 0 2 geobacter 10 0 1 8 and proteiniphilum 1 fig 7c in the sor the enrichment of these bacteria may have led to the outcompetition of azonexus the relative abundance of which decreased to below 1 on day 55 according to literature acholeplasma genus has been suggested to have the ability to reduce sulfate produced in the system and to oxidize dissolved sulfide to sulfur 57 58 which could explain why the genus was detected in both the fbr2 and the sor geobacter sulfurreducens can grow with acetate oxidation using oxygen as the sole electron acceptor at concentrations of 10 or less in the headspace 59 wu et al 60 suggested that cytochrome bd encoded in proteiniphilum genus may periodically perform aerobic respiration to degrade the volatile fatty acids during anaerobic fermentation therefore geobacter and proteiniphilumin may be helpful in sor for reducing the overoxidation of hydrogen sulfide or sulfur through acetate oxidation coupled with oxygen consumption overall the sulfate reducing and sulfide oxidizing consortia in the fbr2 and the sor respectively could be readily used for the sulfate reduction and dissolved sulfide oxidation 29 3 7 implications of the findings the use of orp feedback control by ethanol dosing was previously successfully demonstrated to facilitate selenate nitrate and sulfate removal from wastewater in a two stage fbr process which also enabled the recovery of high purity elemental se without ses formation 29 30 however the optimization of this promising treatment requires knowledge on the microbial community dynamics and the relationship between microbial community composition and process performance based on reactor performance and results from high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing this study for the first time demonstrated that selenate reducers i e geoalkalibacter and geovibrio mainly preferred to live in fbr1 biofilm while nitrate reducers i e caenispirillum and paracoccus were mainly in suspension selenate reducers were impacted at orp setpoint higher than 360 mv in the absence of sulfate or at orp setpoint higher than 440 mv in the presence of sulfate however nitrate reducers were not impacted by the changes of orp setpoint and removed 100 of nitrate both nitrate and selenate reducers could withstand elevated sulfate concentrations in fbr1 at optimal orp setpoint of 480 mv both microbial groups were active enabling sequential oxyanions removal and elemental se recovery from wastewater for biological sulfate removal the presence of srb in the fbr2 and sulfide oxidizing bacteria in a subsequent sor enabled the sequential removal of sulfate and dissolved sulfide however the interpretation of metabolic pathways in two stage biological process requires the investigation of key functional genes related to the reduction of oxyanions 6 61 therefore further study should aim to characterize the key function genes in the bioreactor process and evaluate the effect of redox potential and elevated sulfate concentrations on the expression of key genes 4 conclusions dynamic changes of microbial communities both on the biomass carrier and in the effluent of the fbr1 during the treatment of wastewater containing selenate nitrate and sulfate were successfully characterized at various orp setpoints high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis indicated that high redox condition orp 360 mv without sulfate in stage i and orp 440 mv with sulfate in stage ii and elevated sulfate at orp set points 480 mv stage iii in the fbr1 impacted alpha diversity indicating a shift of microbial communities both on the carrier and in the effluent the microbial communities in the fbr1 were mainly composed of selenate reducing bacteria geoalkalibacter and geovibrio nitrate reducing bacteria caenispirillum and paracoccus and a small fraction of fermenting bacteria soehngenia selenate reducers were negatively impacted by high redox potential at orp setpoints of 360 mv in stage i and 440 mv in stage ii whereas nitrate reducers showed the opposite response to redox changes the apparent changes in the relative abundance of these microbial groups at high orp setpoints in stages i ii likely accounted for the corresponding decrease of selenate removal efficiency in the fbr1 the abundance of nitrate reducers in the fbr1 was consistent with the near 100 removal of nitrate throughout the fbr1 process selenate reducers were quickly enriched in the fbr1 at orp 480 mv after the shortage of electron donor the srb detected in the sulfate reducing fbr2 mainly included desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio and desulfuromonas genera whereas the dominant sob in the sor were members of the paracoccus thiobacillus and acholeplasma genera declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12399,oxidation reduction potential orp feedback control by ethanol dosing was recently proved effective in facilitating a two stage fluidized bed reactor fbr process to remove selenate nitrate and sulfate from wastewater and recover high purity elemental se without the formation of carcinogenic ses however further optimization requires knowledge on the relationship between microbial community composition and process performance here changes of microbial communities during the reduction of selenate and nitrate in the first fbr fbr1 under various orp conditions 240 to 520 mv vs ag agcl sulfate reduction in subsquent fbr fbr2 and sulfide oxidation in sulfide oxidation reactor sor were examined based on 16s rrna gene sequencing high orp stage i without sulfate 360 mv stage ii with sulfate 440 mv and elevated sulfate at orp 480 mv stage iii in fbr1 altered the microbial communities both on fluidized carrier and bulk liquor selenate reducers geoalkalibacter and geovibrio genera were impacted at orp 360 mv stage i or 440 mv stage ii when selenate removal in fbr1 declined however nitrate reducers caenispirillum and paracoccus genera were not affected in the fbr1 and facilitated 100 nitrate removal at orp 480 mv selenate reducers were readily enriched in fbr1 in the fbr2 the major sulfate reducing genera were desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio and desulfuromonas whereas the dominant sulfide oxidating genera in sor were paracoccus thiobacillus and acholeplasma this study suggested that both nitrate and selenate reducing communities could remain active under elevated sulfate concentrations enabling sequential oxyanions removal and elemental se recovery from wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords feedback control microbial community oxidation reduction potential oxyanion reduction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction selenium se is an essential trace element for human beings and animals but the safe dosage range for daily intake is very narrow 40 μg day 1 beneficial dosage 400 μg day 1 toxic dosage 1 industrial activities such as mining coal combustion and metal and oil refining can generate se containing waste streams e g wastewater mine drainage discharge of these waste streams may increase selenium concentration in aquatic environments and cause selenium pollution 2 3 soluble inorganic selenium in water has two major forms selenate seo4 2 and selenite seo3 2 among which selenate is typically more abundant in oxic environments 4 selenate may accumulate in aquatic ecosystems via food chains leading to reproductive and teratogenic defects in aquatic animals 2 to ensure the safety of humans a guideline value of 40 μg l 1 for the maximum se concentration in drinking water has been set by the world health organization 5 bioreduction is considered as an effective method to facilitate selenate removal from wastewater 6 9 selenate reducing microorganisms can reduce selenate to elemental se se0 when supplied with a suitable electron donor such as hydrogen 10 methane 11 ethanol 12 or lactate 13 elemental se is a valuable product which is less bioavailable and that can be used for various applications such as nanotechnology photovoltaic and semiconductor technology 14 the solid elemental se can be recovered from bioreactor effluents via filtering and centrifugation in the past few decades many microbial species have been reported to reduce selenate for example comamonas testosteroni s44 15 pelobacter seleniigenes 16 thauera selenatis 17 and enterobacter cloacae sld1a 1 18 have been described to be capable of selenate or selenite reduction selenate reduction can be catalyzed by specific selenate reductases or non specific reductases involved in denitrification and sulfate reducing pathways 19 suggesting that the electron transfer pathways of selenate reduction are diverse 15 20 apart from pure cultures a mixed consortium consisting of aerobic methanotrophs and selenate reducing bacteria has been reported to have a synergistic effect for selenate reduction via methane oxidation coupled to selenate reduction pathway 21 nitrate and sulfate often coexist with selenate in wastewater 4 13 22 both oxyanions cause environmental issues nitrate can cause eutrophication of water bodies ultimately leading to excessive growth of aquatic organisms and destruction of the aquatic ecosystem 23 sulfate as an electron acceptor can be biologically reduced to hydrogen sulfide h2s in environments lacking oxygen or nitrate this h2s can cause stench and corrosion problems 24 in addition excessive sulfate in the environment impacts drinking water supplies since sulfate in drinking water can result in gastrointestinal disorders for human beings 5 25 26 thus nitrate and sulfate need to be removed along with selenate before effluent discharge to minimize their impact on environment the use of mixed consortia of microorganisms may be a good option for biological reduction of selenate nitrate and sulfate as compared with pure cultures mixed microbial consortia can support syntrophic metabolic pathways and a simultaneous reduction of selenate nitrate and sulfate 2 more importantly mixed consortia have a higher resilience to adapt to possible changes in bioreactor conditions 27 therefore mixed consortia are likely more robust and suited for oxyanion removal in bioreactors than pure cultures although some microbial consortia have been reported to simultaneously reduce the three oxyanions nitrate selenate and sulfate in various bioreactors poor sulfate reduction and recovery of low purity elemental se are conceivable drawbacks for single stage bioreactor processes 8 22 28 the main reason for the poor sulfate reduction may be that the reduction of nitrate and selenate reduction is thermodynamically more favorable than sulfate reduction 22 thus when electron donor availability is limited sulfate reducers may be outcompeted by nitrate and selenate reducers simultaneous reduction of sulfate and selenate can lead to the production of sexsy molecules or a mixture of selenium and sulfides 2 decreasing the purity of elemental se for recovery to effectively remove the three oxyanions from wastewater and recover high purity elemental se a two stage fluidized bed reactor fbr process based on orp feedback control was recently developed for the sequential removal of selenate nitrate and sulfate from acidic wastewater 29 in the first stage of the process fbr1 orp feedback control was used to optimize ethanol dosage for selective and efficient selenate and nitrate removal over sulfate reduction allowing the recovery of elemental se with high purity of 71 29 30 effective removal of the residual sulfate in the effluent of the first bioreactor was achieved with a subsequent bioreactor fbr2 followed by excess sulfide oxidation in a sulfide oxidizing reactor sor 30 the performance of this multi stage bioreactor process under various orp setpoints in fbr1 was examined by yan et al 27 who found that at optimum orp setpoint of 480 mv the fbr1 enabled near complete reduction of selenate and nitrate at a removal rate of 0 40 mm h here elemental se was the main product of selenate reduction and the recovery efficiency of elemental se in fbr1 effluent was 37 5 with 71 se purity 29 however the composition of the microbial communities in the bioreactors as well as their responses to the changes of orp setpoints and elevated influent sulfate concentration have not been reported therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to characterize the composition of microbial communities in fbr1 fbr2 and sor 2 to investigate the effect of orp setpoint and elevated sulfate concentration on the changes in the composition and diversity of microbial communities in the fbr1 and 3 to explore the relationship between the fbr1 operational parameters microbial communities and performance this study provides crucial insights for further optimization of the bioprocess performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum bioreactor operation and sampling the constructions and operation of all bioreactors used in this study have been reported in previous studies 30 32 the original inoculum for the fbr1 was taken from the effluent tank of a 4 l lab scale selenate reducing inverse fluidized bed reactor ifbr 31 the ifbr was continuously fed with selenate containing wastewater at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 5 days for over 590 days with ethanol as the sole electron donor for selenate reduction 31 the fbr2 was originally inoculated with a mixed sulfate reducing consortium 32 the fbr2 effluent was collected as inoculum for the start up of the sulfide oxidizing reactor sor 30 the fbr1 was continuously operated for 223 days at an hrt of 12 h for treating acidic wastewater ph 4 0 containing selenate nitrate or sulfate table 1 the overall operation period was divided into three stages and at each stage fbr1 was operated for at least 8 hrts to ensure a stable performance of reactor would be recorded in stage i the fbr1 was operated to remove selenate and nitrate 5 mm each with electron donor ethanol dosing based on orp feedback control 30 the fbr1 performance was evaluated at various orp set points mv vs ag agcl days 407 497 namely 520 mv 480 mv 440 mv 400 mv 360 mv 300 mv 240 mv and 520 mv the first process recovery from electron shortage in stage ii the fbr1 was operated for the treatment of selenate nitrate and sulfate contained wastewater days 498 573 based on the developed ethanol dosing strategy in fbr1 to determine at which orp sulfate reduction would happen in the presence of nitrate and selenate in fbr1 various orp setpoints mv vs ag agcl namely 520 mv 480 mv 440 mv 400 mv 360 mv and 480 mv the second process recovery were tested at each oxyanion concentration of 5 mm 29 the orp setpoint for process recovery in stages i ii of fbr1 should ensure enough ethanol dosage for the complete reduction of selenate and nitrate in stage iii in order to investigate the effect of elevated sulfate concentration on the effective feedback control of orp at 480 mv for the reduction of both selenate and nitrate 5 mm each sulfate concentration in fbr1 influent was increased from 5 mm to 21 mm 2016 mg l 1 days 574 636 29 this high concentration was based on the actual sulfate concentration in a real acid mine drainage tested in our previous study 32 in this stage as no noticeable sulfate reduction was detected in fbr1 the residual sulfate in fbr1 effluent was treated by subsequent sulfate reducing fbr2 with ethanol as electron donor followed by sor 29 sulfate ethanol molar ratio in fbr2 was set as 1 0 to ensure enough electron donor for sulfate reducing bacteria srb the fbr2 was operated at a longer hrt of 96 h to ensure enough time for the sulfate reducing bacteria to react with the substrates ethanol addition to fbr1 was controlled by using labview feedback controlling software national instruments usa that compared the real time orp signals against an orp setpoint when the real time orp value in fbr1 was above the setpoint ethanol dosing to fbr1 was triggered the weight of the ethanol stock solution was measured at regular intervals for calculating the actual ethanol loading rate of fbr1 at various redox setpoints biomass samples including carrier and effluent samples were collected from the fbr1 at each orp setpoint in stages i iii after combining the fbr1 to fbr2 and sor biomass samples from fbr2 carrier and effluent from fbr2 and sor were collected on days 0 and 55 on biomass sampling days an aliquot 2 ml of the carrier sample with attached biomass was withdrawn from the centre of the fbrs using a sterile tygon tubing attached to a sterile 50 ml plastic syringe under anaerobic condition at each orp setpoint biomass was collected from the reactors as at least duplicate samples after separation of free liquid by decanting 0 25 g of the carrier was directly used for dna extraction suspended cells from 10 ml of the reactor effluents were concentrated by filtering on a 0 2 μm gtbp membrane isopore millipore the membrane with concentrated biomass was then directly used for dna extraction 2 2 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing microbial communities in the biomass samples collected from the fbr1 fbr2 and sor were characterized using next generation sequencing targeting the partial 16s rrna genes fig 1 the dna was extracted from biomass carrier and cells harvested from effluent using power soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc according to the manufacturer s protocol except that the duration for the last incubation with elution buffer on the filter member was extended to 15 min the extracted dna was quantified using a fluorometer qubit invitrogen and stored at 80 c in order to stabilize the dna during shipment at ambient temperature dna samples were mixed with dna stable plus biometrica supplied by diagnostic technology at volume ratio of 4 1 the stabilized dna samples were then submitted to mcgill university and genome quebec innovation center for sequencing of the partial 16s rrna genes in prokaryotes with the primer set 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaatwgrcgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgwgtrc 3 using the illumina miseq pe300 technology 33 2 3 processing of raw sequencing reads the qiime2 pipeline version 2019 4 was adopted to process the raw sequence reads the raw sequences after removing the primer regions using the trim paired command were denoised using the dada2 package to perform quality check dereplicate them merge the forward and reverse paired reads and filter chimeras with the default setting except that p trunc len f and p trunc len r were set to 260 and 240 respectively a feature table was generated to summarize the clustered reads based on amplicon sequence variation asv sequences were considered to represent different asvs if they had at least 1 bp difference the representative sequence for each asv was also determined which then was passed through the silva classifier version 132 99 34 trained specifically for the 926f and 1392r primers for taxonomy determination the feature tables were exported in biom format which then was converted into a csv file to be processed with microsoft excel to compute relative abundance of taxa in the microbial communities and to perform downstream ordination analysis see next section the taxa diversity and richness in the cultures were also assessed by conducting alpha diversity analysis in qiime2 to evaluate the impact of different environmental factors 2 4 statistical analysis the differences of microbial communities between biomass samples were visualized by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds using bray curtis distance and principal component analysis pca via canoco version 5 0 software redundancy analysis rda were performed to evaluate the relationship between the microbial communities and operational parameters orp setpoint and influent sulfate concentration and chemical performance data detected orp selenate removal efficiency ethanol removal rate alkalinity production effluent ph and ammonium concentration by using canoco version 5 0 software 3 results and discussion the performance of the multi stage bioprocess was characterized and detailed in yan et al 27 the fbr1 performance for the reduction of selenate nitrate and sulfate during stages i iii were as summarized in table 1 this section describes and discusses the results obtained from the characterization of the microbial community dynamics during the operation of fbr1 fbr2 and sor 3 1 changes in the alpha diversity of the microbial community in fbr1 during stages i to iii a total of 9 357 671 high quality miseq reads of the partial 16s rrna gene were generated from 56 samples obtained from fbr1 including biofilm carrier and effluent samples and over 48 000 sequences were obtained from each sample fig 2 b these sequences were clustered into asvs in each sample ranging between 46 and 114 fig 2c d high good s coverage value 99 99 fig 2e f of each sample indicated that sufficient sequencing depth was achieved for all samples 35 the shannon and simpson diversity indexes were used to evaluate the alpha diversity of carrier and effluent biomass in fbr1 in stage i iii fig 2g j asv evenness was evaluated with simpson evenness and asv richness with chao1 and ace indexes fig 2k p the results suggested that the changes in orp setpoints had a great influence on the alpha diversity for effluent biomass in fbr1 fig 2g j by affecting the evenness fig 2k l particularly at orp 360 mv and richness fig 2m p high orp setpoints 360 mv in stage i and 400 mv in stage ii had a prolonged effect on the diversity of microbial communities in the effluent while the diversity of microbial communities on carrier had good resilience during the changes of orp setpoints in fbr1 fig 2g j the presence of sulfate at low orp of 480 mv may have stimulated the growth of more microbial taxa in fbr1 additionally microbial diversity for microbes on carrier was higher than that for the effluent throughout the fbr1 process suggesting that the microbial community in the carrier biomass may be less susceptible to the changes in redox condition than the suspended biomass 3 2 orp setpoint and elevated sulfate concentration influenced the microbial communities in fbr1 given that bacteria represented near 100 of the relative abundance of all classified prokaryote taxa in both carrier and effluent biomass in fbr1 the changes of bacterial communities were considered for further studies the cluster analysis using pca revealed a distinct difference between the bacterial communities in carrier and effluent biomass in the fbr1 fig 3a the dissimilarity between bacterial communities of carrier and effluent during the changes of reactor conditions were further determined by nmds fig 3b c the results showed that in stage i at orp ranging between 520 and 360 mv the related communities on the carrier and in the effluent were relatively similar and clustered together however orp higher than 360 mv in fbr1 resulted in a shift of bacterial communities both on the carrier and in the effluent in stage ii when the fbr1 influent was amended with sulfate 5 mm bacterial communities both on the carrier and in the effluent shifted again the carrier communities showed similar structure at orp values between 520 and 360 mv however effluent communities shifted at orp values higher than 440 mv the results suggested that effluent communities were more influenced by the changes of orp setpoint in presence the of sulfate than the carrier communities in stage iii the microbial communities in both carrier and effluent acclimatized were closely assembling those in stage ii given their relatively close distances to their related stage ii clusters as shown in fig 3b and c respectively 3 3 the composition of microbial communities during fbr1 start up during the start up of the fbr1 stage i at orp setpoint of 520 mv the fbr1 was fed with synthetic wastewater containing 5 mm selenate and 5 mm nitrate at hrt of 12 h the fbr1 removed selenate and nitrate nearly completely with no notable selenite and nitrite production table 1 during this period the bacterial communities on the carrier mainly consisted of members from genera geoalkalibacter 37 2 2 4 relative abundance geovibrio 6 1 1 5 soehngenia 2 8 0 2 geobacter 1 9 0 2 paracoccus 1 8 0 1 and caenispirillum 1 5 0 2 fig 4a the suspended communities in frb1 contained members from genera geovibrio 55 0 0 3 caenispirillum 16 6 3 3 pseudomonas 3 3 1 1 paracoccus 3 1 0 0 pandoraea 2 6 1 6 geobacter 2 0 0 4 and geoalkalibacter 1 6 0 5 fig 4b therefore the predominant bacterial members on the carrier were quite different from the suspended cells in the effluent of the fbr1 members from genera geoalkalibacter geovibrio and geobacter have been reported to prefer growing in anaerobic conditions and play important roles in degrading a wide range of organic compounds 36 38 many members in these genera are selenate or selenite reducers and some can also reduce nitrate sulfate or metals i e fe3 mn4 36 38 for instance geobacter sulfurreducens strain pca has been reported to respire selenite to elemental selenium coupled with hydrogen or acetate oxidation 39 it can also respire nitrate anthraquinone disulfonate fumarate fe3 and elemental sulfur geovibrio ferrireducens is an obligately anaerobic selenate respiring bacterium 40 however this species has a very poor capacity to further reduce selenite to elemental selenium although no study has reported that geoalkalibacter members can reduce selenate c type cytochrome in cell membrane of geoalkalibacter ferrihydriticus sp nov strain z 0531 may be responsible for selenate reduction via extracellular electron transfer mechanisms in the fbr1 6 20 41 43 therefore members from genera geoalkalibacter geovibrio and geobacter may have contributed to the reduction of selenate and ethanol oxidation during the start up of fbr1 members from genera caenispirillum paracoccus pseudomonas and pandoraea are common nitrate reducers often found in soil and aquatic environments and play important roles in nitrogen cycling among the members of caenispirillum only caenispirillum bisanense is known to reduce nitrate and is facultatively anaerobic 44 45 species in genus paracoccus can respire oxygen or nitrate as terminal electron acceptors and use a wide range of organic substrates such as alcohols organic acids amino acids and carbohydrates 46 paracoccus denitrificans can also reduce selenate by nitrate reductases but a study found that selenate reduction v max by this species was 40 fold slower than nitrate reduction 19 members of genera pseudomonas and pandoraea have also been reported to be involved in selenate reduction 6 47 48 apart from selenate and nitrate reducing bacteria also fermenting bacteria were detected on the carrier and in the effluent of the fbr1 soehngenia 2 8 0 2 was the predominant fermenting genus which can form syntrophic relationships with hydrogenotrophs 21 49 51 the overall relative abundance of fermentative bacteria in fbr1 was below 4 0 6 3 9 for carrier communities and 0 2 9 for effluent communities which was notably lower than that of selenate and nitrate reducing bacteria the fermentative bacteria in fbr1 may scavenge organic compounds released from other microbial cells 3 4 dynamic changes in bacterial community in fbr1 at various orp conditions 3 4 1 selenate reducers and nitrate reducers had different responses to orp setpoints in stage i in stage i the fbr1 was continuously fed with an influent containing 5 mm selenate and 5 mm nitrate but without sulfate the tested orp setpoints mv vs ag agcl were 520 mv 480 mv 440 mv 400 mv and 360 mv 300 mv and 240 mv the results suggested that as the orp setpoint was increased from 520 mv to 360 mv the relative abundance of genera geoalkalibacter and geovibrio i e the likely selenate reducing bacteria 40 42 43 on the carrier decreased from 37 2 2 4 and 6 1 1 4 to 22 9 6 5 and 4 6 3 2 respectively fig 4a b simultaneously the relative abundance of genus geovibrio in the effluent decreased from 55 0 0 3 to 17 1 1 1 the decreased relative abundance of selenate reducers may have been caused by the decreased ethanol dosage fig 4 table 1 resulting in competition between selenate reducers and other bacteria i e nitrate reducers and fermenting bacteria the relative abundance of geobacter genus remained below 2 in both carrier and effluent in the stage i nevertheless the overall relative abundance of selenate reducing bacteria was still high both on the carrier 29 and in the effluent 19 at orp setpoint of 360 mv fig 4c 4d the abundance of selenate reducing bacteria in fbr1 was consistent with the efficient removal of selenate near 100 in fbr1 at orp setpoints ranging from 520 mv to 360 mv in stage i however as the orp setpoint increased from 360 mv to 240 mv the relative abundance of genera geoalkalibacter and geovibrio on carrier decreased sharply to below 7 and 1 during this period the relative abundance of selenate reducing bacteria decreased to the very low value of 8 on the carrier and 2 in the effluent fig 4c d such low relative abundance of selenate reducing bacteria at high orp setpoints 240 mv may be ascribed to poor competition for limited ethanol by selenate reducers as compared to other bacteria in fbr1 table 1 according to previous studies geoalkalibacter geobacter and geovibrio prefer to grow anaerobically 36 38 thus the high redox condition in fbr1 may have inhibited the growth of selenate reducing bacteria further leading to the decline of fbr1 performance selenate removal efficiency decreased to 10 0 3 5 at orp setpoint of 240 mv table 1 in addition the decline of relative abundance of selenate reducers may also be the result of better growth of denitrifiers at high orp selenate reducing bacteria on carrier had always higher relative abundance than those in the effluent at each tested orp setpoint indicating that selenate reducers on the carrier were more resistant to the changes of ethanol dosing and redox conditions in fbr1 than suspended cells as compared to selenate reducers the predominant nitrate reducers i e genus caenispirillum in fbr1 showed a positive response to the increase of orp setpoint for both the carrier and the effluent members from genus caenispirillum became predominant at a higher orp setpoint of 300 mv on the carrier and 480 mv in the effluent with the relative abundances of 29 7 3 7 and 62 7 3 7 respectively fig 4 this suggested that over the 180 mv window i e 480 mv to 300 mv much of the denitrification activity would likely be attributed to the suspended microorganisms in the bulk water i e the effluent the members of paracoccus genus reached a peak value of 30 5 6 4 on the carrier at orp setpoint of 300 mv fig 4a whereas its relative abundance in the effluent remained at 3 6 fig 4b at a higher orp setpoint of 240 mv caenispirillum was the most abundant genus in the fbr1 with relative abundance of 45 8 0 3 on the carrier and 86 7 2 9 in the effluent however the increase of orp setpoint to 240 mv resulted in the apparent decrease of the relative abundance of paracoccus genus to 16 5 1 1 on the carrier and close to 1 in the effluent which may have been caused by the decreased ethanol dosage leading to the competition between nitrate reducers members from genus pandoraea were with low relative abundance of 1 4 in effluent at all tested orp setpoints in stage i members from genus azoarcus were enriched at orp setpoint of 480 mv and reached a peak value of 7 at orp setpoint between 400 mv and 360 mv at orp setpoint of 240 mv the overall relative abundance of nitrate reducers reached the highest values of 62 on carrier and 94 in the effluent which were much higher than those of selenate reducers 8 4 and 1 7 on the carrier and in the effluent respectively fig 4c d the results suggested that nitrate reducers may have higher affinities to ethanol at high redox conditions than selenate reducers and other bacteria the nitrate reducers could also adequately respond and adapt to environmental changes in fbr1 thus having higher competitiveness for substrates than selenate reducers at high orp conditions the fbr1 achieved efficient nitrate removal even when the supply of ethanol was not sufficient to enable complete reduction of selenate i e at high orp conditions therefore orp setpoint and electron dosage notably influenced the composition of microbial communities on the carrier and in the effluent i e in suspension after the fbr1 was challenged for a period of a high orp 240 mv operation the fbr1 was again operated at a low orp setpoint of 520 mv to reinstate its selenate reducing ability as expected with the increased ethanol loading at orp setpoint of 520 mv the relative abundance of genera geoalkalibacter geobacter and geovibrio on the carrier increased to 17 2 2 3 6 0 0 6 and 5 5 1 5 respectively whereas their relative abundance in the effluent were 0 5 1 0 0 and 14 9 0 4 respectively although the relative abundance of nitrate reducers decreased for both the carrier and the effluent during the enrichment of selenate reducers fig 4c d the predominant nitrate reducers from genus caenispirillum remained abundant on the carrier 31 7 2 6 and in the effluent 71 5 4 0 therefore low redox potential could facilitate the enrichment of selenate reducing bacteria in fbr1 which in turn improved selenate removal overall given the flexible response of selenate and nitrate reducers to redox changes in stage i the online ethanol dosing strategy based on orp feedback was considered an effective method for optimizing the reduction of selenate and nitrate in the fbr1 3 4 2 sulfate influenced the bacterial communities in stages ii and iii after the recovery of fbr1 performance from electron donor shortage 5 mm sulfate was introduced to the fbr1 influent in stage ii the tested orp setpoints in stage ii mv vs ag agcl were 520 mv 480 mv 440 mv 400 mv and 360 mv table 1 with the addition of 5 mm sulfate at orp setpoint of 520 mv in stage ii the relative abundances of dominant selenate reducing bacteria from genera geoalkalibacter and geovibrio increased to 32 2 3 6 and 9 5 0 6 on the carrier and 5 2 0 01 and 27 6 6 6 in the effluent respectively fig 4a b in contrast the relative abundance of dominant nitrate reducing bacteria from genus caenispirillum decreased to 20 9 2 3 on the carrier and 47 1 9 0 in the effluent as the orp setpoint was increased from 520 mv to 440 mv in stage ii the relative abundance of genus geoalkalibacter on the carrier increased to 53 3 3 2 while that of genus geovibrio on the carrier decreased to 2 8 0 2 however the relative abundance of genus geoalkalibacter on the carrier decreased to 26 7 4 0 as orp setpoint increased to 360 mv the relative abundance of genus geovibrio on the carrier remained at 2 4 at orp ranging between 440 mv and 360 mv overall the relative abundance of suspended selenate reducing bacteria decreased from 33 to 3 fig 4d which was mainly associated with the decrease of geovibrio population from 27 6 to 2 2 the decrease in the relative abundance of the dominant selenate reducing bacteria in the fbr1 at orp higher than 440 mv was in line with the decrease of total cell number on the carrier data shown in yan et al 29 and selenate removal efficiency 88 7 9 0 at orp of 400 mv and 79 4 18 1 at orp of 360 mv thus it is likely that the orp setpoint higher than 440 mv in stage ii had impacted the growth of selenate reducing bacteria in the presence of sulfate further impacting the fbr1 performance in terms of nitrate reducers as orp setpoint was increased from 520 mv to 440 mv the dominant bacteria from caenispirillum genus on the carrier decreased in relative abundance from 20 9 0 6 to 13 7 1 9 whereas the caenispirillum still dominated the effluent communities with 58 0 6 6 relative abundance since the ethanol demand gradually decreased to stoichiometric value when the orp setpoint was increased from 520 mv to 440 mv table 1 the slight decrease of caenispirillum on the carrier may be related to competition for ethanol with selenate reducers and other bacteria in the presence of sulfate the decrease of the relative abundance of caenispirillum on the carrier in stage ii was opposite to the trend detected at orp ranging between 520 mv and 440 mv in stage i suggesting that sulfate may have negatively influenced the growth of caenispirillum in fbr1 further increase of orp from 440 mv to 400 mv and beyond resulted in the increase of the relative abundance of caenispirillum on the carrier and in the effluent at orp setpoint of 360 mv members from caenispirillum genus reached their highest relative abundance in stage ii contributing to 32 1 6 6 on the carrier and 87 8 4 2 in the effluent the increase in the relative abundance of caenispirillum at orp setpoints higher than 440 mv in fbr1 may have been caused by decreased population of selenate reducing bacteria which were sensitive to high orp being consistent with phase i additionally other nitrate reducers with small population in stage ii showed different response to the changes of ethanol dose in the presence of sulfate at various orp setpoints in stage ii as compared to stage i for instance the relative abundance of genus paracoccus decreased from 13 5 1 4 to 4 1 1 4 on the carrier and from 6 2 2 6 to 1 in the effluent as orp setpoint was increased from 520 mv to 360 mv the relative abundance of suspended pandoraea reached a peak value of 8 7 0 2 at orp setpoint of 480 mv in stage ii given that nitrate reducers in fbr1 were abundant and could flexibly adapt to the changes of electron donor dosage at all tested orp setpoints in stage ii nitrate removal efficiency was near 100 with no nitrite accumulation table 1 as the orp setpoint was decreased from 360 mv to 480 mv during the second process recovery period in stage ii the relative abundance of genus geoalkalibacter increased to 51 1 0 6 on the carrier and 3 6 1 9 in the effluent suggesting that the low orp setpoint facilitated the enrichment of geoalkalibacter however the members of genera geovibrio and geobacter were not recovered during this period geovibrio genus was still with low relative abundance in carrier 2 4 and effluent 6 geobacter population was below 1 both on the carrier and in the effluent the results indicated that the members of the genus geoalkalibacter were more resilient than the other two selenate reducing genera at orp setpoint of 480 mv which may have contributed to the improvement of selenate removal efficiency during process recovery period caenispirillum population decreased both on the carrier and in the effluent but still remained abundant in the fbr1 26 5 1 5 on the carrier and 79 9 7 6 in the effluent in stage iii fbr1 influent sulfate concentration was increased from 5 mm to 21 mm at orp setpoint of 480 mv to study the effect of elevated sulfate concentration on the changes of microbial communities the relative abundances of genera geoalkalibacter and geovibrio in the effluent increased to 14 7 7 7 and 13 1 2 6 respectively at the elevated sulfate condition while their relative abundances on the carrier remained stable 47 1 4 0 and 3 1 0 4 respectively fig 3 however the relative abundance of genus caenispirillum decreased to 21 0 2 8 on the carrier and 53 5 14 5 in the effluent similarly the relative abundances of genus pandoraea in effluent and paracoccus in carrier were impacted with relative abundance decreased to 1 although elevated sulfate concentration can influence selenate and nitrate reducer populations the fbr1 performance and cell numbers on the carrier and in the effluent were not impacted suggesting a robust microbial community in the fbr1 data shown in yan et al 29 shi et al 6 reported an inhibitory effect of sulfate on selenate reduction at a s se molar ratio of 1 25 or higher in their methane fed membrane biofilm reactor in which no sulfate reduction occurred they found that the inhibition of selenate reduction by sulfate was most likely via the direct competition with molybdate for the transport system resulting in the lack of available mo for mo dependent selenate reductases for selenate reduction however in the present study no inhibitory effect of sulfate on selenate reduction was observed at s se molar ratios of 1 or 4 the reason may be that the selenate reduction was carried out by selenate reductases that do not rely on mo for instance species in genus geoalkalibacter have an extensive array of outer membrane cytochromes 6 39 which may account for extracellular selenate reduction 3 4 3 other microorganisms detected in fbr1 members from genus thiobacillus relative abundance 4 were detected mainly in the effluent during stages ii and iii suggesting that sulfate may have facilitated their enrichment in the fbr1 the members of this genus are strictly chemolithotrophic and capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite or gaseous nitrogen coupling to the oxidization of reduced sulfur compounds such as sulfide sulfur and thiosulfate with sulfate as a product 52 in addition the members from genus soehngenia 1 3 detected in all stages have been reported to be fermentative and acidogenic with formate h2 co2 acetate and ethanol as by products 49 50 they may contribute to the removal of organic compounds released from other microbial cells in the fbr1 other fermenting bacteria with low populations 1 3 such as lentimicrobium aminivibrio candidatus dichloromethanomonas erysipelothrix and acholeplasma were also detected in the fbr1 the possible utilisation of organic compounds released from microbial cells may explain why a higher electron transfer efficiency could be achieved as actual electron consumption rate was lower than theoretical electron consumption rate at orp setpoints higher than 440 mv in stage ii data shown in yan et al 29 the overall relative abundance of fermenting bacteria detected at genus level was approximately 4 both on the carrier and in the effluent in all stages fig 4c d overall throughout the fbr1 operation fermenting bacteria co existed with selenate and nitrate reducers some of which may have putative commensalistic and mutualistic relationships with the fermenting bacteria methanogens 1 i e acetoclastic family methanosarcinaceae and hydrogenotrophic order methanobacteriales were also detected in the fbr1 at orp setpoints ranging between 520 mv and 360 mv in stage i 360 mv in stage ii and 480 in stage iii suggesting that high redox potential can inhibit methanogens their presence in fbr1 indicated that the bioreactor may have produced small amounts of methane the possible production of acetate and hydrogen from ethanol oxidation or fermentation processes in the fbr1 may promote the growth of methanogens 3 5 the relationship between microbial communities and operational parameters and the performance of fbr1 the relationship between operational parameters and microbial communities was explored with rda analysis the results showed that bacteria on the carrier and in the effluent had different responses to the changes of the orp setpoints and sulfate concentration in fbr1 fig 5a b the relative abundances of genus geoalkalibacter geobacter and acholeplasma on the carrier were negatively correlated with orp setpoint both on the carrier and in the effluent while caenispirillum azoarcus erysipelothrix lentimicrobium and candidatus dichloromethanomonas both on the carrier and in the effluent were positively correlated with orp setpoints elevated sulfate concentration in fbr1 resulted in a positive response of geoalkalibacter and lentimicrobium and negative response of geobacter paracoccus azoarcus erysipelothrix acholeplasma and candidatus dichloromethanomonas both on the carrier and in the effluent however elevated sulfate concentration in fbr1 had a much weaker correlation with geovibrio on the carrier and effluent suspended members of genus thiobacillus had a stronger relationship with elevated sulfate than those on the biofilm carrier of the fbr1 suggesting that sulfate might facilitate the enrichment of suspended thiobacillus in reactor liquid here thiobacillus and srb i e desulfovibrio 1 may have syntrophic relationship 53 in which srb may reduce a small fraction of sulfate below detection limit of 6 5 μm to dissolved sulfide subsequently utilized by thiobacillus coupled with the reduction of nitrate or selenate 52 thus the changes of orp setpoint and sulfate concentration resulted in the shifts of microbial communities both on the carrier and in the effluent of the fbr1 from stage i to stage iii selenate reducers had a higher relative abundance on the carrier than in the effluent of the fbr1 process suggesting that selenate reducing organisms i e geoalkalibacter and geovibrio mainly live on the biofilm carrier and biofilm may be the dominant place for selenate reduction however nitrate reducer i e caenispirillum was more abundant in the effluent than that on the carrier suggesting that nitrate reducers prefered living in suspension and denitrification may mainly happen in the liquid phase rda analysis was also used to study the relationship between the microbial communities and bioreactor performance the results from rda analysis suggested that selenate removal efficiency ethanol removal rate alkalinity production effluent ph and ammonium concentration in effluent were positively correlated with each other and these all showed negative correlations to the real orp values in reactor fig 5c d the relative abundances of the genus geoalkalibacter and geovibrio both on the carrier and in the effluent were negatively correlated with the detected orp values in fbr1 and positively correlated with selenate removal efficiency ethanol removal rate alkalinity production and effluent ph suggesting selenate respiration by those bacteria coupled with ethanol oxidation might result in low redox conditions in the fbr1 the relative abundance of nitrate reducers including genus caenispirillum and azoarcus on the carrier and in the effluent and paracoccus on the carrier were positively correlated with the real orp values in the fbr1 and negatively correlated with ethanol removal rate selenate removal and abundance of selenate reducers i e geoalkalibacter and geovibrio the results indicated that high redox potential setpoint benefited the growth of nitrate reducers but impacted the activities of selenate reducers and decreased the demand of ethanol in the fbr1 the relative abundance of suspended nitrate reducers including paracoccus and pseudomonas were negatively correlated with real orp values in fbr1 while the suspended caenispirillum had a positive response the result suggested that caenispirillum may outcompete paracoccus for substrates at high redox potential the production of selenite and ammonium from selenate and nitrate reduction in the fbr1 had a positive correlation with acholeplasma lentimicrobium and thiobacillus on the carrier and in the effluent 3 6 overloading of ethanol stimulated the shift of microbial communities in sulfate reducing reactor fbr2 and sulfide oxidizing reactor sor in stage iii the fbr1 effluent was treated in fbr2 to remove the residual sulfate followed by excess dissolved sulfide oxidation in the subsequent sor based on pca analysis the bacterial communities in fbr2 carrier fbr2 effluent and sor effluent were distinct from each other fig 6 suggesting different communities were responsible for sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation the results also suggested that overloading electron donor here ethanol to the fbr2 during days 44 55 fig 8 caused a notable shift in the microbial community compositions of both the carrier biomass and the effluent biomass over this ethanol overloading period when ethanol sulfate molar ratio was 1 acetate accumulation was detected in the fbr2 fig 8e suggesting the paucity of acetate oxidizers 54 on day 0 of fbr2 operation srb mainly consisted of desulfovibrio 27 5 1 7 relative abundance desulfomicrobium 1 4 0 0 desulfarculus 1 2 1 2 desulfobacca 1 and desulfotomaculum 1 on the carrier fig 7a and desulfovibrio 8 4 0 1 in the effluent fig 7b on day 55 with the increase of ethanol dosing the relative abundances of members from genera desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio and desulfuromonas increased to 4 5 0 3 36 6 2 3 and 2 8 0 3 on carrier and members of desulfomicrobium were enriched 6 2 0 4 in the effluent fig 7a b resulting in the increase of srb relative abundance from 31 6 to 44 7 on the carrier and from 8 4 to 12 4 in the effluent the increase of srb population stimulated by the increased ethanol dosing may be responsible for the increase of sulfate removal efficiency in the fbr2 from 63 to 73 fig 8c alkalinity produced in the complete oxidation of ethanol in the fbr2 maintained the reactor ph at approximately 7 8 in both the fbr2 and the sor fig 8f g due to the high redox potential 100 mv in the sor srb members originated from fbr2 were outcompeted by sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob fig 8h the major sob on day 0 included azonexus 49 1 3 7 paracoccus 10 3 1 1 and thiobacillus 9 9 1 1 fig 7c which may contribute to hydrogen sulfide oxidation the overall average dissolved sulfide removal efficiency was 90 in the sor fig 8b 55 56 on day 55 the overall sulfate removal of the integrated process increased from 53 to 62 as less sulfate was regenerated from the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide or sulfur in the sor fig 8c meanwhile acetate consumption in the sor was increased from 6 09 mm to 15 02 mm fig 8e which was accompanied by the enrichment of bacteria from genera acholeplasma 22 5 0 2 geobacter 10 0 1 8 and proteiniphilum 1 fig 7c in the sor the enrichment of these bacteria may have led to the outcompetition of azonexus the relative abundance of which decreased to below 1 on day 55 according to literature acholeplasma genus has been suggested to have the ability to reduce sulfate produced in the system and to oxidize dissolved sulfide to sulfur 57 58 which could explain why the genus was detected in both the fbr2 and the sor geobacter sulfurreducens can grow with acetate oxidation using oxygen as the sole electron acceptor at concentrations of 10 or less in the headspace 59 wu et al 60 suggested that cytochrome bd encoded in proteiniphilum genus may periodically perform aerobic respiration to degrade the volatile fatty acids during anaerobic fermentation therefore geobacter and proteiniphilumin may be helpful in sor for reducing the overoxidation of hydrogen sulfide or sulfur through acetate oxidation coupled with oxygen consumption overall the sulfate reducing and sulfide oxidizing consortia in the fbr2 and the sor respectively could be readily used for the sulfate reduction and dissolved sulfide oxidation 29 3 7 implications of the findings the use of orp feedback control by ethanol dosing was previously successfully demonstrated to facilitate selenate nitrate and sulfate removal from wastewater in a two stage fbr process which also enabled the recovery of high purity elemental se without ses formation 29 30 however the optimization of this promising treatment requires knowledge on the microbial community dynamics and the relationship between microbial community composition and process performance based on reactor performance and results from high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing this study for the first time demonstrated that selenate reducers i e geoalkalibacter and geovibrio mainly preferred to live in fbr1 biofilm while nitrate reducers i e caenispirillum and paracoccus were mainly in suspension selenate reducers were impacted at orp setpoint higher than 360 mv in the absence of sulfate or at orp setpoint higher than 440 mv in the presence of sulfate however nitrate reducers were not impacted by the changes of orp setpoint and removed 100 of nitrate both nitrate and selenate reducers could withstand elevated sulfate concentrations in fbr1 at optimal orp setpoint of 480 mv both microbial groups were active enabling sequential oxyanions removal and elemental se recovery from wastewater for biological sulfate removal the presence of srb in the fbr2 and sulfide oxidizing bacteria in a subsequent sor enabled the sequential removal of sulfate and dissolved sulfide however the interpretation of metabolic pathways in two stage biological process requires the investigation of key functional genes related to the reduction of oxyanions 6 61 therefore further study should aim to characterize the key function genes in the bioreactor process and evaluate the effect of redox potential and elevated sulfate concentrations on the expression of key genes 4 conclusions dynamic changes of microbial communities both on the biomass carrier and in the effluent of the fbr1 during the treatment of wastewater containing selenate nitrate and sulfate were successfully characterized at various orp setpoints high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis indicated that high redox condition orp 360 mv without sulfate in stage i and orp 440 mv with sulfate in stage ii and elevated sulfate at orp set points 480 mv stage iii in the fbr1 impacted alpha diversity indicating a shift of microbial communities both on the carrier and in the effluent the microbial communities in the fbr1 were mainly composed of selenate reducing bacteria geoalkalibacter and geovibrio nitrate reducing bacteria caenispirillum and paracoccus and a small fraction of fermenting bacteria soehngenia selenate reducers were negatively impacted by high redox potential at orp setpoints of 360 mv in stage i and 440 mv in stage ii whereas nitrate reducers showed the opposite response to redox changes the apparent changes in the relative abundance of these microbial groups at high orp setpoints in stages i ii likely accounted for the corresponding decrease of selenate removal efficiency in the fbr1 the abundance of nitrate reducers in the fbr1 was consistent with the near 100 removal of nitrate throughout the fbr1 process selenate reducers were quickly enriched in the fbr1 at orp 480 mv after the shortage of electron donor the srb detected in the sulfate reducing fbr2 mainly included desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio and desulfuromonas genera whereas the dominant sob in the sor were members of the paracoccus thiobacillus and acholeplasma genera declaration of competing interest the authors declare
