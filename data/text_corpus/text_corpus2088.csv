10440,no till management systems tend to cause soil compaction in the early years of their establishment soil compaction reduces crop production due to restrictions on root development management strategies combining crop rotation and soil conservation practices still need to be researched as potential strategies to mitigate no till soil physical constraints in tropical regions with prolonged drought periods and still promote agricultural sustainability the objective of this study was to determine if soil specific management could mitigate early stage no till compaction and improve least limiting water range in a rhodic ferralsol we hypothesized that no till cropping systems with concomitant conservation practices soil fertilization crop rotation and intercropped brachiaria grass would improve soil physical quality spq and still achieve high crop yields in a tropical region with dry winters and frequent dry spells during wet season six no till cropping systems were tested soybean monoculture t1 corn monoculture t2 corn and soybean rotation t3 corn and soybean rotation with intercropped brachiaria t4 and two more with increased fertilization corn and soybean rotation with intercropped brachiaria t5 and corn and soybean rotation t6 least limiting water range llwr was used as an indicator of spq llwr is computed as a function of bulk density bd and it is defined as the range of soil water content in which physical constraints to plant growth are at minimal its critical limits are water contents associated with field capacity and air filled porosity upper limits along with wilting point and soil resistance lower limits for each bd there is a llwr value the span between the upper limit and the lower limit an adaptation of llwr in which we substituted the wilting point by the critical water content θ was also tested llwr critical bd bdc value was 1 30 mg m 3 for llwr and llwr in monoculture treatments t1 and t2 the maximum bd values exceeded the bdc llwr llwr 0 and negatively correlated with crop yield alternatively cropping systems with diverse crop rotation corn soybean brachiaria showed greater values of llwr and llwr and less soil compaction than monoculture systems usage of llwr evinced water stress was the main limiting plant growth factor viz θ was more limiting than mechanical resistance and deficient aeration these results support the hypothesis that the use of soil conservation practices and crop rotation during initial years of no till farming contributes favorably to spq without compromising crop production keywords grain production intercropped brachiaria crop rotation available water tropical region with characteristic dry periods 1 introduction soil physical limitations can impact crop yield negatively during the early stages of implementing no till farming systems büchi et al 2017 derpsch et al 2014 pittelkow et al 2015 soil compaction due to former and ongoing machinery traffic is the main cause of poor soil physical quality tormena et al 2017 letey 1985 first approached soil physical quality spq for agricultural purposes based on the water availability for plants silva et al 1994 introduced the least limiting water range llwr to quantify model and estimate the range of soil water content associated to minimal spq limitations for plant growth llwr takes into account the concomitant effects of aeration porosity ap mechanical resistance to root penetration penetration resistance pr and plant available water capacity pawc these properties are modeled as a function of bulk density allowing prediction and interpretation concerning soil management in addition to spq llwr has been cited in a recent review paper as a soil function indicator for biomass production rabot et al 2018 although silva and kay 1996 presented significant correlation between llwr and plant growth other authors reported llwr did not assess the minimal soil physical limitations for plant growth and crop yield benjamin et al 2003 cecagno et al 2016 gubiani et al 2013 olibone et al 2010 revamped llwr included adjustments to make it more accurate asgarzadeh et al 2011 mohammadi et al 2010 silva et al 2015 and applicable to plant growth and crop production silva et al 2015 replaced the permanent wilting point pwp as the lower limit of the llwr when calculating the pawc by the critical water content θ identifying this alternative range as llwr for a perennial crop coffee in southeastern brazil this llwr resulted however in a smaller estimate of the plant readily available water in the soil compared to that of llwr silva et al 2015 the rationale for this adjustment is that plants experience severe water stress damage before soil water content equals pwp whereas θ is the soil water content at which plants experience a decrease in stomata opening and could cause restricted plant growth eitzinger et al 2004 silva et al 2015 de jong van lier 1997 therefore llwr is dependent on plant physiological characteristics however there is a total lack of information in literature regarding llwr for cropping systems e g soybean and corn in tropical regions furthermore to achieve high crop yields and promote agricultural sustainability in regions with characteristic dry periods it has been shown that no till management systems must include crop rotation and soil cover with plant residue pittelkow et al 2015 in the brazilian cerrado neotropical savanna a region with a prolonged dry season in winter and frequent occurrence of short periods of drought in the warm rainy season plant residue rapidly decomposes reducing the deposition of straw borghi et al 2013 crusciol et al 2014 abrahao and costa 2018 moreover in regions like central minas gerais brazil it is difficult to grow a second crop during winter because of water scarcity therefore adequate soil cover cannot be achieved increased soil cover and improved soil quality positively impact soil moisture conservation and biomass production leading to increased crop yields pittelkow et al 2015 no till management systems can improve spq but further studies on complementary practices that can improve soil properties are still needed blanco canqui and ruis 2018 although highly site and weather specific different soil conservation practices i e cover crop complementary soil amendments physical conditioning applied together as a conservation farming system can improve soil physical properties and reduce plant water stress silva et al 2019 in addition to crop rotation the introduction of intercropped perennial grass species such as brachiaria urochloa spp along with crops such as corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l and rice oryza sativa l seems to be a key strategy to increase duration of residue cover on the soil crusciol et al 2014 2012 borghi et al 2013 pariz et al 2016 2017 silva et al 2019 this has shown to be beneficial for improving the spq as water loss is reduced due to low evaporation and improved infiltration rates unger and vigil 1998 argenton et al 2005 brachiaria radicular systems are known for promoting pore formation and organic matter accumulation reducing soil compaction and increasing llwr calonego et al 2011 pariz et al 2017 2016 improving soil fertility and increasing crop yield balbinot et al 2017 crusciol et al 2015 ferralsols are the largely dominant soil classes in brazilian cerrado they tend to have substantial contents of gibbsite in the clay fraction as a result of intense and prolonged weathering leaching processes excessive drainage and low pawc or llwr are common in these soils due to their granular structure lack of mesopores and large amount of macropores ferreira et al 1999 silva et al 2014 2015 therefore an increase in water availability and spq is essential to achieve high crop yields which conservation management systems aim to attain benjamin et al 2003 silva and kay 1996 silva et al 2019 long term no till positive impact on llwr has been reported chen et al 2014 crusciol et al 2014 müller et al 2001 tormena et al 2007 williams and weil 2004 nevertheless in short term no till with chronic historic compaction of degraded soils still needs to be addressed blanco canqui and ruis 2018 thus we hypothesized that concomitant soil conservation practices such as crop rotation soybean and corn and intercropped perennial grass urochloa spp would improve spq during the early stages of implementing no till farming systems and still achieve high crop yields in a tropical region with dry winters and frequent dry spells during wet season estimates for llwr and llwr were computed in order to achieve the following objectives 1 to determine if the spq and soil fertility are improved when soil conservation practices are used during no till farming early stages 2 to identify the most limiting soil physical property for plant development and crop yields θpwp θ or pr and 3 to correlate soil properties and crop yields in the first two years of no till under different crop management systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil description the experiment was conducted at sete lagoas municipality central region of the state of minas gerais brazil 19 28 30 s 44 15 08 w according to köppen climate classification köppen 1918 the climate is classified as humid subtropical cwa with an annual average temperature of 22 1 c and annual rainfall of 1 382 7 mm alvares et al 2013 the characteristic dry season occurs from may to october mainly during fall and winter occurrence of short periods of drought during rainy season in the experimental area are frequent this impedes the planting of a second crop the soil is classified as rhodic ferralsol fao wrb 2014 or typic haplustox soil survey staff 2014 presenting gibbsitic mineralogy the soil particle size distribution encompasses 690 g kg 1 of clay 0 002 mm 120 g kg 1 of silt 0 002 0 05 mm and 190 g kg 1 of sand 0 05 2 mm before experimental set up the area has been in use for corn and soybean cultivation under conventional tillage for 20 years according to information obtained from indigenous stakeholders consultation with farm managers soil sampling for chemical characterization and preparation of the soil occurred during the dry season of 2014 from july to october soil amendment and fertilizer requirements were calculated in accordance to sousa and lobato 2004 based on the chemical characterization of the soil surface layer 20 cm depth sampled in july 2014 table 1 the soil was prepared with a subsoiler to a depth of 0 35 m aiming to minimize negative effects of compaction that could restrict root penetration and to mix any possible remnant of amendments and fertilizers throughout the entire soil layer soil acidity correction followed with the application of 4 t ha 1 of dolomitic limestone over the total area which was incorporated by two harrowing operations amending the soil was completed by the application of 3 t ha 1 of agricultural gypsum nutrients were supplied to the soil by the application of fertilizers at rates of 306 kg ha 1 93 kg ha 1 and 1 1 t ha 1 of potassium chloride fte br12 micronutrients and superphosphate respectively gypsum and fertilizers were applied together and were incorporated into the soil by harrowing to ensure all treatments had equal initial conditions 2 2 cropping systems treatments resulted in six combinations of individual or brachiaria consorted cropping systems corn or soybean with or without crop rotation and two levels of improved soil fertility table 2 fertilizer rates were determined by meeting full high or partial medium plant nutritional needs based on the demands for high yields of corn or soybean resende et al 2016 in order to provide enough area for in situ soil sampling and determining crop productivity throughout the experiment duration 2014 2016 and future long time evaluations each of the six treatments occupied a 0 5 ha experimental area thus a completely randomized design was adopted considering georeferenced locations chosen at random sampling points within each treatment as replicates fig 1 as recommended by ferreira et al 2012 for field experiments with one experimental block this statistical methodology has been successfully used in prior studies shukla and lal 2005 cecagno et al 2016 peixoto et al 2019 with similar restrictions for additional randomized blocks and long term experimental set ups seeds were sowed in december of each year right after the beginning of the rainy season for treatments t4 and t5 the seeds of brachiaria species urochloa ruziziensis were sown at a rate of 4 kg ha 1 varying the time of planting according to the consorted crop when consorted with corn brachiaria seeds were mixed together with fertilizers and sown into the soil using a precision seeder fertilizer spreader at the crop line meanwhile when consorted with soybean a mechanical broadcast seeder was used for brachiaria seeds this occurred when soybean plants reached the r5 growth stage as described by andrade et al 2017 fertilizers were applied at the time of sowing table 3 shows the n p2o5 and k2o rates apllied for each treatment based on the crop nutrient requirements additionally for cropping systems in which corn was planted urea was the form of n fertilizer applied for medium level of improved soil fertility treatments t2 t3 and t4 155 kg ha 1 of urea were applied corresponding to 70 kg ha 1 of n in a similar manner in high level n fertilization treatments t5 and t6 200 kg ha 1 of urea were applied equivalent to 90 kg ha 1 of n in july 2015 for the evaluation of the first year under different cropping systems undisturbed soil samples were taken for bulk density bd determination three randomly and georeferenced locations were chosen per treatment and soil was sampled at depths of 0 00 0 05 m and 0 15 0 20 m bd was also measured using the undisturbed soil samples 0 027 m of height and 0 065 m of diameter collected for llwr determination as described in section 2 3 lastly soil samples for chemical characterization were collected from the top 20 cm soil layer within each treatment plot in november 2016 the results of the chemical analyses of the soil after two years of no till farming under different cropping systems are shown for each treatment in table 4 moreover the number of plants for each crop seed treatments herbicide and pesticide application rates as well as disease control practices followed the recommendations for no tillage farming systems in brazil resende et al 2016 2 3 determination of the least limiting water range llwr regarding the least limiting water range llwr determination soil sampling was carried out in march 2016 for the evaluation of the first two years under no till farming previous tests using an impact penetrometer showed that the top 5 cm layer and the subsurface layer from a depth of 0 15 0 20 m presented the highest penetration resistance pr values therefore seven undisturbed soil samples were taken at each depth of interest 0 00 0 05 m and 0 15 0 20 m for every treatment in rings 0 027 m of height and 0 065 m of diameter at three randomly chosen and georeferenced locations to determine hydro physical properties of each of the two soil layers this sampling methodology totaled 21 samples per treatment for each depth which equals to 252 samples the undisturbed samples 0 027 m of height and 0 065 m of diameter were randomly classified into seven batches each batch of samples was equilibrated at one of the seven different matric potentials 4 kpa 6 kpa 10 kpa in an automated suction plate module brand ecotech model pf 33 kpa 100 kpa 500 kpa and 1500 kpa on the porous plates in a richards pressure chamber silva et al 1994 2015 2019 after reaching water equilibrium at each potential the samples were weighed and the soil penetration resistance pr was determined using a digital electronic penetrometer brand stable micro systems model texture analyser xt with a straight cylindrical cone type probe 30 angle 4 mm diameter at a constant speed of 10 mm min 1 silva et al 2015 2019 afterwards the samples were oven dried at 105 c until they reached constant weight for determining the soil water content θ and bulk density bd using the measured data of all samples nonlinear models were developed for water retention eq 1 and pr eq 2 as affected by bd busscher 1990 serafim et al 2013 silva et al 2015 2019 the model coefficients were obtained by minimizing squared deviations between measured and computed values leão and silva 2004 1 θ a ψ b b d c 2 p r d θ e b d f where θ is the soil water content m3 m 3 ψ is the soil water potential kpa pr is the penetration resistance mpa bd is the bulk density mg m 3 and a b c are fitting parameters of eq 1 whereas d e f are fitting parameters of eq 2 llwr determination followed the methodology recommended by silva et al 1994 and leão and da silva 2004 critical limits were water content at field capacity θfc estimated by the equilibrium water content at 6 kpa in eq 1 silva et al 2014 2015 2019 which proved to be a more accurate way to appraise θfc for ferralsols with gibbsitic mineralogy instead of using worldwide criteria of 10 or 33 kpa according to ferreira and marcos 1983 who validated this aspect in the field water content at permanent wilting point θpwp estimated by eq 1 considering soil water potential of 1500 kpa savage et al 1996 water content for an air filled porosity θap of 0 10 m3 m 3 calculated by eq 3 grable and siemer 1968 water content at a critical pr value of 2 0 mpa θpr estimated by eq 4 this root growth limiting pr value may well agree with the hydro physical restrictions of the upper soil layer during the early stages of no tillage farming as reported in the literature for corn and soybean bengough et al 2011 bengough and mullins 1990 klein and camara 2007 de moraes et al 2014 llwr was calculated as the difference between the upper limit and the lower limit for each bd the upper limit is the drier water content of either θfc or θap whereas the lower limit is the wetter water content of either θpwp or θpr silva et al 1994 3 θ a p 1 b d d p 0 1 4 θ p r p r d b d f 1 e where dp 2 65 mg m 3 is the average particle density value according to embrapa 2011 d e f are the exact same fitting parameters as in eq 2 it has been shown by carducci et al 2011 and silva et al 2014 2015 2019 that ferralsols from the brazilian neotropical savanna present limited plant available water even before reaching θpwp this causes irreversible plant impairment and threatens crop production denmead and shaw 1962 allen et al 1998 eitzinger et al 2004 the critical moisture θ has proved to be a more accurate estimate than θpwp to determine the water readily available for plants under these climate and soil environment silva et al 2015 2019 this is the soil water content m3 m 3 at which plant transpiration is reduced however its impact on plant growth and crop productivity due to water stress is not significant doorenbos and kassan 1979 allen et al 1998 van den berg and driessen 2002 assuming a crop standardized evapotranspiration demand of 4 mm day 1 allen et al 1998 an evapotranspiration depletion factor of p 0 55 was computed eq 5 and used to calculate θ eq 6 5 θ f c θ p θ f c θ p w p 6 θ a 6 b p 6 b 1500 b b d c where θ is the critical moisture m3 m 3 p is the evapotranspiration depletion factor bd is the bulk density mg m 3 and a b c are the same fitting parameters as in eq 1 determination of the llwr followed the same methodology presented by silva et al 2015 2019 following eq 7 for each bd measurements of water content were plotted as a function of bd for each depth allowing to analyze water availability and infer water stress while identifying the soil depth of occurrence 7 llwr ul ll where ul is the upper limit considered the smallest value between θap and θfc and ll is the lower limit the highest value between θpr and θ 2 4 relationships of soil physico chemical attributes and crop production the field yield fy was estimated for each treatment annually the mature corn ears or soybean pods enclosed in a 4 5 m2 area equivalent to 3 rows of a 3 m length each were manually harvested at three different georeferenced locations within each treatment these locations were chosen adjacent or proximal to the spq sampling area subsequently the grain weight was measured and fy per hectare was estimated considering 130 g kg 1 wet basis fischer 2015 data were then grouped by crop considering each of the two years of harvest to analyze their relationships with soil physical attributes furthermore relative yield ry was calculated as the ratio in percent of fy to potential yield py of each cultivated crop by adapting methodologies suggested by de ponti et al 2012 and borghi et al 2013 py estimation was considered to be the highest yield measured among all the treatments as a simplified definition explained by evans and fischer 1999 and fischer 2015 for corn py was 13 638 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 10 362 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 meanwhile for soybean py was 4022 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 3118 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 finally relative cropping system yield rcy was calculated by treatment as the mean value of the two ry and it was expressed as a percentage as well data were then grouped by cropping system to analyze their relationships with soil physico chemical attributes benjamin et al 2003 gubiani et al 2013 correlations of soil physical attributes and yield data were determined at depths of 0 5 cm and 15 20 cm fy data were correlated with mean bulk density bdmean llwr and llwr as functions of bdmean benjamin et al 2003 gathala et al 2011 verma and sharma 2008 maximum bulk density bdmax llwr and llwr as functions of bdmax ratio of bdmean to critical bd bdmean bdc ratio of bdmax to critical bd bdmax bdc as recommended by cecagno et al 2016 in a similar manner rcy data were revised for any correlation with relevant chemical attributes 2 5 statistical analyses the fitting parameters a b c d e and f of llwr and llwr nonlinear models were calculated by minimizing the sum of squared differences between determined values and those estimated by the models spreadsheet algorithms were used as indicated in the literature leão and da silva 2004 safadoust et al 2014 silva et al 2015 accuracy of the models was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r² and root mean square error rmse of the determined values and those estimated by the models chen et al 2014 safadoust et al 2014 silva et al 2015 descriptive statistics were performed on the entire data set and llwr was plotted as a function of bd silva et al 1994 silva et al 2015 2019 the relationships between yield and soil attributes were evaluated by pearson s linear correlation 3 results 3 1 wrc and prc models the bulk density bd and penetration resistance pr values at the 0 5 cm depth ranged from 0 85 mg m 3 to 1 35 mg m 3 cv 8 37 and from 0 15 mpa to 5 27 mpa cv 83 4 respectively the models of the water retention curve wrc and the penetration resistance curve prc for this soil depth were ө 0 4496 ψ0 084501 bd0 7444 and pr 0 0031 θ 4 9766 bd7 4321 likewise results for bd and pr at 15 20 cm depth ranged from 0 90 mg m 3 to 1 39 mg m 3 cv 7 60 and from 0 167 mpa to 5 71 mpa cv 89 2 respectively moreover the models of wrc and prc at this depth were ө 0 4445 ψ 0 082 bd0 7299 and pr 0 0029 θ 5 01 bd 7 5055 adjustment parameters are shown in table 5 similar results were observed for bd and pr at both depths being pr data with higher cv 3 2 mechanical and aeration constraints on soil water availability as modeled by llwr and llwr physical limitations were observed at both soil depths in the form of mechanical and aeration constraints results for llwr and llwr are presented in fig 2 depth of 0 5 cm and fig 3 depth of 15 20 cm contrasting these two models colored area at both depths the less limiting water conditions were better predicted when using θ instead of θpwp at bd values below 1 19 mg m 3 this means water stress in the form of reduced transpiration is more limiting for plants narrowed the llwr than poor root development or permanent impairment due to wilting nevertheless at bd values above 1 19 mg m 3 the boundary conditions are θap as upper limit and θpr as lower limit for both llwr and llwr which may suggest deteriorated spq due to soil compaction i e other physical parameters became more plant growth limiting than water since θap becomes the upper critical limit of llwr and llwr only at bd values greater than 1 19 mg m 3 fig 2a soil aeration porosity is a less relevant limiting constraint than mechanical hydric and physiological conditions at low bd values at 0 5 cm depth available water content decreased for llwr as bd values increased fig 2b regarding the data computed for lower limits θpr is more limiting than θpwp for llwr however for llwr θ was chosen as lower boundary according to computed values when contrasted with θpr at bd values below 1 18 mg m 3 thus the soil water content range considered optimal for plants increases up to 1 18 mg m 3 and then it decreases critical bulk density bdc was estimated by both models at 1 30 mg m 3 corresponding to the bd value where θap and θpr converged therefore bd values greater than bdc implies severe constraint to root development due to soil compaction similar results were observed at the soil depth of 15 20 cm θfc was consistently the upper limit of llwr and llwr up to bd value of 1 20 mg m 3 henceforth θap became the most restrictive condition for plant development fig 3a likewise θpr was invariably less limiting than θpwp for llwr meanwhile θ was less limiting than θpr for llwr up to bd value of 1 17 mg m 3 θap and θpr lines converged simultaneously for llwr and llwr to reveal the bdc value at 1 30 mg m 3 fig 3b differences among soil depths are very subtle when contrasting the results e g bdc revealed the same value at both depths deteriorated spq negatively impacts plant development and crop productivity at denser conditions due to soil compaction regardless of the depth direct comparison of llwr amplitude by depth indicated 5 5 more available water content at depth of 0 5 cm 0 109 m3 m 3 in relation to depth of 15 20 cm 0 103 m3 m 3 meanwhile contrasting llwr amplitude by soil depth showed 16 1 less available water content at the depth of 0 5 cm 0 087 m3 m 3 as compared to that at the depth of 15 20 cm 0 101 m3 m 3 these findings suggest that θ agrees better with the less limiting conditions for plant development than θpmp viz θpmp became an irrelevant water content in both llwr models furthermore llwr seems to better predict the optimum water content range for crop productivity in order to avoid plant impairment due to water stress or poorly developed root systems consequently llwr seems to be a better indicator of spq than llwr 3 3 effects of cropping systems on llwr and llwr mean bulk density bdmean values of undisturbed samples collected in july 2015 and march 2016 were entered by treatment into the llwr models introduced in section 3 2 bdmean values showed an average increment of 5 from 2015 2016 regardless of the cropping system this was expected as machine traffic tends to cause soil compaction under no tillage management systems results showed that computed llwr values as a function of bdmean were always less than those of llwr table 6 this was due to the llwr model assuming θ as a less limiting water content for plant physiological development instead of θpr or θpwp being θ θpr θpwp for the cultivars evaluated and bulk density values up to 1 17 mg m 3 decreases in computed llwr values by treatment were observed when contrasting llwr values for bdmean of july 2015 and march 2016 at both soil depths except for t3 at depth of 15 20 cm table 6 conversely llwr values remained the same or increased from year 2015 2016 at both soil depths table 6 furthermore bdmean values by treatment were smaller than bdc values for both years these results suggest that the overall crop production was not compromised towards the end of the second year under various no tillage management systems due to the large variability in bd values within treatments llwr and llwr were computed as a function of the maximum bulk density bdmax values measured by treatment table 7 average bdmax values for depth of 0 5 cm showed an increment of 12 1 from 2015 2016 the worst cases of soil compaction were found at t1 and t2 the soil was denser by 19 1 and 17 4 between 2015 2016 bdmax values for treatments t1 and t2 were greater than bdc meanwhile for soil depth of 15 20 cm average bdmax values showed an increment of 13 2 from 2015 2016 the worst case scenario among all cropping systems was registered at t2 with bdmax 1 39 mg m 3 these results corresponded to possible plant injury as a consequence of mechanical and aeration constraints around proximal areas where soil sampling took place as presented in figs 2 and 3 there is a portion in the graphs of llwr and llwr where the upper and lower boundaries were exactly the same for both models thus results for year 2016 of computed llwr and llwr tended to be very close or equal to each other when contrasting them by treatment except for t4 and t5 at the depth of 0 5 cm table 7 this is because as bd values increased the most limiting parameters became θpr and θap indicating that mechanical and aeration constraints for plant development were present for year 2015 computed llwr values were always less than those of llwr table 7 this was due to the fact that bdmax values for all treatments were less than 1 17 mg m 3 3 4 correlations between soil attributes and crop yield data crop yield data for cropping systems are presented in fig 4 in the form of rcy rcy data did not show significant differences among treatments correlations between ry and physical parameters were only significant for bdmax values for both crops at a 10 significance level table 8 because bdc value was 1 30 mg m 3 for llwr and llwr at both soil depths it became meaningless to analyze the correlation between crop yield data and the ratios of bdmax or bdmean to bdc thus negative correlation between ry and bdmax table 8 indicated large values of bdmax table 7 indeed impacted negatively on crop production this confirmed that localized spots of soil with high bd values observed in monoculture treatments led to mechanical and aeration constraints that reduced crop yield furthermore llwrmax values at the soil depth of 15 20 cm showed positive correlation at a 5 significance level for soybean ry however this may have been coincidental since no trend could be identified regarding soil chemical attributes neither significant correlations were observed between rcy and soc nor between rcy and bs fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 llwr models for soil layers with restrictive physical conditions for plant roots models for llwr and llwr values figs 2 and 3 indicated that soil physical limitations for plant growth were found in very clayey tropical soils with granular structure as the soil studied θcc upper and θpmp lower are usually the boundaries for llwr values this indicates that there are few or null mechanical or aeration constraints for plant development in such soils ferreira et al 2017 severiano et al 2011 silva et al 2015 2019 however in this study the llwr showed mechanical restrictions over the entire range of bd values meanwhile llwr indicated that water stress in the form of θ was a less limiting condition than mechanical restriction at least up to a bd value of 1 17 mg m 3 furthermore soil classes with different textures and under other management systems have shown similar results in which mechanical constraints θpr were the lower boundary of llwr benjamin et al 2003 cecagno et al 2016 tormena et al 2017 2007 1999 however none of these referred authors compared different levels of water stress i e θ versus θpmp in this work θ was indeed the most limiting condition for plant development at llwr and θpmp turned irrelevant due to increased compaction of the soil at llwr as compaction increased pr reached a critical value for root development of 2 mpa bengough et al 2011 safadoust et al 2014 silva et al 1994 the limited growth of radicular systems resulted in reduced crop production for all treatments regardless of the adequate nutrient availability fig 4 attenuation of critical pr value should be expected if continued no till based management systems remain in this area former studies have demonstrated that continuous neomacropores developed by plant roots and soil fauna serve as biopores for soil aeration thus facilitating root development of subsequent crops huang et al 2015 papadopoulos et al 2014 williams and weil 2004 tormena et al 2017 intercropped brachiaria also improves soil structure and spq borghi et al 2013 calonego et al 2017 crusciol et al 2014 2012 pariz et al 2017 possibly as consequences of increments in soil porosity and organic matter content concerning aeration limitations reduced porosity at bd values greater than 1 20 mg m 3 means that there were limitations for oxygen diffusion as bd value approached and surpassed bdc grable and siemer 1968 research has shown that very clayey ferralsols with granular structure such as the studied soil present high macroporosity and consequent rapid drainage attributes thus aeration porosity is never more limiting than mechanical resistance silva et al 2014 cecagno et al 2016 in contrast for poorly drained soils lapen et al 2004 observed that aeration restriction was greater than mechanical constraints as a result reduced corn yield was observed lapen et al 2004 it has extensively been documented that reduced spq occurs at poorly drained soils soil pores are blocked and aggregates become less stable as oxides are reduced and soil organic matter is consumed under anaerobic conditions norton et al 1999 de campos et al 2012 the progressive increase and decrease of θpr and θap respectively as a function of bd resulted in the null value for llwr and llwr at bdc 1 30 mg m 3 and beyond that figs 2 and 3 this value was consistent with the bdc model for ferralsols from the cerrado biome brazil bdc 1 95 0 00095 clay where clay is in g kg 1 severiano et al 2011 resulting in 1 29 mg m 3 calculation of bdc using the model proposed by reichert et al 2009 bdc 1 83803 0 00078 clay where clay is in g kg 1 resulted in 1 30 mg m 3 bulk density values beyond bdc suggest poor spq since there are limiting physical conditions for plant development letey 1985 and decisions need to be made to reverse the soil compaction negative effects silva et al 1994 it should be noted that inclusion of θ did not signify a change in the estimation of bdc however θ agrees better with the less limiting conditions for plant development than θpmp furthermore llwr seems to better predict the optimum water content range to avoid plant impairment due to water stress or poorly developed root systems silva et al 2015 2019 it has been shown by other works that θ outside the upper and lower limits of llwr during the crop cycle impacts plant growth and potential productivity of the crop negatively silva et al 1994 silva and kay 1996 benjamin et al 2003 however for llwr the δθ between llwr and llwr could increase the probability of existing plant available water outside the llwr consequently llwr may be a better indicator of spq than llwr silva et al 2015 2019 nevertheless since this unestimated θ buffer may allow crops to overcome physical constrains without plant impairment more research should be conducted to better understand spq in tropical soils under no till management systems that include crop rotation and intercropped perennial grasses 4 2 effects of cropping systems on spq regarding the cropping systems evaluated in this work the use of crop rotation as well as intercropped brachiaria with corn or soybean resulted in lower values of θpr figs 2 and 3 these results are consistent with those reported by calonego et al 2011 they found that soil structure was improved and pr value was reduced when brachiaria was intercropped with corn for two consecutive years calonego et al 2011 conversely monoculture management systems t1 soybean and t2 corn presented the highest values for bdmean and bdmax which signified increased θpr this trend was observed at both soil depths and it became more evident towards the end of the second year under no tillage tables 6 and 7 bdmean and bdmax values during the first year did not show large differences among treatments due to residual effect of conventional soil preparation this was carried out to initialize the cropping systems which reduced the soil bd values by increasing soil porosity hamza and anderson 2005 stone and silveira 2001 meanwhile towards the end of the experiment bd values increased as machinery traffic caused soil compaction this has been observed to occur for clayey soils at depths down to 20 cm hamza and anderson 2005 nunes et al 2015 stone and silveira 2001 the negative effects of soil compaction were more noticeable at monoculture management systems as bdmax values tended to be proximal to or greater than the bdc value therefore monoculture management systems may induce more negative effects on spq than the other cropping systems e g intercropped brachiaria and crop rotation may alleviate soil compaction effects grasses with robust and strong root systems such as brachiaria can penetrate dense soil layers with large pr values calonego and rosolem 2011 forming neobiopores that favor water movement and gas diffusion in the soil williams and weil 2004 müller et al 2001 therefore they can act as alternative root channels for subsequent crops reducing the negative effects of soil compaction ajayi et al 2019 williams and weil 2004 pariz et al 2017 chen et al 2014 monoculture management systems t1 and t2 also presented values of llwr and llwr as a function of bdmax tending to or equal to zero at both soil depths towards the end of the experiment table 7 these results confirm that llwr and llwr were adequate indicators of deteriorated spq this could help farmers apply localized solutions to improve spq in problematic areas cropping systems that include crop rotation showed less soil compaction than monoculture management systems tables 6 and 7 furthermore greater values of llwr and llwr as a function of bdmax for t3 t4 t5 and t6 for year 2016 as compared to monoculture management systems are indicators of noticeable improved soil structure during the second year under no tillage despite treatments t4 and t5 with intercropped brachiaria did not present results significantly different in comparison to t3 and t6 it has been reported by other works that cropping systems with extra plant biomass input to the soil from cover crops contributes to increase soil organic matter content mishra et al 2015 to improve soil structure calonego et al 2011 and to promote pore reconfiguration favorable to soil water availability for plant roots olibone et al 2010 conversion of arable land to permanent grassland proved perennial grass capacity to promote substantial recovery of pore functions by improving air and water fluxes ajayi and horn 2016 long term research should be conducted to reinterpret intercropped brachiaria effects on spq 4 3 soil attributes and crop production we initially expected llwr and llwr amplitude values to correlate positively with crop production since an increase in θpr accounts for soil compaction negative effects on root penetration resistance however no correlation may indicate that critical pr values should be revised in future research gubiani et al 2013 tested llwr considering critical limits for pr values of 2 3 and 4 mpa they reported significant changes in llwr however there was no correlation between llwr and corn yield tavares filho et al 2001 demonstrated that pr values above 3 5 mpa in long term no till management systems influenced only corn plant morphology meanwhile it did not limit roots growth and grains yield tavares filho et al 2001 beutler and centurion 2003 observed reduction of soybean yield at pr values between 1 66 and 2 22 mpa similar to the adopted pr values for this study beutler et al 2007 also observed reduced soybean yield when the pr value was above 1 30 mpa and the bd value was 1 26 mg m 3 in a clayey ferralsol thus definition of critical pr value in eq 4 may have been crop dependent and consequently llwr and llwr did not correlate neither with ry nor with rcy considering that corn is very sensitive to dry spells in critical stages of crop development bergamaschi et al 2006 and because the study area is characterized by frequent dry periods throughout the year even during the rainy seasons it is possible that rainfall distribution during the study period affected corn production negatively regardless of the treatment this could also have hidden any possible correlation between rcy and physico chemical soil attributes the ferralsol of the study area although very clayey is excessively drained due to its granular structure a reflex of the gibbsitic mineralogy which implies much less water storage for plants silva et al 2019 regarding soil chemical attributes contrasting initial table 1 and final table 4 conditions there were improvements due to the application of soil amendments and fertilizers however there were imperceptible differences among treatments at the end of the experiment table 4 thus chemical attributes as affected by soil fertilization and amendment application had less impact on crop yield during the first two years under no tillage than spq viz no correlations were observed between rcy and bs or soc content fig 5 therefore results suggested soil compaction was the most limiting factor to crop production regardless of adequate nutrient availability i e increased bulk density values due to soil compaction restrained root growth and plant development regardless of the level of fertilization the presence of a compacted layer increases pr values restricts soil water movement kuncoro et al 2014 and reduces aeration porosity and soil aeration mentges et al 2016 these factors impact negatively on plant growth letey 1985 and crop production benjamin et al 2003 therefore farmers need to take actions on best management practices to increase crop production and to improve spq 5 conclusions enhancing knowledge regarding physical properties of a ferralsol during early stages of no till cropping systems proved to be relevant the θ was the most limiting condition for plant physiological development up to a bd value of 1 17 mg m 3 as soil became increasingly compact the mechanical resistance became the most limiting parameter for plants development regardless of the level of fertilization therefore nutrient availability and chemical properties had less impact on crop yield than spq monoculture management systems presented compaction issues bd values greater than the bdc of 1 30 mg m 3 llwr llwr 0 promoted soil physical constraints for appropriate plants development llwr and llwr can play as indicators of problematic areas in which deteriorated spq could limit crop production cropping systems with crop rotation and intercropped brachiaria proved to be favorable for spq at the second year of no till farming of this very clayey gibbsitic ferralsol previously soil compaction effects due to farm machinery common in no till early stages were attenuated by these concomitant best management practices these results are relevant for annual crop farming operations in regions with characteristic long dry season and dry spells during the rainy season conditions that are largely dominant in the brazilian cerrado biome soil physical constraints for plants growth can be overcome during the first years of no tillage without compromising grains production declaration of

10440,no till management systems tend to cause soil compaction in the early years of their establishment soil compaction reduces crop production due to restrictions on root development management strategies combining crop rotation and soil conservation practices still need to be researched as potential strategies to mitigate no till soil physical constraints in tropical regions with prolonged drought periods and still promote agricultural sustainability the objective of this study was to determine if soil specific management could mitigate early stage no till compaction and improve least limiting water range in a rhodic ferralsol we hypothesized that no till cropping systems with concomitant conservation practices soil fertilization crop rotation and intercropped brachiaria grass would improve soil physical quality spq and still achieve high crop yields in a tropical region with dry winters and frequent dry spells during wet season six no till cropping systems were tested soybean monoculture t1 corn monoculture t2 corn and soybean rotation t3 corn and soybean rotation with intercropped brachiaria t4 and two more with increased fertilization corn and soybean rotation with intercropped brachiaria t5 and corn and soybean rotation t6 least limiting water range llwr was used as an indicator of spq llwr is computed as a function of bulk density bd and it is defined as the range of soil water content in which physical constraints to plant growth are at minimal its critical limits are water contents associated with field capacity and air filled porosity upper limits along with wilting point and soil resistance lower limits for each bd there is a llwr value the span between the upper limit and the lower limit an adaptation of llwr in which we substituted the wilting point by the critical water content θ was also tested llwr critical bd bdc value was 1 30 mg m 3 for llwr and llwr in monoculture treatments t1 and t2 the maximum bd values exceeded the bdc llwr llwr 0 and negatively correlated with crop yield alternatively cropping systems with diverse crop rotation corn soybean brachiaria showed greater values of llwr and llwr and less soil compaction than monoculture systems usage of llwr evinced water stress was the main limiting plant growth factor viz θ was more limiting than mechanical resistance and deficient aeration these results support the hypothesis that the use of soil conservation practices and crop rotation during initial years of no till farming contributes favorably to spq without compromising crop production keywords grain production intercropped brachiaria crop rotation available water tropical region with characteristic dry periods 1 introduction soil physical limitations can impact crop yield negatively during the early stages of implementing no till farming systems büchi et al 2017 derpsch et al 2014 pittelkow et al 2015 soil compaction due to former and ongoing machinery traffic is the main cause of poor soil physical quality tormena et al 2017 letey 1985 first approached soil physical quality spq for agricultural purposes based on the water availability for plants silva et al 1994 introduced the least limiting water range llwr to quantify model and estimate the range of soil water content associated to minimal spq limitations for plant growth llwr takes into account the concomitant effects of aeration porosity ap mechanical resistance to root penetration penetration resistance pr and plant available water capacity pawc these properties are modeled as a function of bulk density allowing prediction and interpretation concerning soil management in addition to spq llwr has been cited in a recent review paper as a soil function indicator for biomass production rabot et al 2018 although silva and kay 1996 presented significant correlation between llwr and plant growth other authors reported llwr did not assess the minimal soil physical limitations for plant growth and crop yield benjamin et al 2003 cecagno et al 2016 gubiani et al 2013 olibone et al 2010 revamped llwr included adjustments to make it more accurate asgarzadeh et al 2011 mohammadi et al 2010 silva et al 2015 and applicable to plant growth and crop production silva et al 2015 replaced the permanent wilting point pwp as the lower limit of the llwr when calculating the pawc by the critical water content θ identifying this alternative range as llwr for a perennial crop coffee in southeastern brazil this llwr resulted however in a smaller estimate of the plant readily available water in the soil compared to that of llwr silva et al 2015 the rationale for this adjustment is that plants experience severe water stress damage before soil water content equals pwp whereas θ is the soil water content at which plants experience a decrease in stomata opening and could cause restricted plant growth eitzinger et al 2004 silva et al 2015 de jong van lier 1997 therefore llwr is dependent on plant physiological characteristics however there is a total lack of information in literature regarding llwr for cropping systems e g soybean and corn in tropical regions furthermore to achieve high crop yields and promote agricultural sustainability in regions with characteristic dry periods it has been shown that no till management systems must include crop rotation and soil cover with plant residue pittelkow et al 2015 in the brazilian cerrado neotropical savanna a region with a prolonged dry season in winter and frequent occurrence of short periods of drought in the warm rainy season plant residue rapidly decomposes reducing the deposition of straw borghi et al 2013 crusciol et al 2014 abrahao and costa 2018 moreover in regions like central minas gerais brazil it is difficult to grow a second crop during winter because of water scarcity therefore adequate soil cover cannot be achieved increased soil cover and improved soil quality positively impact soil moisture conservation and biomass production leading to increased crop yields pittelkow et al 2015 no till management systems can improve spq but further studies on complementary practices that can improve soil properties are still needed blanco canqui and ruis 2018 although highly site and weather specific different soil conservation practices i e cover crop complementary soil amendments physical conditioning applied together as a conservation farming system can improve soil physical properties and reduce plant water stress silva et al 2019 in addition to crop rotation the introduction of intercropped perennial grass species such as brachiaria urochloa spp along with crops such as corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l and rice oryza sativa l seems to be a key strategy to increase duration of residue cover on the soil crusciol et al 2014 2012 borghi et al 2013 pariz et al 2016 2017 silva et al 2019 this has shown to be beneficial for improving the spq as water loss is reduced due to low evaporation and improved infiltration rates unger and vigil 1998 argenton et al 2005 brachiaria radicular systems are known for promoting pore formation and organic matter accumulation reducing soil compaction and increasing llwr calonego et al 2011 pariz et al 2017 2016 improving soil fertility and increasing crop yield balbinot et al 2017 crusciol et al 2015 ferralsols are the largely dominant soil classes in brazilian cerrado they tend to have substantial contents of gibbsite in the clay fraction as a result of intense and prolonged weathering leaching processes excessive drainage and low pawc or llwr are common in these soils due to their granular structure lack of mesopores and large amount of macropores ferreira et al 1999 silva et al 2014 2015 therefore an increase in water availability and spq is essential to achieve high crop yields which conservation management systems aim to attain benjamin et al 2003 silva and kay 1996 silva et al 2019 long term no till positive impact on llwr has been reported chen et al 2014 crusciol et al 2014 müller et al 2001 tormena et al 2007 williams and weil 2004 nevertheless in short term no till with chronic historic compaction of degraded soils still needs to be addressed blanco canqui and ruis 2018 thus we hypothesized that concomitant soil conservation practices such as crop rotation soybean and corn and intercropped perennial grass urochloa spp would improve spq during the early stages of implementing no till farming systems and still achieve high crop yields in a tropical region with dry winters and frequent dry spells during wet season estimates for llwr and llwr were computed in order to achieve the following objectives 1 to determine if the spq and soil fertility are improved when soil conservation practices are used during no till farming early stages 2 to identify the most limiting soil physical property for plant development and crop yields θpwp θ or pr and 3 to correlate soil properties and crop yields in the first two years of no till under different crop management systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil description the experiment was conducted at sete lagoas municipality central region of the state of minas gerais brazil 19 28 30 s 44 15 08 w according to köppen climate classification köppen 1918 the climate is classified as humid subtropical cwa with an annual average temperature of 22 1 c and annual rainfall of 1 382 7 mm alvares et al 2013 the characteristic dry season occurs from may to october mainly during fall and winter occurrence of short periods of drought during rainy season in the experimental area are frequent this impedes the planting of a second crop the soil is classified as rhodic ferralsol fao wrb 2014 or typic haplustox soil survey staff 2014 presenting gibbsitic mineralogy the soil particle size distribution encompasses 690 g kg 1 of clay 0 002 mm 120 g kg 1 of silt 0 002 0 05 mm and 190 g kg 1 of sand 0 05 2 mm before experimental set up the area has been in use for corn and soybean cultivation under conventional tillage for 20 years according to information obtained from indigenous stakeholders consultation with farm managers soil sampling for chemical characterization and preparation of the soil occurred during the dry season of 2014 from july to october soil amendment and fertilizer requirements were calculated in accordance to sousa and lobato 2004 based on the chemical characterization of the soil surface layer 20 cm depth sampled in july 2014 table 1 the soil was prepared with a subsoiler to a depth of 0 35 m aiming to minimize negative effects of compaction that could restrict root penetration and to mix any possible remnant of amendments and fertilizers throughout the entire soil layer soil acidity correction followed with the application of 4 t ha 1 of dolomitic limestone over the total area which was incorporated by two harrowing operations amending the soil was completed by the application of 3 t ha 1 of agricultural gypsum nutrients were supplied to the soil by the application of fertilizers at rates of 306 kg ha 1 93 kg ha 1 and 1 1 t ha 1 of potassium chloride fte br12 micronutrients and superphosphate respectively gypsum and fertilizers were applied together and were incorporated into the soil by harrowing to ensure all treatments had equal initial conditions 2 2 cropping systems treatments resulted in six combinations of individual or brachiaria consorted cropping systems corn or soybean with or without crop rotation and two levels of improved soil fertility table 2 fertilizer rates were determined by meeting full high or partial medium plant nutritional needs based on the demands for high yields of corn or soybean resende et al 2016 in order to provide enough area for in situ soil sampling and determining crop productivity throughout the experiment duration 2014 2016 and future long time evaluations each of the six treatments occupied a 0 5 ha experimental area thus a completely randomized design was adopted considering georeferenced locations chosen at random sampling points within each treatment as replicates fig 1 as recommended by ferreira et al 2012 for field experiments with one experimental block this statistical methodology has been successfully used in prior studies shukla and lal 2005 cecagno et al 2016 peixoto et al 2019 with similar restrictions for additional randomized blocks and long term experimental set ups seeds were sowed in december of each year right after the beginning of the rainy season for treatments t4 and t5 the seeds of brachiaria species urochloa ruziziensis were sown at a rate of 4 kg ha 1 varying the time of planting according to the consorted crop when consorted with corn brachiaria seeds were mixed together with fertilizers and sown into the soil using a precision seeder fertilizer spreader at the crop line meanwhile when consorted with soybean a mechanical broadcast seeder was used for brachiaria seeds this occurred when soybean plants reached the r5 growth stage as described by andrade et al 2017 fertilizers were applied at the time of sowing table 3 shows the n p2o5 and k2o rates apllied for each treatment based on the crop nutrient requirements additionally for cropping systems in which corn was planted urea was the form of n fertilizer applied for medium level of improved soil fertility treatments t2 t3 and t4 155 kg ha 1 of urea were applied corresponding to 70 kg ha 1 of n in a similar manner in high level n fertilization treatments t5 and t6 200 kg ha 1 of urea were applied equivalent to 90 kg ha 1 of n in july 2015 for the evaluation of the first year under different cropping systems undisturbed soil samples were taken for bulk density bd determination three randomly and georeferenced locations were chosen per treatment and soil was sampled at depths of 0 00 0 05 m and 0 15 0 20 m bd was also measured using the undisturbed soil samples 0 027 m of height and 0 065 m of diameter collected for llwr determination as described in section 2 3 lastly soil samples for chemical characterization were collected from the top 20 cm soil layer within each treatment plot in november 2016 the results of the chemical analyses of the soil after two years of no till farming under different cropping systems are shown for each treatment in table 4 moreover the number of plants for each crop seed treatments herbicide and pesticide application rates as well as disease control practices followed the recommendations for no tillage farming systems in brazil resende et al 2016 2 3 determination of the least limiting water range llwr regarding the least limiting water range llwr determination soil sampling was carried out in march 2016 for the evaluation of the first two years under no till farming previous tests using an impact penetrometer showed that the top 5 cm layer and the subsurface layer from a depth of 0 15 0 20 m presented the highest penetration resistance pr values therefore seven undisturbed soil samples were taken at each depth of interest 0 00 0 05 m and 0 15 0 20 m for every treatment in rings 0 027 m of height and 0 065 m of diameter at three randomly chosen and georeferenced locations to determine hydro physical properties of each of the two soil layers this sampling methodology totaled 21 samples per treatment for each depth which equals to 252 samples the undisturbed samples 0 027 m of height and 0 065 m of diameter were randomly classified into seven batches each batch of samples was equilibrated at one of the seven different matric potentials 4 kpa 6 kpa 10 kpa in an automated suction plate module brand ecotech model pf 33 kpa 100 kpa 500 kpa and 1500 kpa on the porous plates in a richards pressure chamber silva et al 1994 2015 2019 after reaching water equilibrium at each potential the samples were weighed and the soil penetration resistance pr was determined using a digital electronic penetrometer brand stable micro systems model texture analyser xt with a straight cylindrical cone type probe 30 angle 4 mm diameter at a constant speed of 10 mm min 1 silva et al 2015 2019 afterwards the samples were oven dried at 105 c until they reached constant weight for determining the soil water content θ and bulk density bd using the measured data of all samples nonlinear models were developed for water retention eq 1 and pr eq 2 as affected by bd busscher 1990 serafim et al 2013 silva et al 2015 2019 the model coefficients were obtained by minimizing squared deviations between measured and computed values leão and silva 2004 1 θ a ψ b b d c 2 p r d θ e b d f where θ is the soil water content m3 m 3 ψ is the soil water potential kpa pr is the penetration resistance mpa bd is the bulk density mg m 3 and a b c are fitting parameters of eq 1 whereas d e f are fitting parameters of eq 2 llwr determination followed the methodology recommended by silva et al 1994 and leão and da silva 2004 critical limits were water content at field capacity θfc estimated by the equilibrium water content at 6 kpa in eq 1 silva et al 2014 2015 2019 which proved to be a more accurate way to appraise θfc for ferralsols with gibbsitic mineralogy instead of using worldwide criteria of 10 or 33 kpa according to ferreira and marcos 1983 who validated this aspect in the field water content at permanent wilting point θpwp estimated by eq 1 considering soil water potential of 1500 kpa savage et al 1996 water content for an air filled porosity θap of 0 10 m3 m 3 calculated by eq 3 grable and siemer 1968 water content at a critical pr value of 2 0 mpa θpr estimated by eq 4 this root growth limiting pr value may well agree with the hydro physical restrictions of the upper soil layer during the early stages of no tillage farming as reported in the literature for corn and soybean bengough et al 2011 bengough and mullins 1990 klein and camara 2007 de moraes et al 2014 llwr was calculated as the difference between the upper limit and the lower limit for each bd the upper limit is the drier water content of either θfc or θap whereas the lower limit is the wetter water content of either θpwp or θpr silva et al 1994 3 θ a p 1 b d d p 0 1 4 θ p r p r d b d f 1 e where dp 2 65 mg m 3 is the average particle density value according to embrapa 2011 d e f are the exact same fitting parameters as in eq 2 it has been shown by carducci et al 2011 and silva et al 2014 2015 2019 that ferralsols from the brazilian neotropical savanna present limited plant available water even before reaching θpwp this causes irreversible plant impairment and threatens crop production denmead and shaw 1962 allen et al 1998 eitzinger et al 2004 the critical moisture θ has proved to be a more accurate estimate than θpwp to determine the water readily available for plants under these climate and soil environment silva et al 2015 2019 this is the soil water content m3 m 3 at which plant transpiration is reduced however its impact on plant growth and crop productivity due to water stress is not significant doorenbos and kassan 1979 allen et al 1998 van den berg and driessen 2002 assuming a crop standardized evapotranspiration demand of 4 mm day 1 allen et al 1998 an evapotranspiration depletion factor of p 0 55 was computed eq 5 and used to calculate θ eq 6 5 θ f c θ p θ f c θ p w p 6 θ a 6 b p 6 b 1500 b b d c where θ is the critical moisture m3 m 3 p is the evapotranspiration depletion factor bd is the bulk density mg m 3 and a b c are the same fitting parameters as in eq 1 determination of the llwr followed the same methodology presented by silva et al 2015 2019 following eq 7 for each bd measurements of water content were plotted as a function of bd for each depth allowing to analyze water availability and infer water stress while identifying the soil depth of occurrence 7 llwr ul ll where ul is the upper limit considered the smallest value between θap and θfc and ll is the lower limit the highest value between θpr and θ 2 4 relationships of soil physico chemical attributes and crop production the field yield fy was estimated for each treatment annually the mature corn ears or soybean pods enclosed in a 4 5 m2 area equivalent to 3 rows of a 3 m length each were manually harvested at three different georeferenced locations within each treatment these locations were chosen adjacent or proximal to the spq sampling area subsequently the grain weight was measured and fy per hectare was estimated considering 130 g kg 1 wet basis fischer 2015 data were then grouped by crop considering each of the two years of harvest to analyze their relationships with soil physical attributes furthermore relative yield ry was calculated as the ratio in percent of fy to potential yield py of each cultivated crop by adapting methodologies suggested by de ponti et al 2012 and borghi et al 2013 py estimation was considered to be the highest yield measured among all the treatments as a simplified definition explained by evans and fischer 1999 and fischer 2015 for corn py was 13 638 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 10 362 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 meanwhile for soybean py was 4022 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 3118 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 finally relative cropping system yield rcy was calculated by treatment as the mean value of the two ry and it was expressed as a percentage as well data were then grouped by cropping system to analyze their relationships with soil physico chemical attributes benjamin et al 2003 gubiani et al 2013 correlations of soil physical attributes and yield data were determined at depths of 0 5 cm and 15 20 cm fy data were correlated with mean bulk density bdmean llwr and llwr as functions of bdmean benjamin et al 2003 gathala et al 2011 verma and sharma 2008 maximum bulk density bdmax llwr and llwr as functions of bdmax ratio of bdmean to critical bd bdmean bdc ratio of bdmax to critical bd bdmax bdc as recommended by cecagno et al 2016 in a similar manner rcy data were revised for any correlation with relevant chemical attributes 2 5 statistical analyses the fitting parameters a b c d e and f of llwr and llwr nonlinear models were calculated by minimizing the sum of squared differences between determined values and those estimated by the models spreadsheet algorithms were used as indicated in the literature leão and da silva 2004 safadoust et al 2014 silva et al 2015 accuracy of the models was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r² and root mean square error rmse of the determined values and those estimated by the models chen et al 2014 safadoust et al 2014 silva et al 2015 descriptive statistics were performed on the entire data set and llwr was plotted as a function of bd silva et al 1994 silva et al 2015 2019 the relationships between yield and soil attributes were evaluated by pearson s linear correlation 3 results 3 1 wrc and prc models the bulk density bd and penetration resistance pr values at the 0 5 cm depth ranged from 0 85 mg m 3 to 1 35 mg m 3 cv 8 37 and from 0 15 mpa to 5 27 mpa cv 83 4 respectively the models of the water retention curve wrc and the penetration resistance curve prc for this soil depth were ө 0 4496 ψ0 084501 bd0 7444 and pr 0 0031 θ 4 9766 bd7 4321 likewise results for bd and pr at 15 20 cm depth ranged from 0 90 mg m 3 to 1 39 mg m 3 cv 7 60 and from 0 167 mpa to 5 71 mpa cv 89 2 respectively moreover the models of wrc and prc at this depth were ө 0 4445 ψ 0 082 bd0 7299 and pr 0 0029 θ 5 01 bd 7 5055 adjustment parameters are shown in table 5 similar results were observed for bd and pr at both depths being pr data with higher cv 3 2 mechanical and aeration constraints on soil water availability as modeled by llwr and llwr physical limitations were observed at both soil depths in the form of mechanical and aeration constraints results for llwr and llwr are presented in fig 2 depth of 0 5 cm and fig 3 depth of 15 20 cm contrasting these two models colored area at both depths the less limiting water conditions were better predicted when using θ instead of θpwp at bd values below 1 19 mg m 3 this means water stress in the form of reduced transpiration is more limiting for plants narrowed the llwr than poor root development or permanent impairment due to wilting nevertheless at bd values above 1 19 mg m 3 the boundary conditions are θap as upper limit and θpr as lower limit for both llwr and llwr which may suggest deteriorated spq due to soil compaction i e other physical parameters became more plant growth limiting than water since θap becomes the upper critical limit of llwr and llwr only at bd values greater than 1 19 mg m 3 fig 2a soil aeration porosity is a less relevant limiting constraint than mechanical hydric and physiological conditions at low bd values at 0 5 cm depth available water content decreased for llwr as bd values increased fig 2b regarding the data computed for lower limits θpr is more limiting than θpwp for llwr however for llwr θ was chosen as lower boundary according to computed values when contrasted with θpr at bd values below 1 18 mg m 3 thus the soil water content range considered optimal for plants increases up to 1 18 mg m 3 and then it decreases critical bulk density bdc was estimated by both models at 1 30 mg m 3 corresponding to the bd value where θap and θpr converged therefore bd values greater than bdc implies severe constraint to root development due to soil compaction similar results were observed at the soil depth of 15 20 cm θfc was consistently the upper limit of llwr and llwr up to bd value of 1 20 mg m 3 henceforth θap became the most restrictive condition for plant development fig 3a likewise θpr was invariably less limiting than θpwp for llwr meanwhile θ was less limiting than θpr for llwr up to bd value of 1 17 mg m 3 θap and θpr lines converged simultaneously for llwr and llwr to reveal the bdc value at 1 30 mg m 3 fig 3b differences among soil depths are very subtle when contrasting the results e g bdc revealed the same value at both depths deteriorated spq negatively impacts plant development and crop productivity at denser conditions due to soil compaction regardless of the depth direct comparison of llwr amplitude by depth indicated 5 5 more available water content at depth of 0 5 cm 0 109 m3 m 3 in relation to depth of 15 20 cm 0 103 m3 m 3 meanwhile contrasting llwr amplitude by soil depth showed 16 1 less available water content at the depth of 0 5 cm 0 087 m3 m 3 as compared to that at the depth of 15 20 cm 0 101 m3 m 3 these findings suggest that θ agrees better with the less limiting conditions for plant development than θpmp viz θpmp became an irrelevant water content in both llwr models furthermore llwr seems to better predict the optimum water content range for crop productivity in order to avoid plant impairment due to water stress or poorly developed root systems consequently llwr seems to be a better indicator of spq than llwr 3 3 effects of cropping systems on llwr and llwr mean bulk density bdmean values of undisturbed samples collected in july 2015 and march 2016 were entered by treatment into the llwr models introduced in section 3 2 bdmean values showed an average increment of 5 from 2015 2016 regardless of the cropping system this was expected as machine traffic tends to cause soil compaction under no tillage management systems results showed that computed llwr values as a function of bdmean were always less than those of llwr table 6 this was due to the llwr model assuming θ as a less limiting water content for plant physiological development instead of θpr or θpwp being θ θpr θpwp for the cultivars evaluated and bulk density values up to 1 17 mg m 3 decreases in computed llwr values by treatment were observed when contrasting llwr values for bdmean of july 2015 and march 2016 at both soil depths except for t3 at depth of 15 20 cm table 6 conversely llwr values remained the same or increased from year 2015 2016 at both soil depths table 6 furthermore bdmean values by treatment were smaller than bdc values for both years these results suggest that the overall crop production was not compromised towards the end of the second year under various no tillage management systems due to the large variability in bd values within treatments llwr and llwr were computed as a function of the maximum bulk density bdmax values measured by treatment table 7 average bdmax values for depth of 0 5 cm showed an increment of 12 1 from 2015 2016 the worst cases of soil compaction were found at t1 and t2 the soil was denser by 19 1 and 17 4 between 2015 2016 bdmax values for treatments t1 and t2 were greater than bdc meanwhile for soil depth of 15 20 cm average bdmax values showed an increment of 13 2 from 2015 2016 the worst case scenario among all cropping systems was registered at t2 with bdmax 1 39 mg m 3 these results corresponded to possible plant injury as a consequence of mechanical and aeration constraints around proximal areas where soil sampling took place as presented in figs 2 and 3 there is a portion in the graphs of llwr and llwr where the upper and lower boundaries were exactly the same for both models thus results for year 2016 of computed llwr and llwr tended to be very close or equal to each other when contrasting them by treatment except for t4 and t5 at the depth of 0 5 cm table 7 this is because as bd values increased the most limiting parameters became θpr and θap indicating that mechanical and aeration constraints for plant development were present for year 2015 computed llwr values were always less than those of llwr table 7 this was due to the fact that bdmax values for all treatments were less than 1 17 mg m 3 3 4 correlations between soil attributes and crop yield data crop yield data for cropping systems are presented in fig 4 in the form of rcy rcy data did not show significant differences among treatments correlations between ry and physical parameters were only significant for bdmax values for both crops at a 10 significance level table 8 because bdc value was 1 30 mg m 3 for llwr and llwr at both soil depths it became meaningless to analyze the correlation between crop yield data and the ratios of bdmax or bdmean to bdc thus negative correlation between ry and bdmax table 8 indicated large values of bdmax table 7 indeed impacted negatively on crop production this confirmed that localized spots of soil with high bd values observed in monoculture treatments led to mechanical and aeration constraints that reduced crop yield furthermore llwrmax values at the soil depth of 15 20 cm showed positive correlation at a 5 significance level for soybean ry however this may have been coincidental since no trend could be identified regarding soil chemical attributes neither significant correlations were observed between rcy and soc nor between rcy and bs fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 llwr models for soil layers with restrictive physical conditions for plant roots models for llwr and llwr values figs 2 and 3 indicated that soil physical limitations for plant growth were found in very clayey tropical soils with granular structure as the soil studied θcc upper and θpmp lower are usually the boundaries for llwr values this indicates that there are few or null mechanical or aeration constraints for plant development in such soils ferreira et al 2017 severiano et al 2011 silva et al 2015 2019 however in this study the llwr showed mechanical restrictions over the entire range of bd values meanwhile llwr indicated that water stress in the form of θ was a less limiting condition than mechanical restriction at least up to a bd value of 1 17 mg m 3 furthermore soil classes with different textures and under other management systems have shown similar results in which mechanical constraints θpr were the lower boundary of llwr benjamin et al 2003 cecagno et al 2016 tormena et al 2017 2007 1999 however none of these referred authors compared different levels of water stress i e θ versus θpmp in this work θ was indeed the most limiting condition for plant development at llwr and θpmp turned irrelevant due to increased compaction of the soil at llwr as compaction increased pr reached a critical value for root development of 2 mpa bengough et al 2011 safadoust et al 2014 silva et al 1994 the limited growth of radicular systems resulted in reduced crop production for all treatments regardless of the adequate nutrient availability fig 4 attenuation of critical pr value should be expected if continued no till based management systems remain in this area former studies have demonstrated that continuous neomacropores developed by plant roots and soil fauna serve as biopores for soil aeration thus facilitating root development of subsequent crops huang et al 2015 papadopoulos et al 2014 williams and weil 2004 tormena et al 2017 intercropped brachiaria also improves soil structure and spq borghi et al 2013 calonego et al 2017 crusciol et al 2014 2012 pariz et al 2017 possibly as consequences of increments in soil porosity and organic matter content concerning aeration limitations reduced porosity at bd values greater than 1 20 mg m 3 means that there were limitations for oxygen diffusion as bd value approached and surpassed bdc grable and siemer 1968 research has shown that very clayey ferralsols with granular structure such as the studied soil present high macroporosity and consequent rapid drainage attributes thus aeration porosity is never more limiting than mechanical resistance silva et al 2014 cecagno et al 2016 in contrast for poorly drained soils lapen et al 2004 observed that aeration restriction was greater than mechanical constraints as a result reduced corn yield was observed lapen et al 2004 it has extensively been documented that reduced spq occurs at poorly drained soils soil pores are blocked and aggregates become less stable as oxides are reduced and soil organic matter is consumed under anaerobic conditions norton et al 1999 de campos et al 2012 the progressive increase and decrease of θpr and θap respectively as a function of bd resulted in the null value for llwr and llwr at bdc 1 30 mg m 3 and beyond that figs 2 and 3 this value was consistent with the bdc model for ferralsols from the cerrado biome brazil bdc 1 95 0 00095 clay where clay is in g kg 1 severiano et al 2011 resulting in 1 29 mg m 3 calculation of bdc using the model proposed by reichert et al 2009 bdc 1 83803 0 00078 clay where clay is in g kg 1 resulted in 1 30 mg m 3 bulk density values beyond bdc suggest poor spq since there are limiting physical conditions for plant development letey 1985 and decisions need to be made to reverse the soil compaction negative effects silva et al 1994 it should be noted that inclusion of θ did not signify a change in the estimation of bdc however θ agrees better with the less limiting conditions for plant development than θpmp furthermore llwr seems to better predict the optimum water content range to avoid plant impairment due to water stress or poorly developed root systems silva et al 2015 2019 it has been shown by other works that θ outside the upper and lower limits of llwr during the crop cycle impacts plant growth and potential productivity of the crop negatively silva et al 1994 silva and kay 1996 benjamin et al 2003 however for llwr the δθ between llwr and llwr could increase the probability of existing plant available water outside the llwr consequently llwr may be a better indicator of spq than llwr silva et al 2015 2019 nevertheless since this unestimated θ buffer may allow crops to overcome physical constrains without plant impairment more research should be conducted to better understand spq in tropical soils under no till management systems that include crop rotation and intercropped perennial grasses 4 2 effects of cropping systems on spq regarding the cropping systems evaluated in this work the use of crop rotation as well as intercropped brachiaria with corn or soybean resulted in lower values of θpr figs 2 and 3 these results are consistent with those reported by calonego et al 2011 they found that soil structure was improved and pr value was reduced when brachiaria was intercropped with corn for two consecutive years calonego et al 2011 conversely monoculture management systems t1 soybean and t2 corn presented the highest values for bdmean and bdmax which signified increased θpr this trend was observed at both soil depths and it became more evident towards the end of the second year under no tillage tables 6 and 7 bdmean and bdmax values during the first year did not show large differences among treatments due to residual effect of conventional soil preparation this was carried out to initialize the cropping systems which reduced the soil bd values by increasing soil porosity hamza and anderson 2005 stone and silveira 2001 meanwhile towards the end of the experiment bd values increased as machinery traffic caused soil compaction this has been observed to occur for clayey soils at depths down to 20 cm hamza and anderson 2005 nunes et al 2015 stone and silveira 2001 the negative effects of soil compaction were more noticeable at monoculture management systems as bdmax values tended to be proximal to or greater than the bdc value therefore monoculture management systems may induce more negative effects on spq than the other cropping systems e g intercropped brachiaria and crop rotation may alleviate soil compaction effects grasses with robust and strong root systems such as brachiaria can penetrate dense soil layers with large pr values calonego and rosolem 2011 forming neobiopores that favor water movement and gas diffusion in the soil williams and weil 2004 müller et al 2001 therefore they can act as alternative root channels for subsequent crops reducing the negative effects of soil compaction ajayi et al 2019 williams and weil 2004 pariz et al 2017 chen et al 2014 monoculture management systems t1 and t2 also presented values of llwr and llwr as a function of bdmax tending to or equal to zero at both soil depths towards the end of the experiment table 7 these results confirm that llwr and llwr were adequate indicators of deteriorated spq this could help farmers apply localized solutions to improve spq in problematic areas cropping systems that include crop rotation showed less soil compaction than monoculture management systems tables 6 and 7 furthermore greater values of llwr and llwr as a function of bdmax for t3 t4 t5 and t6 for year 2016 as compared to monoculture management systems are indicators of noticeable improved soil structure during the second year under no tillage despite treatments t4 and t5 with intercropped brachiaria did not present results significantly different in comparison to t3 and t6 it has been reported by other works that cropping systems with extra plant biomass input to the soil from cover crops contributes to increase soil organic matter content mishra et al 2015 to improve soil structure calonego et al 2011 and to promote pore reconfiguration favorable to soil water availability for plant roots olibone et al 2010 conversion of arable land to permanent grassland proved perennial grass capacity to promote substantial recovery of pore functions by improving air and water fluxes ajayi and horn 2016 long term research should be conducted to reinterpret intercropped brachiaria effects on spq 4 3 soil attributes and crop production we initially expected llwr and llwr amplitude values to correlate positively with crop production since an increase in θpr accounts for soil compaction negative effects on root penetration resistance however no correlation may indicate that critical pr values should be revised in future research gubiani et al 2013 tested llwr considering critical limits for pr values of 2 3 and 4 mpa they reported significant changes in llwr however there was no correlation between llwr and corn yield tavares filho et al 2001 demonstrated that pr values above 3 5 mpa in long term no till management systems influenced only corn plant morphology meanwhile it did not limit roots growth and grains yield tavares filho et al 2001 beutler and centurion 2003 observed reduction of soybean yield at pr values between 1 66 and 2 22 mpa similar to the adopted pr values for this study beutler et al 2007 also observed reduced soybean yield when the pr value was above 1 30 mpa and the bd value was 1 26 mg m 3 in a clayey ferralsol thus definition of critical pr value in eq 4 may have been crop dependent and consequently llwr and llwr did not correlate neither with ry nor with rcy considering that corn is very sensitive to dry spells in critical stages of crop development bergamaschi et al 2006 and because the study area is characterized by frequent dry periods throughout the year even during the rainy seasons it is possible that rainfall distribution during the study period affected corn production negatively regardless of the treatment this could also have hidden any possible correlation between rcy and physico chemical soil attributes the ferralsol of the study area although very clayey is excessively drained due to its granular structure a reflex of the gibbsitic mineralogy which implies much less water storage for plants silva et al 2019 regarding soil chemical attributes contrasting initial table 1 and final table 4 conditions there were improvements due to the application of soil amendments and fertilizers however there were imperceptible differences among treatments at the end of the experiment table 4 thus chemical attributes as affected by soil fertilization and amendment application had less impact on crop yield during the first two years under no tillage than spq viz no correlations were observed between rcy and bs or soc content fig 5 therefore results suggested soil compaction was the most limiting factor to crop production regardless of adequate nutrient availability i e increased bulk density values due to soil compaction restrained root growth and plant development regardless of the level of fertilization the presence of a compacted layer increases pr values restricts soil water movement kuncoro et al 2014 and reduces aeration porosity and soil aeration mentges et al 2016 these factors impact negatively on plant growth letey 1985 and crop production benjamin et al 2003 therefore farmers need to take actions on best management practices to increase crop production and to improve spq 5 conclusions enhancing knowledge regarding physical properties of a ferralsol during early stages of no till cropping systems proved to be relevant the θ was the most limiting condition for plant physiological development up to a bd value of 1 17 mg m 3 as soil became increasingly compact the mechanical resistance became the most limiting parameter for plants development regardless of the level of fertilization therefore nutrient availability and chemical properties had less impact on crop yield than spq monoculture management systems presented compaction issues bd values greater than the bdc of 1 30 mg m 3 llwr llwr 0 promoted soil physical constraints for appropriate plants development llwr and llwr can play as indicators of problematic areas in which deteriorated spq could limit crop production cropping systems with crop rotation and intercropped brachiaria proved to be favorable for spq at the second year of no till farming of this very clayey gibbsitic ferralsol previously soil compaction effects due to farm machinery common in no till early stages were attenuated by these concomitant best management practices these results are relevant for annual crop farming operations in regions with characteristic long dry season and dry spells during the rainy season conditions that are

10441,many research papers on crop water requirements of vegetables have been produced since the publication of the fao56 guidelines in 1998 a review of this literature has shown that determination of crop evapotranspiration et c using the k c et o approach i e the product of the specific crop coefficient k c by the reference evapotranspiration et o is the most widely used method for irrigation water management consequently a review was made to provide updated information on the k c values for these crops the reviewed research provided various approaches to determine k c in its single and dual versions with this purpose actual crop et et c act was determined with lysimeters or by performing the soil water balance using measured soil water content and computational models or by using bowen ratio energy balance and eddy covariance measurements or by using remote sensing applications when determining the basal k c k cb the partitioning of et c act was evaluated using different approaches though mainly using the fao56 dual k c method since the accuracy of experimentally determined k c and k cb values depends upon the procedure used to compute et o as well as accuracy in determining and partitioning of et c act the adequacy of the measurement requirements for each approach was carefully reviewed the article discusses in detail the conceptual methodology relative to crop coefficients and the requirements for transferability namely distinguishing between actual and standard k c and the need to appropriately use the fao segmented k c curve hence the research papers selected to update and consolidate mid season and end season standard k c and k cb were those that computed et o with the fao56 pm et o equation and that also used accurate approaches to determine and partition et c act for pristine non stressed cropping conditions under these experimental conditions the reported k c and k cb values relative to the mid and end season could be considered as transferable standard k c and or k cb values after adjustment to the standard climate adopted in fao56 where average rh min 45 and average u 2 2 m s 1 over the mid season and late season growth stages for each vegetable crop these standard values were then compared with the fao56 tabulated k c and k cb values to define the updated values tabulated in the current article in addition reported ancillary data such as maximum root zone depth maximum crop height and soil water depletion fraction for no water stress were also collected from selected papers and tabulated in comparison with those given for the crops in fao56 the presentation of updated crop coefficient results is performed by grouping the vegetables differently than in fao56 where distinction is made according to their edible parts 1 roots tubers bulbs and stem vegetables 2 leaves and flowers vegetables 3 fruit and pod vegetables and 4 herbs spices and special crops with most of them being newly introduced herein the updated k c and k cb of vegetable crops based on this review are generally coincident with those in fao56 although slightly lower for several crops close agreement of selected paper values with fao56 values provides good evidence of their quality and also confirms the reliability of the original fao56 tabulated values it is noteworthy that many papers surveyed from the past 20 years did not satisfy the adopted k c requirements in terms of et o computation method nor provide solid evidence of measurement accuracy for et c act it is recommended that future k c research of vegetables should sufficiently address these issues with objectives broadened to provide more transferable data to other regions also new data on vegetable k c and k cb values should be carefully scrutinized in the context of these results and those provided in fao56 keywords actual vs standard k c upper limits to k c research accuracy requirements roots and tubers vegetables leaves and flowers vegetables fruit and pod vegetables herbs and spices ancillary data 1 introduction the use of water for irrigation of crops is under pressure due to climate and environmental changes which call for reducing water losses and wastages and for improved productivity of the irrigated crops a paramount approach consists in closing the gaps between water application and crop water requirements these gaps refer to various irrigation issues such as improved irrigation methods and related irrigation and delivery scheduling use of information and communication technologies more precise cropping and water management practices and farmers training and self governance on the base of related developments is knowledge and particularly knowledge on crop water requirements thus on crop evapotranspiration processes and determination methods evapotranspiration et is commonly measured with instrumentation that require relatively complex physical principles and techniques e g farahani et al 2007 verstraeten et al 2008 allen et al 2011a b crop et is typically computed or modeled using weather data and algorithms that describe the aerodynamic characteristics of the vegetation and surface energy driving et namely when adopting the fao56 method allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 this method uses the simple k c et o approach that consists of the product of a crop coefficient k c by the grass reference evapotranspiration et o where the latter represents the actual evaporative demand of the atmosphere and k c represents an integration of the effects of the primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the grass reference in terms of the energy balance allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 despite the simplicity of the k c et o approach its application requires the best accuracy of measurements and computations particularly when deriving crop coefficients for a given crop using field observations allen et al 2011a thousands of papers have been published during the last 20 years reporting on the use of k c values and k c curves for nearly all cultivated crops with hundreds of studies dealing with the derivation of k c values for numerous crops and vegetation types however objectives of studies were quite diverse resulting in contradictory approaches when aiming at the transferability of k c values to different environments limitations to transferability are due to a variety of factors 1 using an et o estimation method different than the standard pm et o equation 2 using non standard cultivation conditions such as mulch plastic tunnels intercropping and greenhouses screenhouses 3 adopting crop management practices that may cause various types of stresses e g relative to the use of fertilizers chemicals or wastewater 4 cropping under soil and water salinity sodicity stress 5 using non optimal plant density and or planting dates 6 adopting deficit irrigation stresses 7 insufficient size of experimental plots 8 inadequate lysimeter management 9 using energy balance instrumentation without adopting an appropriate energy balance closure ebr 10 lack of appropriate estimation of soil water fluxes that affect accuracy of soil water balance swb particularly amount of water passing through the bottom boundary of the control volume 11 lack of consideration of possible occurrence of local and regional advection 12 using non calibrated vegetation indices when remote sensing is adopted 13 insufficient description of the experiments namely of the plant density height and vigor and of the instrumentation used and of their accuracy in addition reported k c curves often do not follow the fao segmented curves or k c results are presented as time dependent polynomial equations or are just referred to weekly 10 day or more often monthly values crop growth stages are sometimes defined contradictorily relative to definitions adopted in fao56 allen et al 1998 and previously in fao24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 information provided in those papers may be sufficient relative to objectives of the studies reported but is insufficient to provide for the transferability of reported k c into different environments these limitations obliged to a careful review of published material to check when derived k c are only of local interest and or represent non standard experimental conditions contrasting to k c relative to recognizable potential evaporative crop conditions resulting from optimal pristine cropping practices pereira et al 2015 therefore transferable to other environments when adequately adjusted to climate aiming at providing accurate standard and updated k c values it was required that the et data et models and related model calibrations reported in the literature were exempt of biases caused by flaws in experimental design measurement equipment vegetation management data handling model parameterization and interpretation of results as discussed by allen et al 2011a selected references were checked to ensure that sufficient descriptions of the practices used to measure et data crop practices and related production environment were provided they were also checked to avoid potential computational flaws and shortcomings in data handling and in model calibration and validation as well as to contain the climatological information to adjust k c to the standard climate this paper aims at providing standard updated single and basal k c values k c and k cb for field and vegetable crops corresponding to the standard climate as adopted in fao56 minimum relative humidity rh min 45 and wind speed at 2 meters height u 2 2 m s 1 therefore section 2 focuses on the basic concepts underlying the derivation and use of k c values in order to make clear the approaches adopted including k c concepts k c curves and crop stage dates and factors influencing k c such as mulches and soil management irrigation methods and scheduling and soil salinity the section 3 revises factors that influence the derivation of k c and k cb values namely 1 measuring systems including soil water balance lysimeters bowen ratio eddy covariance and sap flow 2 plot size constraints fetch limitations and advection issues and 3 requirements for estimating et by remote sensing including vegetation index based crop coefficients and surface energy balance techniques section 4 consists of a literature review on the derivation of k c and k cb from field research including related ancillary data differently from the fao56 crop tables we follow the format assumed by the international society of horticultural sciences in which vegetables crops are grouped according to the edible parts of the plant 1 roots tubers bulbs and stems 2 leaves and flowers 3 fruit and pod 4 herbs spices and special crops section 5 based on that review and on the fao56 tabled data provides for updates on standard k c and k cb for vegetable crops section 6 updates ancillary data and the final section consists of conclusions and recommendations for users 2 crop coefficients basic concepts and approaches 2 1 basic concepts adopting the fao56 method crop evapotranspiration et c mm is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et o mm by a dimensionless crop coefficient k c 1 et c k c et o the reference crop is a hypothetical crop with an assumed height of 0 12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered the daily reference evapotranspiration et o mm d 1 is computed with the pm et o eq 2 which resulted from parameterizing the aerodynamic and surface resistance terms of the penman monteith combination equation thus 2 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n g is the net balance of energy available at the surface mj m 2 d 1 t is mean daily air temperature c at the reference height of 2 m e s e a represents the vapor pressure deficit vpd of air kpa at 2 m height u 2 is wind speed m s 1 at 2 m height δ represents the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship at mean air temperature kpa o c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa o c 1 the reference crop incorporates most of the weather effects into et o estimates and thus et o represents the climatic demand on evaporation however advective heat energy fluxes are not considered in et o because the pm et o equation considers only vertical fluxes of heat and vapor pereira et al 1999 it results that k c varies predominantly with the specific crop characteristics and little with climate this enables the transfer of standard values for k c between locations and climates when local and or regional advection is excluded expressing et c and et o in terms of the penman monteith combination equation monteith 1965 and expressing k c as the ratio of et c to et o eq 1 results in 3 k c e t c e t o δ c r n c g c ρ a c p e s e a c r a c δ c γ 1 r s c r a c δ o r n o g o ρ a c p e s e a o r a o δ o γ 1 r s o r a o where r n g e s e a δ and γ were defined above ρ a is air density kg m 3 c p is specific heat of air 1013 j kg 1 c 1 r a is aerodynamic resistance to heat and vapor transport from the surface to z height s m 1 and r s is bulk surface resistance s m 1 the c subscripted parameters refer to the actual crop vegetation and the o subscript in the denominator refers to the grass reference vegetation using this ratio one can visualize that k c represents an integration of the effects of three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference crop height that affects roughness and aerodynamic resistance r a bulk crop soil surface resistance r s which relates to leaf area fraction of ground covered by the vegetation leaf age and condition degree of stomatal control and soil surface wetness and albedo of the crop soil surface that influences r n and is determined by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation and soil surface wetness the derivation of k c is generally not performed using the relation of eq 3 but by using some empirical approaches that must be consistent relative to the above represented theoretical background however related literature often does not refer to that theoretical background two k c approaches are considered in fao56 the first consists of a time averaged single k c that includes multi day effects of evaporation from the soil in addition to plant transpiration the second refers to the dual k c consisting of a basal crop coefficient k cb and an evaporation coefficient k e representing the ratios of respectively the crop transpiration t c and soil evaporation e s to et o i e k cb t c et o and k e e s et o thus it results that k c k cb k e for transferability purposes fao56 allen et al 1998 adopted the concept of standard or potential k c and et c which refer to optimal well watered conditions and are the basis for the tabularized k c in the field and in common practice crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non uniform irrigation crop density salinity soil and agronomic management as referred before under these conditions et c is then replaced by the actual et c act with et c act et c only when the crop is well irrigated and cultivated under standard optimal conditions the resulting k c is then renamed actual k c k c act which corresponds to the product k cact k s k c using a stress coefficient k s depending upon the sufficiency of available soil water to maintain the crop et rate in the case of using the dual k c approach only the basal k cb is modified into k cb act resulting in 4 k c act k s k c k s k cb k e adopting this concept facilitates consistent estimation and transferability of measured and standardized k c otherwise it would be necessary to define multiple k c values for the same crop the concepts of standard k c and potential crop et c and related terminology are progressively being accepted by the user communities the transferability of k c among climate and locations applies only to standard k c the theoretical basis and limitations of the standard k c concept reflect primarily differences in the aerodynamic and surface resistances of the reference crop and of the crop being considered under well watered conditions eq 3 so that differences in et c are influenced mainly by climate pereira et al 1999 this contrasts with k c act because their differences may additionally be due to unique levels of water or salinity stress including when deficit irrigation is adopted or by specific non standard cropping practices e g when mulching or site specific irrigation management are applied such factors influencing crop management cause values for k c act to vary widely contrary to standard k c the extension of k s to saline environments is analyzed by minhas et al 2020 2 2 the crop coefficient curve the crop coefficient curve fig 1 represents the changes in k c or k cb over the length of the growing season allen et al 1998 both the single time averaged k c and the dual k c i e k cb and k e are represented the k c segmented curve is similar for k c and k cb while k e are represented by peaks that occur when soil wettings produce evaporation from the soil surface the curve consists of four linear segments representative of the four crop stages identified in fig 1 indicative time durations of crop stages were given in tables in fao56 and in publications by allen et al 2007c and jensen and allen 2016 despite fao56 recommendations for observing actual stage durations in field studies many articles refer to an inappropriate use of such tabulated crop growth stage lengths and deeply criticized them consequently it is now recommended to refrain from using the indicative durations in fao56 but instead use the actual field observations of crop growth stage durations as a function of days past planting as well as with cumulative growing degree days cgdd an earlier study on the subject is that by sammis et al 1985 various authors quoted in the current review used that approach the segmented curves for k c and k cb are approximate representations of changes in crop vegetation from planting to harvest that affect the ratio et c et o and inherently the ratio t c et o shortly after planting the value for k c is often small because the crop is in its earliest stage of development before attaining 10 cover this is the initial crop stage when k c and k cb are denoted k c ini and k cb ini they are represented fig 1 by a horizontal line because initial stage variation with time is small so they can be estimated by a single average value the next crop growth stage corresponds to crop development which concerns a great change of crop cover and height thus a large change in the et c et o and in t c et o ratios that change is represented by a segment whose slope corresponds to the average time rate of increase in k c from k c ini until its maximum which is attained during mid season thus noted k c mid and k cb mid the k c mid and k cb mid values refer to the period from when crop development growth ends and is replaced by the reproductive period until senescence starts during the mid season the ratios et c et o and t c et o have relatively small changes and k c mid may be approximated by a horizontal line after senescence starts the ratios et c et o and t c et o decrease until harvesting or the end of the crop season during this crop stage called late season k c and k cb decrease with an approximately constant rate which allow representing k c and k cb with a segmented slope corresponding to the rate of decrease of the ratios et c et o and t c et o that segment ends at harvesting or the end of the crop season when k c and k cb are denoted k c end and k cb end the advantage of the segmented k c curve is that it just requires knowing three values those at the initial stage k c ini k cb ini at mid season stage k c mid k cb mid and that at harvesting or at the end season k c end k cb end k c values during crop development and late season stages are then just linearly interpolated with time based on the three values using non linear k c or k cb representations requires appropriate curve fitting and various parameters to describe such curves which generally vary from a location to another and from a year to the next thus making it quite difficult if not impossible to transfer the k c information using more than four crop growth stages also increases the difficulties in transferring k c values since not only are more k c values required to represent the crop season but it is necessary to define the time limits of more crop stages k c and k cb are subject to a large number of influencing factors as summarized in fig 2 during the initial stage the variability of k c ini relates to soil evaporation and factors controlling it such as frequency of rainfall and irrigation wettings plastic mulches plastic tunnels organic mulching soil residues management frequency and depth of irrigation applications and fraction of soil wetted by irrigation with such a variety of influencing factors it is not possible to tabulate values for k c ini and it is not possible to derive related values from published papers fao56 provided indicative k c ini values corresponding to the most common conditions i e when surface irrigation was used and the soil was maintained bare however in many studies researchers considered indicative k c ini as recommended values and thus may have used them erroneously therefore k c ini values are not proposed herein instead the computational procedures proposed by allen et al 1998 pg 114 121 2005b are recommended simple models can be used for that purpose for the dual k c approach the value k cb ini 0 15 is recommended since it averages conditions from bare soil and fraction of ground cover f c up to 0 10 and it is assumed to include diffusive or residual evaporation from soil for potentially long periods following wetting allen et al 2005a however under dry conditions with long periods between wettings or during the non growing season k cb ini can be set much lower even close to 0 differently k e should be computed taking into consideration all the factors affecting soil evaporation as detailed by allen et al 2005a the same factors affect soil evaporation during the crop development stage but in a lesser extent since the fraction of ground shaded by the crop progressively increases thus reducing the amount of energy available for soil evaporation the effect of mulches also progressively reduces because the mulch cover slowly loses its potential characteristics particularly organic mulches plastic tunnels are generally removed during this stage for not affecting crop development during this crop stage more important than controlling e s is providing for good crop growth thus for the transpiration to increase during the crop development stage the aim is to provide rapid growth of healthy vegetation which leads k c and k cb to increase at often a great rate that large variation of k c and k cb makes it inappropriate to represent k c or k cb by an average value which would be necessarily over estimated at the earlier stage of crop growth and largely under estimated when approaching mid season as well evidenced in figs 1 and 2 when canopy is fully developed during mid season and the reproductive phase develops k c mid and k cb mid are at maximum levels the fraction of ground shaded by vegetation is then maximal while the energy available for evaporation is minimal thus soil evaporation and k e are minimal k c mid and k cb mid are largely dependent upon the plant density and height allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020b by the mid season the effects of various practices to control soil evaporation become less important while k c mid and k cb mid turn to be more influenced by climate particularly rh min and u 2 especially when crop height is high during the late season annual crops are senescing leaves turn yellow and fall f c progressively decreases and e s increases while k c and k cb decrease it is therefore inappropriate to represent k c or k cb by a late season average value since their rate of decrease may be quite large particularly when k c end or k cb end are much lower than k c mid and k cb mid figs 1 and 2 impacts of climate may be less important however during late season the main influencing factor refers to the objective of crop harvesting e g if the crop is to be consumed fresh the k cend is high as for table vegetables contrarily if to be stored dry as with small grains k c end is low this variety of conditions determining the k c and k cb values make it challenging to tabulate them and naturally just allow to adequately tabulate values referring to the mid season and end season harvesting however difficulties are increased when reported information about the experiments is insufficient the quoted papers allen et al 2011a b were prepared at request of journal editors to avoid that lack of information in the following reviewed data focused on papers producing reasonable information and cropping under standard conditions only 2 3 adjustment of observed k c and k c b to climate the standard transferable k c mid and k c end values represent k cb k e for irrigation management and precipitation frequencies typical of a sub humid climate where rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 as defined in fao56 allen et al 1998 under humid and calm conditions the k c for full cover agricultural crops generally do not exceed 1 0 by more than about 0 05 because full cover agricultural crops and the reference crop behave similarly regarding absorption of short wave radiation the primary energy source for evaporation under humid and calm conditions because the vpd is small under humid conditions differences in et caused by differences in the aerodynamic resistance r a between the agricultural and the reference crop are also small especially with low to moderate wind speed as explained by allen et al 1998 and pereira et al 1999 then the values of k c are less dependent on differences between the aerodynamic components of et c and et o eq 3 on the contrary under arid conditions the effect of differences in r a between the agricultural and the reference crop on et c become more pronounced because the vpd is then large hence k c will be larger under arid conditions mainly for tall crops that are more subjected to wind effects in terms of replacing the saturated air close to the leaves with drier air thus accelerating evaporation fluxes because the transferable k c mid and k c end should represent conditions where rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 when local climatic conditions deviate from these values the observed k c values k c mid obs and k c end obs need to be adjusted to become the standard k c values k c mid std and k c end std as 5a k c m i d s t d k c m i d o b s 0 04 u 2 m i d 2 0 004 r h min m i d 45 h 3 0 3 5b k c e n d s t d k c e n d o b s 0 04 u 2 l a t e 2 0 004 r h min l a t e 45

that those averages refer to the observations during respectively the mid and late season the same adjustments apply to k cb thus 6a k c b m i d s t d k c b m i d o b s 0 04 u 2 m i d 2 0 004 r h min

and dry in the field k c end 0 45 no adjustment is necessary crop height should be observed in the field indicative values for h are tabulated by allen et al 1998 and in ancillary data tabulated in section 6 however it should be noted that tabulated h values may deviate from reality thus should not replace field observations 3 accuracy and requirements of field measurements for derivation of crop coefficients 3 1 limits on maximum values for et and crop coefficients with consideration of advection evaporation consists of the conversion of liquid water to vapor which requires substantial amounts of energy as discussed in various papers particularly by allen et al 2011a the availability of energy incident to vegetation constrains the potential evaporation rate and forces adherence to the law of conservation of energy considering the basic equation of the balance of energy 7 r n g λ et h it may be noticed that the available energy at the surface r n g is the source for both the latent and sensible heat flux respectively λ et and h if λ et exceeds r n g it means that an additional energy is extracted from the atmosphere via downward sensible heat flux h via convective transfer through the equilibrium boundary layer of air above the surface allen et al 2011a increasingly negative h requires the transport by wind of the required h to the surface to support the conversion to et de bruin et al 2005 as a result there is an upper limit on et even under extreme advection caused by limitations on aerodynamic transport and on equilibrium forces above a vegetation canopy as discussed by allen et al 2011a that upper limit on potential crop evapotranspiration et c is readily approximated by comparing against the widely used reference et o through the crop coefficient k c values for k c may approach 1 3 for tall dense crops under windy arid and semiarid conditions because of the smooth roughness and small lai of the grass reference crop cf eq 3 in humid climates et is dominated more by net radiation availability and less by aerodynamics and vpd because the grass reference crop has an albedo similar to that of many crops at full cover based on total energy constraints where a majority of energy for the et process is from net radiation and regional advection is relatively minor the k c generally cannot exceed about 1 2 to 1 3 relative to the grass reference in arid and semiarid climates differences in aerodynamic and surface resistances when coupled with potentially strong regional advection may cause k c to be as high as 1 2 to exceptionally high values of 1 4 for tall dense healthy and well watered vegetation allen et al 2011a measuring et from small expanses of vegetation should be avoided when the objective is to represent general conditions of crop et for medium to large say 200 m fields or clusters of small fields as discussed by allen et al 2011a when et is measured from small expanses of vegetation the internal boundary layer above the vegetation may not be in equilibrium with the surface and may not have developed up to the height of any meteorological or flux instrumentation moreover small expanses of vegetation surrounded by shorter or dry cover cause a clothesline effect and et from the isolated stands may be significantly greater than the corresponding et o thus not representing large expanses this may also happen when using lysimeters since the vegetation inside the lysimeter may function as a clothesline allen et al 1991b reported measured et from 0 6 m fescue grass to increase by 1 6 times relative to the penman monteith equation when the surrounding grass was clipped to 0 1 m but the vegetation inside the lysimeter remained at 0 6 m summarizing if et estimates are to represent large expanses of vegetation or small stands of vegetation surrounded by mixtures of other vegetation having similar roughness and soil water conditions then k c values must generally be 1 2 1 4 for grass reference advective transport of heat is referred above as an additional source of latent heat through conversion of sensible heat sensible heat advection may play a major role in crop et studies on crop et reporting on advection were more common a few decades ago than they are at present despite progresses in instrumentation which would allow an easy use of indicators under advection λ et exceeds r n g and h becomes very small often negative which corresponds also to the bowen ratio β h λ et to become null or negative there is not a common terminology relative to advection brakke et al 1978 referred to local and regional advection of sensible heat and reported that regional advection observed for an alfalfa irrigated field largely depended upon wind speed while advection at local scale mainly depended upon dryness of air thus from vpd their observations performed in the american great plains indicated that regional sensible heat advection supplied 7 to 40 of energy consumed as latent heat while local advection corresponded to 1 to 14 of such energy local advection was referred by itier et al 1978 as depending upon the fetch the roughness length of the crop the wind speed friction velocity and the temperature difference between the dry and irrigated fields these authors proposed to correct a posteriori the et measured by means of weighing lysimeters soil water balance or sap flow method when the fetch is not large enough to avoid advection effects this correction can be of 1 2 mm d 1 for temperature differences between dry and irrigated fields of 5 10 c itier et al 1978 rana and katerji 2000 the conceptual approaches used by brakke et al 1978 and itier et al 1978 are different but not contradictory differently a previous study by hanks et al 1971 defined large scale advection however not corresponding to the regional advection referred by previous referred authors and border advection considered to occur over most of the plot irrigated but mainly from 0 to 40 m from the upwind edge and yielding sufficient energy to account for about 30 of the energy used for evapotranspiration the former large scale and border advection are different from the regional and local advection defined by brakke et al 1978 and itier et al 1978 these differences illustrate conceptual difficulties that do not favor assessments of advection in current crop et studies de bruin et al 2005 performed micrometeorological observations over extensive well irrigated alfalfa fields in kimberly idaho and observed that on a number of days and during daytime h was negative and λ et r n the energy required for λ et r n was therefore advected from elsewhere which the authors referred to as regional advection since the fields were large differently those authors designed as local advection the advection process where the wet to dry transition is on a field scale they observed λ et r n by about 50 for most of august and september when dry air was advected from large desert areas upwind of kimberly de bruin et al 2005 assumed that for large horizontally homogeneous fields where the atmospheric flow is in equilibrium with the underlying surface the air temperature and humidity in the atmospheric surface layer are well adapted to the irrigated field and no longer have the properties of the dry upwind terrain this assumption implies that a negative h occurs if the atmosphere just above the surface is stably stratified and the negative buoyancy effects suppress turbulent motions thus the turbulence needed for vertical transfer of water vapor only occurs if there is enough wind to offset the damping effects of stability and the influence of the upwind dry terrain will increase with increasing wind speed contrarily under calm conditions daily λ et cannot exceed r n as referred by those authors considering vertical exchange of eddies or air parcels under conditions that h 0 and λ et 0 it is expected that upward moving eddies contain relatively cool and wet air whereas downward moving parcels will be warm and dry consequently the correlation coefficient of turbulent temperature and humidity measurements rtq is expected to be negative conversely when both h and λ et are 0 rtq should be positive those authors therefore proposed rtq as indicator for advection conditions moreover the referred behavior of the eddies disturbs eddy covariance measurements and impacts the energy balance closure thus obliging to careful corrections paw et al 2000 chávez et al 2009 xu et al 2017 energy and water balance of paddies evidenced the occurrence of advection considering that the temperature difference of flooded paddies to surrounding areas was quite large this is the case of the study by lourence and pruitt 1971 who demonstrated the occurrence of advection through the ratio λ et r n where values close to or larger than 1 indicate a reduced or negative h the same approach was used by peterschmitt and perrier 1991 lang et al 1974 studied advection in paddy rice defining a linear relationship between advection and the distance to the upwind edge of the field more recently various studies recognized impacts of advection on various field crops et in the great plains usa e g tolk et al 2006 referred that advected h contributed up to 38 of energy used in λ et of alfalfa and with up to 3 mm d 1 of night time et and payero and irmak 2013 relative to soybean studies from northwest china also identified an important contribution of regional advection to crop et e g the study by ding et al 2015 reporting that advection h may contribute with 4 to 28 of the k c value and the study by tian et al 2017 relative to cotton however there are no indications that oversized k c or k cb due to advection were corrected when to be used as standard values microscale advection was referred by kar et al 2007 relative to crop coefficient studies of oilseed crops due to small size of plots which may have induced k c values up to 23 higher than the values reported by fao56 lund and soegaard 2003 referred to within canopy advection of sensible heat from the dry soil to the millet plants so increasing transpiration this type of micro advection was earlier reported by hanks et al 1971 for sorghum and by heilman et al 1994 for a vineyard the within canopy advection results from the conversion of h at the inter row into λ et of the plants row this micro advection justifies why plastic mulch contributes to increased transpiration while reducing k c less than it could be expected lund and soegaard 2003 however studies referring to plastic mulch effects on k c generally do not consider this process above refer to field crops and only a few studies relative to vegetable crops have reported on solutions for experimental layouts aiming at minimizing advection impacts nevertheless it is important to recognize that the accuracy of determining k c and or k cb for vegetable crops implies considering when advection contributes to increased energy available for et thus augmenting k c values with implications on their transferability 3 2 et measurement accuracy and requirements the exceedance of measured or reported k c above 1 2 for grass reference in sub humid regions or above about 1 2 to 1 4 for grass reference in arid regions should give cause for intense scrutiny of the et measurements the weather data used to calculate et o and the data processing procedure that scrutiny is basically formulated by allen et al 2011a b when revising the requirements for accurate et measuring and the need for related data reporting readers are therefore referred to both papers nevertheless herein we emphasize some essential aspects influencing accuracy of measurements which therefore relate with the quality of derived k c values a deep and complete analysis on field measurements using weighing lysimeters neutron probes soil water balance bowen ratio energy balance breb instruments and eddy covariance flux towers including the assessment of advection effects has been provided by evett et al 2012a b scintilometers are not referred in the selected papers reporting on k c values but they are useful et measuring devices that proved accurate as analyzed by moorhead et al 2017 determining et through computing the soil water balance swb by measuring the change in soil water over the crop season or a selected period of time has been used for a long time earlier using gravimetric soil sampling lately with a variety of sensors including continuous measurements e g reviews by evett et al 2006 2012c major potential errors in et determined by the swb using gravimetric neutron scattering capacitance time domain reflectometry or water potential measurement of soil water include insufficient characterization of the soil hydraulic properties including their spatial and vertical variability and often inadequate consideration of properties over the full root zone depth i e without referring to the entire depth where root uptake activity takes place inadequate vertical spacing of observations and or frequency of observations as well as inadequate representativeness of observed data of actual field conditions inaccuracies in measuring precipitation and irrigation applications or in measuring soil water content and or potential mainly when sensors are not duly calibrated differential spatial wetting of soil due to local spatial variation in irrigation or precipitation for example with bed furrow systems partial drip line wetting or with plastic mulch as well as due to non uniformity of irrigation application inadequate estimation of deep percolation losses and or gains by capillary rise differential spatial extraction of soil water due to spatial variation in root systems e g in the case of trees and when partial root zone drying is used lack of care in obtaining samples or taking readings or installing access tubes or sensors which can significantly alter the plant cover at the sampling site and or alter the density aeration and infiltration characteristics of the surface soil from foot traffic and lack of care during excavation or backfilling soil which may alter soil water extraction and result in poor estimates of et that do not represent actual field et adopting a reliable soil water balance simulation model and taking care in model calibration and validation can be very helpful in overcoming most of the referred problems in estimating et since they provide an alternative means to detect soil water behavior over time various examples relative to the accurate derivation of k c and k cb using the models isareg and simdualkc are referred throughout this paper in addition results from a calibrated model may provide appropriate support for irrigation scheduling and estimation of deep fluxes lysimeters have been used extensively to provide baseline information on et and crop coefficients however lysimeter measurements of et are extremely sensitive to environmental factors many of which are ignored in practice lysimeter measurements are point measurements representing et from areas ranging from 0 05 to 40 m2 but they are commonly used to characterize et and k c for large areas extrapolating data from small to large areas requires that vegetative and environmental conditions of lysimeter systems closely duplicate one dimensional et from the larger areas if improperly managed from an environmental context measured et can differ from the actual et of a large expanse of vegetation by as much as 50 to 100 the lysimetry symposium edited by allen et al 1991b provides several examples of poor lysimeter systems and guidelines for the operation of lysimeters to ensure high quality data for et lysimeters can be grouped as constant water table types drainage types and weighing types the latter when well managed can provide the most accurate data for short time periods when lysimeter facilities are appropriate results from drainage or percolation lysimeters can be accurate if there is also accuracy in observing changes in soil water content the use of models may help produce accurate k c and et results with these systems liu et al 1998 lópez urrea et al 2006 and evett et al 2016 provided for appropriate descriptions and related analysis on using weighing lysimeters for et determination care placed on setting the lysimeters in field on their management and on the management of the crops in the field and in the lysimeters have clearly improved the quality of derived k c values reported in various studies performed with lysimeter et facilities as reported in papers by lópez urrea et al 2009a b c 2014 contrarily some high crop coefficients reported in the literature may result from inappropriate settings and management of lysimeters that caused local and micro scale advection as well as clothesline effects as reported by allen et al 2011a the et accuracy of lysimeters thus of derived k c values depend upon a variety of factors including soil conditions inside the lysimeters must be the same as those outside to insure that the vegetation density water availability vigor evaporation from the soil surface and thus et are the same the lysimeter must be surrounded by the same vegetation that is growing in the lysimeter to insure one dimensionality of the measurement allen et al 1991a lysimeters surrounded by sidewalks or gravel or planted with vegetation different from that outside will not provide accurate et results due to local advection clothesline effect lysimeters should be located with a fetch large enough from the edge of the field such that the equilibrium boundary layer of air can be considered to be fully adjusted above the lysimeter differences in growth and maturity between the lysimeter plants and surrounding plants must be minimal to avoid differences in et measured inside and outside of the lysimeter relative to et measured in the surrounding area pruitt and lourence 1985 in addition flawed lysimeter results can be due to the so called bloom effect where the area of exposed plant canopy has exceeded the effective area of the lysimeter the effective evaporating and transpiring area of the lysimeter must be well recognized a high exposed rim that must be avoided due to its thermal conditions and advective effects the bowen ratio energy balance breb method enables solving the energy balance equation by measuring simple gradients of air temperature t and vapor pressure e a in the near surface layer above the evaporating surface the method works best when soil water is not limiting et as water becomes less readily available the bowen ratio br increases and the relative error in et increases payero et al 2003 described relative errors associated with the breb method as well as techniques for data quality analysis the breb equation for application to vegetation is 8 λ e t r n g 1 β where λ et is latent heat flux i e et expressed in terms of energy r n is net radiation g is soil heat flux density into the ground and β is the bowen ratio h λ et details on breb computations can be found in fritschen and fritschen 2005 large differences in measured et between breb and lysimeters were reported by todd et al 2000 when the bowen ratios were 0 on hot dry and windy days or when the λ et flux exceeded the available energy r n g thus there is need for careful scrutiny of breb observations when advection occurs requirements of the bowen ratio include sufficient distance of fetch to establish an equilibrium boundary layer deeper than the instrument height sufficient elevation of instrument above the canopy to avoid the roughness sublayer representative measurement of r n and g multiple net radiometers and soil heat flux stations when observations are performed over a heterogeneous or sparse crop eddy covariance ec systems are widely used at present for et measurement because of ease of set up reduced costs for sensors and the ability to co measure h λ e and co 2 fluxes depending on the equipment configuration allen et al 2011a the concept of eddy covariance refers to the statistical covariance between vertical fluxes of vapor or sensible heat within upward and downward legs of turbulent eddies et can also be computed as a residual from the energy balance equation as λ et r n g h where sensible heat flux density is measured by eddy covariance which has advantages in terms of instrumentation required however with the need to measure r n and g accurately the vertical component of wind w is generally measured using a sonic anemometer and t is measured using ultra fine wire thermocouples or using sonically determined temperature corrected for humidity effects specific humidity is measured using quick response hygrometers numerous corrections are required and a variety of software are available for correction of ec data paw et al 2000 reported on equations to correct eddy covariance measurements for both fluctuations in density and non zero mean advection induced by convergence or divergence of flow and spatial source sink inhomogeneity under steady state and transient conditions corrections and precautions for eddy covariance were reviewed by burba 2013 the quality of data highly depends upon the environmental conditions for instance flux divergence due to the local advection of warm and dry air over the irrigated fields was analyzed by alfieri et al 2012 assessments of correction needs and related improvements are reported by several authors particularly evett et al 2012b who provided for an adjustment for the effect of advection of energy across the field to the ec stations resulting in reducing the ec station et error to the 6 7 range much literature documented energy balance closure error for eddy covariance data referring to the fact that the sum of measured λ et h does not equal measured r n g often λ e and h can be undermeasured relative to r n g by as much as 30 wilson et al 2002 foken 2008 sánchez et al 2019 possible reasons for the lack of closure include storage of heat in canopies horizontal advection energy used by photosynthesis change in storage of heat in the developing boundary layer below the instrumentation causing flux divergence measurement errors of turbulent fluxes separation of sensors and error or bias in r n or g commonly users close the energy balance by scaling h and λ e in the same proportion until the sum equals r n g however the method used to enforce the energy balance closure is less important than making sure that ec measurements are coherent with conservation of energy twine et al 2000 a recent study by kutikoff et al 2019 demonstrated that days associated with advection exhibited poor surface energy balance compared to all other days heat storage pushed the daytime energy balance closure upward by as much 25 during advection conditions energy balance closure cannot be considered as a data quality test since closure error can still be present even if data acquired by the eddy covariance system are of high quality and vice versa allen et al 2011a requirements of the eddy covariance method include sufficient quite large fetch to establish an equilibrium boundary layer deeper than the instrument height sufficient elevation of instruments above the canopy to reduce roughness sublayer impacts and to increase mean eddy size to match the sensor path length performing the required data corrections particularly adjustments to consider the effects of advection accurate high frequency instrumentation and ability to recognize the occurrence of advection because advective energy modifies energy partitioning which further enhances turbulent fluxes as observed by kutikoff et al 2019 correcting data for the energy balance closure error r n g λ e h namely caring for the effects of advection check data when wind direction changes and or when flow lines change with turbulence and when advection occurs remote sensing vegetation indices vi have been often used to estimate crop coefficients bausch and neale 1987 hunsaker et al 2005 campos et al 2010 calera et al 2017 the estimate of k c and k cb from vis relates to the fact that there is generally a close correspondence between vegetation amount and transpiration i e as vegetation cover increases leaf area increases and transpiration increases reviewed in glenn et al 2011 in addition frequent monitoring of crops with a vi can provide guidance to adjust the durations of crop growth stages and adjust fractional crop cover which are difficult to assess visually in real time hunsaker et al 2007 difficulties arise in vi based methods when trying to estimate evaporation from bare soil because related soil water processes cannot be adequately reflected in a vi however once the crop is established vi s can monitor the seasonal crop growth adequately the most commonly used vi for k c and k cb estimation is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi glenn et al 2011 which is estimated from reflectance in the red 0 6 0 7 μ m and the near infrared bands 0 7 1 3 μ m linear relationships between the ndvi and the crop coefficient are referred in numerous studies namely some referred hereafter generally ndvi values from different satellites show close correlation calera belmonte et al 2005 but some differences occur due to differences in band widths however the degree and type of atmospheric correction of the image can also influence those differences with k c vs ndvi or other vi it is important to distinguish whether the relationships are to represent the average et that includes soil evaporation or are to represent just the basal k c b the latter condition assumes that the vi based relationships are established to represent conditions where the soil surface is dry and soil evaporation is low when compared to transpiration the relationship k cb vs ndvi is more consistent than k c vs ndvi because transpiration is more closely associated with the vegetation amount as estimated by ndvi than is total et that includes evaporation from soil when k c b vs ndvi relationship is used estimates for soil evaporation must be determined separately and added to produce total et burnett et al 2008 allen et al 2011b showed that ndvi was a better basis for the k c vs vi relationship than was the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 because while ndvi tends to reach a maximum value at about the same time as does k c savi tends to continue to increase with increasing lai beyond 3 0 pôças et al 2015 observed that ndvi k cb relationships were better than savi k cb ones for field crops but savi k cb relationships were better for olives allen et al 2011b also showed that the vi calculation can be based on top of atmosphere reflectance or on at surface reflectance with little reduction in estimation accuracy meanwhile with the new satellite sentinel2 a slightly better performance of new vis has been reported e g rozenstein et al 2018 the current use of k c vi relationships to estimate et requires field validation such as ec measurements or using satellite based et energy balance large areas can be covered with remote sensing and data may be used to map et in such areas however the k c values obtained in those circumstances are based on actual et conditions and thus not standard and transferable but the latter may be obtained when applications focus on specific areas where crops are managed in a pristine way as described by hunsaker et al 2003 2005 for cotton and wheat these matters are reviewed by pôças et al 2020 in the current special issue remote sensing energy balance is often used to estimate et from large areas some operational satellite based energy balance models such as sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a b 2005 and metric allen et al 2007a b employ an internal calibration technique referred to as cimec calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions allen et al 2008 they may also be used to estimate k c of small expanses of vegetation good results were obtained by mateos et al 2013 and pôças et al 2015 paço et al 2014 used the energy balance model metric combined with the soil water balance model simdualkc remotely sensed energy balance techniques are useful for identifying areas experiencing water stress and corresponding reductions in et for example the two source energy balance tseb kustas et al 2004 also a thermal model can be used to diagnose et under a wide range of crop water stress and also has the capacity to estimate both transpiration and evaporation french et al 2018 users of this information must bear in mind that satellite based et data are simply retrievals or best estimates of an aerodynamic and radiative process as viewed from space and cannot be considered measurements nevertheless remotely sensed energy balance is discussed here because of its increasing use to estimate k c and et over large areas estimation by remotely sensed energy balance should be expected to adhere to the same limitations and physics as other measurement methods 3 3 implications on collecting k c information from literature crop coefficients k c and k cb reported in literature were obtained from studies having a variety of objectives field methods and data handling procedures the related publication resulted from diverse publication criteria resulting from the journal requirements and the objectives of the studies as described before difficulties in using the published information relate to the insufficiencies of information provided which could affect the accuracy of methods and procedures used as much as possible the aspects dealt by allen et al 2011a b were followed as referred in section 3 2 above particularly for crops that were the focused on numerous studies exceptions were for crops that have been object of few rare studies when insufficient climatic data were available rh min and u 2 used with eqs 5 and 6 where obtained from the internet for the locations where experimentation took place if various studies were available such data sets were discarded data relative to experiments where k c or k cb were given by selected periods or using a non linear equation relating then to time were only used to approximate their mid season values if data on the considered crop were insufficient when information on lysimeter setting was not stating the area cropping around it or the care for limiting micro scale advection or clothesline effects or about determining the effective evaporation area k c data were treated as influenced by advection if various sources of k c for the same crop were available data were discarded if those sources were insufficient then k c or k cb values were reduced by 15 as a rule of tomb to correct excess k c due to less good lysimeter management if k c end k c mid data were necessarily discarded if k c mid 1 40 without appropriate explanation data were discarded when lacking adequate description of procedures used with swb breb ec or else that could justify those high values a similar rule of tomb was used to correct k c mid or k cb mid when the reported k c or k cb adjusted for the standard climate produced season averaged 1 40 k c mid 1 25 and or 1 35 k cb mid 1 20 naturally end season values were reduced proportionally there is a good number of studies on deriving crop coefficients k c and k cb for most vegetable crops however only a part of the published studies is effectively usable when aiming at consolidated updates of standard k c and k cb values updates were only performed for the mid and end season values given the enormous variability of values reported for the initial stage non selected crop coefficient literature refers to studies that did not adopt the fao56 segmented crop coefficient curve namely describing k c as a non linear function of time which may be adequate for local purposes in climates with small variability of climate were performed along a single crop season with insufficient discussion that could allow evaluation of whether one year environmental characteristics led to appropriately or poorly assessed k c or k cb values adopted a reference evapotranspiration different from the grass fao pm or the grass asce pm et o such as pan et the fao24 penman or the hargreaves samani equation insufficiently described the methods used to measure or estimate crop evapotranspiration and therefore did not allow understanding about the quality of performed field work and related data analysis lacked appropriate description of experimental agronomic conditions thus when it was not possible to assume that derived k c referred to a non stressed crop well adapted to the prevailing environmental conditions a common problem was that climate descriptions were insufficient and consequently the papers presenting data on the variables used to adjust observed k c and k cb to the standard climate eqs 5 and 6 i e rh min u 2 and crop height averages for the mid and end season were very rare therefore it was necessary to find estimated parameters using internet information to resolve the observed k c or k cb data to the standard climate knowing the location of the experiments a search for climate data relative to those experimental years and growth periods was performed and the resultant climate values were used in cases when data for the experimental location could not be found data for a nearby location was used while it was evident that the average climate values used from the internet searches provided less accurate adjustment for the actual k c and k cb reported however without that data it would not have been possible to perform that adjustment for most of collected information the large majority of papers also did not provide information on observed crop heights and so the maximum heights tabulated in fao56 for the crops were used for this adjustment the included papers refer to a variety of approaches used to estimate et c act the approaches consist of weighing lysimeters wl data were used when wl were installed in large fields where it is possible to assume that local advection or clothesline effects did not affect results when weighing lysimeter description was insufficient or when the average k c mid and k c end values largely exceeded those observed by other authors and or tabulated in fao56 those papers were discarded drainage or water table lysimeters dl and wtl data were used when soil moisture observations were performed complementarily to lysimeter observations and information provided was sufficient to assume that local advection or clothesline effects did not affect results as for wl if average k c mid and k c end were excessive related dl and wtl papers were also discarded energy balance from measurements of eddy covariance ec and or bowen ratio breb data were used when proper location of towers was reported correction methods were mentioned and closure error was discussed soil water balance swb data were selected when there was adequate information on location depth and frequency of observations deep percolation was considered and there was evidence that computed soil moisture dynamics followed that of observations in addition plots in accepted studies had to have a minimum size to avoid local advection or clothesline effects swb models data were used when there was evidence of model calibration and validation models considered included isareg pereira et al 2003 chaterlán et al 2011 mopeco domínguez et al 2011 martínez romero et al 2019 and simdualkc rosa et al 2012 paredes et al 2018 the growth yield model aquacrop rinaldi et al 2011 was also considered remote sensing of vegetation index ndvi or savi used when at least two years of observations were used information allowed to perceive that ndvi or savi were obtained for a non stressed crop and when the relationship between the crop coefficient and the vegetation index were properly calibrated tested remote sensing energy balance used when measurements adhered to the same limitations and physics as other measurement methods the subscript obs is adopted to identify the collected k c and k cb values reported in literature as being obtained from field observations of et c act aiming at transferability those collected crop coefficients were adjusted to the standard climate and are identified with the subscript std thus indicating that such values are standard single or basal crop coefficients reported k c std or k cb std were very rare so the adjustments to climate using eqs 5 and 6 were the rule for all crops actual k c obs are reported more often than k cb obs likely because the derivation of the latter requires the partition of et c act performing that partition is quite demanding both in terms of field data collection e g with wl or the use of a specific computation algorithm which may be incorporated in simulation models such as the simdualkc model collected information are presented in tables for all groups of crops for each group tables include the common english name and the scientific name of the crop the reference of the selected paper the location where field data were collected which allow a sense of the climate type the field method used to gather data aimed at estimating et c act as discussed above the irrigation method used information on the reported k c mid obs and k c end obs or on the k cb mid obs and k cb end obs and crop coefficient values adjusted to the standard climate thus k c mid std and k c end std or the k cb mid std and k cb end std additional tables are used to provide collected field information on main ancillary crop parameters that are often used in water balance studies namely for irrigation scheduling purposes and that were consistently proposed in fao56 these parameters consist of maximum root depth z r max m maximum crop height h max m maximum leaf area index lai max m2 m 2 maximum fraction of ground cover f c max and soil water depletion fractions for no stress p at the initial mid season and end season p ini p mid and p end for many crops unfortunately the ancillary information is incomplete or lacking it may be noted that most of ancillary parameters were provided by studies using a soil water balance approach or when a dual k c approach was adopted however we did include ancillary data for certain studies though not usable for standard crop coefficients due to non pristine crop conditions e g obvious water stress these studies with ancillary data were retained as they met all other requirements e g proper et o and et c act measurements large fields etc general guidelines to derive k cb from the standard k c values tabulated are those used in fao56 allen et al 1998 mid season ground cover f c more than 80 9a k cb mid k c mid 0 05 ground cover f c less than 80 9b k cb mid k c mid 0 10 at end of season infrequently irrigated or wetted during late season 10a k cb end k c end 0 05 frequently irrigated or wetted during late season 10b k cb end k c end 0 10 when f c is large as it commonly occurs with vegetables soil evaporation is small because most of the ground area is shadowed therefore a limited amount of short wave radiation is available for providing energy for soil water evaporation this fact limits differences among irrigation methods and the effects of mulch since mulch effects were not considered in this report users should make the necessary adjustments if required 4 review on derived single and basal crop coefficients 4 1 roots tubers bulbs and stem vegetable crops collected single and basal crop coefficients obtained from literature for roots tubers bulbs and stem vegetable crops are presented in table 1 k c mid std and k c end std tabulated in table 1 as well as k cb mid std and k cb end std were compared among studies relative to the same or similar crop and with values tabulated in fao56 the crop coefficient values reported in the selected literature generally show coherence however discrepancies exist that mainly occur at the end season of some crops e g onion and garlic because crop management and environmental conditions prior to harvesting which influence the duration of senescence and the soil dryness at the harvest may differ from a location to another and with the crop variety the number of selected papers reporting on deriving k c or k cb for roots tubers bulbs and stem vegetable crops was not large many papers on these crops had to be discarded because they did not use the pm et o equation and or did not adopt research practices in agreement with the experimental requirements defined above which are needed for k c accuracy in addition some papers could not be selected as they did not provide a clear description of the crop itself nor of the field methods thus limiting ability to assess the accuracy of observations papers on various root crops whose k c and k cb were provided in fao56 parsnip turnip and table beets tuber crops radish and rutabaga and stem crops asparagus and celery are not available and related updates were not possible contrasting a common tropical sub tropical crop not previously considered in fao56 the taro colocasia esculenta is now added its edible part is a corm the study mabhaudhi et al 2013 was developed in south africa to assess the performance of three varieties under drip irrigation a swb based on fdr observations was used and has shown that k c end is almost as high as k c mid due to the crop preference for high moisture soils two papers were selected for cassava both referring to studies developed in thailand using breb and referring to rainfed crops watanabe et al 2004 attarod et al 2006 however reported k c mid and k c end are different between both studies which likely is a consequence of different rainfall conditions since both studies refer to rainfed crops five papers relative to the potato crop were selected sousa and pereira 1999 zairi et al 2003 tasumi and allen 2007 martínez romero et al 2019 paredes et al 2018 the latter using the dual k c approach values for k c for the mid season are quite similar but those for the end season diverge in particular the very low k c end std 0 10 reported by sousa and pereira 1999 refers to a specific management practice with harvesting after natural vine kill in the field the paper by tasumi and allen 2007 is the only one that distinguishes long from short season potato however both k c mid values are very close while no information was provided for k c end two papers on sweet potato were selected the first referring to the determination of et c act with a swb supported by neutron probe measurements however without using a model gomes and carr 2003 and the second reporting on the use of ec to measure et c act mulovhedzi et al 2020 the latter a more recent study reported smaller mid and end season crop coefficients than the former likely in relation to the variety the precision of the applied sprinkler irrigation and the accuracy of et measurements used the studies on potato and sweet potato derived seasonal et c act from a soil water balance swb based upon field observations the exceptions were the study by tasumi and allen 2007 which used remote sensing observations combined with the metric model and that by mulovhedzi et al 2020 using ec in a large sweet potato field soil water content swc measurements were performed with various methods and data analysis was performed with different swb models the isareg model sousa and pereira 1999 zairi et al 2003 the simdualkc model paredes et al 2018 and the mopeco model martínez romero et al 2019 an example of the dynamics of the crop coefficients for a fully irrigated and a water stressed potato crop is presented in fig 3 paredes et al 2018 results of both irrigation management strategies clearly show that k e is the main component of k c during the initial and early development stages which relates to the low soil coverage by the crop during those stages differently during the mid and late season stages k cb is the main component of k c under water stress conditions fig 3b the k cb act curve lays below the k cb curve starting shortly before mid season due to the effects of water stress plant canopy was also observed to cover less soil particularly in the late season which corresponded to higher k e peaks than those for fully irrigated potato water stress also influenced the actual k c curve which remained below the potential k cb curve during the mid season stage the analyses in fig 3 illustrate why selected papers were required to provide evidence that their derived k c or k cb were obtained for crops grown in well watered conditions five studies were also selected for onions two of them used weighing lysimeters lópez urrea et al 2009a piccinni et al 2009 one used swb with the model isareg chaterlán et al 2011 another consisted of drainage lysimeters using neutron probes to perform the water balance bossie et al 2009 and the last used a swb supported by tdr carvalho et al 2018 the latter study refers to harvesting onion green and thus k c end std was higher than those for dry onions while they had similar k c mid std values the study by lópez urrea et al 2009a derived both k c and k cb for onions whose time trends are depicted in fig 4 along one season results show that onion k cb is the main k c component during the mid and late season stages despite the numerous wetting events that occur during these stages this relates with the high ground cover by the crop during these stages however authors refer that advection may have influenced k c mid obs the k c mid std values reported in the selected papers for onions vary by about 20 but differences for k c end std are larger particularly when green harvested onion is considered there are four studies selected on garlic one used eddy covariance for et c act measurement villalobos et al 2004 and another used the isareg model as referred to before chaterlán et al 2011 the study by bryla et al 2010 reported on et c act measured with weighing lysimeters while the last paper used remote sensing for deriving basal crop coefficients johnson and trout 2012 the first two papers in the table report close k c mid std values but the chaterlán et al 2011 mid season value is much lower however the high k c end std values for two papers indicate harvest before senescence is completed while the two other studies provided low k c end std and k cb end std values indicating harvesting after vine kill these two latter studies are from california and indicate that garlic cropping practices there were similar likely with machine harvesting but quite different from those adopted elsewhere where harvesting is practiced before the crop fully senesces only two papers were selected for carrots chaterlán et al 2011 carvalho et al 2016 which describe swb applications for et c act the first using a gravimetric approach with the isareg model and the second a swb application based on tdr observations but without modeling both studies had similar k c mid std the study by carvalho et al 2016 shows a k c end std value quite close to k c mid std which indicates an early harvest for consuming fresh it is important to recognize the diverse geographical origin of the selected studies which were conducted in several european countries germany italy portugal and spain north central and south american countries usa cuba and brazil northern and southern african countries ethiopia tunisia south africa and mozambique and thailand these wide origins indicate that good studies were performed for various environmental and socio economic conditions which allow practitioners to better select appropriate research options when required often studies were performed with drip irrigation a few used micro sprinklers micro sprayers sprinklers or surface irrigation generally single crop coefficients tended to be smaller with drip irrigation corresponding with less soil wetting and smaller soil evaporation losses however due to the small set of papers for these crops it was not possible to quantitatively relate mid season differences in k c to irrigation method in addition regardless of irrigation method most crops attained effective full cover of the soil by the mid season which mitigates the possible reduction of k c mid due to mulches studies indicated in table 1 provided some information about main ancillary crop parameters that are used in water balance studies in conjunction with k c based et c estimates particularly for irrigation scheduling purposes these parameters are presented in table 2 unfortunately that information is missing or incomplete for various crops however the derived parameters are generally consistent for a given crop except for the p fraction in dry onions in general the ancillary crop data are also close to the fao56 parameters for these crops it may be noted that most of parameters were provided by studies using a soil water balance approach or when a dual k c approach was adopted 4 2 leaves and flowers vegetable crops collected single and basal crop coefficients obtained from literature for leaves and flowers vegetable crops are presented in table 3 tabled k c values are lower than those originally reported in cases when authors assumed k c mid as a maximum average for a period smaller than the mid season if the data were graphically presented it was then possible to estimate a lower average value for k c mid obs and it was also possible to better estimate k c end obs for a few cases when papers include a graphical presentation of the season dynamics of k cb and k e the k c values were estimated from k cb most studies were performed with drip irrigation only a few used micro sprinkling or micro sprayers and even fewer used furrow irrigation the k c tend to be smaller with drip irrigation since less soil is wetted often under the shadow provided by the canopy thus soil evaporation is smaller however since the frequency of drip irrigation may be very high e s may be less reduced comparatively to micro sprinklers or sprayers soil evaporation also is not high when by the mid season a full cover condition occurs and the energy available at the soil for evaporation is small because harvesting of leaves and flowers vegetable crops is commonly performed before senescence starts or when only a slight maturation occurs ground cover by vegetation is kept high and therefore soil evaporation is maintained small until harvesting therefore reductions in k c when using drip irrigation relative to micro sprinklers or micro sprayers likely do not exceed around 5 i e k c mid act for drip irrigation may be smaller by about 0 05 than for micro sprinklers or sprayers however various papers refer to larger k c differences up to 30 but do not show a justification for that high difference in actual et since values of the fraction of crop ground cover or differences in the radiation energy available at the soil are not reported since k cb values do not include soil evaporation k cb values likely do not change or change little with the irrigation method in the case of vegetable crops i e k cb mid and k cb end values should not change or change little when the crop nearly fully covers the ground contrarily e s varies much during the first crop stages when there is an incomplete ground cover differently the effects of mulch are expected to be larger when a plastic mulch is used the possible inter row process of conversion of sensible into latent heat may reduce the effects of the plastic mulch as noted by lund and soegaard 2003 who reported on the within canopy advection of sensible heat however this process was not referred in any of the selected studies research studies on deriving k c or k cb for brussels sprouts and cauliflower were not found only the study by grattan et al 1998 was selected for artichoke in this study furrow irrigation was used and et c act was measured using breb instrumentation with good fetch however their mid season k c was quite low when compared to artichoke tabled in fao56 three studies relative to broccoli were selected lópez urrea et al 2009b bryla et al 2010 johnson and trout 2012 which provided data on actual k c and k cb the first two were developed with weighing lysimeters and the latter with rs ndvi all of them provided for k cb data however different than the tabulated value for broccoli in fao56 they reported end season values equal to the mid season ones which indicates that harvesting for fresh human consumption is done when broccoli is green and tender i e before senescence starts to occur the same equality for mid and end season k c and k cb happens with lettuce and spinach table 3 an example showing the dynamics of k cb k e and k cb for broccoli is presented in fig 5 broccoli et c measurements were obtained from a large weighing lysimeter lópez urrea et al 2009b specifically et c values were calculated from lysimeter s daily mass loss minus drainage loss and the mass from irrigation and or rainfall was added k c data were calculated as the ratio of the lysimeter measured et c to et o computed daily with the fao56 pm equation the soil evaporation coefficient k e was calculated with the standard fao56 approach allen et al 1998 and afterwards the basal crop coefficient k cb was obtained from the lysimeter k c values minus the calculated k e values results in fig 5 show several k e peaks occurring in response to wetting events these peaks are particularly high during the initial and early crop development stages when the fraction of ground cover by the crop f c is small and therefore solar energy is largely available at the soil surface for evaporation during the mid and late seasons when f c is higher the k e peaks are smaller and k cb becomes the main component of k c as previously pointed out k cb end equals k cb mid because the broccoli was harvested before senescence cabbage crop coefficients are reported in a few papers but only two studies could be selected chaterlán et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 both performed a swb the first using a gravimetric approach along with the isareg model and the latter using watermark soil moisture sensors and a purposefully developed inverse modeling approach their calibrated k c values are close to those tabulated in fao56 thus with k c end std slightly smaller or equal to k c mid std this means that cabbage harvesting was performed early to assure tender produce thus with high k c end values zhang et al 2011 also reported on basal k cb values there are various studies reporting on k c and k cb for lettuce values for the mid season are not very different discordance comes from the fact that while three of them oliveira et al 2005 bryla et al 2010 giménez et al 2019 reported equal values for k c mid std and for k c end std the study by fernández pacheco et al 2014 proposes a lower value for k c end std the k cb values proposed for iceberg lettuce by bryla et al 2010 and johnson and trout 2012 are similar and both papers report a k c end std corresponding to early harvest when leaves are green and tender differently ramírez cuesta et al 2019 report a lower k cb end there is no apparent justification for this difference when it is well known that tenderness of leaves is paramount for marketing lettuce for green salad k c and k cb were obtained with various methods bryla et al 2010 used weighing lysimeters oliveira et al 2005 performed a swb and used dl with tdr observations fernández pacheco et al 2014 used breb and digital image processing and giménez et al 2019 used the model vegsyst outdoors calibrated and validated with dry matter production data finally johnson and trout 2012 computed k cb values with rs ndvi and ramírez cuesta et al 2019 used rs savi the crop coefficients for spinach reported by piccinni et al 2009 and giménez et al 2019 are very similar with k c end std k c mid std the former refers to determining et cact with wl while the latter computed et c act using the model vegsyst outdoors as referred above the reported studies provided ancillary data relative to a few crops only artichoke broccoli cabbage and lettuce which are presented in table 4 4 3 fruit and pod vegetable crops table 5 presents the observed actual k c mid obs and k c end obs and the respective values adjusted to the standard climate k c mid std and k c end std similarly observed and adjusted k cb values are shown in table 5 most selected studies refer to estimating single k c and only a few derived basal k cb values likely because the derivation of the latter is more demanding in terms of observations and computations aimed at the partition of et c act into crop transpiration t c act and soil evaporation e s some of the non selected papers for these crops are highly cited but had insufficient description of methodologies for computing et c act a good number of selected k c studies used lysimeters both wl and dl which included performing the swb supported by either tdr or fdr sensors in studies for tomato breb and ec instrumentation were used in addition a few swb studies were performed based upon neutron probe fdr tdr and gravimetric data collection the selected k cb studies used various approaches including one that estimated k cb from ndvi remote sensing data others used precise wl swb with models such as simdualkc rosa et al 2012 which was purposefully developed for application of the fao56 dual k c approach allen et al 2005a b the reported k c information in many selected papers was corrected for several reasons such as advection and clothesline effects as previously discussed tabled values reported by kong et al 2012 yang et al 2018 and bastos et al 2012 obtained in small plots were corrected to reduce those effects which likely caused the high k c values reported the k c end obs value for bell pepper reported by shukla et al 2013 was corrected to avoid the observed k c end value exceeding k c mid for papers using the cimis penman et o knowing that the latter exceeds the pm et o by 8 itenfisu et al 2003 the k c values were then corrected by 8 i e case of studies by grattan et al 1998 hanson and bendixen 2004 hanson and may 2006 the studies by karam et al 2009 yaghi et al 2013 and zhang et al 2018 were retained because they provided good ancillary information despite conducting experiments under water stress conditions and attaining low mid season k c values which were not considered for the updated k c values a number of research studies were performed with mulch mainly plastic sheets carvalho et al 2012 melo et al 2013 shukla et al 2013 2014 zheng et al 2013 biswas et al 2015 borges et al 2015 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 their effect was not considered since this review does not refer to the periods before the mid season when impacts of mulch in lowering e s are greater moreover by the mid season the canopy cover of vegetables that are consumed for fruit and pod is quite high thus reducing the impacts of mulches nevertheless users are invited to adopt a 5 to 10 k c correction if considered appropriate for their uses the study by carvalho et al 2012 evidenced a consistent reduction of k c mid std and k cend std when no till was used i e when crop residues act as a mulch nevertheless it has not been possible to assess the impacts of mulches which certainly tend to reduce both k c mid and k c end however depending on the fraction of ground cover f c which is rarely reported drip irrigation is the most common method referred in the selected references the research on squash reported by amer 2011 shows that k c values are larger for furrow irrigation comparatively to drip irrigation with k c mid std of 1 07 for furrows and 1 01 for drip the difference is small but gives some evidence assuming that the worldwide tendency will be towards adopting drip irrigation in vegetable crops production consideration needs to be given on adopting reduced k c and k cb values for drip as these selected papers using drip irrigation indicate the updated k c and k cb values in table 5 rarely increased relative to the fao56 tabled values as also discussed later in section 5 the selected studies relative to bell pepper and chili pepper capsicum annuum l used diverse research approaches to derive k c or k cb those by karam et al 2009 and bryla et al 2010 used well managed weighing lysimeters well located in large cropped fields the first also included the computation of the swb based upon tdr measurements the studies by kong et al 2012 and shukla et al 2013 were conducted with drainage lysimeters and the swb was performed with respectively tdr and fdr sensors the study by johnson and trout 2012 obtained k cb data by remote sensing of ndvi data the studies by alemayehu et al 2009 and yang et al 2018 were both performed using a swb procedure based upon respectively neutron probe and gravimetric measurements the study on chilli tabasco pepper capsicum frutescens l used a wl miranda et al 2006 comparing the k c mid std and k cb end std results among those studies it could be concluded that results reported by karam et al 2009 referred to non pristine cropping conditions and therefore could not be used to update k c values but could be used for the ancillary information table 6 the values of k cb end std are close to the k cb mid std values for bell pepper because harvesting is commonly performed when fruits are green and tender thus near to the mid season before senescence affects the marketable and taste characteristics of the fruit differently chili pepper fruits which are not consumed green need a longer late season to turn red and complete the synthesis of capsaicinoids the substances responsible for the hot taste of the fruits therefore the k cb end of chili peppers are lower than the k cb mid the study by alemayehu et al 2009 compared several chili pepper varieties however results for those varieties having lower k cb values were not included since they were likely collected under non pristine conditions this study clearly shows that k cb or k c values are influenced by the crop variety the study on tabasco pepper capsicum frutescens l by miranda et al 2006 identifies another aspect influencing the k c values for crops aimed at the fresh market harvesting may be performed through two harvesting periods which requires adopting two pairs k cb mid k cb end instead of a unique value for the mid and the end season table 5 and fig 6 results in fig 6 show that after the first harvest thus during the second crop cycle the k c mid value is lower than that of the first cycle which may be related to less intense flowering and fruit development few studies report on k c or k cb for eggplant and only one was retained carvalho et al 2012 this study compared no till with conventional tillage and results show that k c for no till are smaller than those for conventional tillage due to the effect of the residue cover this demonstrates impacts of crop residues on k c quite large in the referred application since the eggplant usually leaves a relatively large ground fraction exposed to radiation moreover results indicate that k c end should be close to k c mid since the fruit should be harvested tender several studies focusing on tomato k c and k cb were selected they used a variety of procedures to estimate crop et hanson and may 2006 used both breb and swb while rana et al 2012 adopted ec observations swb models were used by yacoubi et al 2010 and zhang et al 2018 the former with the isareg model and neutron probe measurements and the latter with the simdualkc model and gravimetric swc measurements swb based upon gravimetric soil sampling were used by rinaldi et al 2011 whereas zheng et al 2013 used a swb based upon tensiometer observations and derived k c with the allen and pereira 2009 approach for estimating k c from crop density and height garofalo et al 2011 used wl while biswas et al 2015 used dl the observed k cb by zhang et al 2018 was quite low the reported information allows identifying the occurrence of water stress therefore only related ancillary data were further used for that study table 6 contrarily to the small variation of k c mid std the tomato values for k c end std varied widely from 1 05 zheng et al 2013 to 0 63 yacoubi et al 2010 that variability in cases of tomato for fresh market likely was due to differences in crop management particularly when harvesting is practiced throughout several days or weeks differently the studies relative to tomato for processing hanson and may 2006 rana et al 2012 do not provide k c end but their authors state that harvest was performed after the beginning of senescence thus under these conditions k c end should be lower but close to k c mid only two studies focusing on k c for cucumber were retained both refer to using swb procedures one adopting a gravimetric approach amer et al 2009 and the second using neutron probe yaghi et al 2013 the low k c values reported by the latter led to assuming water stress impacts and therefore reported k c values were not considered for the updates of fao56 weighing lysimeters were used in two melon studies miranda and bleicher 2001 melo et al 2013 while a breb was used by borges et al 2015 in all studies drip irrigation was used which likely reduced soil evaporation impacts of plastic mulch on k c are evident since k c values reported by miranda and bleicher 2001 when not using mulch are much larger than those reported in other studies with mulch only one k c study was selected for pumpkins yavuz et al 2015 another for squash amer 2011 and also one reporting on k cb for zucchini squash by darouich et al 2020 the former used a swb approach with gravimetric soil water measurements the second also used a swb with fdr measurements and the latter used a swb with neutron probe and data handling with the simdualkc model in addition the study by amer 2011 compared k c values for drip and furrow irrigation showing a reduction with drip relative to furrow of around 5 table 5 three publications reporting on crop coefficients for watermelon were selected two used weighing lysimeters miranda et al 2004 bastos et al 2012 while the third used drainage lysimeters and installed plastic mulch shukla et al 2014 thus resulting in k c mid values smaller than the former ones the end season k c are very different which relates with the duration of the harvesting period longer when k c end is smaller there are few publications reporting on crop coefficients for irrigated okra and information provided in these studies is insufficient selected references consist of those developed by the extension services of the university of florida dukes et al 2015 and by researchers from india patil and tiwari 2018 2019 results relative to k c mid std are similar but those for the end season are very different with low k c end std values when the harvesting practice is with the fruit somewhat close to maturation these differences likely result from different traditional marketing in the two regions the studies performed with plastic mulched strawberries under drip irrigation grattan et al 1998 hanson and bendixen 2004 considered establishing a k c f c relationship useful for irrigation scheduling purposes for estimating et c act grattan et al 1998 used the breb method while hanson and bendixen 2004 used a swb supported with time domain transmissibility tdt sensors both studies were performed in coastal california climates and the respective k c mid std show quite small differences the studies in table 5 provided for ancillary information that may help in characterizing the studied crops those data are presented in table 6 the data gaps in table 6 identify the insufficiencies data on root depths are reasonably informative but those on crop heights show numerous gaps and in the case of tomato identify a wide range of crop management options with h max varying from 0 48 m to 1 25 m the latter when the crop grows on stalks a main gap however is limited data on the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p which plays a main role in irrigation scheduling this information is completely lacking for all but three crops the deficiency of ancillary data probably results from the fact that the study aims were not at providing information for irrigation scheduling using soil information but at different objectives in terms of understanding the crops behavior 4 4 herbs spices and special vegetable crops this group of crops is an upgrade relative to the fao56 tables on the one hand the pineapple crop was added to the vegetable crops on the other hand various herbs and spice not considered in fao56 are now added following research developed in the last decennium the reported values for k c mid obs and k c end obs and the respective values adjusted to the standard climate k c mid std and k c end std are given in table 7 reported values for the basal crop coefficients are also included in table 7 but refer to only a few herbs and spice crops the selected studies relative to basil used swb with tdr measurements combined with dl ghamarnia et al 2015a or with wl measurements marques et al 2015 to determine et c act reported k c mid std are similar among basil studies but k c end std differ much since k c end std equals k c mid std when only one harvest is practiced while low values for k c end std correspond to multiple harvests similar k c mid behavior was reported for lemon balm ghamarnia et al 2015b in which et c act was estimated with the swb based on tdr measurements combined with dl and also adopting the simdualkc model however for k cb this method was applied only for a single harvest and thus k cb values for lemon balm are only available for this single harvest condition for black cumin and coriander et c act was also determined by a swb with tdr measurements silva et al 2013 and in combination with dl observations in studies by ghamarnia et al 2013 2014 and ghamarnia and sasani 2015 however the k cb mid values reported by ghamarnia et al 2013 2014 2015a were decreased considering advection influences the study ghamarnia and sasani 2015 also applied the simdualkc model thus making k cb values available for coriander both crops commonly have multiple harvests and have end season k c and k cb smaller than for mid season similarly multiple harvests are used for parsley however dukes et al 2015 report only a value for k c mid likely because k c end varies with time at each harvest after mid season only the study by yarami et al 2011 was selected for saffron where et c act was determined by dl and a swb with neutron probe data that study used micro lysimeters to support deriving k cb also a single paper was selected for pineapple azevedo et al 2007 where breb was used herbs and spices may be subject to single or multiples harvests which create different k c values as reported earlier for tabasco pepper table 5 in multiple harvest conditions the k c mid refers to the peak period before harvesting and k c end refers to the period before crop regrowth however criteria followed in the selected references varied and information provided in table 7 is indicative of this the ancillary data on crop characteristics are provided in table 8 however the available ancillary data from selected literature are once again scarce root depths which are essential when performing a soil water balance were commonly not given for most of herbs and spices moreover the p soil water depletion fractions for no stress were also not given for most of the herbs and spices 5 consolidated updates on standard single and basal crop coefficients the updated standard k c values for vegetable crops referring to a standard sub humid climate rh min 45 u 2 2 m s 1 are presented in table 9 they were defined taking into consideration both the observed k c mid std and k cend std values reported in tables 1 3 5 and 7 and the k c mid and k c end values tabulated in fao56 allen et al 1998 in general the updated k c values differ little from those tabulated in fao56 k c mid and k c end values for roots tubers bulbs and stem vegetable crops were unchanged for asparagus celery and radish since acceptable k c studies on these crops were not available the values were also unchanged for carrots and potato in agreement with available research results following reported values in table 1 the updated k c mid values were slightly increased for cassava and garlic they were also slightly increased for onions harvested green to have the same k c mid values as dry and seed onions k c end values were slightly decreased for onions but not for seed since there was no related information available in contrast the updated standard k c end for parsnip rutabaga turnip and table beets were slightly increased as to become closer to k c mid thus following trends of earlier harvest of table roots and tubers i e with reduced effects of senescence the k c end for sweet potato was slightly decreased based on the available data for leaves and flowers vegetable crops k c mid and k c end values remained unchanged for artichoke following available research the k c mid for broccoli was increased by 0 05 but was not changed for other crops in this category for broccoli brussel sprouts cabbage cauliflower lettuce and spinach the k c end values were increased to become equal or very close to k c mid because these crops are eaten when fresh and tender thus it was assumed that those crops would be harvested before senescence starts the largest k c end increase was for broccoli which went from 0 95 to 1 10 there was sufficient research on k c for all fruit and pod vegetable crops considered thus the k c mid and k c end values tabulated in fao56 were often updated a distinction was made between bell pepper and chili peppers within the capsicum annuum crops and within the chilies between capsicum annuum and capsicum frutescens tabasco pepper for the latter single and double harvesting were considered the standard k c mid values for bell pepper were increased by 0 05 and the same value 1 10 was also adopted for the other peppers for bell pepper often consumed fresh k c end was increased to become closer to k c mid differently a smaller k c end is proposed for chili peppers because the late season of chillies is longer to allow for the red color of chillies and for the synthesis of capsaicinoids the substance responsible for their flavor however the duration of the late season thus the k c end value too may differ with the species and cultivar of chillies in addition smaller k c mid and k c end are proposed for a second harvest when practiced following results reported in the literature slightly larger k c mid values are proposed for cucumber zucchini squash and watermelon while both k c mid and k c end are increased for cantaloupe melon becoming closer to those of the melon crop standard k c mid values were not changed for eggplant melon and pumpkin but were decreased for strawberries however standard k c end values were changed slightly increasing for melon and eggplants indicating that fruits at harvesting should be harvested before senescence is completed distinct k c end values already suggested in fao56 were adopted when the crop is harvested for processing or for fresh market a lower value for fresh market refers to a long period of harvesting for okra not considered in fao56 a value based on observations was assumed k c mid 0 95 since this fruit is normally consumed fresh the k c end is close to the k c mid indicating that for produce quality senescence effects should be avoided reported research results did not provide justification for the high fao56 k c mid values for tomato thus both k c mid values for processing and fresh market were decreased to the same value 1 10 however different k c end values were adopted with that for processing smaller than the one for market because the fruit should not be too tender for machine harvesting for processing harvesting should occur when ripening starts when soluble contents are high which better value is reached when the fruit is still not fully mature yellow orange color however harvesting for the fresh market starts during the mid season and lasts while there are fruits in the field thus in practice k c end may be smaller than the tabulated one with exception of mint all standard k c values for herbs and spices are new and were selected considering the literature review summarized in table 7 thus based on the selected references two sets of k c mid and k c end were adopted for basil and lemon balm one for single harvest and the other for multiple harvest of these herbs the standard k c values for pineapple were highly increased relative to those tabulated in fao56 only one reference was selected but other studies or reviews such as that by carr 2012 were concordant that the k c mid and k c end should be higher than those proposed in fao56 near 0 90 in addition equal values were selected for mid and end season k c considering the common management used in south america the updated standard basal crop coefficients for vegetable crops referring to a standard sub humid climate rh min 45 u 2 2 m s 1 are presented in table 10 the updated k cb values also result from considering both the observed k cb mid std and k cb end std values reported in literature tables 1 3 5 and 7 and the k cb mid and k cb end values tabulated in fao56 allen et al 1998 their definition followed a similar approach to that used for k c mid and for k c end reported above nevertheless because only few studies focused on basal crop coefficients most proposed values in table 10 follow the general guidelines used in fao56 to derive k cb from k c section 3 3 as well as the differences between k c and k cb values in fao56 in other words the selection of k c mid and k c end values described above relative to table 9 dictated the definition of k cb mid and k cb end values proposed in table 10 thus differences between k c mid table 9 and k cb mid table 10 generally do not exceed 0 05 for crops fully covering the ground but differ by 0 10 otherwise differences between k c end and k cb end are also small 0 10 when rain or irrigation often occur during the late season and 0 05 for dry conditions this indicates that k e values k c k cb are small during the mid and late season i e soil evaporation e s is small since most of the ground area is shadowed therefore receiving only a limited amount of short wave radiation available for soil water evaporation reduced e s limits the k c differences among irrigation methods and the effect of mulch which are much larger in sparse canopies and during the earlier crop growth stages of vegetable crops most studies were performed with drip irrigation only a few used micro sprinkling or micro sprayers and even less furrow irrigation or sprinklers k c tend to be smaller with drip irrigation since less soil is wetted and often the wetted soil is shadowed thus e s is smaller than for other methods because harvesting of small vegetables is commonly performed before senescence starts or when a slight maturation occurs ground cover by vegetation is kept high and therefore e s is kept small until harvesting therefore reductions in k c when using drip irrigation relative to micro sprinklers or micro sprayers likely do not exceed around 5 to 10 i e k c mid act for drip irrigation may be smaller by about 0 05 than k c mid act for micro sprinklers or sprayers however various papers refer to larger k c differences up to 30 but do not show a justification for that high difference since k cb values do not include soil evaporation k cb values likely do not change with the irrigation method similarly k cb is also generally not affected by the control of e s by mulches therefore the k c and k cb provided in tables 9 and 10 may confidently be used in practice namely to parameterize soil water balance and irrigation scheduling models pereira et al 2020c however users must decide on which corrections to introduce either due to irrigation method the use of mulches the adoption of deficit irrigation small size of plots or due to the occurrence of advection which effectively may require a decrease in k c and k cb values however in a limited amount 6 ancillary data although ancillary data for vegetable crops were limited considering the values reported in the cited studies the ancillary parameter values proposed in various tables of fao56 could be updated to provide better information for readers about parameter options the ancillary values available from the selected literature tables 2 4 6 and 8 are summarized in table 11 together with the former tabulated values in fao56 the information provided in the selected papers led to reducing the tabulated rooting depths in fao56 for several crops vegetable crops often have short roots and because irrigation water management today is mostly with frequent water applications e g by drip irrigation smaller rooting depths are warranted good examples of reduced depths with supporting data were for cabbage processing tomato and melons differently updated crop heights are sometimes larger than the fao56 tabulated ones which likely corresponds to new varieties and new crop management practices it is noted however that a few updates of z r and h max were made when information was not available but followed the personal knowledge of authors nevertheless for most cases data provided in fao56 was kept unchanged reported values for the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p of vegetable crops were often smaller than those tabulated in fao56 because drip irrigation is more often used with vegetable crops irrigation frequency is high and plants are generally short rooted there is no apparent reason to adopt large p values instead following the reported values it appears preferable to adopt smaller p values which correspond to minimizing the risk for water stress thus values for p were often decreased while there is not an fao56 table for maximum crop cover and thus no need to update f c max the values observed in some selected the papers are summarized in table 11 this data may prove useful for irrigation scheduling purposes of these crops mainly to parameterize soil water balance models pereira et al 2020c 7 conclusions and recommendations the current study led to conclusions of diverse nature first it is important to note that the tabulated k c and k cb values in fao56 allen et al 1998 were generally confirmed by the research conducted in the last two decennia and reviewed herein albeit with slight refinements made for various crops a similar conclusion was derived from the study reported in the companion paper relative to field crops pereira et al 2020a this conclusion makes it clear that the fao56 tabulated crop coefficients can assuredly be trusted it is also essential to recognize the adequateness of the definition and computation of the reference evapotranspiration and of the procedures relative to the crop coefficients with this in mind users can also be assured that the k c et o method proposed by fao56 is accurate and appropriate for a variety of applications otherwise tabulated k c and k cb should be adapted to the prevailing conditions the performed review effectively demonstrated the appropriateness of clearly distinguishing actual from standard crop coefficients with the latter referring to crops cultivated in pristine conditions in which the evapotranspiration may well be considered the potential et of the considered crop under given environmental conditions in reality there is very abundant literature where this distinction is not made and where crop coefficients correspond to cultivation practices far from pristine due to water stress salinity stress or stresses produced by various insufficiencies of agronomic nature the review also allowed to perceive that a distinction between actual and standard potential conditions is often not recognized or even accepted by many researchers this obviously makes it more difficult to transfer research results of crop coefficients from one location to another nevertheless the review has shown that using well calibrated and validated soil water balance models e g the simdualkc model has made it possible to overcome problems related to stress and to achieve k c standardized values more research along these lines is desirable since the reported use of models in the reviewed literature is scarce in addition research must pay attention to the adjustment of k c to the standard climate the review has also demonstrated that differences between k c observed and those adjusted to the standard climate may be quite large particularly when observations are performed in arid and windy conditions for those reasons it is very important that k c papers include appropriate description of methods used and of the climate during experimentation the review also indicated that researchers often do not include any scrutiny relative to high k c values which could be due to either flaws in field measurements or to advection influences on the one hand it was observed that exceptionally high k c values are often reported in papers where the description of methods employed were insufficient which may relate to absence of scrutiny of research results that lack of scrutiny could also be associated with advection impacts which were not considered in many papers published during the last two decennia therefore it is recommended that research studies of this nature include a careful analysis of results including the time dynamics of et that would provide better information about the accuracy of et estimation on the other hand since energy balance methods mainly ec and breb are becoming quite popular in et research it is recommended that the dynamics of the energy balance be explored to verify when latent heat exceeds the available energy r n g and or when sensible heat becomes negative thus identifying periods where et was influenced by advection in addition it is recommended that derived k c or k cb values are scrutinized comparing them with those tabulated which in fact correspond to a kind of upper limit of k c values for the standard climate this scrutiny also applies to one step et c act since easily the ratios et c act et o may be compared with tabulated standard k c it became apparent from this review that the definition and computational procedures relative to the pm et o equation are often not followed or have not yet been accepted by many researchers this is well apparent through numerous comparative studies of et equations including when authors search for a k c value for a given crop and by the use as reference of a variety of equations different from the pm et o equation without considering the actual ratio between et o computed with the selected equation to the pm et o naturally using an et o different than the pm et o results in different k c values on the one hand the derived k c are negatively affected and transferability of research results are hampered when a different et o is used on the other hand using the fao56 tabulated standard k c with a different et equation leads to over or under estimation errors in using the k c et o approach it is recommended that research using a different et equation should consider the ratio between et o equations when using k c values that refer to the pm et o thus allow the ability to convert k c values the best use of the k c et o method implies using the segmented fao k c curve i e with accepting the definition of the four crop growth stages and the definition of three k c values k c ini k c mid and k c end using time averaged k c values or non linear k c functions with time are difficult to use predictably because the corresponding values are site focused the fao k c curve is also difficult to use predictably due to inter annual weather variability inducing variable durations of the crop growth stages however this difficulty may be overcome when expressing those duration in terms of cumulative growth degree days this consists of an area of research already initiated for various field crops and that should be extended to vegetable crops the review reported herein provided a set of updated tables for k c mid and k c end as well as k cb mid and k cb end season for a great number of vegetable crops exceeding those previously tabulated in fao56 the new tabulated values refer to the pm et o reference equation and the standard sub humid climate with rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 the k c values principally refer to drip irrigation without the use of mulches plastic tunnels or greenhouses the review allowed us to observe that results comparing impacts of irrigation methods on the single and basal crop coefficients for vegetables are not very consistent likely because many variables are considered further research is required for various crops and with consideration of the relationships between soil evaporation transpiration fraction of soil wetted fraction of ground cover by the crop hopefully future research will focus on a few of the relevant variables in such a way that k c and k cb values could be easily recognized and related results more readily transferred to other locations the impacts of mulches on k c and k cb values could not be developed through this review and consist of another area where further needs of research were clearly identified first it is necessary to produce research focusing on high accuracy et estimation including through well developed energy balance and water balance methods second it is required that impacts of mulches focus on the dynamics of soil evaporation and plant transpiration with consideration of the fraction of ground cover in fact there are numerous studies relative to mulches mainly plastic ones as for a recent special issue of this journal entitled plastic mulching effects on water use efficiency crop growth and soil health in northwestern china to overcome difficulties resulting from the fact that studies refer to multiple issues it is recommended that studies relative to mulch impacts on water use include a focus on the base et processes and dynamics today s vegetable farm irrigators face climate change challenges and related environmental consequences such as decreasing water availability thus it is apparent that increasing the irrigation water savings in these crops will play a major role in irrigated agriculture s adaption to climate change effects it cannot be emphasized more clearly that the upper limits of potential crop evapotranspiration must be recognized in the irrigation management practice despite some limitations of the current review it is recommended that researchers and practitioners use the updated k c and k cb values to determine those et limits when planning or developing irrigation scheduling programs when using fao56 procedures it is of upmost importance to apply the pm et o equation for reference evapotranspiration and to ensure climatic parameters are correctly measured and scrutinized avoiding the use of high k c values let say above 1 25 which have no physical justification for these crops can lead to saving irrigation water moreover the use of drip irrigation systems for vegetables is a means to apply frequent irrigation from mid season on without increased evaporation consequences thus well planned and highly efficient irrigation scheduling should result using fao56 et estimation along with properly managed drip irrigation declaration of

10441,many research papers on crop water requirements of vegetables have been produced since the publication of the fao56 guidelines in 1998 a review of this literature has shown that determination of crop evapotranspiration et c using the k c et o approach i e the product of the specific crop coefficient k c by the reference evapotranspiration et o is the most widely used method for irrigation water management consequently a review was made to provide updated information on the k c values for these crops the reviewed research provided various approaches to determine k c in its single and dual versions with this purpose actual crop et et c act was determined with lysimeters or by performing the soil water balance using measured soil water content and computational models or by using bowen ratio energy balance and eddy covariance measurements or by using remote sensing applications when determining the basal k c k cb the partitioning of et c act was evaluated using different approaches though mainly using the fao56 dual k c method since the accuracy of experimentally determined k c and k cb values depends upon the procedure used to compute et o as well as accuracy in determining and partitioning of et c act the adequacy of the measurement requirements for each approach was carefully reviewed the article discusses in detail the conceptual methodology relative to crop coefficients and the requirements for transferability namely distinguishing between actual and standard k c and the need to appropriately use the fao segmented k c curve hence the research papers selected to update and consolidate mid season and end season standard k c and k cb were those that computed et o with the fao56 pm et o equation and that also used accurate approaches to determine and partition et c act for pristine non stressed cropping conditions under these experimental conditions the reported k c and k cb values relative to the mid and end season could be considered as transferable standard k c and or k cb values after adjustment to the standard climate adopted in fao56 where average rh min 45 and average u 2 2 m s 1 over the mid season and late season growth stages for each vegetable crop these standard values were then compared with the fao56 tabulated k c and k cb values to define the updated values tabulated in the current article in addition reported ancillary data such as maximum root zone depth maximum crop height and soil water depletion fraction for no water stress were also collected from selected papers and tabulated in comparison with those given for the crops in fao56 the presentation of updated crop coefficient results is performed by grouping the vegetables differently than in fao56 where distinction is made according to their edible parts 1 roots tubers bulbs and stem vegetables 2 leaves and flowers vegetables 3 fruit and pod vegetables and 4 herbs spices and special crops with most of them being newly introduced herein the updated k c and k cb of vegetable crops based on this review are generally coincident with those in fao56 although slightly lower for several crops close agreement of selected paper values with fao56 values provides good evidence of their quality and also confirms the reliability of the original fao56 tabulated values it is noteworthy that many papers surveyed from the past 20 years did not satisfy the adopted k c requirements in terms of et o computation method nor provide solid evidence of measurement accuracy for et c act it is recommended that future k c research of vegetables should sufficiently address these issues with objectives broadened to provide more transferable data to other regions also new data on vegetable k c and k cb values should be carefully scrutinized in the context of these results and those provided in fao56 keywords actual vs standard k c upper limits to k c research accuracy requirements roots and tubers vegetables leaves and flowers vegetables fruit and pod vegetables herbs and spices ancillary data 1 introduction the use of water for irrigation of crops is under pressure due to climate and environmental changes which call for reducing water losses and wastages and for improved productivity of the irrigated crops a paramount approach consists in closing the gaps between water application and crop water requirements these gaps refer to various irrigation issues such as improved irrigation methods and related irrigation and delivery scheduling use of information and communication technologies more precise cropping and water management practices and farmers training and self governance on the base of related developments is knowledge and particularly knowledge on crop water requirements thus on crop evapotranspiration processes and determination methods evapotranspiration et is commonly measured with instrumentation that require relatively complex physical principles and techniques e g farahani et al 2007 verstraeten et al 2008 allen et al 2011a b crop et is typically computed or modeled using weather data and algorithms that describe the aerodynamic characteristics of the vegetation and surface energy driving et namely when adopting the fao56 method allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 this method uses the simple k c et o approach that consists of the product of a crop coefficient k c by the grass reference evapotranspiration et o where the latter represents the actual evaporative demand of the atmosphere and k c represents an integration of the effects of the primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the grass reference in terms of the energy balance allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 despite the simplicity of the k c et o approach its application requires the best accuracy of measurements and computations particularly when deriving crop coefficients for a given crop using field observations allen et al 2011a thousands of papers have been published during the last 20 years reporting on the use of k c values and k c curves for nearly all cultivated crops with hundreds of studies dealing with the derivation of k c values for numerous crops and vegetation types however objectives of studies were quite diverse resulting in contradictory approaches when aiming at the transferability of k c values to different environments limitations to transferability are due to a variety of factors 1 using an et o estimation method different than the standard pm et o equation 2 using non standard cultivation conditions such as mulch plastic tunnels intercropping and greenhouses screenhouses 3 adopting crop management practices that may cause various types of stresses e g relative to the use of fertilizers chemicals or wastewater 4 cropping under soil and water salinity sodicity stress 5 using non optimal plant density and or planting dates 6 adopting deficit irrigation stresses 7 insufficient size of experimental plots 8 inadequate lysimeter management 9 using energy balance instrumentation without adopting an appropriate energy balance closure ebr 10 lack of appropriate estimation of soil water fluxes that affect accuracy of soil water balance swb particularly amount of water passing through the bottom boundary of the control volume 11 lack of consideration of possible occurrence of local and regional advection 12 using non calibrated vegetation indices when remote sensing is adopted 13 insufficient description of the experiments namely of the plant density height and vigor and of the instrumentation used and of their accuracy in addition reported k c curves often do not follow the fao segmented curves or k c results are presented as time dependent polynomial equations or are just referred to weekly 10 day or more often monthly values crop growth stages are sometimes defined contradictorily relative to definitions adopted in fao56 allen et al 1998 and previously in fao24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 information provided in those papers may be sufficient relative to objectives of the studies reported but is insufficient to provide for the transferability of reported k c into different environments these limitations obliged to a careful review of published material to check when derived k c are only of local interest and or represent non standard experimental conditions contrasting to k c relative to recognizable potential evaporative crop conditions resulting from optimal pristine cropping practices pereira et al 2015 therefore transferable to other environments when adequately adjusted to climate aiming at providing accurate standard and updated k c values it was required that the et data et models and related model calibrations reported in the literature were exempt of biases caused by flaws in experimental design measurement equipment vegetation management data handling model parameterization and interpretation of results as discussed by allen et al 2011a selected references were checked to ensure that sufficient descriptions of the practices used to measure et data crop practices and related production environment were provided they were also checked to avoid potential computational flaws and shortcomings in data handling and in model calibration and validation as well as to contain the climatological information to adjust k c to the standard climate this paper aims at providing standard updated single and basal k c values k c and k cb for field and vegetable crops corresponding to the standard climate as adopted in fao56 minimum relative humidity rh min 45 and wind speed at 2 meters height u 2 2 m s 1 therefore section 2 focuses on the basic concepts underlying the derivation and use of k c values in order to make clear the approaches adopted including k c concepts k c curves and crop stage dates and factors influencing k c such as mulches and soil management irrigation methods and scheduling and soil salinity the section 3 revises factors that influence the derivation of k c and k cb values namely 1 measuring systems including soil water balance lysimeters bowen ratio eddy covariance and sap flow 2 plot size constraints fetch limitations and advection issues and 3 requirements for estimating et by remote sensing including vegetation index based crop coefficients and surface energy balance techniques section 4 consists of a literature review on the derivation of k c and k cb from field research including related ancillary data differently from the fao56 crop tables we follow the format assumed by the international society of horticultural sciences in which vegetables crops are grouped according to the edible parts of the plant 1 roots tubers bulbs and stems 2 leaves and flowers 3 fruit and pod 4 herbs spices and special crops section 5 based on that review and on the fao56 tabled data provides for updates on standard k c and k cb for vegetable crops section 6 updates ancillary data and the final section consists of conclusions and recommendations for users 2 crop coefficients basic concepts and approaches 2 1 basic concepts adopting the fao56 method crop evapotranspiration et c mm is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et o mm by a dimensionless crop coefficient k c 1 et c k c et o the reference crop is a hypothetical crop with an assumed height of 0 12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing and adequately watered the daily reference evapotranspiration et o mm d 1 is computed with the pm et o eq 2 which resulted from parameterizing the aerodynamic and surface resistance terms of the penman monteith combination equation thus 2 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n g is the net balance of energy available at the surface mj m 2 d 1 t is mean daily air temperature c at the reference height of 2 m e s e a represents the vapor pressure deficit vpd of air kpa at 2 m height u 2 is wind speed m s 1 at 2 m height δ represents the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship at mean air temperature kpa o c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa o c 1 the reference crop incorporates most of the weather effects into et o estimates and thus et o represents the climatic demand on evaporation however advective heat energy fluxes are not considered in et o because the pm et o equation considers only vertical fluxes of heat and vapor pereira et al 1999 it results that k c varies predominantly with the specific crop characteristics and little with climate this enables the transfer of standard values for k c between locations and climates when local and or regional advection is excluded expressing et c and et o in terms of the penman monteith combination equation monteith 1965 and expressing k c as the ratio of et c to et o eq 1 results in 3 k c e t c e t o δ c r n c g c ρ a c p e s e a c r a c δ c γ 1 r s c r a c δ o r n o g o ρ a c p e s e a o r a o δ o γ 1 r s o r a o where r n g e s e a δ and γ were defined above ρ a is air density kg m 3 c p is specific heat of air 1013 j kg 1 c 1 r a is aerodynamic resistance to heat and vapor transport from the surface to z height s m 1 and r s is bulk surface resistance s m 1 the c subscripted parameters refer to the actual crop vegetation and the o subscript in the denominator refers to the grass reference vegetation using this ratio one can visualize that k c represents an integration of the effects of three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference crop height that affects roughness and aerodynamic resistance r a bulk crop soil surface resistance r s which relates to leaf area fraction of ground covered by the vegetation leaf age and condition degree of stomatal control and soil surface wetness and albedo of the crop soil surface that influences r n and is determined by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation and soil surface wetness the derivation of k c is generally not performed using the relation of eq 3 but by using some empirical approaches that must be consistent relative to the above represented theoretical background however related literature often does not refer to that theoretical background two k c approaches are considered in fao56 the first consists of a time averaged single k c that includes multi day effects of evaporation from the soil in addition to plant transpiration the second refers to the dual k c consisting of a basal crop coefficient k cb and an evaporation coefficient k e representing the ratios of respectively the crop transpiration t c and soil evaporation e s to et o i e k cb t c et o and k e e s et o thus it results that k c k cb k e for transferability purposes fao56 allen et al 1998 adopted the concept of standard or potential k c and et c which refer to optimal well watered conditions and are the basis for the tabularized k c in the field and in common practice crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non uniform irrigation crop density salinity soil and agronomic management as referred before under these conditions et c is then replaced by the actual et c act with et c act et c only when the crop is well irrigated and cultivated under standard optimal conditions the resulting k c is then renamed actual k c k c act which corresponds to the product k cact k s k c using a stress coefficient k s depending upon the sufficiency of available soil water to maintain the crop et rate in the case of using the dual k c approach only the basal k cb is modified into k cb act resulting in 4 k c act k s k c k s k cb k e adopting this concept facilitates consistent estimation and transferability of measured and standardized k c otherwise it would be necessary to define multiple k c values for the same crop the concepts of standard k c and potential crop et c and related terminology are progressively being accepted by the user communities the transferability of k c among climate and locations applies only to standard k c the theoretical basis and limitations of the standard k c concept reflect primarily differences in the aerodynamic and surface resistances of the reference crop and of the crop being considered under well watered conditions eq 3 so that differences in et c are influenced mainly by climate pereira et al 1999 this contrasts with k c act because their differences may additionally be due to unique levels of water or salinity stress including when deficit irrigation is adopted or by specific non standard cropping practices e g when mulching or site specific irrigation management are applied such factors influencing crop management cause values for k c act to vary widely contrary to standard k c the extension of k s to saline environments is analyzed by minhas et al 2020 2 2 the crop coefficient curve the crop coefficient curve fig 1 represents the changes in k c or k cb over the length of the growing season allen et al 1998 both the single time averaged k c and the dual k c i e k cb and k e are represented the k c segmented curve is similar for k c and k cb while k e are represented by peaks that occur when soil wettings produce evaporation from the soil surface the curve consists of four linear segments representative of the four crop stages identified in fig 1 indicative time durations of crop stages were given in tables in fao56 and in publications by allen et al 2007c and jensen and allen 2016 despite fao56 recommendations for observing actual stage durations in field studies many articles refer to an inappropriate use of such tabulated crop growth stage lengths and deeply criticized them consequently it is now recommended to refrain from using the indicative durations in fao56 but instead use the actual field observations of crop growth stage durations as a function of days past planting as well as with cumulative growing degree days cgdd an earlier study on the subject is that by sammis et al 1985 various authors quoted in the current review used that approach the segmented curves for k c and k cb are approximate representations of changes in crop vegetation from planting to harvest that affect the ratio et c et o and inherently the ratio t c et o shortly after planting the value for k c is often small because the crop is in its earliest stage of development before attaining 10 cover this is the initial crop stage when k c and k cb are denoted k c ini and k cb ini they are represented fig 1 by a horizontal line because initial stage variation with time is small so they can be estimated by a single average value the next crop growth stage corresponds to crop development which concerns a great change of crop cover and height thus a large change in the et c et o and in t c et o ratios that change is represented by a segment whose slope corresponds to the average time rate of increase in k c from k c ini until its maximum which is attained during mid season thus noted k c mid and k cb mid the k c mid and k cb mid values refer to the period from when crop development growth ends and is replaced by the reproductive period until senescence starts during the mid season the ratios et c et o and t c et o have relatively small changes and k c mid may be approximated by a horizontal line after senescence starts the ratios et c et o and t c et o decrease until harvesting or the end of the crop season during this crop stage called late season k c and k cb decrease with an approximately constant rate which allow representing k c and k cb with a segmented slope corresponding to the rate of decrease of the ratios et c et o and t c et o that segment ends at harvesting or the end of the crop season when k c and k cb are denoted k c end and k cb end the advantage of the segmented k c curve is that it just requires knowing three values those at the initial stage k c ini k cb ini at mid season stage k c mid k cb mid and that at harvesting or at the end season k c end k cb end k c values during crop development and late season stages are then just linearly interpolated with time based on the three values using non linear k c or k cb representations requires appropriate curve fitting and various parameters to describe such curves which generally vary from a location to another and from a year to the next thus making it quite difficult if not impossible to transfer the k c information using more than four crop growth stages also increases the difficulties in transferring k c values since not only are more k c values required to represent the crop season but it is necessary to define the time limits of more crop stages k c and k cb are subject to a large number of influencing factors as summarized in fig 2 during the initial stage the variability of k c ini relates to soil evaporation and factors controlling it such as frequency of rainfall and irrigation wettings plastic mulches plastic tunnels organic mulching soil residues management frequency and depth of irrigation applications and fraction of soil wetted by irrigation with such a variety of influencing factors it is not possible to tabulate values for k c ini and it is not possible to derive related values from published papers fao56 provided indicative k c ini values corresponding to the most common conditions i e when surface irrigation was used and the soil was maintained bare however in many studies researchers considered indicative k c ini as recommended values and thus may have used them erroneously therefore k c ini values are not proposed herein instead the computational procedures proposed by allen et al 1998 pg 114 121 2005b are recommended simple models can be used for that purpose for the dual k c approach the value k cb ini 0 15 is recommended since it averages conditions from bare soil and fraction of ground cover f c up to 0 10 and it is assumed to include diffusive or residual evaporation from soil for potentially long periods following wetting allen et al 2005a however under dry conditions with long periods between wettings or during the non growing season k cb ini can be set much lower even close to 0 differently k e should be computed taking into consideration all the factors affecting soil evaporation as detailed by allen et al 2005a the same factors affect soil evaporation during the crop development stage but in a lesser extent since the fraction of ground shaded by the crop progressively increases thus reducing the amount of energy available for soil evaporation the effect of mulches also progressively reduces because the mulch cover slowly loses its potential characteristics particularly organic mulches plastic tunnels are generally removed during this stage for not affecting crop development during this crop stage more important than controlling e s is providing for good crop growth thus for the transpiration to increase during the crop development stage the aim is to provide rapid growth of healthy vegetation which leads k c and k cb to increase at often a great rate that large variation of k c and k cb makes it inappropriate to represent k c or k cb by an average value which would be necessarily over estimated at the earlier stage of crop growth and largely under estimated when approaching mid season as well evidenced in figs 1 and 2 when canopy is fully developed during mid season and the reproductive phase develops k c mid and k cb mid are at maximum levels the fraction of ground shaded by vegetation is then maximal while the energy available for evaporation is minimal thus soil evaporation and k e are minimal k c mid and k cb mid are largely dependent upon the plant density and height allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020b by the mid season the effects of various practices to control soil evaporation become less important while k c mid and k cb mid turn to be more influenced by climate particularly rh min and u 2 especially when crop height is high during the late season annual crops are senescing leaves turn yellow and fall f c progressively decreases and e s increases while k c and k cb decrease it is therefore inappropriate to represent k c or k cb by a late season average value since their rate of decrease may be quite large particularly when k c end or k cb end are much lower than k c mid and k cb mid figs 1 and 2 impacts of climate may be less important however during late season the main influencing factor refers to the objective of crop harvesting e g if the crop is to be consumed fresh the k cend is high as for table vegetables contrarily if to be stored dry as with small grains k c end is low this variety of conditions determining the k c and k cb values make it challenging to tabulate them and naturally just allow to adequately tabulate values referring to the mid season and end season harvesting however difficulties are increased when reported information about the experiments is insufficient the quoted papers allen et al 2011a b were prepared at request of journal editors to avoid that lack of information in the following reviewed data focused on papers producing reasonable information and cropping under standard conditions only 2 3 adjustment of observed k c and k c b to climate the standard transferable k c mid and k c end values represent k cb k e for irrigation management and precipitation frequencies typical of a sub humid climate where rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 as defined in fao56 allen et al 1998 under humid and calm conditions the k c for full cover agricultural crops generally do not exceed 1 0 by more than about 0 05 because full cover agricultural crops and the reference crop behave similarly regarding absorption of short wave radiation the primary energy source for evaporation under humid and calm conditions because the vpd is small under humid conditions differences in et caused by differences in the aerodynamic resistance r a between the agricultural and the reference crop are also small especially with low to moderate wind speed as explained by allen et al 1998 and pereira et al 1999 then the values of k c are less dependent on differences between the aerodynamic components of et c and et o eq 3 on the contrary under arid conditions the effect of differences in r a between the agricultural and the reference crop on et c become more pronounced because the vpd is then large hence k c will be larger under arid conditions mainly for tall crops that are more subjected to wind effects in terms of replacing the saturated air close to the leaves with drier air thus accelerating evaporation fluxes because the transferable k c mid and k c end should represent conditions where rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 when local climatic conditions deviate from these values the observed k c values k c mid obs and k c end obs need to be adjusted to become the standard k c values k c mid std and k c end std as 5a k c m i d s t d k c m i d o b s 0 04 u 2 m i d 2 0 004 r h min m i d 45 h 3 0 3 5b k c e n d s t d k c e n d o b s 0 04 u 2 l a t e 2 0 004 r h min l a t e 45 h 3 0 3 where u 2 is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 rh min is the average daily minimum relative humidity and h is the average plant height m the subscripts mid and late indicate that those averages refer to the observations during respectively the mid and late season the same adjustments apply to k cb thus 6a k c b m i d s t d k c b m i d o b s 0 04 u 2 m i d 2 0 004 r h min

and dry in the field k c end 0 45 no adjustment is necessary crop height should be observed in the field indicative values for h are tabulated by allen et al 1998 and in ancillary data tabulated in section 6 however it should be noted that tabulated h values may deviate from reality thus should not replace field observations 3 accuracy and requirements of field measurements for derivation of crop coefficients 3 1 limits on maximum values for et and crop coefficients with consideration of advection evaporation consists of the conversion of liquid water to vapor which requires substantial amounts of energy as discussed in various papers particularly by allen et al 2011a the availability of energy incident to vegetation constrains the potential evaporation rate and forces adherence to the law of conservation of energy considering the basic equation of the balance of energy 7 r n g λ et h it may be noticed that the available energy at the surface r n g is the source for both the latent and sensible heat flux respectively λ et and h if λ et exceeds r n g it means that an additional energy is extracted from the atmosphere via downward sensible heat flux h via convective transfer through the equilibrium boundary layer of air above the surface allen et al 2011a increasingly negative h requires the transport by wind of the required h to the surface to support the conversion to et de bruin et al 2005 as a result there is an upper limit on et even under extreme advection caused by limitations on aerodynamic transport and on equilibrium forces above a vegetation canopy as discussed by allen et al 2011a that upper limit on potential crop evapotranspiration et c is readily approximated by comparing against the widely used reference et o through the crop coefficient k c values for k c may approach 1 3 for tall dense crops under windy arid and semiarid conditions because of the smooth roughness and small lai of the grass reference crop cf eq 3 in humid climates et is dominated more by net radiation availability and less by aerodynamics and vpd because the grass reference crop has an albedo similar to that of many crops at full cover based on total energy constraints where a majority of energy for the et process is from net radiation and regional advection is relatively minor the k c generally cannot exceed about 1 2 to 1 3 relative to the grass reference in arid and semiarid climates differences in aerodynamic and surface resistances when coupled with potentially strong regional advection may cause k c to be as high as 1 2 to exceptionally high values of 1 4 for tall dense healthy and well watered vegetation allen et al 2011a measuring et from small expanses of vegetation should be avoided when the objective is to represent general conditions of crop et for medium to large say 200 m fields or clusters of small fields as discussed by allen et al 2011a when et is measured from small expanses of vegetation the internal boundary layer above the vegetation may not be in equilibrium with the surface and may not have developed up to the height of any meteorological or flux instrumentation moreover small expanses of vegetation surrounded by shorter or dry cover cause a clothesline effect and et from the isolated stands may be significantly greater than the corresponding et o thus not representing large expanses this may also happen when using lysimeters since the vegetation inside the lysimeter may function as a clothesline allen et al 1991b reported measured et from 0 6 m fescue grass to increase by 1 6 times relative to the penman monteith equation when the surrounding grass was clipped to 0 1 m but the vegetation inside the lysimeter remained at 0 6 m summarizing if et estimates are to represent large expanses of vegetation or small stands of vegetation surrounded by mixtures of other vegetation having similar roughness and soil water conditions then k c values must generally be 1 2 1 4 for grass reference advective transport of heat is referred above as an additional source of latent heat through conversion of sensible heat sensible heat advection may play a major role in crop et studies on crop et reporting on advection were more common a few decades ago than they are at present despite progresses in instrumentation which would allow an easy use of indicators under advection λ et exceeds r n g and h becomes very small often negative which corresponds also to the bowen ratio β h λ et to become null or negative there is not a common terminology relative to advection brakke et al 1978 referred to local and regional advection of sensible heat and reported that regional advection observed for an alfalfa irrigated field largely depended upon wind speed while advection at local scale mainly depended upon dryness of air thus from vpd their observations performed in the american great plains indicated that regional sensible heat advection supplied 7 to 40 of energy consumed as latent heat while local advection corresponded to 1 to 14 of such energy local advection was referred by itier et al 1978 as depending upon the fetch the roughness length of the crop the wind speed friction velocity and the temperature difference between the dry and irrigated fields these authors proposed to correct a posteriori the et measured by means of weighing lysimeters soil water balance or sap flow method when the fetch is not large enough to avoid advection effects this correction can be of 1 2 mm d 1 for temperature differences between dry and irrigated fields of 5 10 c itier et al 1978 rana and katerji 2000 the conceptual approaches used by brakke et al 1978 and itier et al 1978 are different but not contradictory differently a previous study by hanks et al 1971 defined large scale advection however not corresponding to the regional advection referred by previous referred authors and border advection considered to occur over most of the plot irrigated but mainly from 0 to 40 m from the upwind edge and yielding sufficient energy to account for about 30 of the energy used for evapotranspiration the former large scale and border advection are different from the regional and local advection defined by brakke et al 1978 and itier et al 1978 these differences illustrate conceptual difficulties that do not favor assessments of advection in current crop et studies de bruin et al 2005 performed micrometeorological observations over extensive well irrigated alfalfa fields in kimberly idaho and observed that on a number of days and during daytime h was negative and λ et r n the energy required for λ et r n was therefore advected from elsewhere which the authors referred to as regional advection since the fields were large differently those authors designed as local advection the advection process where the wet to dry transition is on a field scale they observed λ et r n by about 50 for most of august and september when dry air was advected from large desert areas upwind of kimberly de bruin et al 2005 assumed that for large horizontally homogeneous fields where the atmospheric flow is in equilibrium with the underlying surface the air temperature and humidity in the atmospheric surface layer are well adapted to the irrigated field and no longer have the properties of the dry upwind terrain this assumption implies that a negative h occurs if the atmosphere just above the surface is stably stratified and the negative buoyancy effects suppress turbulent motions thus the turbulence needed for vertical transfer of water vapor only occurs if there is enough wind to offset the damping effects of stability and the influence of the upwind dry terrain will increase with increasing wind speed contrarily under calm conditions daily λ et cannot exceed r n as referred by those authors considering vertical exchange of eddies or air parcels under conditions that h 0 and λ et 0 it is expected that upward moving eddies contain relatively cool and wet air whereas downward moving parcels will be warm and dry consequently the correlation coefficient of turbulent temperature and humidity measurements rtq is expected to be negative conversely when both h and λ et are 0 rtq should be positive those authors therefore proposed rtq as indicator for advection conditions moreover the referred behavior of the eddies disturbs eddy covariance measurements and impacts the energy balance closure thus obliging to careful corrections paw et al 2000 chávez et al 2009 xu et al 2017 energy and water balance of paddies evidenced the occurrence of advection considering that the temperature difference of flooded paddies to surrounding areas was quite large this is the case of the study by lourence and pruitt 1971 who demonstrated the occurrence of advection through the ratio λ et r n where values close to or larger than 1 indicate a reduced or negative h the same approach was used by peterschmitt and perrier 1991 lang et al 1974 studied advection in paddy rice defining a linear relationship between advection and the distance to the upwind edge of the field more recently various studies recognized impacts of advection on various field crops et in the great plains usa e g tolk et al 2006 referred that advected h contributed up to 38 of energy used in λ et of alfalfa and with up to 3 mm d 1 of night time et and payero and irmak 2013 relative to soybean studies from northwest china also identified an important contribution of regional advection to crop et e g the study by ding et al 2015 reporting that advection h may contribute with 4 to 28 of the k c value and the study by tian et al 2017 relative to cotton however there are no indications that oversized k c or k cb due to advection were corrected when to be used as standard values microscale advection was referred by kar et al 2007 relative to crop coefficient studies of oilseed crops due to small size of plots which may have induced k c values up to 23 higher than the values reported by fao56 lund and soegaard 2003 referred to within canopy advection of sensible heat from the dry soil to the millet plants so increasing transpiration this type of micro advection was earlier reported by hanks et al 1971 for sorghum and by heilman et al 1994 for a vineyard the within canopy advection results from the conversion of h at the inter row into λ et of the plants row this micro advection justifies why plastic mulch contributes to increased transpiration while reducing k c less than it could be expected lund and soegaard 2003 however studies referring to plastic mulch effects on k c generally do not consider this process above refer to field crops and only a few studies relative to vegetable crops have reported on solutions for experimental layouts aiming at minimizing advection impacts nevertheless it is important to recognize that the accuracy of determining k c and or k cb for vegetable crops implies considering when advection contributes to increased energy available for et thus augmenting k c values with implications on their transferability 3 2 et measurement accuracy and requirements the exceedance of measured or reported k c above 1 2 for grass reference in sub humid regions or above about 1 2 to 1 4 for grass reference in arid regions should give cause for intense scrutiny of the et measurements the weather data used to calculate et o and the data processing procedure that scrutiny is basically formulated by allen et al 2011a b when revising the requirements for accurate et measuring and the need for related data reporting readers are therefore referred to both papers nevertheless herein we emphasize some essential aspects influencing accuracy of measurements which therefore relate with the quality of derived k c values a deep and complete analysis on field measurements using weighing lysimeters neutron probes soil water balance bowen ratio energy balance breb instruments and eddy covariance flux towers including the assessment of advection effects has been provided by evett et al 2012a b scintilometers are not referred in the selected papers reporting on k c values but they are useful et measuring devices that proved accurate as analyzed by moorhead et al 2017 determining et through computing the soil water balance swb by measuring the change in soil water over the crop season or a selected period of time has been used for a long time earlier using gravimetric soil sampling lately with a variety of sensors including continuous measurements e g reviews by evett et al 2006 2012c major potential errors in et determined by the swb using gravimetric neutron scattering capacitance time domain reflectometry or water potential measurement of soil water include insufficient characterization of the soil hydraulic properties including their spatial and vertical variability and often inadequate consideration of properties over the full root zone depth i e without referring to the entire depth where root uptake activity takes place inadequate vertical spacing of observations and or frequency of observations as well as inadequate representativeness of observed data of actual field conditions inaccuracies in measuring precipitation and irrigation applications or in measuring soil water content and or potential mainly when sensors are not duly calibrated differential spatial wetting of soil due to local spatial variation in irrigation or precipitation for example with bed furrow systems partial drip line wetting or with plastic mulch as well as due to non uniformity of irrigation application inadequate estimation of deep percolation losses and or gains by capillary rise differential spatial extraction of soil water due to spatial variation in root systems e g in the case of trees and when partial root zone drying is used lack of care in obtaining samples or taking readings or installing access tubes or sensors which can significantly alter the plant cover at the sampling site and or alter the density aeration and infiltration characteristics of the surface soil from foot traffic and lack of care during excavation or backfilling soil which may alter soil water extraction and result in poor estimates of et that do not represent actual field et adopting a reliable soil water balance simulation model and taking care in model calibration and validation can be very helpful in overcoming most of the referred problems in estimating et since they provide an alternative means to detect soil water behavior over time various examples relative to the accurate derivation of k c and k cb using the models isareg and simdualkc are referred throughout this paper in addition results from a calibrated model may provide appropriate support for irrigation scheduling and estimation of deep fluxes lysimeters have been used extensively to provide baseline information on et and crop coefficients however lysimeter measurements of et are extremely sensitive to environmental factors many of which are ignored in practice lysimeter measurements are point measurements representing et from areas ranging from 0 05 to 40 m2 but they are commonly used to characterize et and k c for large areas extrapolating data from small to large areas requires that vegetative and environmental conditions of lysimeter systems closely duplicate one dimensional et from the larger areas if improperly managed from an environmental context measured et can differ from the actual et of a large expanse of vegetation by as much as 50 to 100 the lysimetry symposium edited by allen et al 1991b provides several examples of poor lysimeter systems and guidelines for the operation of lysimeters to ensure high quality data for et lysimeters can be grouped as constant water table types drainage types and weighing types the latter when well managed can provide the most accurate data for short time periods when lysimeter facilities are appropriate results from drainage or percolation lysimeters can be accurate if there is also accuracy in observing changes in soil water content the use of models may help produce accurate k c and et results with these systems liu et al 1998 lópez urrea et al 2006 and evett et al 2016 provided for appropriate descriptions and related analysis on using weighing lysimeters for et determination care placed on setting the lysimeters in field on their management and on the management of the crops in the field and in the lysimeters have clearly improved the quality of derived k c values reported in various studies performed with lysimeter et facilities as reported in papers by lópez urrea et al 2009a b c 2014 contrarily some high crop coefficients reported in the literature may result from inappropriate settings and management of lysimeters that caused local and micro scale advection as well as clothesline effects as reported by allen et al 2011a the et accuracy of lysimeters thus of derived k c values depend upon a variety of factors including soil conditions inside the lysimeters must be the same as those outside to insure that the vegetation density water availability vigor evaporation from the soil surface and thus et are the same the lysimeter must be surrounded by the same vegetation that is growing in the lysimeter to insure one dimensionality of the measurement allen et al 1991a lysimeters surrounded by sidewalks or gravel or planted with vegetation different from that outside will not provide accurate et results due to local advection clothesline effect lysimeters should be located with a fetch large enough from the edge of the field such that the equilibrium boundary layer of air can be considered to be fully adjusted above the lysimeter differences in growth and maturity between the lysimeter plants and surrounding plants must be minimal to avoid differences in et measured inside and outside of the lysimeter relative to et measured in the surrounding area pruitt and lourence 1985 in addition flawed lysimeter results can be due to the so called bloom effect where the area of exposed plant canopy has exceeded the effective area of the lysimeter the effective evaporating and transpiring area of the lysimeter must be well recognized a high exposed rim that must be avoided due to its thermal conditions and advective effects the bowen ratio energy balance breb method enables solving the energy balance equation by measuring simple gradients of air temperature t and vapor pressure e a in the near surface layer above the evaporating surface the method works best when soil water is not limiting et as water becomes less readily available the bowen ratio br increases and the relative error in et increases payero et al 2003 described relative errors associated with the breb method as well as techniques for data quality analysis the breb equation for application to vegetation is 8 λ e t r n g 1 β where λ et is latent heat flux i e et expressed in terms of energy r n is net radiation g is soil heat flux density into the ground and β is the bowen ratio h λ et details on breb computations can be found in fritschen and fritschen 2005 large differences in measured et between breb and lysimeters were reported by todd et al 2000 when the bowen ratios were 0 on hot dry and windy days or when the λ et flux exceeded the available energy r n g thus there is need for careful scrutiny of breb observations when advection occurs requirements of the bowen ratio include sufficient distance of fetch to establish an equilibrium boundary layer deeper than the instrument height sufficient elevation of instrument above the canopy to avoid the roughness sublayer representative measurement of r n and g multiple net radiometers and soil heat flux stations when observations are performed over a heterogeneous or sparse crop eddy covariance ec systems are widely used at present for et measurement because of ease of set up reduced costs for sensors and the ability to co measure h λ e and co 2 fluxes depending on the equipment configuration allen et al 2011a the concept of eddy covariance refers to the statistical covariance between vertical fluxes of vapor or sensible heat within upward and downward legs of turbulent eddies et can also be computed as a residual from the energy balance equation as λ et r n g h where sensible heat flux density is measured by eddy covariance which has advantages in terms of instrumentation required however with the need to measure r n and g accurately the vertical component of wind w is generally measured using a sonic anemometer and t is measured using ultra fine wire thermocouples or using sonically determined temperature corrected for humidity effects specific humidity is measured using quick response hygrometers numerous corrections are required and a variety of software are available for correction of ec data paw et al 2000 reported on equations to correct eddy covariance measurements for both fluctuations in density and non zero mean advection induced by convergence or divergence of flow and spatial source sink inhomogeneity under steady state and transient conditions corrections and precautions for eddy covariance were reviewed by burba 2013 the quality of data highly depends upon the environmental conditions for instance flux divergence due to the local advection of warm and dry air over the irrigated fields was analyzed by alfieri et al 2012 assessments of correction needs and related improvements are reported by several authors particularly evett et al 2012b who provided for an adjustment for the effect of advection of energy across the field to the ec stations resulting in reducing the ec station et error to the 6 7 range much literature documented energy balance closure error for eddy covariance data referring to the fact that the sum of measured λ et h does not equal measured r n g often λ e and h can be undermeasured relative to r n g by as much as 30 wilson et al 2002 foken 2008 sánchez et al 2019 possible reasons for the lack of closure include storage of heat in canopies horizontal advection energy used by photosynthesis change in storage of heat in the developing boundary layer below the instrumentation causing flux divergence measurement errors of turbulent fluxes separation of sensors and error or bias in r n or g commonly users close the energy balance by scaling h and λ e in the same proportion until the sum equals r n g however the method used to enforce the energy balance closure is less important than making sure that ec measurements are coherent with conservation of energy twine et al 2000 a recent study by kutikoff et al 2019 demonstrated that days associated with advection exhibited poor surface energy balance compared to all other days heat storage pushed the daytime energy balance closure upward by as much 25 during advection conditions energy balance closure cannot be considered as a data quality test since closure error can still be present even if data acquired by the eddy covariance system are of high quality and vice versa allen et al 2011a requirements of the eddy covariance method include sufficient quite large fetch to establish an equilibrium boundary layer deeper than the instrument height sufficient elevation of instruments above the canopy to reduce roughness sublayer impacts and to increase mean eddy size to match the sensor path length performing the required data corrections particularly adjustments to consider the effects of advection accurate high frequency instrumentation and ability to recognize the occurrence of advection because advective energy modifies energy partitioning which further enhances turbulent fluxes as observed by kutikoff et al 2019 correcting data for the energy balance closure error r n g λ e h namely caring for the effects of advection check data when wind direction changes and or when flow lines change with turbulence and when advection occurs remote sensing vegetation indices vi have been often used to estimate crop coefficients bausch and neale 1987 hunsaker et al 2005 campos et al 2010 calera et al 2017 the estimate of k c and k cb from vis relates to the fact that there is generally a close correspondence between vegetation amount and transpiration i e as vegetation cover increases leaf area increases and transpiration increases reviewed in glenn et al 2011 in addition frequent monitoring of crops with a vi can provide guidance to adjust the durations of crop growth stages and adjust fractional crop cover which are difficult to assess visually in real time hunsaker et al 2007 difficulties arise in vi based methods when trying to estimate evaporation from bare soil because related soil water processes cannot be adequately reflected in a vi however once the crop is established vi s can monitor the seasonal crop growth adequately the most commonly used vi for k c and k cb estimation is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi glenn et al 2011 which is estimated from reflectance in the red 0 6 0 7 μ m and the near infrared bands 0 7 1 3 μ m linear relationships between the ndvi and the crop coefficient are referred in numerous studies namely some referred hereafter generally ndvi values from different satellites show close correlation calera belmonte et al 2005 but some differences occur due to differences in band widths however the degree and type of atmospheric correction of the image can also influence those differences with k c vs ndvi or other vi it is important to distinguish whether the relationships are to represent the average et that includes soil evaporation or are to represent just the basal k c b the latter condition assumes that the vi based relationships are established to represent conditions where the soil surface is dry and soil evaporation is low when compared to transpiration the relationship k cb vs ndvi is more consistent than k c vs ndvi because transpiration is more closely associated with the vegetation amount as estimated by ndvi than is total et that includes evaporation from soil when k c b vs ndvi relationship is used estimates for soil evaporation must be determined separately and added to produce total et burnett et al 2008 allen et al 2011b showed that ndvi was a better basis for the k c vs vi relationship than was the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 because while ndvi tends to reach a maximum value at about the same time as does k c savi tends to continue to increase with increasing lai beyond 3 0 pôças et al 2015 observed that ndvi k cb relationships were better than savi k cb ones for field crops but savi k cb relationships were better for olives allen et al 2011b also showed that the vi calculation can be based on top of atmosphere reflectance or on at surface reflectance with little reduction in estimation accuracy meanwhile with the new satellite sentinel2 a slightly better performance of new vis has been reported e g rozenstein et al 2018 the current use of k c vi relationships to estimate et requires field validation such as ec measurements or using satellite based et energy balance large areas can be covered with remote sensing and data may be used to map et in such areas however the k c values obtained in those circumstances are based on actual et conditions and thus not standard and transferable but the latter may be obtained when applications focus on specific areas where crops are managed in a pristine way as described by hunsaker et al 2003 2005 for cotton and wheat these matters are reviewed by pôças et al 2020 in the current special issue remote sensing energy balance is often used to estimate et from large areas some operational satellite based energy balance models such as sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a b 2005 and metric allen et al 2007a b employ an internal calibration technique referred to as cimec calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions allen et al 2008 they may also be used to estimate k c of small expanses of vegetation good results were obtained by mateos et al 2013 and pôças et al 2015 paço et al 2014 used the energy balance model metric combined with the soil water balance model simdualkc remotely sensed energy balance techniques are useful for identifying areas experiencing water stress and corresponding reductions in et for example the two source energy balance tseb kustas et al 2004 also a thermal model can be used to diagnose et under a wide range of crop water stress and also has the capacity to estimate both transpiration and evaporation french et al 2018 users of this information must bear in mind that satellite based et data are simply retrievals or best estimates of an aerodynamic and radiative process as viewed from space and cannot be considered measurements nevertheless remotely sensed energy balance is discussed here because of its increasing use to estimate k c and et over large areas estimation by remotely sensed energy balance should be expected to adhere to the same limitations and physics as other measurement methods 3 3 implications on collecting k c information from literature crop coefficients k c and k cb reported in literature were obtained from studies having a variety of objectives field methods and data handling procedures the related publication resulted from diverse publication criteria resulting from the journal requirements and the objectives of the studies as described before difficulties in using the published information relate to the insufficiencies of information provided which could affect the accuracy of methods and procedures used as much as possible the aspects dealt by allen et al 2011a b were followed as referred in section 3 2 above particularly for crops that were the focused on numerous studies exceptions were for crops that have been object of few rare studies when insufficient climatic data were available rh min and u 2 used with eqs 5 and 6 where obtained from the internet for the locations where experimentation took place if various studies were available such data sets were discarded data relative to experiments where k c or k cb were given by selected periods or using a non linear equation relating then to time were only used to approximate their mid season values if data on the considered crop were insufficient when information on lysimeter setting was not stating the area cropping around it or the care for limiting micro scale advection or clothesline effects or about determining the effective evaporation area k c data were treated as influenced by advection if various sources of k c for the same crop were available data were discarded if those sources were insufficient then k c or k cb values were reduced by 15 as a rule of tomb to correct excess k c due to less good lysimeter management if k c end k c mid data were necessarily discarded if k c mid 1 40 without appropriate explanation data were discarded when lacking adequate description of procedures used with swb breb ec or else that could justify those high values a similar rule of tomb was used to correct k c mid or k cb mid when the reported k c or k cb adjusted for the standard climate produced season averaged 1 40 k c mid 1 25 and or 1 35 k cb mid 1 20 naturally end season values were reduced proportionally there is a good number of studies on deriving crop coefficients k c and k cb for most vegetable crops however only a part of the published studies is effectively usable when aiming at consolidated updates of standard k c and k cb values updates were only performed for the mid and end season values given the enormous variability of values reported for the initial stage non selected crop coefficient literature refers to studies that did not adopt the fao56 segmented crop coefficient curve namely describing k c as a non linear function of time which may be adequate for local purposes in climates with small variability of climate were performed along a single crop season with insufficient discussion that could allow evaluation of whether one year environmental characteristics led to appropriately or poorly assessed k c or k cb values adopted a reference evapotranspiration different from the grass fao pm or the grass asce pm et o such as pan et the fao24 penman or the hargreaves samani equation insufficiently described the methods used to measure or estimate crop evapotranspiration and therefore did not allow understanding about the quality of performed field work and related data analysis lacked appropriate description of experimental agronomic conditions thus when it was not possible to assume that derived k c referred to a non stressed crop well adapted to the prevailing environmental conditions a common problem was that climate descriptions were insufficient and consequently the papers presenting data on the variables used to adjust observed k c and k cb to the standard climate eqs 5 and 6 i e rh min u 2 and crop height averages for the mid and end season were very rare therefore it was necessary to find estimated parameters using internet information to resolve the observed k c or k cb data to the standard climate knowing the location of the experiments a search for climate data relative to those experimental years and growth periods was performed and the resultant climate values were used in cases when data for the experimental location could not be found data for a nearby location was used while it was evident that the average climate values used from the internet searches provided less accurate adjustment for the actual k c and k cb reported however without that data it would not have been possible to perform that adjustment for most of collected information the large majority of papers also did not provide information on observed crop heights and so the maximum heights tabulated in fao56 for the crops were used for this adjustment the included papers refer to a variety of approaches used to estimate et c act the approaches consist of weighing lysimeters wl data were used when wl were installed in large fields where it is possible to assume that local advection or clothesline effects did not affect results when weighing lysimeter description was insufficient or when the average k c mid and k c end values largely exceeded those observed by other authors and or tabulated in fao56 those papers were discarded drainage or water table lysimeters dl and wtl data were used when soil moisture observations were performed complementarily to lysimeter observations and information provided was sufficient to assume that local advection or clothesline effects did not affect results as for wl if average k c mid and k c end were excessive related dl and wtl papers were also discarded energy balance from measurements of eddy covariance ec and or bowen ratio breb data were used when proper location of towers was reported correction methods were mentioned and closure error was discussed soil water balance swb data were selected when there was adequate information on location depth and frequency of observations deep percolation was considered and there was evidence that computed soil moisture dynamics followed that of observations in addition plots in accepted studies had to have a minimum size to avoid local advection or clothesline effects swb models data were used when there was evidence of model calibration and validation models considered included isareg pereira et al 2003 chaterlán et al 2011 mopeco domínguez et al 2011 martínez romero et al 2019 and simdualkc rosa et al 2012 paredes et al 2018 the growth yield model aquacrop rinaldi et al 2011 was also considered remote sensing of vegetation index ndvi or savi used when at least two years of observations were used information allowed to perceive that ndvi or savi were obtained for a non stressed crop and when the relationship between the crop coefficient and the vegetation index were properly calibrated tested remote sensing energy balance used when measurements adhered to the same limitations and physics as other measurement methods the subscript obs is adopted to identify the collected k c and k cb values reported in literature as being obtained from field observations of et c act aiming at transferability those collected crop coefficients were adjusted to the standard climate and are identified with the subscript std thus indicating that such values are standard single or basal crop coefficients reported k c std or k cb std were very rare so the adjustments to climate using eqs 5 and 6 were the rule for all crops actual k c obs are reported more often than k cb obs likely because the derivation of the latter requires the partition of et c act performing that partition is quite demanding both in terms of field data collection e g with wl or the use of a specific computation algorithm which may be incorporated in simulation models such as the simdualkc model collected information are presented in tables for all groups of crops for each group tables include the common english name and the scientific name of the crop the reference of the selected paper the location where field data were collected which allow a sense of the climate type the field method used to gather data aimed at estimating et c act as discussed above the irrigation method used information on the reported k c mid obs and k c end obs or on the k cb mid obs and k cb end obs and crop coefficient values adjusted to the standard climate thus k c mid std and k c end std or the k cb mid std and k cb end std additional tables are used to provide collected field information on main ancillary crop parameters that are often used in water balance studies namely for irrigation scheduling purposes and that were consistently proposed in fao56 these parameters consist of maximum root depth z r max m maximum crop height h max m maximum leaf area index lai max m2 m 2 maximum fraction of ground cover f c max and soil water depletion fractions for no stress p at the initial mid season and end season p ini p mid and p end for many crops unfortunately the ancillary information is incomplete or lacking it may be noted that most of ancillary parameters were provided by studies using a soil water balance approach or when a dual k c approach was adopted however we did include ancillary data for certain studies though not usable for standard crop coefficients due to non pristine crop conditions e g obvious water stress these studies with ancillary data were retained as they met all other requirements e g proper et o and et c act measurements large fields etc general guidelines to derive k cb from the standard k c values tabulated are those used in fao56 allen et al 1998 mid season ground cover f c more than 80 9a k cb mid k c mid 0 05 ground cover f c less than 80 9b k cb mid k c mid 0 10 at end of season infrequently irrigated or wetted during late season 10a k cb end k c end 0 05 frequently irrigated or wetted during late season 10b k cb end k c end 0 10 when f c is large as it commonly occurs with vegetables soil evaporation is small because most of the ground area is shadowed therefore a limited amount of short wave radiation is available for providing energy for soil water evaporation this fact limits differences among irrigation methods and the effects of mulch since mulch effects were not considered in this report users should make the necessary adjustments if required 4 review on derived single and basal crop coefficients 4 1 roots tubers bulbs and stem vegetable crops collected single and basal crop coefficients obtained from literature for roots tubers bulbs and stem vegetable crops are presented in table 1 k c mid std and k c end std tabulated in table 1 as well as k cb mid std and k cb end std were compared among studies relative to the same or similar crop and with values tabulated in fao56 the crop coefficient values reported in the selected literature generally show coherence however discrepancies exist that mainly occur at the end season of some crops e g onion and garlic because crop management and environmental conditions prior to harvesting which influence the duration of senescence and the soil dryness at the harvest may differ from a location to another and with the crop variety the number of selected papers reporting on deriving k c or k cb for roots tubers bulbs and stem vegetable crops was not large many papers on these crops had to be discarded because they did not use the pm et o equation and or did not adopt research practices in agreement with the experimental requirements defined above which are needed for k c accuracy in addition some papers could not be selected as they did not provide a clear description of the crop itself nor of the field methods thus limiting ability to assess the accuracy of observations papers on various root crops whose k c and k cb were provided in fao56 parsnip turnip and table beets tuber crops radish and rutabaga and stem crops asparagus and celery are not available and related updates were not possible contrasting a common tropical sub tropical crop not previously considered in fao56 the taro colocasia esculenta is now added its edible part is a corm the study mabhaudhi et al 2013 was developed in south africa to assess the performance of three varieties under drip irrigation a swb based on fdr observations was used and has shown that k c end is almost as high as k c mid due to the crop preference for high moisture soils two papers were selected for cassava both referring to studies developed in thailand using breb and referring to rainfed crops watanabe et al 2004 attarod et al 2006 however reported k c mid and k c end are different between both studies which likely is a consequence of different rainfall conditions since both studies refer to rainfed crops five papers relative to the potato crop were selected sousa and pereira 1999 zairi et al 2003 tasumi and allen 2007 martínez romero et al 2019 paredes et al 2018 the latter using the dual k c approach values for k c for the mid season are quite similar but those for the end season diverge in particular the very low k c end std 0 10 reported by sousa and pereira 1999 refers to a specific management practice with harvesting after natural vine kill in the field the paper by tasumi and allen 2007 is the only one that distinguishes long from short season potato however both k c mid values are very close while no information was provided for k c end two papers on sweet potato were selected the first referring to the determination of et c act with a swb supported by neutron probe measurements however without using a model gomes and carr 2003 and the second reporting on the use of ec to measure et c act mulovhedzi et al 2020 the latter a more recent study reported smaller mid and end season crop coefficients than the former likely in relation to the variety the precision of the applied sprinkler irrigation and the accuracy of et measurements used the studies on potato and sweet potato derived seasonal et c act from a soil water balance swb based upon field observations the exceptions were the study by tasumi and allen 2007 which used remote sensing observations combined with the metric model and that by mulovhedzi et al 2020 using ec in a large sweet potato field soil water content swc measurements were performed with various methods and data analysis was performed with different swb models the isareg model sousa and pereira 1999 zairi et al 2003 the simdualkc model paredes et al 2018 and the mopeco model martínez romero et al 2019 an example of the dynamics of the crop coefficients for a fully irrigated and a water stressed potato crop is presented in fig 3 paredes et al 2018 results of both irrigation management strategies clearly show that k e is the main component of k c during the initial and early development stages which relates to the low soil coverage by the crop during those stages differently during the mid and late season stages k cb is the main component of k c under water stress conditions fig 3b the k cb act curve lays below the k cb curve starting shortly before mid season due to the effects of water stress plant canopy was also observed to cover less soil particularly in the late season which corresponded to higher k e peaks than those for fully irrigated potato water stress also influenced the actual k c curve which remained below the potential k cb curve during the mid season stage the analyses in fig 3 illustrate why selected papers were required to provide evidence that their derived k c or k cb were obtained for crops grown in well watered conditions five studies were also selected for onions two of them used weighing lysimeters lópez urrea et al 2009a piccinni et al 2009 one used swb with the model isareg chaterlán et al 2011 another consisted of drainage lysimeters using neutron probes to perform the water balance bossie et al 2009 and the last used a swb supported by tdr carvalho et al 2018 the latter study refers to harvesting onion green and thus k c end std was higher than those for dry onions while they had similar k c mid std values the study by lópez urrea et al 2009a derived both k c and k cb for onions whose time trends are depicted in fig 4 along one season results show that onion k cb is the main k c component during the mid and late season stages despite the numerous wetting events that occur during these stages this relates with the high ground cover by the crop during these stages however authors refer that advection may have influenced k c mid obs the k c mid std values reported in the selected papers for onions vary by about 20 but differences for k c end std are larger particularly when green harvested onion is considered there are four studies selected on garlic one used eddy covariance for et c act measurement villalobos et al 2004 and another used the isareg model as referred to before chaterlán et al 2011 the study by bryla et al 2010 reported on et c act measured with weighing lysimeters while the last paper used remote sensing for deriving basal crop coefficients johnson and trout 2012 the first two papers in the table report close k c mid std values but the chaterlán et al 2011 mid season value is much lower however the high k c end std values for two papers indicate harvest before senescence is completed while the two other studies provided low k c end std and k cb end std values indicating harvesting after vine kill these two latter studies are from california and indicate that garlic cropping practices there were similar likely with machine harvesting but quite different from those adopted elsewhere where harvesting is practiced before the crop fully senesces only two papers were selected for carrots chaterlán et al 2011 carvalho et al 2016 which describe swb applications for et c act the first using a gravimetric approach with the isareg model and the second a swb application based on tdr observations but without modeling both studies had similar k c mid std the study by carvalho et al 2016 shows a k c end std value quite close to k c mid std which indicates an early harvest for consuming fresh it is important to recognize the diverse geographical origin of the selected studies which were conducted in several european countries germany italy portugal and spain north central and south american countries usa cuba and brazil northern and southern african countries ethiopia tunisia south africa and mozambique and thailand these wide origins indicate that good studies were performed for various environmental and socio economic conditions which allow practitioners to better select appropriate research options when required often studies were performed with drip irrigation a few used micro sprinklers micro sprayers sprinklers or surface irrigation generally single crop coefficients tended to be smaller with drip irrigation corresponding with less soil wetting and smaller soil evaporation losses however due to the small set of papers for these crops it was not possible to quantitatively relate mid season differences in k c to irrigation method in addition regardless of irrigation method most crops attained effective full cover of the soil by the mid season which mitigates the possible reduction of k c mid due to mulches studies indicated in table 1 provided some information about main ancillary crop parameters that are used in water balance studies in conjunction with k c based et c estimates particularly for irrigation scheduling purposes these parameters are presented in table 2 unfortunately that information is missing or incomplete for various crops however the derived parameters are generally consistent for a given crop except for the p fraction in dry onions in general the ancillary crop data are also close to the fao56 parameters for these crops it may be noted that most of parameters were provided by studies using a soil water balance approach or when a dual k c approach was adopted 4 2 leaves and flowers vegetable crops collected single and basal crop coefficients obtained from literature for leaves and flowers vegetable crops are presented in table 3 tabled k c values are lower than those originally reported in cases when authors assumed k c mid as a maximum average for a period smaller than the mid season if the data were graphically presented it was then possible to estimate a lower average value for k c mid obs and it was also possible to better estimate k c end obs for a few cases when papers include a graphical presentation of the season dynamics of k cb and k e the k c values were estimated from k cb most studies were performed with drip irrigation only a few used micro sprinkling or micro sprayers and even fewer used furrow irrigation the k c tend to be smaller with drip irrigation since less soil is wetted often under the shadow provided by the canopy thus soil evaporation is smaller however since the frequency of drip irrigation may be very high e s may be less reduced comparatively to micro sprinklers or sprayers soil evaporation also is not high when by the mid season a full cover condition occurs and the energy available at the soil for evaporation is small because harvesting of leaves and flowers vegetable crops is commonly performed before senescence starts or when only a slight maturation occurs ground cover by vegetation is kept high and therefore soil evaporation is maintained small until harvesting therefore reductions in k c when using drip irrigation relative to micro sprinklers or micro sprayers likely do not exceed around 5 i e k c mid act for drip irrigation may be smaller by about 0 05 than for micro sprinklers or sprayers however various papers refer to larger k c differences up to 30 but do not show a justification for that high difference in actual et since values of the fraction of crop ground cover or differences in the radiation energy available at the soil are not reported since k cb values do not include soil evaporation k cb values likely do not change or change little with the irrigation method in the case of vegetable crops i e k cb mid and k cb end values should not change or change little when the crop nearly fully covers the ground contrarily e s varies much during the first crop stages when there is an incomplete ground cover differently the effects of mulch are expected to be larger when a plastic mulch is used the possible inter row process of conversion of sensible into latent heat may reduce the effects of the plastic mulch as noted by lund and soegaard 2003 who reported on the within canopy advection of sensible heat however this process was not referred in any of the selected studies research studies on deriving k c or k cb for brussels sprouts and cauliflower were not found only the study by grattan et al 1998 was selected for artichoke in this study furrow irrigation was used and et c act was measured using breb instrumentation with good fetch however their mid season k c was quite low when compared to artichoke tabled in fao56 three studies relative to broccoli were selected lópez urrea et al 2009b bryla et al 2010 johnson and trout 2012 which provided data on actual k c and k cb the first two were developed with weighing lysimeters and the latter with rs ndvi all of them provided for k cb data however different than the tabulated value for broccoli in fao56 they reported end season values equal to the mid season ones which indicates that harvesting for fresh human consumption is done when broccoli is green and tender i e before senescence starts to occur the same equality for mid and end season k c and k cb happens with lettuce and spinach table 3 an example showing the dynamics of k cb k e and k cb for broccoli is presented in fig 5 broccoli et c measurements were obtained from a large weighing lysimeter lópez urrea et al 2009b specifically et c values were calculated from lysimeter s daily mass loss minus drainage loss and the mass from irrigation and or rainfall was added k c data were calculated as the ratio of the lysimeter measured et c to et o computed daily with the fao56 pm equation the soil evaporation coefficient k e was calculated with the standard fao56 approach allen et al 1998 and afterwards the basal crop coefficient k cb was obtained from the lysimeter k c values minus the calculated k e values results in fig 5 show several k e peaks occurring in response to wetting events these peaks are particularly high during the initial and early crop development stages when the fraction of ground cover by the crop f c is small and therefore solar energy is largely available at the soil surface for evaporation during the mid and late seasons when f c is higher the k e peaks are smaller and k cb becomes the main component of k c as previously pointed out k cb end equals k cb mid because the broccoli was harvested before senescence cabbage crop coefficients are reported in a few papers but only two studies could be selected chaterlán et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 both performed a swb the first using a gravimetric approach along with the isareg model and the latter using watermark soil moisture sensors and a purposefully developed inverse modeling approach their calibrated k c values are close to those tabulated in fao56 thus with k c end std slightly smaller or equal to k c mid std this means that cabbage harvesting was performed early to assure tender produce thus with high k c end values zhang et al 2011 also reported on basal k cb values there are various studies reporting on k c and k cb for lettuce values for the mid season are not very different discordance comes from the fact that while three of them oliveira et al 2005 bryla et al 2010 giménez et al 2019 reported equal values for k c mid std and for k c end std the study by fernández pacheco et al 2014 proposes a lower value for k c end std the k cb values proposed for iceberg lettuce by bryla et al 2010 and johnson and trout 2012 are similar and both papers report a k c end std corresponding to early harvest when leaves are green and tender differently ramírez cuesta et al 2019 report a lower k cb end there is no apparent justification for this difference when it is well known that tenderness of leaves is paramount for marketing lettuce for green salad k c and k cb were obtained with various methods bryla et al 2010 used weighing lysimeters oliveira et al 2005 performed a swb and used dl with tdr observations fernández pacheco et al 2014 used breb and digital image processing and giménez et al 2019 used the model vegsyst outdoors calibrated and validated with dry matter production data finally johnson and trout 2012 computed k cb values with rs ndvi and ramírez cuesta et al 2019 used rs savi the crop coefficients for spinach reported by piccinni et al 2009 and giménez et al 2019 are very similar with k c end std k c mid std the former refers to determining et cact with wl while the latter computed et c act using the model vegsyst outdoors as referred above the reported studies provided ancillary data relative to a few crops only artichoke broccoli cabbage and lettuce which are presented in table 4 4 3 fruit and pod vegetable crops table 5 presents the observed actual k c mid obs and k c end obs and the respective values adjusted to the standard climate k c mid std and k c end std similarly observed and adjusted k cb values are shown in table 5 most selected studies refer to estimating single k c and only a few derived basal k cb values likely because the derivation of the latter is more demanding in terms of observations and computations aimed at the partition of et c act into crop transpiration t c act and soil evaporation e s some of the non selected papers for these crops are highly cited but had insufficient description of methodologies for computing et c act a good number of selected k c studies used lysimeters both wl and dl which included performing the swb supported by either tdr or fdr sensors in studies for tomato breb and ec instrumentation were used in addition a few swb studies were performed based upon neutron probe fdr tdr and gravimetric data collection the selected k cb studies used various approaches including one that estimated k cb from ndvi remote sensing data others used precise wl swb with models such as simdualkc rosa et al 2012 which was purposefully developed for application of the fao56 dual k c approach allen et al 2005a b the reported k c information in many selected papers was corrected for several reasons such as advection and clothesline effects as previously discussed tabled values reported by kong et al 2012 yang et al 2018 and bastos et al 2012 obtained in small plots were corrected to reduce those effects which likely caused the high k c values reported the k c end obs value for bell pepper reported by shukla et al 2013 was corrected to avoid the observed k c end value exceeding k c mid for papers using the cimis penman et o knowing that the latter exceeds the pm et o by 8 itenfisu et al 2003 the k c values were then corrected by 8 i e case of studies by grattan et al 1998 hanson and bendixen 2004 hanson and may 2006 the studies by karam et al 2009 yaghi et al 2013 and zhang et al 2018 were retained because they provided good ancillary information despite conducting experiments under water stress conditions and attaining low mid season k c values which were not considered for the updated k c values a number of research studies were performed with mulch mainly plastic sheets carvalho et al 2012 melo et al 2013 shukla et al 2013 2014 zheng et al 2013 biswas et al 2015 borges et al 2015 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 their effect was not considered since this review does not refer to the periods before the mid season when impacts of mulch in lowering e s are greater moreover by the mid season the canopy cover of vegetables that are consumed for fruit and pod is quite high thus reducing the impacts of mulches nevertheless users are invited to adopt a 5 to 10 k c correction if considered appropriate for their uses the study by carvalho et al 2012 evidenced a consistent reduction of k c mid std and k cend std when no till was used i e when crop residues act as a mulch nevertheless it has not been possible to assess the impacts of mulches which certainly tend to reduce both k c mid and k c end however depending on the fraction of ground cover f c which is rarely reported drip irrigation is the most common method referred in the selected references the research on squash reported by amer 2011 shows that k c values are larger for furrow irrigation comparatively to drip irrigation with k c mid std of 1 07 for furrows and 1 01 for drip the difference is small but gives some evidence assuming that the worldwide tendency will be towards adopting drip irrigation in vegetable crops production consideration needs to be given on adopting reduced k c and k cb values for drip as these selected papers using drip irrigation indicate the updated k c and k cb values in table 5 rarely increased relative to the fao56 tabled values as also discussed later in section 5 the selected studies relative to bell pepper and chili pepper capsicum annuum l used diverse research approaches to derive k c or k cb those by karam et al 2009 and bryla et al 2010 used well managed weighing lysimeters well located in large cropped fields the first also included the computation of the swb based upon tdr measurements the studies by kong et al 2012 and shukla et al 2013 were conducted with drainage lysimeters and the swb was performed with respectively tdr and fdr sensors the study by johnson and trout 2012 obtained k cb data by remote sensing of ndvi data the studies by alemayehu et al 2009 and yang et al 2018 were both performed using a swb procedure based upon respectively neutron probe and gravimetric measurements the study on chilli tabasco pepper capsicum frutescens l used a wl miranda et al 2006 comparing the k c mid std and k cb end std results among those studies it could be concluded that results reported by karam et al 2009 referred to non pristine cropping conditions and therefore could not be used to update k c values but could be used for the ancillary information table 6 the values of k cb end std are close to the k cb mid std values for bell pepper because harvesting is commonly performed when fruits are green and tender thus near to the mid season before senescence affects the marketable and taste characteristics of the fruit differently chili pepper fruits which are not consumed green need a longer late season to turn red and complete the synthesis of capsaicinoids the substances responsible for the hot taste of the fruits therefore the k cb end of chili peppers are lower than the k cb mid the study by alemayehu et al 2009 compared several chili pepper varieties however results for those varieties having lower k cb values were not included since they were likely collected under non pristine conditions this study clearly shows that k cb or k c values are influenced by the crop variety the study on tabasco pepper capsicum frutescens l by miranda et al 2006 identifies another aspect influencing the k c values for crops aimed at the fresh market harvesting may be performed through two harvesting periods which requires adopting two pairs k cb mid k cb end instead of a unique value for the mid and the end season table 5 and fig 6 results in fig 6 show that after the first harvest thus during the second crop cycle the k c mid value is lower than that of the first cycle which may be related to less intense flowering and fruit development few studies report on k c or k cb for eggplant and only one was retained carvalho et al 2012 this study compared no till with conventional tillage and results show that k c for no till are smaller than those for conventional tillage due to the effect of the residue cover this demonstrates impacts of crop residues on k c quite large in the referred application since the eggplant usually leaves a relatively large ground fraction exposed to radiation moreover results indicate that k c end should be close to k c mid since the fruit should be harvested tender several studies focusing on tomato k c and k cb were selected they used a variety of procedures to estimate crop et hanson and may 2006 used both breb and swb while rana et al 2012 adopted ec observations swb models were used by yacoubi et al 2010 and zhang et al 2018 the former with the isareg model and neutron probe measurements and the latter with the simdualkc model and gravimetric swc measurements swb based upon gravimetric soil sampling were used by rinaldi et al 2011 whereas zheng et al 2013 used a swb based upon tensiometer observations and derived k c with the allen and pereira 2009 approach for estimating k c from crop density and height garofalo et al 2011 used wl while biswas et al 2015 used dl the observed k cb by zhang et al 2018 was quite low the reported information allows identifying the occurrence of water stress therefore only related ancillary data were further used for that study table 6 contrarily to the small variation of k c mid std the tomato values for k c end std varied widely from 1 05 zheng et al 2013 to 0 63 yacoubi et al 2010 that variability in cases of tomato for fresh market likely was due to differences in crop management particularly when harvesting is practiced throughout several days or weeks differently the studies relative to tomato for processing hanson and may 2006 rana et al 2012 do not provide k c end but their authors state that harvest was performed after the beginning of senescence thus under these conditions k c end should be lower but close to k c mid only two studies focusing on k c for cucumber were retained both refer to using swb procedures one adopting a gravimetric approach amer et al 2009 and the second using neutron probe yaghi et al 2013 the low k c values reported by the latter led to assuming water stress impacts and therefore reported k c values were not considered for the updates of fao56 weighing lysimeters were used in two melon studies miranda and bleicher 2001 melo et al 2013 while a breb was used by borges et al 2015 in all studies drip irrigation was used which likely reduced soil evaporation impacts of plastic mulch on k c are evident since k c values reported by miranda and bleicher 2001 when not using mulch are much larger than those reported in other studies with mulch only one k c study was selected for pumpkins yavuz et al 2015 another for squash amer 2011 and also one reporting on k cb for zucchini squash by darouich et al 2020 the former used a swb approach with gravimetric soil water measurements the second also used a swb with fdr measurements and the latter used a swb with neutron probe and data handling with the simdualkc model in addition the study by amer 2011 compared k c values for drip and furrow irrigation showing a reduction with drip relative to furrow of around 5 table 5 three publications reporting on crop coefficients for watermelon were selected two used weighing lysimeters miranda et al 2004 bastos et al 2012 while the third used drainage lysimeters and installed plastic mulch shukla et al 2014 thus resulting in k c mid values smaller than the former ones the end season k c are very different which relates with the duration of the harvesting period longer when k c end is smaller there are few publications reporting on crop coefficients for irrigated okra and information provided in these studies is insufficient selected references consist of those developed by the extension services of the university of florida dukes et al 2015 and by researchers from india patil and tiwari 2018 2019 results relative to k c mid std are similar but those for the end season are very different with low k c end std values when the harvesting practice is with the fruit somewhat close to maturation these differences likely result from different traditional marketing in the two regions the studies performed with plastic mulched strawberries under drip irrigation grattan et al 1998 hanson and bendixen 2004 considered establishing a k c f c relationship useful for irrigation scheduling purposes for estimating et c act grattan et al 1998 used the breb method while hanson and bendixen 2004 used a swb supported with time domain transmissibility tdt sensors both studies were performed in coastal california climates and the respective k c mid std show quite small differences the studies in table 5 provided for ancillary information that may help in characterizing the studied crops those data are presented in table 6 the data gaps in table 6 identify the insufficiencies data on root depths are reasonably informative but those on crop heights show numerous gaps and in the case of tomato identify a wide range of crop management options with h max varying from 0 48 m to 1 25 m the latter when the crop grows on stalks a main gap however is limited data on the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p which plays a main role in irrigation scheduling this information is completely lacking for all but three crops the deficiency of ancillary data probably results from the fact that the study aims were not at providing information for irrigation scheduling using soil information but at different objectives in terms of understanding the crops behavior 4 4 herbs spices and special vegetable crops this group of crops is an upgrade relative to the fao56 tables on the one hand the pineapple crop was added to the vegetable crops on the other hand various herbs and spice not considered in fao56 are now added following research developed in the last decennium the reported values for k c mid obs and k c end obs and the respective values adjusted to the standard climate k c mid std and k c end std are given in table 7 reported values for the basal crop coefficients are also included in table 7 but refer to only a few herbs and spice crops the selected studies relative to basil used swb with tdr measurements combined with dl ghamarnia et al 2015a or with wl measurements marques et al 2015 to determine et c act reported k c mid std are similar among basil studies but k c end std differ much since k c end std equals k c mid std when only one harvest is practiced while low values for k c end std correspond to multiple harvests similar k c mid behavior was reported for lemon balm ghamarnia et al 2015b in which et c act was estimated with the swb based on tdr measurements combined with dl and also adopting the simdualkc model however for k cb this method was applied only for a single harvest and thus k cb values for lemon balm are only available for this single harvest condition for black cumin and coriander et c act was also determined by a swb with tdr measurements silva et al 2013 and in combination with dl observations in studies by ghamarnia et al 2013 2014 and ghamarnia and sasani 2015 however the k cb mid values reported by ghamarnia et al 2013 2014 2015a were decreased considering advection influences the study ghamarnia and sasani 2015 also applied the simdualkc model thus making k cb values available for coriander both crops commonly have multiple harvests and have end season k c and k cb smaller than for mid season similarly multiple harvests are used for parsley however dukes et al 2015 report only a value for k c mid likely because k c end varies with time at each harvest after mid season only the study by yarami et al 2011 was selected for saffron where et c act was determined by dl and a swb with neutron probe data that study used micro lysimeters to support deriving k cb also a single paper was selected for pineapple azevedo et al 2007 where breb was used herbs and spices may be subject to single or multiples harvests which create different k c values as reported earlier for tabasco pepper table 5 in multiple harvest conditions the k c mid refers to the peak period before harvesting and k c end refers to the period before crop regrowth however criteria followed in the selected references varied and information provided in table 7 is indicative of this the ancillary data on crop characteristics are provided in table 8 however the available ancillary data from selected literature are once again scarce root depths which are essential when performing a soil water balance were commonly not given for most of herbs and spices moreover the p soil water depletion fractions for no stress were also not given for most of the herbs and spices 5 consolidated updates on standard single and basal crop coefficients the updated standard k c values for vegetable crops referring to a standard sub humid climate rh min 45 u 2 2 m s 1 are presented in table 9 they were defined taking into consideration both the observed k c mid std and k cend std values reported in tables 1 3 5 and 7 and the k c mid and k c end values tabulated in fao56 allen et al 1998 in general the updated k c values differ little from those tabulated in fao56 k c mid and k c end values for roots tubers bulbs and stem vegetable crops were unchanged for asparagus celery and radish since acceptable k c studies on these crops were not available the values were also unchanged for carrots and potato in agreement with available research results following reported values in table 1 the updated k c mid values were slightly increased for cassava and garlic they were also slightly increased for onions harvested green to have the same k c mid values as dry and seed onions k c end values were slightly decreased for onions but not for seed since there was no related information available in contrast the updated standard k c end for parsnip rutabaga turnip and table beets were slightly increased as to become closer to k c mid thus following trends of earlier harvest of table roots and tubers i e with reduced effects of senescence the k c end for sweet potato was slightly decreased based on the available data for leaves and flowers vegetable crops k c mid and k c end values remained unchanged for artichoke following available research the k c mid for broccoli was increased by 0 05 but was not changed for other crops in this category for broccoli brussel sprouts cabbage cauliflower lettuce and spinach the k c end values were increased to become equal or very close to k c mid because these crops are eaten when fresh and tender thus it was assumed that those crops would be harvested before senescence starts the largest k c end increase was for broccoli which went from 0 95 to 1 10 there was sufficient research on k c for all fruit and pod vegetable crops considered thus the k c mid and k c end values tabulated in fao56 were often updated a distinction was made between bell pepper and chili peppers within the capsicum annuum crops and within the chilies between capsicum annuum and capsicum frutescens tabasco pepper for the latter single and double harvesting were considered the standard k c mid values for bell pepper were increased by 0 05 and the same value 1 10 was also adopted for the other peppers for bell pepper often consumed fresh k c end was increased to become closer to k c mid differently a smaller k c end is proposed for chili peppers because the late season of chillies is longer to allow for the red color of chillies and for the synthesis of capsaicinoids the substance responsible for their flavor however the duration of the late season thus the k c end value too may differ with the species and cultivar of chillies in addition smaller k c mid and k c end are proposed for a second harvest when practiced following results reported in the literature slightly larger k c mid values are proposed for cucumber zucchini squash and watermelon while both k c mid and k c end are increased for cantaloupe melon becoming closer to those of the melon crop standard k c mid values were not changed for eggplant melon and pumpkin but were decreased for strawberries however standard k c end values were changed slightly increasing for melon and eggplants indicating that fruits at harvesting should be harvested before senescence is completed distinct k c end values already suggested in fao56 were adopted when the crop is harvested for processing or for fresh market a lower value for fresh market refers to a long period of harvesting for okra not considered in fao56 a value based on observations was assumed k c mid 0 95 since this fruit is normally consumed fresh the k c end is close to the k c mid indicating that for produce quality senescence effects should be avoided reported research results did not provide justification for the high fao56 k c mid values for tomato thus both k c mid values for processing and fresh market were decreased to the same value 1 10 however different k c end values were adopted with that for processing smaller than the one for market because the fruit should not be too tender for machine harvesting for processing harvesting should occur when ripening starts when soluble contents are high which better value is reached when the fruit is still not fully mature yellow orange color however harvesting for the fresh market starts during the mid season and lasts while there are fruits in the field thus in practice k c end may be smaller than the tabulated one with exception of mint all standard k c values for herbs and spices are new and were selected considering the literature review summarized in table 7 thus based on the selected references two sets of k c mid and k c end were adopted for basil and lemon balm one for single harvest and the other for multiple harvest of these herbs the standard k c values for pineapple were highly increased relative to those tabulated in fao56 only one reference was selected but other studies or reviews such as that by carr 2012 were concordant that the k c mid and k c end should be higher than those proposed in fao56 near 0 90 in addition equal values were selected for mid and end season k c considering the common management used in south america the updated standard basal crop coefficients for vegetable crops referring to a standard sub humid climate rh min 45 u 2 2 m s 1 are presented in table 10 the updated k cb values also result from considering both the observed k cb mid std and k cb end std values reported in literature tables 1 3 5 and 7 and the k cb mid and k cb end values tabulated in fao56 allen et al 1998 their definition followed a similar approach to that used for k c mid and for k c end reported above nevertheless because only few studies focused on basal crop coefficients most proposed values in table 10 follow the general guidelines used in fao56 to derive k cb from k c section 3 3 as well as the differences between k c and k cb values in fao56 in other words the selection of k c mid and k c end values described above relative to table 9 dictated the definition of k cb mid and k cb end values proposed in table 10 thus differences between k c mid table 9 and k cb mid table 10 generally do not exceed 0 05 for crops fully covering the ground but differ by 0 10 otherwise differences between k c end and k cb end are also small 0 10 when rain or irrigation often occur during the late season and 0 05 for dry conditions this indicates that k e values k c k cb are small during the mid and late season i e soil evaporation e s is small since most of the ground area is shadowed therefore receiving only a limited amount of short wave radiation available for soil water evaporation reduced e s limits the k c differences among irrigation methods and the effect of mulch which are much larger in sparse canopies and during the earlier crop growth stages of vegetable crops most studies were performed with drip irrigation only a few used micro sprinkling or micro sprayers and even less furrow irrigation or sprinklers k c tend to be smaller with drip irrigation since less soil is wetted and often the wetted soil is shadowed thus e s is smaller than for other methods because harvesting of small vegetables is commonly performed before senescence starts or when a slight maturation occurs ground cover by vegetation is kept high and therefore e s is kept small until harvesting therefore reductions in k c when using drip irrigation relative to micro sprinklers or micro sprayers likely do not exceed around 5 to 10 i e k c mid act for drip irrigation may be smaller by about 0 05 than k c mid act for micro sprinklers or sprayers however various papers refer to larger k c differences up to 30 but do not show a justification for that high difference since k cb values do not include soil evaporation k cb values likely do not change with the irrigation method similarly k cb is also generally not affected by the control of e s by mulches therefore the k c and k cb provided in tables 9 and 10 may confidently be used in practice namely to parameterize soil water balance and irrigation scheduling models pereira et al 2020c however users must decide on which corrections to introduce either due to irrigation method the use of mulches the adoption of deficit irrigation small size of plots or due to the occurrence of advection which effectively may require a decrease in k c and k cb values however in a limited amount 6 ancillary data although ancillary data for vegetable crops were limited considering the values reported in the cited studies the ancillary parameter values proposed in various tables of fao56 could be updated to provide better information for readers about parameter options the ancillary values available from the selected literature tables 2 4 6 and 8 are summarized in table 11 together with the former tabulated values in fao56 the information provided in the selected papers led to reducing the tabulated rooting depths in fao56 for several crops vegetable crops often have short roots and because irrigation water management today is mostly with frequent water applications e g by drip irrigation smaller rooting depths are warranted good examples of reduced depths with supporting data were for cabbage processing tomato and melons differently updated crop heights are sometimes larger than the fao56 tabulated ones which likely corresponds to new varieties and new crop management practices it is noted however that a few updates of z r and h max were made when information was not available but followed the personal knowledge of authors nevertheless for most cases data provided in fao56 was kept unchanged reported values for the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p of vegetable crops were often smaller than those tabulated in fao56 because drip irrigation is more often used with vegetable crops irrigation frequency is high and plants are generally short rooted there is no apparent reason to adopt large p values instead following the reported values it appears preferable to adopt smaller p values which correspond to minimizing the risk for water stress thus values for p were often decreased while there is not an fao56 table for maximum crop cover and thus no need to update f c max the values observed in some selected the papers are summarized in table 11 this data may prove useful for irrigation scheduling purposes of these crops mainly to parameterize soil water balance models pereira et al 2020c 7 conclusions and recommendations the current study led to conclusions of diverse nature first it is important to note that the tabulated k c and k cb values in fao56 allen et al 1998 were generally confirmed by the research conducted in the last two decennia and reviewed herein albeit with slight refinements made for various crops a similar conclusion was derived from the study reported in the companion paper relative to field crops pereira et al 2020a this conclusion makes it clear that the fao56 tabulated crop coefficients can assuredly be trusted it is also essential to recognize the adequateness of the definition and computation of the reference evapotranspiration and of the procedures relative to the crop coefficients with this in mind users can also be assured that the k c et o method proposed by fao56 is accurate and appropriate for a variety of applications otherwise tabulated k c and k cb should be adapted to the prevailing conditions the performed review effectively demonstrated the appropriateness of clearly distinguishing actual from standard crop coefficients with the latter referring to crops cultivated in pristine conditions in which the evapotranspiration may well be considered the potential et of the considered crop under given environmental conditions in reality there is very abundant literature where this distinction is not made and where crop coefficients correspond to cultivation practices far from pristine due to water stress salinity stress or stresses produced by various insufficiencies of agronomic nature the review also allowed to perceive that a distinction between actual and standard potential conditions is often not recognized or even accepted by many researchers this obviously makes it more difficult to transfer research results of crop coefficients from one location to another nevertheless the review has shown that using well calibrated and validated soil water balance models e g the simdualkc model has made it possible to overcome problems related to stress and to achieve k c standardized values more research along these lines is desirable since the reported use of models in the reviewed literature is scarce in addition research must pay attention to the adjustment of k c to the standard climate the review has also demonstrated that differences between k c observed and those adjusted to the standard climate may be quite large particularly when observations are performed in arid and windy conditions for those reasons it is very important that k c papers include appropriate description of methods used and of the climate during experimentation the review also indicated that researchers often do not include any scrutiny relative to high k c values which could be due to either flaws in field measurements or to advection influences on the one hand it was observed that exceptionally high k c values are often reported in papers where the description of methods employed were insufficient which may relate to absence of scrutiny of research results that lack of scrutiny could also be associated with advection impacts which were not considered in many papers published during the last two decennia therefore it is recommended that research studies of this nature include a careful analysis of results including the time dynamics of et that would provide better information about the accuracy of et estimation on the other hand since energy balance methods mainly ec and breb are becoming quite popular in et research it is recommended that the dynamics of the energy balance be explored to verify when latent heat exceeds the available energy r n g and or when sensible heat becomes negative thus identifying periods where et was influenced by advection in addition it is recommended that derived k c or k cb values are scrutinized comparing them with those tabulated which in fact correspond to a kind of upper limit of k c values for the standard climate this scrutiny also applies to one step et c act since easily the ratios et c act et o may be compared with tabulated standard k c it became apparent from this review that the definition and computational procedures relative to the pm et o equation are often not followed or have not yet been accepted by many researchers this is well apparent through numerous comparative studies of et equations including when authors search for a k c value for a given crop and by the use as reference of a variety of equations different from the pm et o equation without considering the actual ratio between et o computed with the selected equation to the pm et o naturally using an et o different than the pm et o results in different k c values on the one hand the derived k c are negatively affected and transferability of research results are hampered when a different et o is used on the other hand using the fao56 tabulated standard k c with a different et equation leads to over or under estimation errors in using the k c et o approach it is recommended that research using a different et equation should consider the ratio between et o equations when using k c values that refer to the pm et o thus allow the ability to convert k c values the best use of the k c et o method implies using the segmented fao k c curve i e with accepting the definition of the four crop growth stages and the definition of three k c values k c ini k c mid and k c end using time averaged k c values or non linear k c functions with time are difficult to use predictably because the corresponding values are site focused the fao k c curve is also difficult to use predictably due to inter annual weather variability inducing variable durations of the crop growth stages however this difficulty may be overcome when expressing those duration in terms of cumulative growth degree days this consists of an area of research already initiated for various field crops and that should be extended to vegetable crops the review reported herein provided a set of updated tables for k c mid and k c end as well as k cb mid and k cb end season for a great number of vegetable crops exceeding those previously tabulated in fao56 the new tabulated values refer to the pm et o reference equation and the standard sub humid climate with rh min 45 and u 2 2 m s 1 the k c values principally refer to drip irrigation without the use of mulches plastic tunnels or greenhouses the review allowed us to observe that results comparing impacts of irrigation methods on the single and basal crop coefficients for vegetables are not very consistent likely because many variables are considered further research is required for various crops and with consideration of the relationships between soil evaporation transpiration fraction of soil wetted fraction of ground cover by the crop hopefully future research will focus on a few of the relevant variables in such a way that k c and k cb values could be easily recognized and related results more readily transferred to other locations the impacts of mulches on k c and k cb values could not be developed through this review and consist of another area where further needs of research were clearly identified first it is necessary to produce research focusing on high accuracy et estimation including through well developed energy balance and water balance methods second it is required that impacts of mulches focus on the dynamics of soil evaporation and plant transpiration with consideration of the fraction of ground cover in fact there are numerous studies relative to mulches mainly plastic ones as for a recent special issue of this journal entitled plastic mulching effects on water use efficiency crop growth and soil health in northwestern china to overcome difficulties resulting from the fact that studies refer to multiple issues it is recommended that studies relative to mulch impacts on water use include a focus on the base et processes and dynamics today s vegetable farm irrigators face climate change challenges and related environmental consequences such as decreasing water availability thus it is apparent that increasing the irrigation water savings in these crops will play a major role in irrigated agriculture s adaption to climate change effects it cannot be emphasized more clearly that the upper limits of potential crop evapotranspiration must be recognized in the irrigation management practice despite some limitations of the current review it is recommended that researchers and practitioners use the updated k c and k cb values to determine those et limits when planning or developing irrigation scheduling programs when using fao56 procedures it is of upmost importance to apply the pm et o equation for reference evapotranspiration and to ensure climatic parameters are correctly measured and scrutinized avoiding the use of high k c values let say above 1 25 which have no physical justification for these crops can lead to saving irrigation water moreover the use of drip irrigation systems for vegetables is a means to apply frequent irrigation from mid season on without increased evaporation consequences thus well planned and highly efficient irrigation scheduling should result using fao56 et estimation along with properly managed drip irrigation declaration of

10442,several studies have shown that irrigation is essential for global agricultural development however water is a limited resource and should be used as efficiently as possible which requires appropriate management as such the search for irrigation techniques that are more efficient in terms of water use such as subsurface drip irrigation is ongoing subsurface drip irrigation systems are highly efficient and can serve as suitable alternatives for the rational management of water however these systems also have limitations specifically variation in flow rate can occur depending on the soil characteristics subsurface drip irrigation systems covered by only a thin soil layer have been used especially in irrigated coffee crops in brazil however most related studies have investigated the variation in the flow rate at relatively great soil depths thus the objective of the present study was to evaluate two emitters buried at a depth of 5 cm to determine the variation in the flow rate within four different soil types and assess the wet bulb the evaluated soil types were classified as a sandy loam silty loam clay loam or clay and the two emitters evaluated included a pressure compensating drip emitter pc and a non pressure compensating model npc with respect to the pc emitter a flow rate reduction was detected only in the clay loam soil but with respect to the npc emitter a reduction in the flow rate was detected in a sandy loam and clay loam the flow rate varied even at shallow depths for some soils and the soil type and emitter flow rate affected this variation as well as the water distribution in the wet bulb thus this variation should be considered even for systems installed at shallow depths keywords subsurface drip irrigation sdi small depths soils soil water movement 1 introduction the use of subsurface drip irrigation systems has been increasing and yields various benefits including the ability to apply water close to the plant root system without wetting the soil surface which results in small losses by evaporation and thus high application efficiency ayars et al 1999 fan and li 2018 because the drip lines are not exposed on the surface mechanical damage and solar radiation are minimized facilitating crop management practices and increasing the longevity of the system martínez and reca 2014 as a variation of surface drip irrigation systems subsurface systems are also associated with the disadvantage of a relatively high risk of clogging which can be aggravated by root intrusion gil et al 2011 one of the main differences between surface and subsurface systems is that in the latter soil characteristics can affect the flow rate from the emitter gil et al 2008 thereby affecting the uniformity of the system several authors have studied this issue for example warrick and shani 1996 investigated the effects of soil hydraulic conductivity on the variation in the flow rate of subsurface emitters lazarovitch et al 2006 2005 investigated the effects of soil properties via mathematical models and fan and li 2018 and ren et al 2018 studied the effects of the bulk density and initial soil water content on the flow rate of emitters ren et al 2018 also developed a model that takes these parameters into account and analyzes the effects of soil variability on the discharge of lateral lines shani et al 1996 measured the pressure in emitters buried in the field and reported that when the discharge of the emitter is greater than the soil infiltration rate the pressure head around the emitter becomes positive generating back pressure that reduces the hydraulic gradient between the inside of the emitter and the soil consequently reducing the emitter flow rate gil et al 2008 shani et al 1996 in fine textured soils the back pressure effect is more pronounced resulting in a greater reduction in the flow rate gil et al 2008 shani et al 1996 cavities can develop around buried emitters where water flows freely and the size of these cavities can affect the amount of back pressure gil et al 2010 studied the formation of these cavities and related it to the emitter flow rate in addition gil et al 2011 evaluated the variation in the flow rate of different emitters in two types of soil by using simulations the authors proposed procedures to determine the maximum variation in the flow rate while considering the effects of soil hydraulic properties variations in flow rate due to soil properties can affect the performance of subsurface drip irrigation systems leading to inadequate amounts of water applied ren et al 2017 which can affect the homogeneity of applications and consequently affect the rates of nutrient applications lazarovitch et al 2006 most of the cited studies investigating the variation in emitter flow rate as a function of soil characteristics and back pressure were performed at depths between 10 and 40 cm however for some crops such as those in the large coffee growing areas irrigated by subsurface drip irrigation systems in brazil the tendency has been to cover the emitters with only a thin layer of soil around 5 cm to protect the lines from mechanical damage the same principle is true for landscape irrigation where the lateral lines are covered with a small layer of soil followed by the vegetation waller and yitayew 2016 given the above the objective of the present study was to evaluate the variation in the flow rate caused by the use of two subsurface emitters buried at a depth of 5 cm in 4 different soil types 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil water movement and soil physics characterization the four soil types used were collected from different locations in the southern region of the state of minas gerais brazil in efforts to encompass the different types of soil in this region which is one of the most important coffee production area in brazil the soil samples had the following textures sandy loam sal clay loam cal silty loam sil and clay cla table 1 the soil was collected along the 5 30 cm depth profile after the surface layer was removed all the samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm mesh sieve in order to standardize the soil and minimize spatial variability and the water content before each test was approximately 1 the texture analysis was performed at the laboratory of soil physics of the university of lavras ufla the soil water retention curve fig 1 was fit by the model proposed by van genuchten 1980 with the samples submitted to tensions of 1 2 4 5 6 50 200 and 1500 kpa and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was determined at a constant head permeameter for all soils except for silty loam which was determined by the falling head method for both cases 3 samples from each soil were used and the soil density adjusted according to table 1 to better understand the water movement in the soil the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was also evaluated using the soil water diffusivity eq 1 for the soil hydraulic

0 l h 1 a non pressure compensating npc system with a recommended working pressure range of 80 kpa to 140 kpa a wall thickness of 0 90 mm and an outer diameter of 16 mm both surface and subsurface flow rate measurements were performed at an operating pressure of 100 kpa with the drip line buried 5 cm below the soil surface and with 4 replicates per drip line in the 4 types of soil the tests were conducted using an experimental apparatus fig 3 consisting of an air compressor connected to a pressure regulating valve 2 kpa which was connected to a mariotte bottle made with pvc pipe with a height of 1 2 m and a diameter of 125 mm suspended through a calibrated load cell with a load capacity of 100 kg 0 02 kg that was fixed in a tripod the drip lines containing 1 emitter unit were placed in a plastic container with a 440 mm diameter and 605 mm height and tested once at a time the pressure was monitored by a pressure transducer 3 kpa while the soil water content was monitored by six 10hs sensors from decagon devices 0 03 cm³ cm 3 installed as shown in fig 4 it was used the manufacturer calibration equation to determine the moisture which is a general equation for mineral soils the distance between sensors was in accordance with the manufacturer s recommendations the sensors were arranged in such a way that one sensor does not interfere in the other respecting the influence radius informed by the manufacture the data were acquired at 6 min intervals by a cr10 campbell scientific datalogger and used to construct maps of the advancement of the wetting front by kriging the same apparatus used for data collection was used for constructing the flow rate versus pressure curve of the emitters evaluated the curve was constructed according to the abnt iso 9261 standard 2006 for the measurements of the subsurface flow rate soil was added to the container in successive 5 cm layers until a height of 30 cm was reached after the addition of each layer the container was raised to a height of 10 cm and dropped to compact the soil after this procedure the density was measured taking 3 non deformed samples and drying it at an oven at 105 c for 48 h the resulting mean densities were 1 57 1 33 1 33 and 1 07 g cm ³ for the sal cal sil and cla soil types respectively table 1 the drip line which was 30 cm long and contained one emitter was subjected to an operating time of 1 h and the flow rate was determined by the difference in the mass of the mariotte bottle as there is no water entering the bottle its volume decreases with the operation of the dripper so every 6 min the mass of the container was measured through the load cell how the flow rate is determined by the ratio between volume and time it was determined using eq 2 the procedure was repeated four times for each soil the flow rate when the emitter was on the soil surface was calculated in the same manner also using 4 repetitions the superficial tests were performed before subsurface tests and the emitter

experimental design for results analysis of flow and operating pressure over time of the tested emitters we used a completely randomized design in a split plot scheme with two sources of variation soil main plot with four levels sandy loam sal clay loam cal silty loam sil and clay cla and time secondary plot with levels defined by 6 min time intervals within 1 h working time when significant differences were verified due to the sources of variation by the f test at 5 probability the tukey test was used to means comparison also at 5 probability regarding the comparison of surface and subsurface conditions on hydraulic variables a second essay was performed where we used a completely randomized design also with four replications the only source of variation was the position of the emitter five levels surface sur buried in sandy loam b sal buried in clay loam b cal buried in silty loam b sil and buried in clay b clay for significant differences verified due to the source of variation by the f test at 5 probability the tukey test was used to means comparison also at 5 significance level 3 results and discussion the results of the initial characterization of the emitters are shown in fig 5 where the flow rate versus the pressure curves are shown for both emitters evaluated on the surface the specific behavior of each emitter in terms of pressure compensation is evident as shown by the observed values of the emitter coefficients regarding the ksat values evaluated table 1 especially for clay soil even though its value seems high the results are real such values were obtained due to experimental conditions and soil s natural features some tropical clay soils have this characteristic of forming microaggregates and because the hydraulic conductivity in the saturated condition is more dependent on the structure than on the texture of the soil as it increases the degree of the soil aggregation its value increases gonçalves and libardi 2013 another point mentioned by these same authors is that even small soil pores can conduct more water when they are continuous reflecting the importance of its continuity this characteristic of some tropical clay soils particularly oxisoils which present hydraulic behavior very similar to sandy soils it is not unusual according to tomasella et al 2000 therefore due to the conditions in which the experiment was carried out the fact that we have standardized the soil through sieving what led to a very uniform pore distribution varying from the field condition and favoring the increase in ksat tomasella and hodnett 1997 using a theoretical equation to estimate ksat presents a study for tropical soils in brazil and among them one similar of the clayey used in this study applying the results presented by this author we found a ksat value of approximately 1 2 cm min 1 below the value found under laboratory conditions for the constant head permeameter method but very close to the highest value found for the clay soil on the moisture dependent unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve fig 2 it is also possible to observe in fig 2 the atypical behavior of this clay soil used in this study due to its structure and high total porosity the hydraulic conductivity is high near to saturation condition but drops considerably with just a small reduction in the soil moisture and in drier conditions the water movement becomes more difficult table 2 shows the variance analysis for the emitter flow and operating pressure variation as a function of time and soil type with respect to the emitters installed below the surface no significant effects of the time at which the flow rate was measured on the flow rate or pressure were detected for any of the emitters evaluated table 2 however significant differences were detected in the mean flow rate of both emitters and in the flow rate in some soil types when the emitters were below the surface table 3 shows the operating pressure for the pc emitter operating at the subsurface and the values differed only for the silty loam soil this soil showed also a totally different behavior in the water movement promoting a preferred path probably due to its low permeability table 1 as will be shown later thus there wasn t resistance to the water movement consequently the backpressure effect can have not occurred table 4 shows the mean flow rate for the npc emitter that was significantly influenced by the soil whereas the pc emitter was not this may be due to its higher flow rate almost double that of the other emitter since the operating pressure for this emitter did not show any significant difference it is assumed that the difference may have come from the resistance to flow imposed by each type of soil one more time the sil soil presents itself as an unexpected behavior probably this soil does not impose resistance at all once we have the formation of the preferred path to the surface evaluating just the installation position table 5 there were detected significant differences in the emitter flow rate where the mean flow rate was lower below the surface than above for both emitters in some soils types table 6 indicating that the factor causing the variation in the flow rate exerted an effect within the first few minutes after the start of the operation but before the first flow rate evaluation which was 6 min after the irrigation began even in pressure compensating emitters the backpressure effect can affect the flow rate at beginning of operation because these emitters reach full compensation after 5 10 min of operation thus during this period the dripper be vulnerable to flow rate variation gil et al 2010 reported that the back pressure increased suddenly at the start of irrigation and peaked before 3 min of testing after which it decreased rapidly until it stabilized which occurred between 3 and 6 min the backpressure stabilization in all replications evaluated by the author occurred between 0 005 and 0 006 mpa this behavior was also reported by rodríguez sinobas et al 2009 who when evaluating lateral lines in loam soil observed that the flow rate declined rapidly and became constant for both pressure compensating and non pressure compensating emitters under the assumption that back pressure reduces the flow rate of subsurface emitters the reduction in the flow rate observed in the present study may have been due to this effect as the flow had already decreased after 6 min of testing as shown in table 6 and presented as percentages in fig 6 pc emitter 2 3 l h 1 had the highest variation in flow rate except for the sandy loam soil but with significant difference just for the cal soil which presents 5 12 of the flow reduction when in subsurface installation this result contrasts that of gil et al 2008 who reported no differences between the surface and subsurface flow rates of pressure compensating emitters with rates of 2 and 4 l h 1 when buried in clay and sandy soil types as the back pressure was lower than the lower limit of the compensation range of the emitter gil et al 2011 reported less than 1 differences in the flow rate of pressure compensating emitters with a rate of 2 l h 1 buried in sandy soils which was considered within the experimental error range additionally the same author also reported backpressure values that were much lower than the lower limit of the pressure compensation range in addition rodríguez sinobas et al 2009 found significant differences with respect to lateral lines that were buried in loam soils and that contained pressure compensating emitters with a rate of 3 5 l h 1 the authors reported that the elastomer of the regulated emitter did not reach total compensation within the total irrigation time 30 min which caused the flow rate of the emitter to decrease rapidly at the beginning of irrigation though the rate became constant over time thebaldi et al 2016 also reported a significant reduction in the flow rate of both pressure compensating and non pressure compensating emitters under the action of backpressure operating underwater with respect to the npc emitter considering just the flow rate reduction that resulted in significant differences the greatest reduction in flow rate was observed for the sal soil 3 49 the lowest the cla soil 2 79 it was not possible to identify a clear effect of saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils on flow variations as it was expected that soils with lower conductivity values would result in higher flow variations however only a small area around the emitter reached the ksat where the water movement is facilitated but in most of the wetted area soil water content is below saturation thus the water movement is limited by non saturated hydraulic conductivity k θ therefore even with a considerable potential gradient the flow is limited by the soil and may be causing backpressure increase evaluating the results seems the flow rate reduction may be affected by both soil characteristics and emitter flow rate for the pc emitter with low flow rate 2 3 l h 1 the variation was detected just in one soil cal and for the npc emitter that has high flow rate 4 l h 1 the variation was significantly different in the sandy loam sal and clay cla soils the variability for the clay soil even with the highest saturated hydraulic conductivity can be explained by the peculiarities of the studied soil which is an oxisoil and had its particular features explained earlier these characteristics of this type of soil may have contributed in some way to the flow variation besides the variability of soil properties among repetitions in fig 2 it is possible to better observe the behavior described above when drier the clay soil has low values of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity but from 0 26 cm³ cm 3 of water content these values already become larger than clay loam and silty loam soils and eventually become larger than sandy loam soil with the data of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 2 it is possible to observe the water movement as a function of soil moisture sandy soils have a lower total pore volume in general but are larger so unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is expected to be low and had high saturated conductivity as shown in fig 2 moreover as the soil in question has low residual moisture fig 1 that is when the soil is dry the unsaturated conductivity values become low in this moisture level as low as the other soils with this in the initial moments of the test probably the values of the back pressure were elevated especially for the npc emitter that has a higher flow rate these results were opposite those expected because in previous studies such as those of gil et al 2011 and gil et al 2008 soils with a sandy texture had little effect on the flow rate because of high hydraulic conductivity however the results of the present study may have occurred because of the relatively high mean bulk density of the sal soil 1 57 g cm 3 during tests according to fan and li 2018 for a given pressure and soil moisture an increase in bulk density can reduce the flow rate of a subsurface drip line with increasing density soils become less permeable and thus at a subsurface emission point the water around the emitter becomes stagnant the authors in the same study also reported that a subsurface emitter in a sandy soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density and an 18 initial water content had a lower flow rate than did subsurface emitters in other soils with a higher clay content during the experiment in all replications and for both emitters tested a small amount of water rapidly appeared on the surface of the sil soil according to ben gal and lazarovitch 2003 and rodríguez sinobas et al 2009 when positive pressure is present around a buried emitter preferential water paths that ascend to the soil surface can be created thus with the shallow installation depth the back pressure was probably practically null explaining why the subsurface flow rate did not differ from the surface flow rate for either emitter in addition the soil has no structure as cohesive as will probably have in field conditions due to the uniformization done by the soil preparation procedure so it is probably to have absence of backpressure for this soil in this situation to evaluate the advancement of the soil wetting front thru time a series of moisture sensors were used even the sensors were not calibrated for each specific soil which would reduce the precision the behavior of the water movement is clearly different among the soils fig 7 shows the advancement of the soil wetting front for the npc emitter for this emitter as expected the moisture values in the sal soil increased rapidly because of the distribution of water inside the soil additionally compared with that in the other soil types the wetting front in the sal soil reached greater distances in both the horizontal and vertical directions more moisture was present around the emitter in the cla soil than in the other soil types with the formation of a larger wet bulb in the horizontal direction exceeding 10 cm after 36 min of testing at the end of the test the bulb reached a depth of 10 cm in the vertical direction relative to the emitter in the cal soil the bulb also grew primarily in the horizontal direction whereas in the vertical direction the depth was similar to that in the cla soil because water was present on the sil soil surface with the formation of a preferred path the wetting front did not have the characteristic shape of a wet bulb and the water was concentrated within the soil surface layers above the emitter a possible explanation for the development of the wetting on the front from left to right is that with the accumulation of water on the surface the water was directed to the sides of the container causing different water infiltration and redistribution behaviors among the replications the advancement of soil wetting in the four soil types for the pc emitter can be seen in fig 8 the behavior was similar to that of the npc emitter however the size of the wetting front was smaller from the pc emitter than from the npc emitter because of the lower flow rate of the former the water content values in the sil were much lower than those in the other soil types indicating an accumulation of water on the soil surface which was observed during the experiment independent of the soil or the flow rate evaluated the vertical wetting front reached the soil surface by the end of the 1 h of operation for all replications evaluated probably by the shallow installation depth exposure of the wet bulb to the soil surface may increase evaporative losses which can reduce the efficiency of the system 4 conclusions a reduction in the mean flow rate of the emitters buried at a shallow depth 5 cm occurred differently for some soils and emitters evaluated when that happened was at the beginning of the operation before the first evaluation that was 6 min after start running the system compared with the flow rate at the surface for the pc emitter the flow rate reduction was just significant in the clay loam soil with a reduction of 5 1 for the npc emitter the reduction was in the sandy loam and the clay soil with a reduction of 3 5 and 2 8 respectively thus even at shallow depths great care is required in subsurface drip irrigation projects once the evaluation was done at the soil with a natural structure destroyed by the uniformization process the flow reduction could be underestimated reaching higher values in the field condition the sil soil displayed the formation of preferential paths leading to the appearance of a trickle of water at the soil surface for all emitters this appearance can lead to surface runoff causing decreases in efficiency of subsurface drip irrigation systems additionally systems installed at shallow depths may experience increased evaporation due to the wet bulb on the surface consequently leading to reduced efficiency as the npc s flow rate is higher than pc emitter the wet bulb dimensions were bigger for npc emitter in all soils in general the dimensions for the sal soil were the biggest and for the cla soil was the smallest after one hour running the system at the end of the evaluation time the water content in the cla soil was higher near to the discharge point when compared with the sal and the cal soil had an intermediate behavior as explained above there isn t the formation of a wet bulb for the sil soil with the drip at shallow installation depth was observed the wet front clearly reaching the surface quickly which can promote evaporation losses reducing this advantage normally attribute

10442,several studies have shown that irrigation is essential for global agricultural development however water is a limited resource and should be used as efficiently as possible which requires appropriate management as such the search for irrigation techniques that are more efficient in terms of water use such as subsurface drip irrigation is ongoing subsurface drip irrigation systems are highly efficient and can serve as suitable alternatives for the rational management of water however these systems also have limitations specifically variation in flow rate can occur depending on the soil characteristics subsurface drip irrigation systems covered by only a thin soil layer have been used especially in irrigated coffee crops in brazil however most related studies have investigated the variation in the flow rate at relatively great soil depths thus the objective of the present study was to evaluate two emitters buried at a depth of 5 cm to determine the variation in the flow rate within four different soil types and assess the wet bulb the evaluated soil types were classified as a sandy loam silty loam clay loam or clay and the two emitters evaluated included a pressure compensating drip emitter pc and a non pressure compensating model npc with respect to the pc emitter a flow rate reduction was detected only in the clay loam soil but with respect to the npc emitter a reduction in the flow rate was detected in a sandy loam and clay loam the flow rate varied even at shallow depths for some soils and the soil type and emitter flow rate affected this variation as well as the water distribution in the wet bulb thus this variation should be considered even for systems installed at shallow depths keywords subsurface drip irrigation sdi small depths soils soil water movement 1 introduction the use of subsurface drip irrigation systems has been increasing and yields various benefits including the ability to apply water close to the plant root system without wetting the soil surface which results in small losses by evaporation and thus high application efficiency ayars et al 1999 fan and li 2018 because the drip lines are not exposed on the surface mechanical damage and solar radiation are minimized facilitating crop management practices and increasing the longevity of the system martínez and reca 2014 as a variation of surface drip irrigation systems subsurface systems are also associated with the disadvantage of a relatively high risk of clogging which can be aggravated by root intrusion gil et al 2011 one of the main differences between surface and subsurface systems is that in the latter soil characteristics can affect the flow rate from the emitter gil et al 2008 thereby affecting the uniformity of the system several authors have studied this issue for example warrick and shani 1996 investigated the effects of soil hydraulic conductivity on the variation in the flow rate of subsurface emitters lazarovitch et al 2006 2005 investigated the effects of soil properties via mathematical models and fan and li 2018 and ren et al 2018 studied the effects of the bulk density and initial soil water content on the flow rate of emitters ren et al 2018 also developed a model that takes these parameters into account and analyzes the effects of soil variability on the discharge of lateral lines shani et al 1996 measured the pressure in emitters buried in the field and reported that when the discharge of the emitter is greater than the soil infiltration rate the pressure head around the emitter becomes positive generating back pressure that reduces the hydraulic gradient between the inside of the emitter and the soil consequently reducing the emitter flow rate gil et al 2008 shani et al 1996 in fine textured soils the back pressure effect is more pronounced resulting in a greater reduction in the flow rate gil et al 2008 shani et al 1996 cavities can develop around buried emitters where water flows freely and the size of these cavities can affect the amount of back pressure gil et al 2010 studied the formation of these cavities and related it to the emitter flow rate in addition gil et al 2011 evaluated the variation in the flow rate of different emitters in two types of soil by using simulations the authors proposed procedures to determine the maximum variation in the flow rate while considering the effects of soil hydraulic properties variations in flow rate due to soil properties can affect the performance of subsurface drip irrigation systems leading to inadequate amounts of water applied ren et al 2017 which can affect the homogeneity of applications and consequently affect the rates of nutrient applications lazarovitch et al 2006 most of the cited studies investigating the variation in emitter flow rate as a function of soil characteristics and back pressure were performed at depths between 10 and 40 cm however for some crops such as those in the large coffee growing areas irrigated by subsurface drip irrigation systems in brazil the tendency has been to cover the emitters with only a thin layer of soil around 5 cm to protect the lines from mechanical damage the same principle is true for landscape irrigation where the lateral lines are covered with a small layer of soil followed by the vegetation waller and yitayew 2016 given the above the objective of the present study was to evaluate the variation in the flow rate caused by the use of two subsurface emitters buried at a depth of 5 cm in 4 different soil types 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil water movement and soil physics characterization the four soil types used were collected from different locations in the southern region of the state of minas gerais brazil in efforts to encompass the different types of soil

min after the irrigation began even in pressure compensating emitters the backpressure effect can affect the flow rate at beginning of operation because these emitters reach full compensation after 5 10 min of operation thus during this period the dripper be vulnerable to flow rate variation gil et al 2010 reported that the back pressure increased suddenly at the start of irrigation and peaked before 3 min of testing after which it decreased rapidly until it stabilized which occurred between 3 and 6 min the backpressure stabilization in all replications evaluated by the author occurred between 0 005 and 0 006 mpa this behavior was also reported by rodríguez sinobas et al 2009 who when evaluating lateral lines in loam soil observed that the flow rate declined rapidly and became constant for both pressure compensating and non pressure compensating emitters under the assumption that back pressure reduces the flow rate of subsurface emitters the reduction in the flow rate observed in the present study may have been due to this effect as the flow had already decreased after 6 min of testing as shown in table 6 and presented as percentages in fig 6 pc emitter 2 3 l h 1 had the highest variation in flow rate except for the sandy loam soil but with significant difference just for the cal soil which presents 5 12 of the flow reduction when in subsurface installation this result contrasts that of gil et al 2008 who reported no differences between the surface and subsurface flow rates of pressure compensating emitters with rates of 2 and 4 l h 1 when buried in clay and sandy soil types as the back pressure was lower than the lower limit of the compensation range of the emitter gil et al 2011 reported less than 1 differences in the flow rate of pressure compensating emitters with a rate of 2 l h 1 buried in sandy soils which was considered within the experimental error range additionally the same author also reported backpressure values that were much lower than the lower limit of the pressure compensation range in addition rodríguez sinobas et al 2009 found significant differences with respect to lateral lines that were buried in loam soils and that contained pressure compensating emitters with a rate of 3 5 l h 1 the authors reported that the elastomer of the regulated emitter did not reach total compensation within the total irrigation time 30 min which caused the flow rate of the emitter to decrease rapidly at the beginning of irrigation though the rate became constant over time thebaldi et al 2016 also reported a significant reduction in the flow rate of both pressure compensating and non pressure compensating emitters under the action of backpressure operating underwater with respect to the npc emitter considering just the flow rate reduction that resulted in significant differences the greatest reduction in flow rate was observed for the sal soil 3 49 the lowest the cla soil 2 79 it was not possible to identify a clear effect of saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils on flow variations as it was expected that soils with lower conductivity values would result in higher flow variations however only a small area around the emitter reached the ksat where the water movement is facilitated but in most of the wetted area soil water content is below saturation thus the water movement is limited by non saturated hydraulic conductivity k θ therefore even with a considerable potential gradient the flow is limited by the soil and may be causing backpressure increase evaluating the results seems the flow rate reduction may be affected by both soil characteristics and emitter flow rate for the pc emitter with low flow rate 2 3 l h 1 the variation was detected just in one soil cal and for the npc emitter that has high flow rate 4 l h 1 the variation was significantly different in the sandy loam sal and clay cla soils the variability for the clay soil even with the highest saturated hydraulic conductivity can be explained by the peculiarities of the studied soil which is an oxisoil and had its particular features explained earlier these characteristics of this type of soil may have contributed in some way to the flow variation besides the variability of soil properties among repetitions in fig 2 it is possible to better observe the behavior described above when drier the clay soil has low values of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity but from 0 26 cm³ cm 3 of water content these values already become larger than clay loam and silty loam soils and eventually become larger than sandy loam soil with the data of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 2 it is possible to observe the water movement as a function of soil moisture sandy soils have a lower total pore volume in general but are larger so unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is expected to be low and had high saturated conductivity as shown in fig 2 moreover as the soil in question has low residual moisture fig 1 that is when the soil is dry the unsaturated conductivity values become low in this moisture level as low as the other soils with this in the initial moments of the test probably the values of the back pressure were elevated especially for the npc emitter that has a higher flow rate these results were opposite those expected because in previous studies such as those of gil et al 2011 and gil et al 2008 soils with a sandy texture had little effect on the flow rate because of high hydraulic conductivity however the results of the present study may have occurred because of the relatively high mean bulk density of the sal soil 1 57 g cm 3 during tests according to fan and li 2018 for a given pressure and soil moisture an increase in bulk density can reduce the flow rate of a subsurface drip line with increasing density soils become less permeable and thus at a subsurface emission point the water around the emitter becomes stagnant the authors in the same study also reported that a subsurface emitter in a sandy soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density and an 18 initial water content had a lower flow rate than did subsurface emitters in other soils with a higher clay content during the experiment in all replications and for both emitters tested a small amount of water rapidly appeared on the surface of the sil soil according to ben gal and lazarovitch 2003 and rodríguez sinobas et al 2009 when positive pressure is present around a buried emitter preferential water paths that ascend to the soil surface can be created thus with the shallow installation depth the back pressure was probably practically null explaining why the subsurface flow rate did not differ from the surface flow rate for either emitter in addition the soil has no structure as cohesive as will probably have in field conditions due to the uniformization done by the soil preparation procedure so it is probably to have absence of backpressure for this soil in this situation to evaluate the advancement of the soil wetting front thru time a series of moisture sensors were used even the sensors were not calibrated for each specific soil which would reduce the precision the behavior of the water movement is clearly different among the soils fig 7 shows the advancement of the soil wetting front for the npc emitter for this emitter as expected the moisture values in the sal soil increased rapidly because of the distribution of water inside the soil additionally compared with that in the other soil types the wetting front in the sal soil reached greater distances in both the horizontal and vertical directions more moisture was present around the emitter in the cla soil than in the other soil types with the formation of a larger wet bulb in the horizontal direction exceeding 10 cm after 36 min of testing at the end of the test the bulb reached a depth of 10 cm in the vertical direction relative to the emitter in the cal soil the bulb also grew primarily in the horizontal direction whereas in the vertical direction the depth was similar to that in the cla soil because water was present on the sil soil surface with the formation of a preferred path the wetting front did not have the characteristic shape of a wet bulb and the water was concentrated within the soil surface layers above the emitter a possible explanation for the development of the wetting on the front from left to right is that with the accumulation of water on the surface the water was directed to the sides of the container causing different water infiltration and redistribution behaviors among the replications the advancement of soil wetting in the four soil types for the pc emitter can be seen in fig 8 the behavior was similar to that of the npc emitter however the size of the wetting front was smaller from the pc emitter than from the npc emitter because of the lower flow rate of the former the water content values in the sil were much lower than those in the other soil types indicating an accumulation of water on the soil surface which was observed during the experiment independent of the soil or the flow rate evaluated the vertical wetting front reached the soil surface by the end of the 1 h of operation for all replications evaluated probably by the shallow installation depth exposure of the wet bulb to the soil surface may increase evaporative losses which can reduce the efficiency of the system 4 conclusions a reduction in the mean flow rate of the emitters buried at a shallow depth 5 cm occurred differently for some soils and emitters evaluated when that happened was at the beginning of the operation before the first evaluation that was 6 min after start running the system compared with the flow rate at the surface for the pc emitter the flow rate reduction was just significant in the clay loam soil with a reduction of 5 1 for the npc emitter the reduction was in the sandy loam and the clay soil with a reduction of 3 5 and 2 8 respectively thus even at shallow depths great care is required in subsurface drip irrigation projects once the evaluation was done at the soil with a natural structure destroyed by the uniformization process the flow reduction could be underestimated reaching higher values in the field condition the sil soil displayed the formation of preferential paths leading to the appearance of a trickle of water at the soil surface for all emitters this appearance can lead to surface runoff causing decreases in efficiency of subsurface drip irrigation systems additionally systems installed at shallow depths may experience increased evaporation due to the wet bulb on the surface consequently leading to reduced efficiency as the npc s flow rate is higher than pc emitter the wet bulb dimensions were bigger for npc emitter in all soils in general the dimensions for the sal soil were the biggest and for the cla soil was the smallest after one hour running the system at the end of the evaluation time the water content in the cla soil was higher near to the discharge point when compared with the sal and the cal soil had an intermediate behavior as explained above there isn t the formation of a wet bulb for the sil soil with the drip at shallow installation depth was observed the wet front clearly reaching the surface quickly which can promote evaporation losses reducing this advantage normally attribute

10443,partial root zone drying irrigation prdi can influence carbon c nitrogen n and p phosphorus allocations in annual crop plants this study consisted of a two factorial split plot field experiment conducted on huanghua farmland in western china and it was focused on investigating the effects of prdi on the biomass water productivity and c n and p allocations in a perennial plant alfalfa from 2016 2017 the two factors were the irrigation mode prdi and conventional furrow irrigation cfi and irrigation volume 70 i1 85 i2 100 i3 and 115 i4 of the alfalfa water requirement in which the irrigation mode was the primary plot and the irrigation volume was the subplot this study showed that prdi decreased the alfalfa leaf biomass and increased the alfalfa root stem biomass and water productivity but that it had no effect on the alfalfa shoot biomass at the end of the vegetative growth period in 2016 and 2017 prdi increased the c and p concentrations in the roots and the n concentration in the roots stems and leaves and it led more c and p to be allocated to the roots and more n to be allocated to the leaves in 2016 and 2017 these results implied that c n and p allocation changes in different organs induced by prdi may be one of the possible ways for alfalfa plants to adapt to the changing environmental conditions caused by prdi keywords irrigation mode irrigation volume vegetative organ soil water content 1 introduction carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p are three vital elements for plants and they are believed by many to regulate plant growth and development zhang et al 2018b because c provides the structural basis and constitutes 50 of the dry mass of plants tang et al 2018 n is part of all amino acids and p is an essential part of nucleic acids and membrane lipids somaweera et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a at present the c n and p allocations in the roots stems and leaves of plants are often considered an important mechanism for plants to adapt to a specific environment akmal et al 2010 aaltonen et al 2017 and they have been found to vary with the c n and p concentrations in the roots stems and leaves and the biomass of those organs ye et al 2014 sun et al 2015 the c n and p concentrations in an organ and the biomass of that organ are often influenced by agricultural management choices such as tillage laufer and koch 2016 fertilization akmal et al 2010 and irrigation he et al 2017 liu et al 2018a partial root zone drying irrigation prdi a water saving irrigation technique with easy extension and low cost is a spatial and temporal alternative to other irrigation types used to produce wet dry cycles in the root systems of plants kang et al 1997 topcu et al 2007 sarker et al 2019 this irrigation pattern has been successfully applied to plant production in arid and semiarid regions mingo et al 2004 shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2017 because it can improve water productivity li et al 2007 consoli et al 2017 with minor or no yield loss xiao et al 2015 mossad et al 2017 generally prdi improves water productivity in two ways first prdi can lead to the closure of the leaf stomata and reduce luxury transpiration by encouraging the abscisic acid aba induced by dry soil conditions to transform from the roots to the leaves second prdi can maintain relatively higher photosynthesis rates and improve the root absorption simultaneously kang et al 1997 mingo et al 2004 sun et al 2013 current studies have addressed the c n and p allocations in the roots stems and leaves of plants to explain how they adapt to the changing environmental conditions induced by prdi mingo et al 2004 wang et al 2009 ye et al 2014 somaweera et al 2015 mossad et al 2017 prdi has been found to encourage more c and n to be allocated to the roots and less c and n to be allocated to the stems and leaves of rice ye et al 2014 more n and p to be allocated to the stems and leaves and less n and p to rice panicle somaweera et al 2015 and more p to be allocated to potato roots sun et al 2015 however these studies focused on the effects of prdi on the c n and p allocations in annual crops in which seeds or tubers are often harvested in agriculture some crops are annual whereas others are perennial in addition the harvest targets of some crops are reproductive organs such as seeds and fruits and underground vegetative organs such as tubers and roots whereas the harvest targets of other crops are aboveground vegetative organs stems and leaves however little attention has been given to the effect of prdi on the c n and p allocations in perennial crops in which the aboveground vegetative organs are harvested alfalfa which has high quality forage and a high n fixing ability fan et al 2016 is a perennial legume in which the aboveground vegetative organs leaves and stems are generally harvested to feed livestock directly he et al 2017 fan et al 2016 this crop is widely planted throughout the arid and semiarid regions of europe cavero et al 2017 the americas del pozo et al 2017 and china zhang et al 2019 meuriot et al 2004 have stated that understanding the c n and p allocation in alfalfa plants is essential for implementing efficient water management to ensure sustainable alfalfa production in arid and semiarid regions some studies have verified that prdi has been found to be applicable to alfalfa production because it can increase water use efficiency without reducing yields xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 2019 and others have shown that clipping and shading management encourage more c to be allocated to the roots of alfalfa plants schmitt et al 2013 and n application allocates more n to alfalfa shoots meuriot et al 2004 therefore more studies are needed to simultaneously examine whether prdi influences c n and p allocations to the roots stems and leaves and biomass of alfalfa plants this study investigates the effect of prdi on the biomass water productivity and c n and p allocations in the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa in this study it was hypothesized that 1 prdi has no effect on the stem and leaf biomass and increases water productivity 2 prdi increases the c concentrations in the roots and the n and p concentrations in the leaves and 3 prdi encourages more c to be allocated to the roots and more n and p to be allocated to the leaves 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was located at the huanghua farmland station 97 11 e 40 23 n 1395 m altitude in gansu province west china this station is located in a typical continental arid region with annual sunshine of 3000 h a mean annual temperature of 9 3 a maximum temperature of 40 4 in july a minimum temperature of 16 in january and annual mean precipitation of 59 5 mm the monthly precipitation differed but the monthly temperature did not between 2016 and 2017 fig 1 based on the chinese soil classification system gong 2001 the soil type is medium loam in which the ph value bulk density average field capacity and permanent wilting coefficient data for the 2 m soil profile are approximately 8 1 1 42 g cm 3 25 and 8 1 respectively and the organic matter and available n p and k contents of the soil are 20 g kg 1 91 mg kg 1 18 46 mg kg 1 and 151 52 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design and crop management the field experiment was performed from 2015 2017 on 5 april 2015 a furrow ridge system qi et al 2017 was used to establish the experimental alfalfa pasture with a 22 5 kg ha 1 seeding density and a 3 cm depth the alfalfa cultivar was 8920 fm from canada the irrigation treatments were performed from 2016 to 2017 because the two year alfalfa pasture had a relatively steady yield guo et al 2005 this experiment involved two factors irrigation mode and irrigation volume in a split plot design in which the irrigation mode was considered as the primary plot and the irrigation volume was considered as a subplot in northern china cropland in the same environment has been divided into individual parcels and each parcel is managed by an individual household through a long term contract since the 1980s qu et al 1995 the size of each parcel ranges from 0 1 to 0 4 ha in the study areas thus this study used a common parcel approximate 0 35 ha managed by an individual household to establish an experimental field area measuring 89 m 39 m the experimental field was divided into three equal blocks for 3 replications each block was 89 m 13 m consisting of 8 subplots each subplot was set at 10 m 11 m and consisted of 11 rows in which each row was 0 5 m wide with 10 0 m long ridges fig 2 the 0 5 m ridge width between furrows was determined in previous studies sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 barzegari et al 2017 and a pre experiment test which ensured that prdi truly occurred between subplots a 1 m buffering belt was designed to eliminate the effect of lateral soil water movement an irrigation furrow with a top width of 0 3 m a bottom width of 0 25 m and a depth of 0 3 m was developed between the ridges and each furrow was labeled with odd and paired even numbers management measurements for the experimental field area including pests and diseases were performed in accordance with the local farmers who live in this region every year during the experimental period each subplot received 25 95 kg ha 1 n 83 55 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 218 55 kg ha 1 k2o as urea n 46 calcium superphosphate p2o5 15 5 and potassium sulfate k2o 51 respectively at the regrowth stage when the shoots emerged from the crown and these fertilizers were evenly broadcast into all the furrows of each subplot 2 3 irrigation treatments the irrigation modes im consisted of prdi and conventional furrow irrigation cfi in this study prdi was conducted through alternate furrow irrigation in the field kang et al 1997 barzegari et al 2017 in prdi odd furrows were irrigated the first time and paired furrows were irrigated the next time which ensured that only one side of the plant roots received water and that the other side was left dry during that irrigation event in cfi each furrow was irrigated each time the irrigation volumes were set up according to the alfalfa water requirement the alfalfa water requirement was estimated by using the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations penman monteith formula allen et al 1998 of et kc et0 the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was computed based on the 20 year 1994 2014 statistical data from the local meteorological station the crop coefﬁcient kc was 0 88 based on the average value during the entire growth period in this region xiao et al 2015 the calculation result indicates that the et was 1117 mm which was total et of the entire growing season and the alfalfa et for the experimental period from march regrowth after winter to june early flowering stage was 357 mm the four irrigation volumes were 70 of et i1 85 of et i2 100 of et i3 and 115 of et i4 therefore the experiment resulted in 8 treatments i e prdi i1 prdi i2 prdi i3 prdi i4 cfi i1 cfi i2 cfi i3 and cfi i4 and each treatment had three replications there were 24 total subplots here the prdi subplots received 50 of the irrigation water used for the cfi and the actual irrigation water volumes were 250 304 357 and 411 mm for the i1 i2 i3 and i4 treatments under cfi respectively while the respective values for prdi were 125 mm 152 mm 179 mm and 206 mm the irrigation volume was not adjusted according to the rainfall since rainfall was scarce during the experimental period the irrigation volumes were the same for each treatment from 2016 to 2017 since the alfalfa water requirement was calculated using 20 years of weather data water was applied briefly with a controlled irrigation system and the irrigation water was delivered to each furrow from the canal with an electrical pump the water coming from the canal was passed through a flow meter to control the irrigation water before it entered a flexible hose diameter 120 mm that was laid in each subplot the actual irrigation date was determined by the local farmer s long term irrigation experience and the critical water requirement stage of alfalfa xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the critical water requirement stage of alfalfa was approximately 20 d at regrowth after the winter and at the branch stage the actual irrigation date should be delayed 3 d if it rains table s1 which could ensure prdi really occurred again 2 4 plant sampling and measurements at the end of the vegetative growth period of the alfalfa baslam et al 2012 in 2016 and 2017 three sampling quadrants 0 5 m by 0 5 m were placed randomly in each subplot to collect the aboveground parts of the alfalfa plants and then the roots of that subplot were collected using a 0 5 by 0 5 by 1 0 m soil column created with a shovel all the visible root systems were collected from the corresponding soil column and were then carefully washed free of soil the aboveground parts of the alfalfa plants were further divided by hand into leaves including floral components and stems lamb et al 2007 the roots stems and leaves were immediately oven dried at 105 c for 1 h and then maintained at 70 c until they reached a constant mass to calculate the dried biomass the dry root stem and leaf samples were weighed and then ground into powder with a mixer mill grinder these sample powders were passed through a 2 mm mesh screen to prepare for measuring the c n and p concentrations the c n and p concentrations were measured by dumas dry combustion method in a flash ii ea112 elemental analyzer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa kjeldahl procedure foss kjeltec 8400 foss dk and mo sb colorimetry uv 2102c unico shanghai china bao 2000 respectively 2 4 1 water productivity water productivity is dependent on the temporal and spatial scales of concern sarker et al 2019 and is calculated with many different formulas in accordance with the given objectives wang et al 2010a 2017 carracelas et al 2019 wakchaure et al 2020 in this study water productivity was calculated with the following equation 1 w p s h o o t b i o m a s s i p where wp was water productivity kg 1 ha 1 mm 1 the shoot biomass was the sum of the leaf and stem biomass kg ha 1 and i and p were irrigation volumes and precipitation mm respectively 2 4 2 c n and p accumulation and allocation the c n and p accumulations in different alfalfa organs were calculated by multiplying the c n and p concentrations in one organ by the biomass of the corresponding organ for example the c accumulation in the roots was calculated according to the following equation 2 car ccr rdm where car is the c accumulation in the roots kg ha 1 ccr is the c concentration in the roots mg g 1 and rdm is the root dry matter kg ha 1 a previous study employed the shoot to root ratio to estimate the n allocation in tomato plants topcu et al 2007 therefore this study also used the shoot to root ratio to estimate the c n and p allocations between the shoot and root which were calculated as follows 3 cs cr cas cal cr 4 ns nr nas nal nr 5 ps pr pas pal pr where cs ns and ps are the c n and p accumulation respectively in the shoots kg ha 1 which were calculated by finding the c n and p accumulation in the leaves plus the c n and p accumulation in the stems the cr nr and pr are the c n and p accumulation respectively in the roots kg ha 1 the cas nas and pas are the c n and p accumulation respectively in the stems kg ha 1 and the cal nal and pal are the c n and p accumulation respectively in the leaves kg ha 1 the c n and p allocations in the shoots were further estimated by finding the ratio of c accumulation in leaves to stems cl cs the ratio of n accumulation in leaves to stems nl ns and the ratio of p accumulation in leaves to stems pl ps 2 5 soil water content the gravimetric soil water content of the 0 2 m soil depth range was measured at 20 cm intervals by using soil cores with a 4 cm diameter and a 20 cm height six soil cores were taken randomly at both ridges and furrows in each subplot the collected soil samples were weighed immediately dried at 105 c for 24 h and then weighed again to calculate the gravimetric soil water content the gravimetric soil water content was measured at 7 day intervals after the first irrigation 2 6 statistical analysis the 2016 and 2017 data were analyzed separately using the following analysis procedure the variables root stem leaf and shoot biomass water productivity and c n and p concentrations accumulations and allocation in the roots stems and leaves were tested for normality and homogeneity and logarithmic transformations were performed when necessary two way analyses of variance anova with the general linear model univariate procedure were used to test the effects of the irrigation mode and irrigation volume as well as their interaction on the root stem leaf and shoot biomass water productivity and c n and p concentrations accumulations and allocation in which the irrigation mode and irrigation volume were considered fixed factors and the root stem leaf and shoot biomass water productivity and c n and p concentrations accumulations and allocations were considered separate dependent variables the least significant difference lsd test was used to compare the mean values of the different treatments at a significance level of p 0 05 if the interaction was significant the building multivariate quadratic polynomial regression model was used to establish the equation on the effect of the interaction of the irrigation mode and irrigation volume in which the irrigation modes were assigned numerical values in the abovementioned statistical analyses a multivariate quadratic polynomial regression model was created with matlab 2014 and others analyses were performed using the spss 17 0 software package from spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 soil water content regardless of the irrigation modes the soil water content under four irrigation volumes was between field capacity and permanent wilting point from 2016 2017 the soil water content was higher under cfi conditions than under prdi conditions and it was the highest under i4 irrigation conditions in both 2016 and 2017 fig 3 as time passed during the experimental period the soil water content showed similar fluctuating variations under two irrigation modes and four irrigation volumes between 2016 and 2017 these fluctuation variations were more distinct at the 0 100 cm soil depth than at the 100 200 cm soil depth under prdi compared to cfi fig s1 at each soil depth layer the soil water content under prdi and cfi increased as the irrigation volume increased in 2016 and 2017 during both years the gravimetric soil water content under each treatment decreased with the increasing soil depth fig s2 3 2 effect of prdi on alfalfa biomass and water productivity in both 2016 and 2017 the irrigation mode significantly affected the root stem and leaf biomass and water productivity but it did not affect the shoot biomass table 1 the irrigation volume affected the leaf root and shoot biomass and did not affect the stem biomass and water productivity interactions between the irrigation modes and irrigation volumes did not affect the leaf stem shoot and root biomass or the water productivity regardless of the irrigation volumes prdi resulted in greater stem and root biomass and water productivity while it lowered the leaf biomass p 0 05 during the two years the water productivity under prdi was 12 00 and 11 87 higher than under cfi in 2016 and 2017 respectively irrespective of the irrigation modes the leaf shoot and root biomass first increased and then decreased as the irrigation volume increased peaking under i3 irrigation conditions 3 3 effect of prdi on the c n and p concentrations in the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa with the exception of the p concentration in the stems the responses of the c n and p concentrations in the roots and leaves to the irrigation mode and irrigation volume were similar in 2016 and 2017 the irrigation mode had significant impacts on the c and p concentrations in the roots and the n concentrations in the roots stems and leaves p 0 05 whereas the irrigation mode had no significant impacts on the c and p concentrations in the stems and leaves figs 4 5 and 6 the irrigation volume had significant impacts on the c n and p concentrations in the roots stems and leaves the interactions of irrigation modes and irrigation volumes were only significant concerning n concentrations in the roots in 2016 and 2017 during the two year study prdi produced a higher c concentration in the roots fig 4 n concentration in the roots stems fig 5 and leaves and p concentration in the roots fig 6 the c concentration in the roots and stems increased from the i1 irrigation conditions to the i3 irrigation conditions and decreased from the i3 irrigation conditions to the i4 irrigation conditions while the c concentration in the leaves increased from the i1 irrigation conditions to the i3 irrigation conditions and was not different between the i3 and i4 irrigation conditions the p concentration in the roots increased from the i1 to i3 irrigation conditions and showed no difference when the irrigation volume was above that of the i3 irrigation conditions while the n and p concentrations in the leaves first increased and then decreased peaking under i3 irrigation conditions the p concentration in the stems in 2016 first increased from i1 to i2 irrigation conditions then remained stable from i2 to i3 irrigation conditions and then decreased from i3 to i4 irrigation conditions whereas the p concentration in stems in 2017 first remained stable from i1 to i2 irrigation conditions increased from i2 to i3 irrigation conditions and then decreased from i3 to i4 irrigation conditions during both years prdi resulted in higher n concentrations in the roots under four irrigation volumes under the prdi mode the n concentration in the roots first increased from the i1 to i2 irrigation conditions and then remained stable from the i2 to i4 irrigation conditions under the cfi mode the n concentration in the roots first increased from the i1 to i3 irrigation conditions and then decreased from the i3 to i4 irrigation conditions figs 5 7 among all of the treatments the highest n concentration in the roots was observed in prdi i3 treatment and the quadratic polynomial regression showed that there was a strong relationship among the n concentrations in the roots y c and the irrigation mode x 1 and irrigation volume x 2 and the regression models were y c 9 88 2 28 x 1 40 13 x 2 4 14 x 1 x 2 17 74 x 2 2 r2 0 56 f 6 06 p 0

alfalfa plant in 2016 and 2017 the irrigation mode was only found to significantly affect the p accumulation in the roots and irrigation volume was found to significantly affect the c n p accumulations in the roots and leaves p 0 05 fig s3 s4 and s5 while irrigation volume had no significant effect on the c n and p accumulation in the stems the interaction of the irrigation modes and irrigation volumes did not impact the c n and p accumulations in the roots stems and leaves prdi only increased p accumulation in the roots the c accumulation in the roots and the c n and p accumulations in the leaves first increased from the i1 to i3 irrigation conditions and then decreased from the i3 to i4 irrigation conditions while the n and p accumulations in the roots first increased and then remained stable respectively 3 5 effect of prdi on c n and p allocations in alfalfa in both 2016 and 2017 the cs cr were markedly influenced by the irrigation mode irrigation volume and their interactions p 0 05 whereas the ns nr and ps pr were only markedly influenced by the irrigation mode p 0 05 table 2 prdi decreased the cs cr at each irrigation volume during the two year study as the irrigation volume increased the cs cr under the two irrigation modes first increased and then decreased table 2 fig 8 and they were the highest in the cfi i2 treatment the results of building a multivariate quadratic polynomial regression showed that the relationship among the cs cr y c irrigation mode x 1 and irrigation volume x 2 was described as y c 9 40 0 61 x 1 21 90 x 2 0 01

2 and cs cr first increased and then decreased as the irrigation volume increased in 2016 and 2017 the cl cs were significantly affected by the irrigation mode and irrigation volume and the nl ns were only notably influenced by the irrigation mode whereas the p allocations in the leaves and stems were not affected by the irrigation modes irrigation volume and their interaction p 0 05 table 2 in contrast to cfi prdi decreased the cl cs and increased the nl ns the cl cs first increased and then decreased as the irrigation volume increased 4 discussion prdi changes the soil biophysiochemical conditions where plants grow and further influences plant performance sun et al 2013 zare abyaneh et al 2017 this study shows that prdi increases the root and stem biomass and decreases the leaf biomass and this finding is not consistent with the first hypothesis prdi has no effect on the shoot biomass of alfalfa plants confirming the results reported by xiao et al 2015 and zhang et al 2019 these results further verify that there is no shoot biomass response in alfalfa plants to prdi caused by the trade offs of an increase in stem biomass and a decrease in leaf biomass but do not indicate a lack of response in the stem and leaf biomass to prdi prdi produces higher root biomass because it increases the lateral root numbers liu et al 2017b and root length density qi et al 2017 and similar results are also found in annual crops mingo et al 2004 somaweera et al 2015 liu et al 2017b and other perennial crops in which fruits degaris et al 2016 and roots zare abyaneh et al 2017 are harvested implying that the effect of prdi on the root biomass is consistent among plants that are annuals and perennials or in which different organs are harvested prdi increases the stem biomass of alfalfa plants which supports the idea that prdi increases the branch numbers per plant to some extent xiao et al 2015 while this trend differs from annual crops wang et al 2009 sun et al 2015 wang et al 2015 hou et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 these annual crops are generally sampled at their full maturity stage during the reproductive period of the abovementioned annual crops plants generally translocate most of their photosynthate to seeds tubers and fruits rather than stems alfalfa plants are sampled at the vegetative stage when plants allocate most of their photosynthate to the stem to encourage the plants to stand upright sheaffer et al 2000 indicating that the harvest or sample times can result in different stem biomass responses to prdi prdi decreased leaf biomass which is in agreement with previous results showing that prdi decreases the number of leaves of alfalfa plants xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 and as well as the leaf biomass of annual crops liu et al 2018b zheng et al 2018 and perennial crops in which the roots zare abyaneh et al 2017 and fruits degaris et al 2016 are harvested however some studies argue that prdi has no effect on the leaf biomass of annual crops jovanovic et al 2010 hou et al 2017 and perennial crops in which roots are harvested barzegari et al 2017 suggesting that the response of leaf biomass to prdi varies with the plant species these results demonstrate that the tradeoff in the different responses of the stem and leaf biomass to prdi results in a stable shoot biomass for alfalfa plants under prdi and a vigorous root system caused by prdi xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 is an important way for alfalfa plants to adapt to the changing environmental conditions under prdi high alfalfa water productivity caused by prdi is ascribed to low irrigation volume and soil evaporation kang et al 1997 and less deep percolation jovanovic et al 2010 similar to potatoes sarker et al 2019 and maize wang et al 2017 the root stem and leaf biomass are higher at 100 et than other et levels because low irrigation volumes do not meet the requirement of alfalfa plants for water whereas excessive irrigation water under i4 irrigation conditions often leads to a lack of o2 in the root zone which causes the development of high ethanol and other toxic substances in the roots cavero et al 2017 inhibiting alfalfa plant growth and wasting water resources these results indicate that there is an appropriate irrigation volume for alfalfa production in a given region this study also shows that prdi increases the c and p concentrations in the roots the n concentrations in the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa plants which is not in accordance with the second hypothesis prdi develops drought stress in alfalfa plants to some extent which provokes the c translocation from the leaf as the source to the root as the sink xu et al 2007 resulting in higher c concentrations in the roots of alfalfa plants higher n concentrations in the roots stems and leaves are also observed in annual crops shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2010a which can be caused in the following three ways first prdi increases the accumulation of soluble proteins in the plants raza et al 2017 second prdi may facilitate the transport of nitrate from bulk soil to the root surface which is beneficial for improving n uptake by the plant shahnazari et al 2008 and third prdi increases the available n supply for plants because it accelerates the organic n mineralization process wang et al 2010b sun et al 2013 the higher n concentration in alfalfa plants induced by prdi can improve the ability of alfalfa plants to adapt to environmental conditions by controlling the plant water status sun et al 2013 maintaining a greater photosynthesis rate and higher water use efficiency karandish and shahnazari 2016 prdi enhances the p uptake by plant roots in a horizontal direction or along the vertical soil profile liu et al 2018a because it stimulates root growth qi et al 2017 and transports more p from soils to roots liu et al 2017a resulting in higher p concentrations in alfalfa roots which is similar to what happens in annual crops somaweera et al 2015 the c n and p concentrations in the roots stems and leaves under the i1 and i2 conditions were lower than those under i3 and i4 which may be ascribed to drought stress in which drought stress influences c metabolism saud et al 2017 and reduces n and p mineralization wang et al 2010b liu et al 2018a resulting in low c n and p concentrations in the roots stems and leaves under i1 and i2 in addition the p concentrations in the stems showed a different change as the irrigation volumes increased from i1 to i3 irrigation conditions between 2016 and 2017 which can be explained by three factors first the soil in the study area is phosphorus deficient and the available p in the soil was lower in 2017 than in 2016 because alfalfa can deplete some p fan et al 2016 second the available p transportation from roots to shoots is slow under i2 irrigation conditions because alfalfa plants suffer from water stress dimkpa et al 2020 and third the i2 irrigation conditions could have encouraged the alfalfa to grow more root systems in 2017 than in 2016 which can consume more available p to support n fixation by alfalfa roots he et al 2017 these three factors encourage alfalfa plants to transport less p under i2 from roots to shoots than under i3 irrigation conditions in addition the p in shoots under i2 irrigation conditions has yet to be allocated to the leaves rosecrance et al 1996 which decreased the p in the stems under i2 irrigation conditions from 2016 to 2017 low p concentrations in stems under i2 in 2017 made no significant difference in the p concentration in stems between the i1 and i2 irrigation conditions this study further shows that prdi encourages more c and p to be allocated to the roots and more n to be allocated to the shoots especially in alfalfa leaves because of the higher ns nr and nl ns and lower cs cr ps pr and cl cs which does not support the third hypothesis the higher c and p allocations in roots under prdi is also observed in annual crops ye et al 2014 sun et al 2015 implying that prdi can lead to more c and p allocation to the roots of annual and perennial plants however prdi can allocate more n to alfalfa leaves under field conditions which is similar to annual tomatoes wang et al 2010b and rice somaweera et al 2015 under pot experimental condition and is not similar to rice under field conditions ye et al 2014 demonstrating that the effect of prdi on n allocation varies with the crop types or experimental conditions in this case higher c and p allocations in roots under prdi are primarily ascribed to higher root biomass because the higher number of roots induced by prdi is a major mechanism through which plants adapt positively to a limiting resource supply ye et al 2014 liu et al 2018a more c allocation in roots under prdi conditions is good for alfalfa root growth the large root system in alfalfa under prdi is beneficial for taking up soil water and soil released n and p xu et al 2007 oberhuber et al 2017 ensuring rhizosphere respiration and n fixation schmitt et al 2012 which contributes to the development of aboveground organs and the regrowth of alfalfa plants after clipping schmitt et al 2012 and results in a relatively stable alfalfa forage yield higher p allocation in roots under prdi has been found to indirectly increase n rich extracellular phosphatase zhang et al 2018a higher n allocation in leaves under prdi can be due to two factors first prdi increases the n concentration in leaves and second the leaf is often considered the primary organ of plant n assimilation at the vegetative growth stage of plants zhang et al 2018a more n allocation in leaves under prdi contributes to increased photosynthesis ability hu et al 2018 benefiting the synthesis of amino acids schmitt et al 2012 which can improve the alfalfa feed quality for livestock noland et al 2017 lamb et al 2007 the low irrigation volume encourages more c to be allocated to alfalfa roots because increasing drought stress encourages the roots to acquire more of the new c in the roots xu and zhou 2005 and similar results were also found in scots pine seedlings aaltonen et al 2017 and norway spruce oberhuber et al 2017 the highest n allocation in leaves and p allocation in roots were found under i2 irrigation conditions because moderate drought stress increases the n concentrations in leaves aaltonen et al 2017 and reduces p translocation somaweera et al 2015 these results suggest that alfalfa plants adopt different strategies to allocate c n and p to roots stems and leaves to optimize their growth and adapt well to the changed environment caused by prdi notably prdi can decrease the leaf biomass and increase the stem biomass implying that prdi is not beneficial to the alfalfa feed quality for livestock zhang et al 2016 whereas prdi can increase the n concentration in the shoots suggesting that prdi can indirectly improve the alfalfa feed quality for livestock he et al 2017 although the responses in the alfalfa feed quality to prdi is a complicated issue prdi has higher economic benefits than cfi since it maintains relatively stable yields and decreases the irrigation volume these findings imply that prdi can be applied to the alfalfa production of individual households in addition the furrow length under prdi may have impacts on the biomass c n and p allocations to different alfalfa organs in this case the furrow length under prdi is determined by the common cropland area of an individual household in the study regions therefore the findings of this study can provide useful information towards water saving irrigation in alfalfa production for most individual households in northern china however the cropland area is different among different regions and countries as a consequence the appropriate furrow length under prdi must be redetermined for alfalfa production 5 conclusions this study has investigated the effects of prdi on c n and p allocations to the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa one of the perennial crops for which the aboveground biomass is harvested the results of this study show that prdi increases the root and stem biomass and water productivity and decreases the leaf biomass and the trade offs of an increase in stem biomass and a decrease in leaf biomass result in a relatively stable shoot biomass prdi increases the c and p concentrations in the roots and the n concentrations in the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa and it encourages more c and p to be allocated to the roots and n to the leaves indicating that changes in the c n and p allocations in the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa are beneficial in enhancing the ability of alfalfa plants to adapt to the changed environmental conditions induced by prdi the findings of this study suggest that changes in c n and p allocations caused by prdi are one way to optimize plant growth for perennial crops for which the aboveground biomass is harvested declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript and the manuscript is approved by all authors for

10443,partial root zone drying irrigation prdi can influence carbon c nitrogen n and p phosphorus allocations in annual crop plants this study consisted of a two factorial split plot field experiment conducted on huanghua farmland in western china and it was focused on investigating the effects of prdi on the biomass water productivity and c n and p allocations in a perennial plant alfalfa from 2016 2017 the two factors were the irrigation mode prdi and conventional furrow irrigation cfi and irrigation volume 70 i1 85 i2 100 i3 and 115 i4 of the alfalfa water requirement in which the irrigation mode was the primary plot and the irrigation volume was the subplot this study showed that prdi decreased the alfalfa leaf biomass and increased the alfalfa root stem biomass and water productivity but that it had no effect on the alfalfa shoot biomass at the end of the vegetative growth period in 2016 and 2017 prdi increased the c and p concentrations in the roots and the n concentration in the roots stems and leaves and it led more c and p to be allocated to the roots and more n to be allocated to the leaves in 2016 and 2017 these results implied that c n and p allocation changes in different organs induced by prdi may be one of the possible ways for alfalfa plants to adapt to the changing environmental conditions caused by prdi keywords irrigation mode irrigation volume vegetative organ soil water content 1 introduction carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p are three vital elements for plants and they are believed by many to regulate plant growth and development zhang et al 2018b because c provides the structural basis and constitutes 50 of the dry mass of plants tang et al 2018 n is part of all amino acids and p is an essential part of nucleic acids and membrane lipids somaweera et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a at present the c n and p allocations in the roots stems and leaves of plants are often considered an important mechanism for plants to adapt to a specific environment akmal et al 2010 aaltonen et al 2017 and they have been found to vary with the c n and p concentrations in the roots stems and leaves and the biomass of those organs ye et al 2014 sun et al 2015 the c n and p concentrations in an organ and the biomass of that organ are often influenced by agricultural management choices such as tillage laufer and koch 2016 fertilization akmal et al 2010 and irrigation he et al 2017 liu et al 2018a partial root zone drying irrigation prdi a water saving irrigation technique with easy extension and low cost is a spatial and temporal alternative to other irrigation types used to produce wet dry cycles in the root systems of plants kang et al 1997 topcu et al 2007 sarker et al 2019 this irrigation pattern has been successfully applied to plant production in arid and semiarid regions mingo et al 2004 shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2017 because it can improve water productivity li et al 2007 consoli et al 2017 with minor or no yield loss xiao et al 2015 mossad et al 2017 generally prdi improves water productivity in two ways first prdi can lead to the closure of the leaf stomata and reduce luxury transpiration by encouraging the abscisic acid aba induced by dry soil conditions to transform from the roots to the leaves second prdi can maintain relatively higher photosynthesis rates and improve the root absorption simultaneously kang et al 1997 mingo et al 2004 sun et al 2013 current studies have addressed the c n and p allocations in the roots stems and leaves of plants to explain how they adapt to the changing environmental conditions induced by prdi mingo et al 2004 wang et al 2009 ye et al 2014 somaweera et al 2015 mossad et al 2017 prdi has been found to encourage more c and n to be allocated to the roots and less c and n to be allocated to the stems and leaves of rice ye et al 2014 more n and p to be allocated to the stems and leaves and less n and p to rice panicle somaweera et al 2015 and more p to be allocated to potato roots sun et al 2015 however these studies focused on the effects of prdi on the c n and p allocations in annual crops in which seeds or tubers are often harvested in agriculture some crops are annual whereas others are perennial in addition the harvest targets of some crops are reproductive organs such as seeds and fruits and underground vegetative organs such as tubers and roots whereas the harvest targets of other crops are aboveground vegetative organs stems and leaves however little attention has been given to the effect of prdi on the c n and p allocations in perennial crops in which the aboveground vegetative organs are harvested alfalfa which has high quality forage and a high n fixing ability fan et al 2016 is a perennial legume in which the aboveground vegetative organs leaves and stems are generally harvested to feed livestock directly he et al 2017 fan et al 2016 this crop is widely planted throughout the arid and semiarid regions of europe cavero et al 2017 the americas del pozo et al 2017 and china zhang et al 2019 meuriot et al 2004 have stated that understanding the c n and p allocation in alfalfa plants is essential for implementing efficient water management to ensure sustainable alfalfa production in arid and semiarid regions some studies have verified that prdi has been found to be applicable to alfalfa production because it can increase water use efficiency without reducing yields xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 2019 and others have shown that clipping and shading management encourage more c to be allocated to the roots of alfalfa plants schmitt et al 2013 and n application allocates more n to alfalfa shoots meuriot et al 2004 therefore more studies are needed to simultaneously examine whether prdi influences c n and p allocations to the roots stems and leaves and biomass of alfalfa plants this study investigates the effect of prdi on the biomass water productivity and c n and p allocations in the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa in this study it was hypothesized that 1 prdi has no effect on the stem and leaf biomass and increases water productivity 2 prdi increases the c concentrations in the roots and the n and p concentrations in the leaves and 3 prdi encourages more c to be allocated to the roots and more n and p to be allocated to the leaves 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was located at the huanghua farmland station 97 11 e 40 23 n 1395 m altitude in gansu province west china this station is located in a typical continental arid region with annual sunshine of 3000 h a mean annual temperature of 9 3 a maximum temperature of 40 4 in july a minimum temperature of 16 in january and annual mean precipitation of 59 5 mm the monthly precipitation differed but the monthly temperature did not between 2016 and 2017 fig 1 based on the chinese soil classification system gong 2001 the soil type is medium loam in which the ph value bulk density average field capacity and permanent wilting coefficient data for the 2 m soil profile are approximately 8 1 1 42 g cm 3 25 and 8 1 respectively and the organic matter and available n p and k contents of the soil are 20 g kg 1 91 mg kg 1 18 46 mg kg 1 and 151 52 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design and crop management the field experiment was performed from 2015 2017 on 5 april 2015 a furrow ridge system qi et al 2017 was used to establish the experimental alfalfa pasture with a 22 5 kg ha 1 seeding density and a 3 cm depth the alfalfa cultivar was 8920 fm from canada the irrigation treatments were performed from 2016 to 2017 because the two year alfalfa pasture had a relatively steady yield guo et al 2005 this experiment involved two factors irrigation mode and irrigation volume in a split plot design in which the irrigation mode was considered as the primary plot and the irrigation volume was considered as a subplot in northern china cropland in the same environment has been divided into individual parcels and each parcel is managed by an individual household through a long term contract since the 1980s qu et al 1995 the size of each parcel ranges from 0 1 to 0 4 ha in the study areas thus this study used a common parcel approximate 0 35 ha managed by an individual household to establish an experimental field area measuring 89 m 39 m the experimental field was divided into three equal blocks for 3 replications each block was 89 m 13 m consisting of 8 subplots each subplot was set at 10 m 11 m and consisted of 11 rows in which each row was 0 5 m wide with 10 0 m long ridges fig 2 the 0 5 m ridge width between furrows was determined in previous studies sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 barzegari et al 2017 and a pre experiment test which ensured that prdi truly occurred between subplots a 1 m buffering belt was designed to eliminate the effect of lateral soil water movement an irrigation furrow with a top width of 0 3 m a bottom width of 0 25 m and a depth of 0 3 m was developed between the ridges and each furrow was labeled with odd and paired even numbers management measurements for the experimental field area including pests and diseases were performed in accordance with the local farmers who live in this region every year during the experimental period each subplot received 25 95 kg ha 1 n 83 55 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 218 55 kg ha 1 k2o as urea n 46 calcium superphosphate p2o5 15 5 and potassium sulfate k2o 51 respectively at the regrowth stage when the shoots emerged from the crown and these fertilizers were evenly broadcast into all the furrows of each subplot 2 3 irrigation treatments the irrigation modes im consisted of prdi and conventional furrow irrigation cfi in this study prdi was conducted through alternate furrow irrigation in the field kang et al 1997 barzegari et al 2017 in prdi odd furrows were irrigated the first time and paired furrows were irrigated the next time which ensured that only one side of the plant roots received water and that the other side was left dry during that irrigation event in cfi each furrow was irrigated each time the irrigation volumes were set up according to the alfalfa water requirement the alfalfa water requirement was estimated by using the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations penman monteith formula allen et al 1998 of et kc et0 the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was computed based on the 20 year 1994 2014 statistical data from the local meteorological station the crop coefﬁcient kc was 0 88 based on the average value during the entire growth period in this region xiao et al 2015 the calculation result indicates that the et was 1117 mm which was total et of the entire growing season and the alfalfa et for the experimental period from march regrowth after winter to june early flowering stage was 357 mm the four irrigation volumes were 70 of et i1 85 of et i2 100 of et i3 and 115 of et i4 therefore the experiment resulted in 8 treatments i e prdi i1 prdi i2 prdi i3 prdi i4 cfi i1 cfi i2 cfi i3 and cfi i4 and each treatment had three replications there were 24 total subplots here the prdi subplots received 50 of the irrigation water used for the cfi and the actual irrigation water volumes were 250 304 357 and 411 mm for the i1 i2 i3 and i4 treatments under cfi respectively while the respective values for prdi were 125 mm 152 mm 179 mm and 206 mm the irrigation volume was not adjusted according to the rainfall since rainfall was scarce during the experimental period the irrigation volumes were the same for each treatment from 2016 to 2017 since the alfalfa water requirement was calculated using 20 years of weather data water was applied briefly with a controlled irrigation system and the irrigation water was delivered to each furrow from the canal with an electrical pump the water coming from the canal was passed through a flow meter to control the irrigation water before it entered a flexible hose diameter 120 mm that was laid in each subplot the actual irrigation date was determined by the local farmer s long term irrigation experience and the critical water requirement stage of alfalfa xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the critical water requirement stage of alfalfa was approximately 20 d at regrowth after the winter and at the branch stage the actual irrigation date should be delayed 3 d if it rains table s1 which could ensure prdi really occurred again 2 4 plant sampling and measurements at the end of the vegetative growth period of the alfalfa baslam et al 2012 in 2016 and 2017 three sampling quadrants 0 5 m by 0 5 m were placed randomly in each subplot to collect the aboveground parts of the alfalfa plants and then the roots of that subplot were collected using a 0 5 by 0 5 by 1 0 m soil column created with a shovel all the visible root systems were collected from the corresponding soil column and were then carefully washed free of soil the aboveground parts of the alfalfa plants were further divided by hand into leaves including floral components and stems lamb et al 2007 the roots stems and leaves were immediately oven dried at 105 c for 1 h and then maintained at 70 c until they reached a constant mass to calculate the dried biomass the dry root stem and leaf samples were weighed and then ground into powder with a mixer mill grinder these sample powders were passed through a 2 mm mesh screen to prepare for measuring the c n and p concentrations the c n and p concentrations were measured by dumas dry combustion method in a flash ii ea112 elemental analyzer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa kjeldahl procedure foss kjeltec 8400 foss dk and mo sb colorimetry uv 2102c unico shanghai china bao 2000 respectively 2 4 1 water productivity water productivity is dependent on the temporal and spatial scales of concern sarker et al 2019 and is calculated with many different formulas in accordance with the given objectives wang et al 2010a 2017 carracelas et al 2019 wakchaure et al 2020 in this study water productivity was calculated with the following equation 1 w p s h o o t b i o m a s s i p where wp was water productivity kg 1 ha 1 mm 1 the shoot biomass was the sum of the leaf and stem biomass kg ha 1 and i and p were irrigation volumes and precipitation mm respectively 2 4 2 c n and p accumulation and allocation the c n and p accumulations in different alfalfa organs were calculated by multiplying the c n and p concentrations in one organ by the biomass of the corresponding organ for example the c accumulation in the roots was calculated according to the following equation 2 car ccr rdm where car is the c accumulation in the roots kg ha 1 ccr is the c concentration in the roots mg g 1 and rdm is the root dry matter kg ha 1 a previous study employed the shoot to root ratio to estimate the n allocation in tomato plants topcu et al 2007 therefore this study also used the shoot to root ratio to estimate the c n and p allocations between the shoot and root which were calculated as follows 3 cs cr cas cal cr 4 ns nr nas nal nr 5 ps pr pas pal pr where cs ns and ps are the c n and p accumulation respectively in the shoots kg ha 1 which were calculated by finding the c n and p accumulation in the leaves plus the c n and p accumulation in the stems the cr nr and pr are the c n and p accumulation respectively in the roots kg ha 1 the cas nas and pas are the c n and p accumulation respectively in the stems kg ha 1 and the cal nal and pal are the c n and p accumulation respectively in the leaves kg ha 1 the c n and p allocations in the shoots were further estimated by finding the ratio of c accumulation in leaves to stems cl cs the ratio of n accumulation in leaves to stems nl ns and the ratio of p accumulation in leaves to stems pl ps 2 5 soil water content the gravimetric soil water content of the 0 2 m soil depth range was measured at 20 cm intervals by using soil cores with a 4 cm diameter and a 20 cm height six soil cores were taken randomly at both ridges and furrows in each subplot the collected soil samples were weighed immediately dried at 105 c for 24 h and then weighed again to calculate the gravimetric soil water content the gravimetric soil water content was measured at 7 day intervals after the first irrigation 2 6 statistical analysis the 2016 and 2017 data were analyzed separately using the following analysis procedure the variables root stem leaf and shoot biomass water productivity and c n and p concentrations accumulations and allocation in the roots stems and leaves were tested for normality and homogeneity and logarithmic transformations were performed when necessary two way analyses of variance anova with the general linear model univariate procedure were used to test the effects of the irrigation mode and irrigation volume as well as their interaction on the root stem leaf and shoot biomass water productivity and c n and p concentrations accumulations and allocation in which the irrigation mode and irrigation volume were considered fixed factors and the root stem leaf and shoot biomass water productivity and c n and p concentrations accumulations and allocations were considered separate dependent variables the least significant difference lsd test was used to compare the mean values of the different treatments at a significance level of p 0 05 if the interaction was significant the building multivariate quadratic polynomial regression model was used to establish the equation on the effect of the interaction of the irrigation mode and irrigation volume in which the irrigation modes were assigned numerical values in the abovementioned statistical analyses a multivariate quadratic polynomial regression model was created with matlab 2014 and others analyses were performed using the spss 17 0 software package from spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 soil water content regardless of the irrigation modes the soil water content under four irrigation volumes was between field capacity and permanent wilting point from 2016 2017 the soil water content was higher under cfi conditions than under prdi conditions and it was the highest under i4 irrigation conditions in both 2016 and 2017 fig 3 as time passed during the experimental period the soil water content showed similar fluctuating variations under two irrigation modes and four irrigation volumes between 2016 and 2017 these fluctuation variations were more distinct at the 0 100 cm soil depth than at the 100 200 cm soil depth under prdi compared to cfi fig s1 at each soil depth layer the soil water content under prdi and cfi increased as the irrigation volume increased in 2016 and 2017 during both years the gravimetric soil water content under each treatment decreased with the increasing soil depth fig s2 3 2 effect of prdi on alfalfa biomass and water productivity in both 2016 and 2017 the irrigation mode significantly affected the root stem and leaf biomass and water productivity but it did not affect the shoot biomass table 1 the irrigation volume affected the leaf root and shoot biomass and did not affect the stem biomass and water productivity interactions between the irrigation modes and irrigation volumes did not affect the leaf stem shoot and root biomass or the water productivity regardless of the irrigation volumes prdi resulted in greater stem and root biomass and water productivity while it lowered the leaf biomass p 0 05 during the two years the water productivity under prdi was 12 00 and 11 87 higher than under cfi in 2016 and 2017 respectively irrespective of the irrigation modes the leaf shoot and root biomass first increased and then decreased as the irrigation volume increased peaking under i3 irrigation conditions 3 3 effect of prdi on the c n and p concentrations in the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa with the exception of the p concentration in the stems the responses of the c n and p concentrations in the roots and leaves to the irrigation mode and irrigation volume were similar in 2016 and 2017 the irrigation mode had significant impacts on the c and p

figs 4 5 and 6 the irrigation volume had significant impacts on the c n and p concentrations in the roots stems and leaves the interactions of irrigation modes and irrigation volumes were only significant concerning n concentrations in the roots in 2016 and 2017 during the two year study prdi produced a higher c concentration in the roots fig 4 n concentration in the roots stems fig 5 and leaves and p concentration in the roots fig 6 the c concentration in the roots and stems increased from the i1 irrigation conditions to the i3 irrigation conditions and decreased from the i3 irrigation conditions to the i4 irrigation conditions while the c concentration in the leaves increased from the i1 irrigation conditions to the i3 irrigation conditions and was not different between the i3 and i4 irrigation conditions the p concentration in the roots increased from the i1 to i3 irrigation conditions and showed no difference when the irrigation volume was above that of the i3 irrigation conditions while the n and p concentrations in the leaves first increased and then decreased peaking under i3 irrigation conditions the p concentration in the stems in 2016 first increased from i1 to i2 irrigation conditions then remained stable from i2 to i3 irrigation conditions and then decreased from i3 to i4 irrigation conditions whereas the p concentration in stems in 2017 first remained stable from i1 to i2 irrigation conditions increased from i2 to i3 irrigation conditions and then decreased from i3 to i4 irrigation conditions during both years prdi resulted in higher n concentrations in the roots under four irrigation volumes under the prdi mode the n concentration in the roots first increased from the i1 to i2 irrigation conditions and then remained stable from the i2 to i4 irrigation conditions under the cfi mode the n concentration in the roots first increased from the i1 to i3 irrigation conditions and then decreased from the i3 to i4 irrigation conditions figs 5 7 among all of the treatments the highest n concentration in the roots was observed in prdi i3 treatment and the quadratic polynomial regression showed that there was a strong relationship

alfalfa plant in 2016 and 2017 the irrigation mode was only found to significantly affect the p accumulation in the roots and irrigation volume was found to significantly affect the c n p accumulations in the roots and leaves p 0 05 fig s3 s4 and s5 while irrigation volume had no significant effect on the c n and p accumulation in the stems the interaction of the irrigation modes and irrigation volumes did not impact the c n and p accumulations in the roots stems and leaves prdi only increased p accumulation in the roots the c accumulation in the roots and the c n and p accumulations in the leaves first increased from the i1 to i3 irrigation conditions and then decreased from the i3 to i4 irrigation conditions while the n and p accumulations in the roots first increased and then remained stable respectively 3 5 effect of prdi on c n and p allocations in alfalfa in both 2016 and 2017 the cs cr were markedly influenced by the irrigation mode irrigation volume

contrast to cfi prdi decreased the cl cs and increased the nl ns the cl cs first increased and then decreased as the irrigation volume increased 4 discussion prdi changes the soil biophysiochemical conditions where plants grow and further influences plant performance sun et al 2013 zare abyaneh et al 2017 this study shows that prdi increases the root and stem biomass and decreases the leaf biomass and this finding is not consistent with the first hypothesis prdi has no effect on the shoot biomass of alfalfa plants confirming the results reported by xiao et al 2015 and zhang et al 2019 these results further verify that there is no shoot biomass response in alfalfa plants to prdi caused by the trade offs of an increase in stem biomass and a decrease in leaf biomass but do not indicate a lack of response in the stem and leaf biomass to prdi prdi produces higher root biomass because it increases the lateral root numbers liu et al 2017b and root length density qi et al 2017 and similar results are also found in annual crops mingo et al 2004 somaweera et al 2015 liu et al 2017b and other perennial crops in which fruits degaris et al 2016 and roots zare abyaneh et al 2017 are harvested implying that the effect of prdi on the root biomass is consistent among plants that are annuals and perennials or in which different organs are harvested prdi increases the stem biomass of alfalfa plants which supports the idea that prdi increases the branch numbers per plant to some extent xiao et al 2015 while this trend differs from annual crops wang et al 2009 sun et al 2015 wang et al 2015 hou et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 these annual crops are generally sampled at their full maturity stage during the reproductive period of the abovementioned annual crops plants generally translocate most of their photosynthate to seeds tubers and fruits rather than stems alfalfa plants are sampled at the vegetative stage when plants allocate most of their photosynthate to the stem to encourage the plants to stand upright sheaffer et al 2000 indicating that the harvest or sample times can result in different stem biomass responses to prdi prdi decreased leaf biomass which is in agreement with previous results showing that prdi decreases the number of leaves of alfalfa plants xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 and as well as the leaf biomass of annual crops liu et al 2018b zheng et al 2018 and perennial crops in which the roots zare abyaneh et al 2017 and fruits degaris et al 2016 are harvested however some studies argue that prdi has no effect on the leaf biomass of annual crops jovanovic et al 2010 hou et al 2017 and perennial crops in which roots are harvested barzegari et al 2017 suggesting that the response of leaf biomass to prdi varies with the plant species these results demonstrate that the tradeoff in the different responses of the stem and leaf biomass to prdi results in a stable shoot biomass for alfalfa plants under prdi and a vigorous root system caused by prdi xiao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 is an important way for alfalfa plants to adapt to the changing environmental conditions under prdi high alfalfa water productivity caused by prdi is ascribed to low irrigation volume and soil evaporation kang et al 1997 and less deep percolation jovanovic et al 2010 similar to potatoes sarker et al 2019 and maize wang et al 2017 the root stem and leaf biomass are higher at 100 et than other et levels because low irrigation volumes do not meet the requirement of alfalfa plants for water whereas excessive irrigation water under i4 irrigation conditions often leads to a lack of o2 in the root zone which causes the development of high ethanol and other toxic substances in the roots cavero et al 2017 inhibiting alfalfa plant growth and wasting water resources these results indicate that there is an appropriate irrigation volume for alfalfa production in a given region this study also shows that prdi increases the c and p concentrations in the roots the n concentrations in the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa plants which is not in accordance with the second hypothesis prdi develops drought stress in alfalfa plants to some extent which provokes the c translocation from the leaf as the source to the root as the sink xu et al 2007 resulting in higher c concentrations in the roots of alfalfa plants higher n concentrations in the roots stems and leaves are also observed in annual crops shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2010a which can be caused in the following three ways first prdi increases the accumulation of soluble proteins in the plants raza et al 2017 second prdi may facilitate the transport of nitrate from bulk soil to the root surface which is beneficial for improving n uptake by the plant shahnazari et al 2008 and third prdi increases the available n supply for plants because it accelerates the organic n mineralization process wang et al 2010b sun et al 2013 the higher n concentration in alfalfa plants induced by prdi can improve the ability of alfalfa plants to adapt to environmental conditions by controlling the plant water status sun et al 2013 maintaining a greater photosynthesis rate and higher water use efficiency karandish and shahnazari 2016 prdi enhances the p uptake by plant roots in a horizontal direction or along the vertical soil profile liu et al 2018a because it stimulates root growth qi et al 2017 and transports more p from soils to roots liu et al 2017a resulting in higher p concentrations in alfalfa roots which is similar to what happens in annual crops somaweera et al 2015 the c n and p concentrations in the roots stems and leaves under the i1 and i2 conditions were lower than those under i3 and i4 which may be ascribed to drought stress in which drought stress influences c metabolism saud et al 2017 and reduces n and p mineralization wang et al 2010b liu et al 2018a resulting in low c n and p concentrations in the roots stems and leaves under i1 and i2 in addition the p concentrations in the stems showed a different change as the irrigation volumes increased from i1 to i3 irrigation conditions between 2016 and 2017 which can be explained by three factors first the soil in the study area is phosphorus deficient and the available p in the soil was lower in 2017 than in 2016 because alfalfa can deplete some p fan et al 2016 second the available p transportation from roots to shoots is slow under i2 irrigation conditions because alfalfa plants suffer from water stress dimkpa et al 2020 and third the i2 irrigation conditions could have encouraged the alfalfa to grow more root systems in 2017 than in 2016 which can consume more available p to support n fixation by alfalfa roots he et al 2017 these three factors encourage alfalfa plants to transport less p under i2 from roots to shoots than under i3 irrigation conditions in addition the p in shoots under i2 irrigation conditions has yet to be allocated to the leaves rosecrance et al 1996 which decreased the p in the stems under i2 irrigation conditions from 2016 to 2017 low p concentrations in stems under i2 in 2017 made no significant difference in the p concentration in stems between the i1 and i2 irrigation conditions this study further shows that prdi encourages more c and p to be allocated to the roots and more n to be allocated to the shoots especially in alfalfa leaves because of the higher ns nr and nl ns and lower cs cr ps pr and cl cs which does not support the third hypothesis the higher c and p allocations in roots under prdi is also observed in annual crops ye et al 2014 sun et al 2015 implying that prdi can lead to more c and p allocation to the roots of annual and perennial plants however prdi can allocate more n to alfalfa leaves under field conditions which is similar to annual tomatoes wang et al 2010b and rice somaweera et al 2015 under pot experimental condition and is not similar to rice under field conditions ye et al 2014 demonstrating that the effect of prdi on n allocation varies with the crop types or experimental conditions in this case higher c and p allocations in roots under prdi are primarily ascribed to higher root biomass because the higher number of roots induced by prdi is a major mechanism through which plants adapt positively to a limiting resource supply ye et al 2014 liu et al 2018a more c allocation in roots under prdi conditions is good for alfalfa root growth the large root system in alfalfa under prdi is beneficial for taking up soil water and soil released n and p xu et al 2007 oberhuber et al 2017 ensuring rhizosphere respiration and n fixation schmitt et al 2012 which contributes to the development of aboveground organs and the regrowth of alfalfa plants after clipping schmitt et al 2012 and results in a relatively stable alfalfa forage yield higher p allocation in roots under prdi has been found to indirectly increase n rich extracellular phosphatase zhang et al 2018a higher n allocation in leaves under prdi can be due to two factors first prdi increases the n concentration in leaves and second the leaf is often considered the primary organ of plant n assimilation at the vegetative growth stage of plants zhang et al 2018a more n allocation in leaves under prdi contributes to increased photosynthesis ability hu et al 2018 benefiting the synthesis of amino acids schmitt et al 2012 which can improve the alfalfa feed quality for livestock noland et al 2017 lamb et al 2007 the low irrigation volume encourages more c to be allocated to alfalfa roots because increasing drought stress encourages the roots to acquire more of the new c in the roots xu and zhou 2005 and similar results were also found in scots pine seedlings aaltonen et al 2017 and norway spruce oberhuber et al 2017 the highest n allocation in leaves and p allocation in roots were found under i2 irrigation conditions because moderate drought stress increases the n concentrations in leaves aaltonen et al 2017 and reduces p translocation somaweera et al 2015 these results suggest that alfalfa plants adopt different strategies to allocate c n and p to roots stems and leaves to optimize their growth and adapt well to the changed environment caused by prdi notably prdi can decrease the leaf biomass and increase the stem biomass implying that prdi is not beneficial to the alfalfa feed quality for livestock zhang et al 2016 whereas prdi can increase the n concentration in the shoots suggesting that prdi can indirectly improve the alfalfa feed quality for livestock he et al 2017 although the responses in the alfalfa feed quality to prdi is a complicated issue prdi has higher economic benefits than cfi since it maintains relatively stable yields and decreases the irrigation volume these findings imply that prdi can be applied to the alfalfa production of individual households in addition the furrow length under prdi may have impacts on the biomass c n and p allocations to different alfalfa organs in this case the furrow length under prdi is determined by the common cropland area of an individual household in the study regions therefore the findings of this study can provide useful information towards water saving irrigation in alfalfa production for most individual households in northern china however the cropland area is different among different regions and countries as a consequence the appropriate furrow length under prdi must be redetermined for alfalfa production 5 conclusions this study has investigated the effects of prdi on c n and p allocations to the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa one of the perennial crops for which the aboveground biomass is harvested the results of this study show that prdi increases the root and stem biomass and water productivity and decreases the leaf biomass and the trade offs of an increase in stem biomass and a decrease in leaf biomass result in a relatively stable shoot biomass prdi increases the c and p concentrations in the roots and the n concentrations in the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa and it encourages more c and p to be allocated to the roots and n to the leaves indicating that changes in the c n and p allocations in the roots stems and leaves of alfalfa are beneficial in enhancing the ability of alfalfa plants to adapt to the changed environmental conditions induced by prdi the findings of this study suggest that changes in c n and p allocations caused by prdi are one way to optimize plant growth for perennial crops for which the aboveground biomass is harvested declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript and the manuscript is approved by all authors for

10444,water scarcity is becoming a major challenge worldwide the agricultural sector as a main user of freshwater may significantly increase its water use efficiency by promoting water saving strategies this paper proposes a socio psychological model that builds upon the theory of planned behavior and social capital variables to examine how psychological constructs and their interaction with the environment and farmers backgrounds influence the switch from traditional to pressurized irrigation considering temporal precedence we measured farmers intention to adopt irrigation technologies and one year later their actual behavior we used a structural equation model and estimated marginal effects for direct and indirect relations the results show that actual adoption is affected directly by intention and the effect of subjective norms perceived control and attitudes on adoption are mediated through intention social pressure exerts a strong influence on farmers particularly in comparison to their own attitudes social capital triggers the adoption of pressurized irrigation by increasing social pressure and strengthening farmers perceived self confidence keywords planned behavior theory social capital technology adoption pressurized irrigation structural equation model 1 introduction water scarcity attributed to climate change and increasing population fader et al 2016 field 2014 is becoming one of the most relevant challenges worldwide global water demand is projected to increase by 20 30 by 2050 using 2018 as baseline from which industrial and domestic use are expected to grow even faster boretti and rosa 2019 agriculture is the main user of freshwater consuming approximately 70 of the total supply and a 16 increase in irrigation water withdrawals is expected by 2050 baseline 2000 pastor et al 2019 policies aimed at promoting water saving strategies in the agricultural sector may have a major positive impact on the sustainability of the resource nair 2019 scholars have pointed out that efficient irrigation technologies irrigation scheduling and smart agriculture at the farm level as well as basin management strategies and diversification of water sources are valuable approaches to cope with the current scenario connor 2016 galioto et al 2020 hess and knox 2013 rosegrant et al 2000 zhang et al 2019 fader et al 2016 concluded that efficient irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinklers can save up to 35 of water in the mediterranean and similar results were found by koech and langat 2018 in australia aitken et al 2016 in a study in chile provides evidence that using irrigation technologies can reduce scarcity by 19 moreover ahumada orellana et al 2017 concluded that limiting water by 20 does not affect yields in olive orchards in chile however regardless of the favorable evidence the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies is rather low worldwide only 14 of the total of 275 million ha of irrigated land uses pressurized irrigation araujo et al 2019 hence a key question for policy makers is how to increase the use of technologies that can meet higher efficiency in water use to date the prevailing approach to understanding the drivers of farmers decisions regarding the adoption of water efficient technologies and practices is economic rationality whereby the individual is motivated by the objective of maximizing his her utility subject to a series of constraints related to farm size low levels of education and limited financial resources chen et al 2014 edwards jones 2006 engler et al 2016 handschuch and wollni 2016 jara rojas et al 2012 roco et al 2014 however decisions are more complex than what purely economic rationality would indicate and decisions also depend on cognitive and sociological variables czap et al 2016 hunecke et al 2017 monteleone et al 2019 yazdanpanah et al 2014 zeweld et al 2017 besides socio economic constraints and drivers individual behavior is based on the perceived value of the effectiveness ease and or difficulty and advantages and or disadvantages of the technology all of which are subject to social psychological factors foster and rosenzweig 2010 given this broader context to water use decision making it is clear that we need to thoroughly elucidate the factors directing farmers behavior adoption klöckner 2013 a widely used approach to explain individual behavior in the field of economic psychology is the theory of planned behavior tpb ajzen 1985 de leeuw et al 2015 hansson et al 2012 monteleone et al 2019 yazdanpanah and forouzani 2015 tpb proposes that the intention of a behavior acts as a mediator of attitude individual beliefs with respect to the outcome of behavior subjective norms individual perception of social pressure and perceived control an individual s opinion about their ability to carry out a particular behavior glanz et al 2008 fishbein and ajzen 2011 tpb has also been applied to agriculture borges et al 2014 yazdanpanah et al 2014 chin et al 2016 senger et al 2017 however few studies have applied the full model that includes the link between intention and actual behavior borremans et al 2016 meijer et al 2015 niles et al 2016 yazdanpanah et al 2014 a downside of the aforementioned studies is that they estimate the relationship between intention and adoption at the same point in time whereas the inference of a causal relation must have a temporal precedence kline 2012 de leeuw et al 2015 additionally the agricultural literature has highlighted some shortcomings of tpb because it only focus on cognitive constructs and thus excludes the effect of the farmers environment and their interaction with the community which can be considered an asset and produces private benefits durlauf 2002 ramirez 2013 sidibé 2005 zeweld et al 2018 this study aims to bridge these two gaps from the literature a first by proposing a socio psychological model that examines how psychological constructs and their interaction with the farmers environment influence the intention of adoption of pressurized irrigation and b second by using a temporal scheme to link intention of adoption and actual behavior there is a rich literature that uses social capital networks norms and trust to account for the relationship between the individual and the environment as a predictor of adoption behavior concluding that the probability of adoption increases as the individual has more and deeper networks higher trust in the surrounding community and higher exposure to social norms esterhuyse 2012 van rijn et al 2015 wossen et al 2015 hunecke et al 2017 this leaves an unexplored question how does the social context in which the farmers are embedded influence the cognitive constructs of decision making we additionally explore the role of socio economic constraints in the decision to adopt pressurized irrigation and the association between the intention measured in year t0 and the actual behavior in t1 1 1 based on recommendations from the ministry of agriculture one year is a reasonable timeframe to observe changes in adoption farmers do have access to financial and extension services in different degrees we test the socio psychological model with vineyard farmers in the maule and o higgins regions of chile where adoption rates of pressurized irrigation are low despite the fact that pressurized irrigation has been proven to increase productivity and quality in vineyard and fruit species acevedo opazo et al 2010 ahumada orellana et al 2017 and that the chilean government implemented decree law 18 450 to promote the construction and improvement of irrigation systems by co financing up to 80 of the total investment donoso 2015 hearne and donoso 2014 hence understanding farmers motivations and the relationships between social and psychological factors will provide insights into strategies that promote adoption and counteract those perceptions that delay and or hinder adoption de leeuw et al 2015 2 theoretical framework and hypotheses we propose an integrated theoretical framework that considers social psychological and economic factors as a basis for this framework we use the theory of planned behavior tpb to account for cognitive constructs that have been proven in the psychology literature to influence behavior conner and armitage 1998 ajzen 2002 de leeuw et al 2015 and extend this to include farmers social capital characteristics network levels of trust and membership which have been identified to have an effect on psychological variables attitudes norms perceived control willock et al 1999 nuthall 2001 there are other experiences accounting for extensions of the tpb for example yazdanpanah et al 2014 extended the tpb model with moral norms self identity and perceived risk in order to analyze an unobservable variable measuring water conservation in iran concluding that intention was mostly explained by norms and that perceived control does not affect intention or behavior another study that proposes an integrated approach including tpb value beliefs norm theory and norm activation theory was performed by klöckner 2013 in essence he found that the tpb model alone cannot provide full insight into conservation behavior and that the relation between intention and behavior is dependent on the type of decision under analysis for the purpose of our study we follow the tpb framework proposed by ajzen 1985 which proposes that intention acts as a mediator of attitude subjective norms and perceived control in explaining actual behavior see fig 1 glanz et al 2008 fishbein and ajzen 2011 manteleone 2019 specifically attitude indicates the individual s belief with respect to the outcome of performing a behavior behavioral beliefs and the evaluation of those results glanz et al 2008 subjective norms are defined by how the individual weights the expectations of important others regarding a certain behavior corresponding to informal rules bicchieri and mercier 2014 hansson et al 2012 ajzen 1991 included perceived behavioral control to explain aspects outside the individual s intention and behavior perceived control measures the individual s opinion about their ability to carry out a particular behavior and the term can be used interchangeably with self confidence or self efficacy ajzen 2002 in tpb perceived control has an indirect effect through intention but could also have a direct effect on behavior if it were strong enough to be used as a measurement for actual control ajzen 2002 from the above we state the first hypothesis as h1 farmers that have a positive attitude towards the technology feel social pressure to adopt and perceive themselves to have the ability to act are more likely to adopt pressurized irrigation as their effects is mediated through intention to adoption empirical studies have shown that these unobservable cognitive constructs are socially learned changed and expressed hogg and terry 2000 the scope of the tpb framework provides information with regards to the customary codes of behavior in a group of people or larger cultural context but further information about the complete dynamics of the social context or of the continuous state of change as a result of new experiences is required nuthall 2001 therefore we include social capital variables to account for social context effects the literature suggests that individual behavior is driven by particular experiences and by the environment e g social comparison social norms with both being powerful factors in decision making kollmuss and agyeman 2002 ferraro and price 2013 rode et al 2015 to account for this we include trust and networks measured as membership and size of network we recognize that although beliefs are relatively stable they can be malleable as events unfold and new information about a person or issue becomes available fishbein and ajzen 2011 specifically beliefs about the outcome of a technology can change over time as new informal rules in a society are established slusher and anderson 1996 attitude changes can stem from different sources but one important element related to technology adoption is trust particularly because technologies are frequently promoted by the government or by non governmental organizations ngos from outside the community genius et al 2014 trust relates to the level of confidence that a farmer has towards an entity and whether he can count on the trusted entity jones 1996 lyon 2000 sponarski et al 2014 in the case of technology adoption it is important to differentiate between general and institutional trust general trust refers to the level of confidence of the farmer that he can rely on his community in the event of need lyon 2000 khalil 2003 carmeli and spreitzer 2009 coleman 1988 highlights that trust facilitates productive activities by allowing groups to engage in information exchange and accomplish more when they have extensive trust coleman 1988 pannell et al 2006 wossen et al 2015 granja and wollni 2018 institutional trust refers to trust in the government or ngos which will drive the subjective reliability of the source of information about the promoted technologies i e how much farmers trust the source lyon 2000 thus affecting farmers attitudes in the context of governments promoting the transition from traditional to pressurized irrigation systems it is therefore relevant to explore whether the level of trust in such institutions has an effect on attitudes at the same time institutional trust creates commitment from the farmer to behave according to the community s informal norms thus inducing the formation of social norms coleman 1988 seddon and levin 2013 summarizing the preceding review we can state the following hypothesis h2 the higher the general and institutional trust the more favorable will be the farmer s perception of the outcomes attitude higher institutional trust will further be associated with higher perceived pressure to behave according to the social norm a farmer s social environment is created by a social network that functions as a platform for interaction and communication with a circle of friends and peers members of a local organization and other important connections these constant interactions affect farmers beliefs decisions and behaviors jacques et al 2018 social networks allow individuals to connect exchange ideas and experiences look for help when in need or in doubt and access new information knowledge and sources of credit pelling and high 2005 esterhuyse 2012 van rijn et al 2015 farmers learn from each other and change their beliefs by learning from what others have adopted based on the above we hypothesize the following h3 farmers with a larger network using pressurized irrigation will feel more pressure to change from traditional to pressurized irrigation themselves but will also feel more confident to do so and will generally tend to have a more positive attitude towards pressurized irrigation h4 members of a local water organization perceive more social pressure to adopt pressurized irrigation nuthall 2001 indicated that previous experience influences decision making because lessons are processed instantaneously most farmers learn not only by testing a technology on their farms but also by exchanging experiences with close friends therefore we include farmers backgrounds to account for variables such as previous experience with pressurized irrigation technologies environmental awareness education and age weber et al 2004 highlighted that the decision process starts with some form of problem recognition therefore we analyze whether the perception of water limitations has a direct influence on the farmer s adoption of pressurized irrigation finally we control for key variables that may play a role when farmers adopt irrigation such as access to extension services land area and fees paid to the water community for water use ervin and ervin 1982 borges et al 2014 rubas 2004 prokopy et al 2008 although additional relationships could be analyzed we focus on the above elements to maintain the parsimony of the model fig 1 depicts the relationships and hypotheses we are testing 3 material and methods 3 1 study area in this study we focus on vineyard agricultural systems which produce some of the top export products in chile the study was carried out in the maule and o higgins regions both are located in the central part of chile characterized by a mediterranean climate that is especially suited for the production of vineyards and fruits in 2017 these regions contributed 34 8 of chile s agricultural gross domestic product gdp and 32 of the exports from agriculture moreover the maule and o higgins regions contributed a combined 42 of total wine exports 29 and 13 respectively and comprised a total of 98 262 ha planted with vineyards of which 91 are on irrigated land sag 2017 further engler et al 2016 using a sample of 452 vineyard producers of the o higgins and maule regions estimated a relatively low 43 3 adoption rate of pressurized irrigation despite the incentives provided by the government according to mcphee et al 2012 efficiency levels reducing water wastage of irrigation systems in central chile varies from 35 to 45 while in northern chile a region characterized by water scarcity efficiency increases to 45 60 as jordán and speelman 2020 highlighted farmers are not incentivized to adopt pressurized irrigation due to the perceived relative abundance of water nonetheless lozano parra et al 2020 forecast a reduction of 936 mm y 1 in precipitation by 2050 in chile highlighting that increased water demands by the population and agriculture to produce export products exacerbates competition among economic sectors therefore pressurized irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation are becoming more relevant to the chilean economy 3 2 data collection the study applied a cross sectional survey focused on collecting data about attitudes perceived control subjective norms intentions and the farmers environment and backgrounds the questionnaire was developed based on a literature review and was subsequently validated in a focus group that included experts from academia farmers public sector officers cnr 2 2 national irrigation commission and indap 3 3 national agricultural development institution and extension services agents in designing the questionnaire a five point likert scale was used for all tpb variables except for adoption behavior that is measured as a binary variable the descriptors were strongly disagree disagree neither agree nor disagree agree and strongly agree the targeted population was small and medium scale vineyard farmers from 21 municipalities 4 4 the municipalities were in order of number of surveyed producers san javier sagrada familia curicó rancagua villa alegre santa cruz talca palmilla san clemente peralillo rio claro requinoa chimarongo maule san vicente and peumo from three valleys cachapoal colchagua curico and maule of the o higgins and maule regions from which 324 farmers were selected producers were selected randomly in situ with a protocol of being at least 1 km apart from each other the number of producers correspond to a stratified sample based on the 2012 wine growing cadastral from the agriculture and livestock service the data were gathered in face to face interviews that were conducted between november 2014 and february 2015 each farmer was informed that they were free to refuse to participate and no payment was made to the farmers those who declined to participate were replaced by alternate respondents the location of the study site is presented in fig 2 a telephone follow up survey was conducted 12 months after the cross sectional survey we contacted all participants from the initial survey with a response rate of 91 295 of the 324 participants the brief approx 10 minute telephone follow up focused on asking the farmers if they had adopted or extended pressurized irrigation technology this follow up call verified short term actual behavior with regards to adoption of pressurized irrigation technologies and it facilitated a comparison with intentions declared the year before thus assuring the condition of time precedence hence tpb and social capital variables and socio economic characteristics were gathered for year t0 and actual adoption behavior for year t1 4 empirical model 4 1 model specification we use structural equation modeling sem to test the hypotheses regarding the relationship among cognitive social and socio economic variables simultaneously including measurement errors yazdanpanah et al 2014 sem is a multivariate estimator generating coefficients that allow us to estimate the magnitude and statistical significance of the structural relation between the latent and observed variables of the theoretical model following fig 1 the empirical model is expressed in the following equations 1 a t t β i t β g t β n e t w β w c β p e ζ 1 2 s n β i t

and institutional trust it and the observed variables of subjective norms sn networks netw membership mem and general trust gt as for tpb and social capital variables in the adoption behavior equation we include variables such as water fees wf water limitations wl water conservation awareness wc previous experience with pressurized irrigation pe and control variables to complete the model relationships the variable description is detailed in section 4 2 the shapiro wilk test showed that the variables are not normally distributed therefore we use the robust unweighted least squares ulsmv estimation procedure the estimates of structural coefficients under ulsmv surpass maximum likelihood ml and robust maximum likelihood mlr in almost all asymmetric conditions hence providing more robust standard errors under conditions of non normality and when modeling categorical or ordered data li 2014 additionally to infer a causal relation between two variables several statistical conditions must be met as specified by kline 2012 1 intention and adoption should be measured at two different points in time 2 covariation among the variables should be observed see correlation matrix in table a1 and 3 the statistical association should hold when controlling for other covariates that may have an effect on the variable of interest in this case adoption existence of isolation to check the robustness of the model we estimated three models using eqs 1 5 but with the following differences model 1 was estimated with the total sample 324 observations and without control variables wc pe wl wp extens area age and edu model 2 tests full isolation by estimating the empirical model with the total sample and control variables and model 3 tests systematic differences among farmers with and without previous experience with pressurized irrigation technology by restricting the sample to farmer that at t0 did not have pressurized irrigation resulting in a sample of 198 observations model fit is assessed using the comparative fit index cfi the tucker lewis index tli and the root mean squared error of approximation rmsea conventional rules establish that a model is satisfactory if the cfi and tli indices are higher than 0 9 and a model is considered excellent if the values are higher than 0 95 for both indexes for rmsea values below 0 08 are acceptable and below 0 06 are considered excellent hu and bentler 1999 kline 2015 li 2014 the model was estimated with mplus 7 4 2 variable description 4 2 1 cognitive constructs latent variables to generate the factor scores that are used in the regressions for the cognitive constructs of attitude att perceived control pc intention int and institutional trust it we use a series of statements rated on a five point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree following the guidelines and adjusted statements proposed by ajzen 1991 the literature uses cronbach s alpha to measure internal consistency and the kaiser meyer olkin kmo test to measure sampling adequacy these indicators are not reported when estimating sem in mplus hence we performed a factor analysis to validate the constructs we estimate the cronbach s alpha and the kmo observing results higher than 0 8 for att pc and int implying high internal consistency and adequacy it shows satisfactory results with a kmo of 0 73 and a cronbach s alpha of 0 83 table a2 in the appendix show results of factor analysis table 1 presents the average value of the constructs 4 2 2 observed variables observable variables were measured through direct questions in the survey for instance to measure sn we follow mobley et al 2010 by asking 1 the water community to which i belong expects me to adopt pressurized irrigation technology and 2 other farmers look favorably upon me or would look favorably upon me if i adopted modern irrigation these statements were rated on a five point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree and were averaged to deliver the variable sn networks were measured with two variables 1 netw number of the farmer s acquaintances who have adopted pressurized irrigation technologies and 2 mem participation in water organizations is a binary variable equaling 1 when the farmer was part of a water organization and 0 otherwise following grootaert 2003 gt was measured based on the statement i can trust the people around me without being too cautious using also a five point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree background information on the farmers includes land tenure area of their property years of education access to extension services water fee measured in chilean pesos paid annually by the farmer 5 5 the fee is a flat rate that is not based on the actual water quantity being used previous experience pe with pressurized irrigation take the value 1 if the farmer has had any previous experience implementing pressurized irrigation system on their farm or 0 otherwise water limitations wl 1 if the farmer has reported limitations on irrigation due to water shortages 0 otherwise and his level of water conservation awareness wc water conservation awareness is measured using the statement i would adopt modern irrigation technology because it helps to conserve water descriptive statistics of these variables are provided in table 1 5 results 5 1 descriptive statistics 5 1 1 characteristics of the sample basic sociodemographic characteristics show that the average age of the farmers is 52 76 years 91 are male and on average they have 11 57 years of schooling the baseline data show that 126 farmers 39 have previous experience with pressurized irrigation either because they have partially adopted it on their land or had it at some point in the past and 198 farmers 61 have no experience we observe that farmers who have experience with pressurized irrigation are significantly younger and have more years of schooling 13 12 years less farming experience higher area of land in tenure additional sources of income other than agriculture and a higher perception of water limitations compared to those that have no experience with pressurized irrigation systems table 1 in the case on smallholders extension services are provided free of charge by agricultural associations or by the institute for agricultural development indap of the agricultural ministry overall these services have been used by 38 of the farmers in the sample regarding land tenure most of the land is owned according to the organization of water distribution system farmers must pay their water communities a fee for the water rights they own in our sample 80 of the farmers pay an annual fee for their water right independent of consumption the yearly payment was 20 176 chilean pesos on the average which is equivalent to us 32 18 on average farmers have moderate levels of general and institutional trust with mean values of 3 58 and 3 28 on a scale of 1 5 respectively the average number of known acquaintances that use pressurized technologies is 6 and there is a significant difference between farmers who have previous experience with pressurized irrigation technology as they have almost twice the number of acquaintances compared to farmers who have no experience with irrigation technology participation in local organizations is relatively low only 23 of the sample participates in a water organization when analyzing the cognitive constructs of tpb we observe moderate intentions to adopt pressurized irrigation technologies with an average value of 3 18 on a scale of 1 5 a positive attitude with a score of 4 97 moderate subjective norm 3 39 and moderate perceived control 3 57 comparing the values of farmers with and without previous experience with pressurized irrigation there are significant differences in all these constructs with those who have previous experience reporting higher scores on all aspects the comparison between these two groups provides support for the hypotheses presented in section 2 the differences found here between the two groups regarding attitudes subjective norms perceived control intention and social capital variables are consistent with the literature and highlight the importance of considering farmers context and social environment when analyzing intentions and actual adoption behavior 5 1 2 relation between intention and actual behavior actual behavior was measured 12 months after the application of the cross sectional survey adopters are defined as those farmers who had either adopted or extended pressurized irrigation during the previous twelve months for comparison and descriptive purposes we recoded the variable intention originally measured on a likert scale from 1 5 into a dummy variable where scores of 3 take the value of 1 aggregating the responses of those farmers with declared intention to adopt pressurized irrigation in the following year and scores 3 take the value 0 6 6 the recoding of intention into a binary variable was used only for comparison in the descriptive section in the econometric analysis we used the five statements of intention as originally measured on a likert scale from 1 to 5 therefore in the econometric analysis the factor scores were used in the regression fig 3 shows that 58 of the farmers stated an intention to adopt and 17 actually adopted pressurized irrigation technology when comparing farmers with and without previous experience we find significant differences with respect to both intentions and actual behavior among farmers with previous experience 76 have the intention to adopt or expand the use of pressurized irrigation technology while only 46 of the farmers without previous experience have such intention regarding actual behavior 26 of the farmers with experience adopted the technology compared to only 11 of the farmers without experience these results support the hypothesis that knowledge can shape the attitudes and intentions of farmers 5 2 sem results as explained in section 4 we estimate three different model specifications to check the robustness of the multiple relations proposed in the theoretical framework model 1 estimates the relationships among the cognitive constructs of tpb and social capital variables without control variables model 2 estimates the relationships as in model 1 but additionally incorporates control variables to verify the assumption of isolation model 3 constrains the sample to those farmers who have not had any previous experience with pressurized irrigation technology all three models present a satisfactory fit based on the criteria formulated by hu and bentler 1999 table 2 which compare the residual differences between the fitted and the sample covariance matrices with respect to the classical tpb variables model 1 shows that attitudes subjective norms and perceived control have positive and significant effects on intention eq 4 subjective norms exhibit the highest estimated coefficient β 0 434 p 0 001 followed by perceived control β 0 280 p 0 001 and attitudes β 0 138 p 0 05 indicating that social pressure exerts a strong influence on farmers particularly in comparison to their own attitudes these results align with previous studies that have emphasized the influence of perceived social pressure on adoption renfroe et al 1990 burton 2014 all three variables together explain 43 5 of the variance in intention furthermore model 1 reveals that intention 7 7 as explained in section 4 2 1 intention is a latent variable estimated in the sem with all parameters simultaneously it considers the statements indicated in appendix a2 thus intention is a factor score with the estimates for the true latent variable scores devlieger and rosseel 2017 has a significant and positive effect on adoption eq 5 and thus confirms that intention to engage in an action is the proximal antecedent of voluntary action ajzen 2002 de leeuw et al 2015 based on these results we can corroborate hypothesis h1 that farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived control have a positive effect on intention and adoption of pressurized irrigation systems regarding the social capital variables we observe mixed results model 1 shows that institutional trust is positively related to attitudes and subjective norms while general trust is positively related to attitudes thus supporting h2 these findings imply that higher levels of trust are associated with positive perceptions of the action outcomes attitudes institutional trust can be seen as a cooperation agreement between the farmer and the institutions providing extension services and therefore farmers feel committed to act according to the social norms embodied by these institutions khalil 2003 the size of the network netw is statistically related to perceived control indicating that farmers will feel more confident about their ability to implement the technology when they are embedded in a large network of other adopters thus partially supporting h3 contrary to our expectations netw does not have significant effects on attitudes and subjective norms finally membership in water organizations has a positive effect on subjective norms which corroborates h4 model 2 which includes additional control variables generates results that are consistent with model 1 i e most of the statistical associations persist overall model 2 explains 21 3 of the variance in actual adoption behavior eq 5 previous experience pe with the technology contributes to a positive attitude to higher perceived control and intentions to adopt in the adoption equation eq 5 only physical capital and water limitations for irrigation have positive and significant effects model 3 shows consistency with the findings of model 2 for the cognitive constructs further we estimated the marginal effects of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable adoption adop including direct indirect and total effects for this purpose we use model 2 because it controls for additional covariates and presents the best goodness of fit table 3 provides the direct indirect and total marginal effects 8 8 we estimate the probit regression probabilities based on muthén and muthén 2009 of each variable on the probability of adoption adop the results show that attitudes att perceived control pc and subjective norms sn have significant indirect effects on adoption adop and that they are effectively mediated through intention membership in water organizations mem increases the probability of adoption indirectly because its effects are mediated through subjective norms this finding can be explained by the well established institutions in the chilean water code that define water community organizations as key to water management this is also reflected in the institutional trust that farmers have in these organizations higher institutional trust levels indirectly increase the likelihood of adoption through their positive effects on attitudes att with regard to control variables having water limitations wl for irrigation shows a direct effect on the adoption of irrigation technologies as expected water fee wf shows no effect on adoption adop because the payment is not dependent on water consumption to provide an incentive for more efficient water use charges must be a direct function of consumption southgate and figueroa 2006 de fraiture and perry 2007 extension services extens show a significant effect on perceived control pc but not on adoption adop physical capital area measured as farm size in hectares positively and significantly influences adoption meaning that larger farmers are more likely to adopt due to scale economies and larger capacity to bear risk diederen et al 2003 jara rojas et al 2012 finally we observe that water conservation awareness wc indirectly and positively impacts the likelihood of adoption mediated through its positive effect on attitudes and intentions 6 discussion several authors recognize the need to tie the individual s cognitive processes to the environment where s he is embedded as farmers psychological characteristics are important non economic elements of decision making edwards jones 2006 monteleone et al 2019 more interestingly our work goes deeper to show that such attitudes subjective norms networks and trust general and institutional are interconnected elements of two different frameworks that jointly explain farmers intentions to perform a specific action this finding provides insights into the associations among a large number of variables that individual models are not able to show klöckner 2013 in this sense tpb acts as a mediator to unveil a more complex interaction of interconnected internal psychological and external institutional factors that can help us understand the decision making processes underlying adoption although we are aware that a model that incorporates all factors might not be feasible our proposed model sheds light on important cognitive social capital and economic factors that affect adoption an additional contribution of our work is that it tests intention and actual behavior using a one year lifespan analysis this approach is rare in the literature and even scarcer in decisions related to the agricultural sector the results show that intention predicts actual behavior and that modeling actual behavior enables testing both direct and indirect effects of interconnected variables not only on intention but also on actual adoption farmers reported a positive attitude towards pressurized irrigation technology believing that pressurized irrigation is profitable improves crop management and increases yields this positive attitude indirectly affects adoption through intention the impact of subjective norms on intention and its indirect effect on adoption is noteworthy as is the fact that a farmer s perception of what others expect him her to do is influenced by institutional trust farmers are keen to adopt technologies that others approve of this is in line with the findings of läpple and kelley 2013 who showed that social norms and the ability and resources of the farmer limited the adoption of organic practices yet the implications of social norms go beyond social acceptance social norms define what is acceptable or unacceptable providing the basis for maintaining trust and at the same time such norms create an obligation to engage in mutual effort lyon 2000 social capital provides access to more and better information jacques et al 2018 wuepper et al 2018 hence its inclusion mediated through tpb variables gives a sense of what is affected by this access to information being a member of an association provides access to information that can shape the willingness to adopt in our results membership directly impacts the intention to adopt the technology and indirectly affects actual adoption this finding fills the gap identified by prokopy et al 2008 as our model provides evidence that membership has a positive and significant influence on intention our results also indicate that if the farmer trusts water community associations and water monitoring boards it is more likely that he she will have a higher intention to adopt modern irrigation technologies nonetheless other studies have found that trust is negatively related to decisions regarding the adoption of irrigation technology and climate change adaptation paul et al 2016 hunecke et al 2017 such contradictory results highlight the importance of understanding the relations of the elements of social capital and behavior on a case by case basis in order to design locally adapted policies overall we can see that general and institutional trust social norms and membership are relevant in explaining adoption directly or indirectly through intention despite this only 23 of the sample has had a role within local organizations this represents an opportunity to design an intervention in which local organizations promote the engagement and active participation of farmers the influence of perceived control on intention is positive and significant in our model an individual s belief in their capacity to execute the action will affect their behavioral intention how confident a farmer is in adopting pressurized irrigation depends on the people around him her who have adopted the technology as shown by the influence of networks on perceived control social networks should be strengthened and used as an instrument to increase self confidence levels among farmers as dowd et al 2014 noted strong networks make individuals feel more satisfied and confident with the amount of information they receive through their network social influences help shape a person s estimation of their confidence and capability to use a system well bhatti 1970 we measured social networks through membership and the number of farmers that have adopted so strategies should focus on encouraging an increase in membership and in the creation of discussion forums that foster interaction and therefore enlargement of the network in the estimated model we also included control variables focusing on the traditional economic incentives and restrictions that are part of the utility maximizing models the results are indeed revealing in general other than physical capital these variables do not have a significant effect on adoption meaning that socio psychological variables are capturing the effect they usually express in traditional models engler et al 2016 hence more emphasis should be placed on developing a pro adoption environment than on relaxing farmers constraints such as providing high subsidies to promote adoption key policy implications can be derived from our empirical results first attitude campaigns are not enough to influence intentions therefore policies introduced by governmental institutions could achieve better results by promoting long term changes in beliefs and social norms even a policy without any financial incentive could result in more environmentally friendly and socially responsible behavior if it were designed to strengthen self confidence and perceived social pressure czap et al 2016 second initiatives from the government could define a strategy to change the current practice the generally acceptable norm of traditional irrigation influencing farmers core beliefs associated with water conservation awareness and boosting farmers trust in water organizations that could foster cooperation could both lead to the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems as a norm klöckner 2013 third extension services should focus on transferring knowledge and information through social networks to facilitate action and increase farmers perceived self confidence about undertaking the challenge of switching from superficial to pressurized irrigation in this context such as strategy is more important than improving attitudes towards the technology 7 conclusions the objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the farmers behavioral beliefs and the effect of the social environment on such beliefs to explain adoption decisions we argued that understanding how attitudes subjective norms and perceived control affect the intention of adoption is not enough to provide useful insights for policy in doing so we proposed an integral framework that includes the cognitive components of tpb and is extended by social capital variables our results provide novel insights into the decision making process and they raise several points that can expand this line of research first decisions are a result of a dynamic process and although we capture two points in time individual intention and action it would be interesting to analyze the changes in beliefs and or social aspects in order to measure the indirect and direct effect on adoption of such aspects second as the triggers of decisions are already in motion we could also explore the impact of tpb and social capital on incremental adoption having a better understanding of the adoption path of the farmers could lead to proposing more purposeful policy incentives to increase the speed of adoption by farmers declaration of competing interest we confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by any other journal all of the authors agree with submission to agricultural water management we have no conflicts

10444,water scarcity is becoming a major challenge worldwide the agricultural sector as a main user of freshwater may significantly increase its water use efficiency by promoting water saving strategies this paper proposes a socio psychological model that builds upon the theory of planned behavior and social capital variables to examine how psychological constructs and their interaction with the environment and farmers backgrounds influence the switch from traditional to pressurized irrigation considering temporal precedence we measured farmers intention to adopt irrigation technologies and one year later their actual behavior we used a structural equation model and estimated marginal effects for direct and indirect relations the results show that actual adoption is affected directly by intention and the effect of subjective norms perceived control and attitudes on adoption are mediated through intention social pressure exerts a strong influence on farmers particularly in comparison to their own attitudes social capital triggers the adoption of pressurized irrigation by increasing social pressure and strengthening farmers perceived self confidence keywords planned behavior theory social capital technology adoption pressurized irrigation structural equation model 1 introduction water scarcity attributed to climate change and increasing population fader et al 2016 field 2014 is becoming one of the most relevant challenges worldwide global water demand is projected to increase by 20 30 by 2050 using 2018 as baseline from which industrial and domestic use are expected to grow even faster boretti and rosa 2019 agriculture is the main user of freshwater consuming approximately 70 of the total supply and a 16 increase in irrigation water withdrawals is expected by 2050 baseline 2000 pastor et al 2019 policies aimed at promoting water saving strategies in the agricultural sector may have a major positive impact on the sustainability of the resource nair 2019 scholars have pointed out that efficient irrigation technologies irrigation scheduling and smart agriculture at the farm level as well as basin management strategies and diversification of water sources are valuable approaches to cope with the current scenario connor 2016 galioto et al 2020 hess and knox 2013 rosegrant et al 2000 zhang et al 2019 fader et al 2016 concluded that efficient irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinklers can save up to 35 of water in the mediterranean and similar results were found by koech and langat 2018 in australia aitken et al 2016 in a study in chile provides evidence that using irrigation technologies can reduce scarcity by 19 moreover ahumada orellana et al 2017 concluded that limiting water by 20 does not affect yields in olive orchards in chile however regardless of the favorable evidence the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies is rather low worldwide only 14 of the total of 275 million ha of irrigated land uses pressurized irrigation araujo et al 2019 hence a key question for policy makers is how to increase the use of technologies that can meet higher efficiency in water use to date the prevailing approach to understanding the drivers of farmers decisions regarding the adoption of water efficient technologies and practices is economic rationality whereby the individual is motivated by the objective of maximizing his her utility subject to a series of constraints related to farm size low levels of education and limited financial resources chen et al 2014 edwards jones 2006 engler et al 2016 handschuch and wollni 2016 jara rojas et al 2012 roco et al 2014 however decisions are more complex than what purely economic rationality would indicate and decisions also depend on cognitive and sociological variables czap et al 2016 hunecke et al 2017 monteleone et al 2019 yazdanpanah et al 2014 zeweld et al 2017 besides socio economic constraints and drivers individual behavior is based on the perceived value of the effectiveness ease and or difficulty and advantages and or disadvantages of the technology all of which are subject to social psychological factors foster and rosenzweig 2010 given this broader context to water use decision making it is clear that we need to thoroughly elucidate the factors directing farmers behavior adoption klöckner 2013 a widely used approach to explain individual behavior in the field of economic psychology is the theory of planned behavior tpb ajzen 1985 de leeuw et al 2015 hansson et al 2012 monteleone et al 2019 yazdanpanah and forouzani 2015 tpb proposes that the intention of a behavior acts as a mediator of attitude individual beliefs with respect to the outcome of behavior subjective norms individual perception of social pressure and perceived control an individual s opinion about their ability to carry out a particular behavior glanz et al 2008 fishbein and ajzen 2011 tpb has also been applied to agriculture borges et al 2014 yazdanpanah et al 2014 chin et al 2016 senger et al 2017 however few studies have applied the full model that includes the link between intention and actual behavior borremans et al 2016 meijer et al 2015 niles et al 2016 yazdanpanah et al 2014 a downside of the aforementioned studies is that they estimate the relationship between intention and adoption at the same point in time whereas the inference of a causal relation must have a temporal precedence kline 2012 de leeuw et al 2015 additionally the agricultural literature has highlighted some shortcomings of tpb because it only focus on cognitive constructs and thus excludes the effect of the farmers environment and their interaction with the community which can be considered an asset and produces private benefits durlauf 2002 ramirez 2013 sidibé 2005 zeweld et al 2018 this study aims to bridge these two gaps from the literature a first by proposing a socio psychological model that examines how psychological constructs and their interaction with the farmers environment influence the intention of adoption of pressurized irrigation and b second by using a temporal scheme to link intention of adoption and actual behavior there is a rich literature that uses social capital networks norms and trust to account for the relationship between the individual and the environment as a predictor of adoption behavior concluding that the probability of adoption increases as the individual has more and deeper networks higher trust in the surrounding community and higher exposure to social norms esterhuyse 2012 van rijn et al 2015 wossen et al 2015 hunecke et al 2017 this leaves an unexplored question how does the social context in which the farmers are embedded influence the cognitive constructs of decision making we additionally explore the role of socio economic constraints in the decision to adopt pressurized irrigation and the association between the intention measured in year t0 and the actual behavior in t1 1 1 based on recommendations from the ministry of agriculture one year is a reasonable timeframe to observe changes in adoption farmers do have access to financial and extension services in different degrees we test the socio psychological model with vineyard farmers in the maule and o higgins regions of chile where adoption rates of pressurized irrigation are low despite the fact that pressurized irrigation has been proven to increase productivity and quality in vineyard and fruit species acevedo opazo et al 2010 ahumada orellana et al 2017 and that the chilean government implemented decree law 18 450 to promote the construction and improvement of irrigation systems by co financing up to 80 of the total investment donoso 2015 hearne and donoso 2014 hence understanding farmers motivations and the relationships between social and psychological factors will provide insights into strategies that promote adoption and counteract those perceptions that delay and or hinder adoption de leeuw et al 2015 2 theoretical framework and hypotheses we propose an integrated theoretical framework that considers social psychological and economic factors as a basis for this framework we use the theory of planned behavior tpb to account for cognitive constructs that have been proven in the psychology literature to influence behavior conner and armitage 1998 ajzen 2002 de leeuw et al 2015 and extend this to include farmers social capital characteristics network levels of trust and membership which have been identified to have an effect on psychological variables attitudes norms perceived control willock et al 1999 nuthall 2001 there are other experiences accounting for extensions of the tpb for example yazdanpanah et al 2014 extended the tpb model with moral norms self identity and perceived risk in order to analyze an unobservable variable measuring water conservation in iran concluding that intention was mostly explained by norms and that perceived control does not affect intention or behavior another study that proposes an integrated approach including tpb value beliefs norm theory and norm activation theory was performed by klöckner 2013 in essence he found that the tpb model alone cannot provide full insight into conservation behavior and that the relation between intention and behavior is dependent on the type of decision under analysis for the purpose of our study we follow the tpb framework proposed by ajzen 1985 which proposes that intention acts as a mediator of attitude subjective norms and perceived control in explaining actual behavior see fig 1 glanz et al 2008 fishbein and ajzen 2011 manteleone 2019 specifically attitude indicates the individual s belief with respect to the outcome of performing a behavior behavioral beliefs and the evaluation of those results glanz et al 2008 subjective norms are defined by how the individual weights the expectations of important others regarding a certain behavior corresponding to informal rules bicchieri and mercier 2014 hansson et al 2012 ajzen 1991 included perceived behavioral control to explain aspects outside the individual s intention and behavior perceived control measures the individual s opinion about their ability to carry out a particular behavior and the term can be used interchangeably with self confidence or self efficacy ajzen 2002 in tpb perceived control has an indirect effect through intention but could also have a direct effect on behavior if it were strong enough to be used as a measurement for actual control ajzen 2002 from the above we state the first hypothesis as h1 farmers that have a positive attitude towards the technology feel social pressure to adopt and perceive themselves to have the ability to act are more likely to adopt pressurized irrigation as their effects is mediated through intention to adoption empirical studies have shown that these unobservable cognitive constructs are socially learned changed and expressed hogg and terry 2000 the scope of the tpb framework provides information with regards to the customary codes of behavior in a group of people or larger cultural context but further information about the complete dynamics of the social context or of the continuous state of change as a result of new experiences is required nuthall 2001 therefore we include social capital variables to account for social context effects the literature suggests that individual behavior is driven by particular experiences and by the environment e g social comparison social norms with both being powerful factors in decision making kollmuss and agyeman 2002 ferraro and price 2013 rode et al 2015 to account for this we include trust and networks measured as membership and size of network we recognize that although beliefs are relatively stable they can be malleable as events unfold and new information about a person or issue becomes available fishbein and ajzen 2011 specifically beliefs about the outcome of a technology can change over time as new informal rules in a society are established slusher and anderson 1996 attitude changes can stem from different sources but one important element related to technology adoption is trust particularly because technologies are frequently promoted by the government or by non governmental organizations ngos from outside the community genius et al 2014 trust relates to the level of confidence that a farmer has towards an entity and whether he can count on the trusted entity jones 1996 lyon 2000 sponarski et al 2014 in the case of technology adoption it is important to differentiate between general and institutional trust general trust refers to the level of confidence of the farmer that he can rely on his community in the event of need lyon 2000 khalil 2003 carmeli and spreitzer 2009 coleman 1988 highlights that trust facilitates productive activities by allowing groups to engage in information exchange and accomplish more when they have extensive trust coleman 1988 pannell et al 2006 wossen et al 2015 granja and wollni 2018 institutional trust refers to trust in the government or ngos which will drive the subjective reliability of the source of information about the promoted technologies i e how much farmers trust the source lyon 2000 thus affecting farmers attitudes in the context of governments promoting the transition from traditional to pressurized irrigation systems it is therefore relevant to explore whether the level of trust in such institutions has an effect on attitudes at the same time institutional trust creates commitment from the farmer to behave according to the community s informal norms thus inducing the formation of social norms coleman 1988 seddon and levin 2013 summarizing the preceding review we can state the following hypothesis h2 the higher the general and institutional trust the more favorable will be the farmer s perception of the outcomes attitude higher institutional trust will further be associated with higher perceived pressure to behave according to the social norm a farmer s social environment is created by a social network that functions as a platform for interaction and communication with a circle of friends and peers members of a local organization and other important connections these constant interactions affect farmers beliefs decisions and behaviors jacques et al 2018 social networks allow individuals to connect exchange ideas and experiences look for help when in need or in doubt and access new information knowledge and sources of credit pelling and high 2005 esterhuyse 2012 van rijn et al 2015 farmers learn from each other and change their beliefs by learning from what others have adopted based on the above we hypothesize the following h3 farmers with a larger network using pressurized irrigation will feel more pressure to change from traditional to pressurized irrigation themselves but will also feel more confident to do so and will generally tend to have a more positive attitude towards pressurized irrigation h4 members of a local water organization perceive more social pressure to adopt pressurized irrigation nuthall 2001 indicated that previous experience influences decision making because lessons are processed instantaneously most farmers learn not only by testing a technology on their farms but also by exchanging experiences with close friends therefore we include farmers backgrounds to account for variables such as previous experience with pressurized irrigation technologies environmental awareness education and age weber et al 2004 highlighted that the decision process starts with some form of problem recognition therefore we analyze whether the perception of water limitations has a direct influence on the farmer s adoption of pressurized irrigation finally we control for key variables that may play a role when farmers adopt irrigation such as access to extension services land area and fees paid to the water community for water use ervin and ervin 1982 borges et al 2014 rubas 2004 prokopy et al 2008 although additional relationships could be analyzed we focus on the above elements to maintain the parsimony of the model fig 1 depicts the relationships and hypotheses we are testing 3 material and methods 3 1 study area in this study we focus on vineyard agricultural systems which produce some of the top export products in chile the study was carried out in the maule and o higgins regions both are located in the central part of chile characterized by a mediterranean climate that is especially suited for the production of vineyards and fruits in 2017 these regions contributed 34 8 of chile s agricultural gross domestic product gdp and 32 of the exports from agriculture moreover the maule and o higgins regions contributed a combined 42 of total wine exports 29 and 13 respectively and comprised a total of 98 262 ha planted with vineyards of which 91 are on irrigated land sag 2017 further engler et al 2016 using a sample of 452 vineyard producers of the o higgins and maule regions estimated a relatively low 43 3 adoption rate of pressurized irrigation despite the incentives provided by the government according to mcphee et al 2012 efficiency levels reducing water wastage of irrigation systems in central chile varies from 35 to 45 while in northern chile a region characterized by water scarcity efficiency increases to 45 60 as jordán and speelman 2020 highlighted farmers are not incentivized to adopt pressurized irrigation due to the perceived relative abundance of water nonetheless lozano parra et al 2020 forecast a reduction of 936 mm y 1 in precipitation by 2050 in chile highlighting that increased water demands by the population and agriculture to produce export products exacerbates competition among economic sectors therefore pressurized irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation are becoming more relevant to the chilean economy 3 2 data collection the study applied a cross sectional survey focused on collecting data about attitudes perceived control subjective norms intentions and the farmers environment and backgrounds the questionnaire was developed based on a literature review and was subsequently validated in a focus group that included experts from academia farmers public sector officers cnr 2 2 national irrigation commission and indap 3 3 national agricultural development institution and extension services agents in designing the questionnaire a five point likert scale was used for all tpb variables except for adoption behavior that is measured as a binary variable the descriptors were strongly disagree disagree neither agree nor disagree agree and strongly agree the targeted population was small and medium scale vineyard farmers from 21 municipalities 4 4 the municipalities were in order of number of surveyed producers san javier sagrada familia curicó rancagua villa alegre santa cruz talca palmilla san clemente peralillo rio claro requinoa chimarongo maule san vicente and peumo from three valleys cachapoal colchagua curico and maule of the o higgins and maule regions from which 324 farmers were selected producers were selected randomly in situ with a protocol of being at least 1 km apart from each other the number of producers correspond to a stratified sample based on the 2012 wine growing cadastral from the agriculture and livestock service the data were gathered in face to face interviews that were conducted between november 2014 and february 2015 each farmer was informed that they were free to refuse to participate and no payment was made to the farmers those who declined to participate were replaced by alternate respondents the location of the study site is presented in fig 2 a telephone follow up survey was conducted 12 months after the cross sectional survey we contacted all participants from the initial survey with a response rate of 91 295 of the 324 participants the brief approx 10 minute telephone follow up focused on asking the farmers if they had adopted or extended pressurized irrigation technology this follow up call verified short term actual behavior with regards to adoption of pressurized irrigation technologies and it facilitated a comparison with intentions declared the year before thus assuring the condition of time precedence hence tpb and social capital variables and socio economic characteristics were gathered for year t0 and actual adoption behavior for year t1 4 empirical model 4 1 model specification we use structural equation modeling sem to test the hypotheses regarding the relationship among cognitive social and socio economic variables simultaneously including measurement errors yazdanpanah et al 2014 sem is a multivariate estimator generating coefficients that allow us to estimate the magnitude and statistical significance of the structural relation between the latent and observed variables of the theoretical model following fig 1 the empirical model is expressed in the following equations 1 a t t β i t β g t β n e t w β w c β p e ζ 1 2 s n β i t β n e t w β m e m ζ 2 3 p c β n e t w β e x t e n s β p e ζ 3 4 i n t β a t t β s n β p c β p e ζ 4 and adoption behavior 5 a d o p β i n t β p c β a r e a β e x t e n s β a g e β w c β e d u β w p β

and institutional trust it and the observed variables of subjective norms sn networks netw membership mem and general trust gt as for tpb and social capital variables in the adoption behavior equation we include variables such as water fees wf water limitations wl water conservation awareness wc previous experience with pressurized irrigation pe and control variables to complete the model relationships the variable description is detailed in section 4 2 the shapiro wilk test showed that the variables are not normally distributed therefore we use the robust unweighted least squares ulsmv estimation procedure the estimates of structural coefficients under ulsmv surpass maximum likelihood ml and robust maximum likelihood mlr in almost all asymmetric conditions hence providing more robust standard errors under conditions of non normality and when modeling categorical or ordered data li 2014 additionally to infer a causal relation between two variables several statistical conditions must be met as specified by kline 2012 1 intention and adoption should be measured at two different points in time 2 covariation among the variables should be observed see correlation matrix in table a1 and 3 the statistical association should hold when controlling for other covariates that may have an effect on the variable of interest in this case adoption existence of isolation to check the robustness of the model we estimated three models using eqs 1 5 but with the following differences model 1 was estimated with the total sample 324 observations and without control variables wc pe wl wp extens area age and edu model 2 tests full isolation by estimating the empirical model with the total sample and control variables and model 3 tests systematic differences among farmers with and without previous experience with pressurized irrigation technology by restricting the sample to farmer that at t0 did not have pressurized irrigation resulting in a sample of 198 observations model fit is assessed using the comparative fit index cfi the tucker lewis index tli and the root mean squared error of approximation rmsea conventional rules establish that a model is satisfactory if the cfi and tli indices are higher than 0 9 and a model is considered excellent if the values are higher than 0 95 for both indexes for rmsea values below 0 08 are acceptable and below 0 06 are considered excellent hu and bentler 1999 kline 2015 li 2014 the model was estimated with mplus 7 4 2 variable description 4 2 1 cognitive constructs latent variables to generate the factor scores that are used in the regressions for the cognitive constructs of attitude att perceived control pc intention int and institutional trust it we use a series of statements rated on a five point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree following the guidelines and adjusted statements proposed by ajzen 1991 the literature uses cronbach s alpha to measure internal consistency and the kaiser meyer olkin kmo test to measure sampling adequacy these indicators are not reported when estimating sem in mplus hence we performed a factor analysis to validate the constructs we estimate the cronbach s alpha and the kmo observing results higher than 0 8 for att pc and int implying high internal consistency and adequacy it shows satisfactory results with a kmo of 0 73 and a cronbach s alpha of 0 83 table a2 in the appendix show results of factor analysis table 1 presents the average value of the constructs 4 2 2 observed variables observable variables were measured through direct questions in the survey for instance to measure sn we follow mobley et al 2010 by asking 1 the water community to which i belong expects me to adopt pressurized irrigation technology and 2 other farmers look favorably upon me or would look favorably upon me if i adopted modern irrigation these statements were rated on a five point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree and were averaged to deliver the variable sn networks were measured with two variables 1 netw number of the farmer s acquaintances who have adopted pressurized irrigation technologies and 2 mem participation in water organizations is a binary variable equaling 1 when the farmer was part of a water organization and 0 otherwise following grootaert 2003 gt was measured based on the statement i can trust the people around me without being too cautious using also a five point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree background information on the farmers includes land tenure area of their property years of education access to extension services water fee measured in chilean pesos paid annually by the farmer 5 5 the fee is a flat rate that is not based on the actual water quantity being used previous experience pe with pressurized irrigation take the value 1 if the farmer has had any previous experience implementing pressurized irrigation system on their farm or 0 otherwise water limitations wl 1 if the farmer has reported limitations on irrigation due to water shortages 0 otherwise and his level of water conservation awareness wc water conservation awareness is measured using the statement i would adopt modern irrigation technology because it helps to conserve water descriptive statistics of these variables are provided in table 1 5 results 5 1 descriptive statistics 5 1 1 characteristics of the sample basic sociodemographic characteristics show that the average age of the farmers is 52 76 years 91 are male and on average they have 11 57 years of schooling the baseline data show that 126 farmers 39 have previous experience with pressurized irrigation either because they have partially adopted it on their land or had it at some point in the past and 198 farmers 61 have no experience we observe that farmers who have experience with pressurized irrigation are significantly younger and have more years of schooling 13 12 years less farming experience higher area of land in tenure additional sources of income other than agriculture and a higher perception of water limitations compared to those that have no experience with pressurized irrigation systems table 1 in the case on smallholders extension services are provided free of charge by agricultural associations or by the institute for agricultural development indap of the agricultural ministry overall these services have been used by 38 of the farmers in the sample regarding land tenure most of the land is owned according to the organization of water distribution system farmers must pay their water communities a fee for the water rights they own in our sample 80 of the farmers pay an annual fee for their water right independent of consumption the yearly payment was 20 176 chilean pesos on the average which is equivalent to us 32 18 on average farmers have moderate levels of general and institutional trust with mean values of 3 58 and 3 28 on a scale of 1 5 respectively the average number of known acquaintances that use pressurized technologies is 6 and there is a significant difference between farmers who have previous experience with pressurized irrigation technology as they have almost twice the number of acquaintances compared to farmers who have no experience with irrigation technology participation in local organizations is relatively low only 23 of the sample participates in a water organization when analyzing the cognitive constructs of tpb we observe moderate intentions to adopt pressurized irrigation technologies with an average value of 3 18 on a scale of 1 5 a positive attitude with a score of 4 97 moderate subjective norm 3 39 and moderate perceived control 3 57 comparing the values of farmers with and without previous experience with pressurized irrigation there are significant differences in all these constructs with those who have previous experience reporting higher scores on all aspects the comparison between these two groups provides support for the hypotheses presented in section 2 the differences found here between the two groups regarding attitudes subjective norms perceived control intention and social capital variables are consistent with the literature and highlight the importance of considering farmers context and social environment when analyzing intentions and actual adoption behavior 5 1 2 relation between intention and actual behavior actual behavior was measured 12 months after the application of the cross sectional survey adopters are defined as those farmers who had either adopted or extended pressurized irrigation during the previous twelve months for comparison and descriptive purposes we recoded the variable intention originally measured on a likert scale from 1 5 into a dummy variable where scores of 3 take the value of 1 aggregating the responses of those farmers with declared intention to adopt pressurized irrigation in the following year and scores 3 take the value 0 6 6 the recoding of intention into a binary variable was used only for comparison in the descriptive section in the econometric analysis we used the five statements of intention as originally measured on a likert scale from 1 to 5 therefore in the econometric analysis the factor scores were used in the regression fig 3 shows that 58 of the farmers stated an intention to adopt and 17 actually adopted pressurized irrigation technology when comparing farmers with and without previous experience we find significant differences with respect to both intentions and actual behavior among farmers with previous experience 76 have the intention to adopt or expand the use of pressurized irrigation technology while only 46 of the farmers without previous experience have such intention regarding actual behavior 26 of the farmers with experience adopted the technology compared to only 11 of the farmers without experience these results support the hypothesis that knowledge can shape the attitudes and intentions of farmers 5 2 sem results as explained in section 4 we estimate three different model specifications to check the robustness of the multiple relations proposed in the theoretical framework model 1 estimates the relationships among the cognitive constructs of tpb and social capital variables without control variables model 2 estimates the relationships as in model 1 but additionally incorporates control variables to verify the assumption of isolation model 3 constrains the sample to those farmers who have not had any previous experience with pressurized irrigation technology all three models present a satisfactory fit based on the criteria formulated by hu and bentler 1999 table 2 which compare the residual differences between the fitted and the sample covariance matrices with respect to the classical tpb variables model 1 shows that attitudes subjective norms and perceived control have positive and significant effects on intention eq 4 subjective norms exhibit the highest estimated coefficient β 0 434 p 0 001 followed by perceived control β 0 280 p 0 001 and attitudes β 0 138 p 0 05 indicating that social pressure exerts a strong influence on farmers particularly in comparison to their own attitudes these results align with previous studies that have emphasized the influence of perceived social pressure on adoption renfroe et al 1990 burton 2014 all three variables together explain 43 5 of the variance in intention furthermore model 1 reveals that intention 7 7 as explained in section 4 2 1 intention is a latent variable estimated in the sem with all parameters simultaneously it considers the statements indicated in appendix a2 thus intention is a factor score with the estimates for the true latent variable scores devlieger and rosseel 2017 has a significant and positive effect on adoption eq 5 and thus confirms that intention to engage in an action is the proximal antecedent of voluntary action ajzen 2002 de leeuw et al 2015 based on these results we can corroborate hypothesis h1 that farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived control have a positive effect on intention and adoption of pressurized irrigation systems regarding the social capital variables we observe mixed results model 1 shows that institutional trust is positively related to attitudes and subjective norms while general trust is positively related to attitudes thus supporting h2 these findings imply that higher levels of trust are associated with positive perceptions of the action outcomes attitudes institutional trust can be seen as a cooperation agreement between the farmer and the institutions providing extension services and therefore farmers feel committed to act according to the social norms embodied by these institutions khalil 2003 the size of the network netw is statistically related to perceived control indicating that farmers will feel more confident about their ability to implement the technology when they are embedded in a large network of other adopters thus partially supporting h3 contrary to our expectations netw does not have significant effects on attitudes and subjective norms finally membership in water organizations has a positive effect on subjective norms which corroborates h4 model 2 which includes additional control variables generates results that are consistent with model 1 i e most of the statistical associations persist overall model 2 explains 21 3 of the variance in actual adoption behavior eq 5 previous experience pe with the technology contributes to a positive attitude to higher perceived control and intentions to adopt in the adoption equation eq 5 only physical capital and water limitations for irrigation have positive and significant effects model 3 shows consistency with the findings of model 2 for the cognitive constructs further we estimated the marginal effects of the explanatory variables on the dependent variable adoption adop including direct indirect and total effects for this purpose we use model 2 because it controls for additional covariates and presents the best goodness of fit table 3 provides the direct indirect and total marginal effects 8 8 we estimate the probit regression probabilities based on muthén and muthén 2009 of each variable on the probability of adoption adop the results show that attitudes att perceived control pc and subjective norms sn have significant indirect effects on adoption adop and that they are effectively mediated through intention membership in water organizations mem increases the probability of adoption indirectly because its effects are mediated through subjective norms this finding can be explained by the well established institutions in the chilean water code that define water community organizations as key to water management this is also reflected in the institutional trust that farmers have in these organizations higher institutional trust levels indirectly increase the likelihood of adoption through their positive effects on attitudes att with regard to control variables having water limitations wl for irrigation shows a direct effect on the adoption of irrigation technologies as expected water fee wf shows no effect on adoption adop because the payment is not dependent on water consumption to provide an incentive for more efficient water use charges must be a direct function of consumption southgate and figueroa 2006 de fraiture and perry 2007 extension services extens show a significant effect on perceived control pc but not on adoption adop physical capital area measured as farm size in hectares positively and significantly influences adoption meaning that larger farmers are more likely to adopt due to scale economies and larger capacity to bear risk diederen et al 2003 jara rojas et al 2012 finally we observe that water conservation awareness wc indirectly and positively impacts the likelihood of adoption mediated through its positive effect on attitudes and intentions 6 discussion several authors recognize the need to tie the individual s cognitive processes to the environment where s he is embedded as farmers psychological characteristics are important non economic elements of decision making edwards jones 2006 monteleone et al 2019 more interestingly our work goes deeper to show that such attitudes subjective norms networks and trust general and institutional are interconnected elements of two different frameworks that jointly explain farmers intentions to perform a specific action this finding provides insights into the associations among a large number of variables that individual models are not able to show klöckner 2013 in this sense tpb acts as a mediator to unveil a more complex interaction of interconnected internal psychological and external institutional factors that can help us understand the decision making processes underlying adoption although we are aware that a model that incorporates all factors might not be feasible our proposed model sheds light on important cognitive social capital and economic factors that affect adoption an additional contribution of our work is that it tests intention and actual behavior using a one year lifespan analysis this approach is rare in the literature and even scarcer in decisions related to the agricultural sector the results show that intention predicts actual behavior and that modeling actual behavior enables testing both direct and indirect effects of interconnected variables not only on intention but also on actual adoption farmers reported a positive attitude towards pressurized irrigation technology believing that pressurized irrigation is profitable improves crop management and increases yields this positive attitude indirectly affects adoption through intention the impact of subjective norms on intention and its indirect effect on adoption is noteworthy as is the fact that a farmer s perception of what others expect him her to do is influenced by institutional trust farmers are keen to adopt technologies that others approve of this is in line with the findings of läpple and kelley 2013 who showed that social norms and the ability and resources of the farmer limited the adoption of organic practices yet the implications of social norms go beyond social acceptance social norms define what is acceptable or unacceptable providing the basis for maintaining trust and at the same time such norms create an obligation to engage in mutual effort lyon 2000 social capital provides access to more and better information jacques et al 2018 wuepper et al 2018 hence its inclusion mediated through tpb variables gives a sense of what is affected by this access to information being a member of an association provides access to information that can shape the willingness to adopt in our results membership directly impacts the intention to adopt the technology and indirectly affects actual adoption this finding fills the gap identified by prokopy et al 2008 as our model provides evidence that membership has a positive and significant influence on intention our results also indicate that if the farmer trusts water community associations and water monitoring boards it is more likely that he she will have a higher intention to adopt modern irrigation technologies nonetheless other studies have found that trust is negatively related to decisions regarding the adoption of irrigation technology and climate change adaptation paul et al 2016 hunecke et al 2017 such contradictory results highlight the importance of understanding the relations of the elements of social capital and behavior on a case by case basis in order to design locally adapted policies overall we can see that general and institutional trust social norms and membership are relevant in explaining adoption directly or indirectly through intention despite this only 23 of the sample has had a role within local organizations this represents an opportunity to design an intervention in which local organizations promote the engagement and active participation of farmers the influence of perceived control on intention is positive and significant in our model an individual s belief in their capacity to execute the action will affect their behavioral intention how confident a farmer is in adopting pressurized irrigation depends on the people around him her who have adopted the technology as shown by the influence of networks on perceived control social networks should be strengthened and used as an instrument to increase self confidence levels among farmers as dowd et al 2014 noted strong networks make individuals feel more satisfied and confident with the amount of information they receive through their network social influences help shape a person s estimation of their confidence and capability to use a system well bhatti 1970 we measured social networks through membership and the number of farmers that have adopted so strategies should focus on encouraging an increase in membership and in the creation of discussion forums that foster interaction and therefore enlargement of the network in the estimated model we also included control variables focusing on the traditional economic incentives and restrictions that are part of the utility maximizing models the results are indeed revealing in general other than physical capital these variables do not have a significant effect on adoption meaning that socio psychological variables are capturing the effect they usually express in traditional models engler et al 2016 hence more emphasis should be placed on developing a pro adoption environment than on relaxing farmers constraints such as providing high subsidies to promote adoption key policy implications can be derived from our empirical results first attitude campaigns are not enough to influence intentions therefore policies introduced by governmental institutions could achieve better results by promoting long term changes in beliefs and social norms even a policy without any financial incentive could result in more environmentally friendly and socially responsible behavior if it were designed to strengthen self confidence and perceived social pressure czap et al 2016 second initiatives from the government could define a strategy to change the current practice the generally acceptable norm of traditional irrigation influencing farmers core beliefs associated with water conservation awareness and boosting farmers trust in water organizations that could foster cooperation could both lead to the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems as a norm klöckner 2013 third extension services should focus on transferring knowledge and information through social networks to facilitate action and increase farmers perceived self confidence about undertaking the challenge of switching from superficial to pressurized irrigation in this context such as strategy is more important than improving attitudes towards the technology 7 conclusions the objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the farmers behavioral beliefs and the effect of the social environment on such beliefs to explain adoption decisions we argued that understanding how attitudes subjective norms and perceived control affect the intention of adoption is not enough to provide useful insights for policy in doing so we proposed an integral framework that includes the cognitive components of tpb and is extended by social capital variables our results provide novel insights into the decision making process and they raise several points that can expand this line of research first decisions are a result of a dynamic process and although we capture two points in time individual intention and action it would be interesting to analyze the changes in beliefs and or social aspects in order to measure the indirect and direct effect on adoption of such aspects second as the triggers of decisions are already in motion we could also explore the impact of tpb and social capital on incremental adoption having a better understanding of the adoption path of the farmers could lead to proposing more purposeful policy incentives to increase the speed of adoption by farmers declaration of competing interest we confirm
