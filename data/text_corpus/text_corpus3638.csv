18190,sewage sludge is a primary pathway for microplastics mps entering into terrestrial ecosystems however a standardized method to analyze mp in sludge is lacking due to its high organic matter this study investigated the extraction efficiency of six mps in five solid matrices i e sewage sludge cattle manure soil sediment and silicon dioxide results show lower extraction efficiency of 87 2 for mps in sludge compared with that in other matrices especially polyethylene terephthalate pet only 27 8 the possible reason was that the presence of extracellular polymeric substances within the sludge hinders the mps to float therefore five protocols i e hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fenton nitric acid hno3 hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were used to pretreat the sludge and optimize the mp extraction the sludge pretreated by h2o2 fenton and 1 m of acids had higher mp extraction efficiency than the raw sludge due to higher extraction of the pet the mp extraction efficiency in the sludge first increased and subsequently decreased with the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod content implying that moderate dissolution of sludge organic matter is beneficial to the mp extraction quantitative analysis of the changes in the mp physicochemical characteristics after the pretreatments indicated that polyamide pa and pet are not resistant to acid and alkali treatment respectively principal component analysis shows that the effect of pretreatments on the mps follows a decreasing sequence alkali high concentration of acids low concentration of acids h2o2 and fenton additionally the susceptibility of the mps to the pretreatments follows a decreasing sequence pet pa and polymethyl methacrylate pmma polystyrene ps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp the findings supply novel insights into the effect of chemical pretreatments on mp extraction in sewage sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics wastewater treatment plants sewage sludge microplastic extraction chemical pretreatment physicochemical property 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are a significant point source of microplastics mps in the environment in recent years mason et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 sun et al 2019 however only a small amount of mps in wastewater is directly discharged into the aquatic environment and more than 98 of the mps are trapped in sewage sludge resulting in high concentrations of mps in the sludge carr et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 found that the mp contents in the sludge from the wwtps in the netherlands reach 4196 15385 particles kg 1 dry sludge lassen 2015 reported a mps concentration of 1000 24 000 particles kg 1 dry sludge in germany li et al 2018 found an average mp contents of 22 7 12 1 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge in china the total amount of mps inputted into the soil via land and agricultural use of sludge in europe north america and china can reach 63 000 430 000 tons 44 000 300 000 tons and 1 56 1014 particles per year respectively nizzetto et al 2016 once mps are introduced into the soil and accumulated to a certain extent they will affect soil properties soil functions and biodiversity and cause potential damage to terrestrial ecosystems he et al 2018 therefore mp pollution in sludge and its potential environmental risks need more attention until now our knowledge about the mps in sewage sludge is limited probably due to the lack of standardized methods for the mp analysis which are a prerequisite to effectively characterize the environmental behavior of the mps currently the extraction of mps in sludge mainly refers to the method used in the sediment system i e the separation of light target components from heavy impurity components using density separation mahon et al 2017 nevertheless the extraction efficiency of mps from sludge is not often satisfactory at present especially for fibrous mps lares et al 2019 sludge contains high concentrations of organic particles bacterial micelles and filamentous bacteria produced in the sewage treatment process all of which are encapsulated in a network structure composed of extracellular polymeric substances eps bala subramanian et al 2010 eps are an important component of activated sludge flocs which are widely distributed in the inner and outer layers of flocs and have an important influence on sludge flocculation sedimentation and dewatering performance bala subramanian et al 2010 thus mps may be also embedded in the sludge flocs by the eps thus affecting the mps floating velocity in addition flocculants are widely used in wwtps to improve dewatering and sedimentation performance of sludge dai et al 2014 hence it is hypothesized that the low extraction efficiency of mps in sludge may be related to the eps and flocculants and thus leading to the complication of extraction methods for sludge based mps at present sludge pretreatment processes are widely used to promote the breakdown of eps and microbial cell walls of sludge cells to improve sludge energy conversion and for dewatering zhen et al 2017 therefore the sludge pretreatment may be able to optimize mp extraction by removing the negative impact of eps chemical pretreatment methods are widely applied because of their high processing speed and treatment efficiency carrere et al 2010 which can be divided into two major categories acid alkali treatment and oxidation treatment the ph is adjusted through adding acid or alkali reagents to the excess sludge a lower ph can destroy the floc structure of the microorganisms while a higher ph can effectively dissolve and destroy the cell wall and cell membrane torres and llorens 2008 meanwhile to facilitate mp quantification and identification hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fenton alkaline and acid pretreatments have been used to remove organic matter and purify the mps hurley et al 2018 lares et al 2019 sun et al 2019 although hurley et al 2018 suggested that the ordering of the analytical procedure organic matter removal followed by density separation and vice versa has no significant effect on the recovery of the different mps the information about the effect of chemical pretreatments on the mp extraction in sewage sludge is limited additionally mp physicochemical property may be affected during the process of sludge pretreatment nuelle et al 2014 noted that h2o2 has an effect on the polymer and causes a decrease in surface area of the polymer polyamide pa particles were destroyed after treated by h2o2 at 70 c hurley et al 2018 in contrast tagg et al 2015 demonstrated that fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra of the mps remain unchanged and their surface properties are not affected after seven days of exposure of the samples to h2o2 30 most mps have almost no change in size during the oxidation process nuelle et al 2014 the above results are based on the qualitative analysis using scanning electron microscopy sem and or ftir which may not properly reflect the effect of pretreatment on the mp surface properties due to their high subjectivity and low sensitivity zhang et al 2018 found enhanced adsorption for oxytetracycline in the beached foams compared with that in the virgin foams which may not be visually reflected on the sem image therefore quantitative indicators like adsorption potentials of mps were used to assess the impact of pretreatments in this study in order to fully understand their effect the objectives of this study are to 1 verify extraction efficiency of mps in the sludge and explore the reasons for limiting the mp extraction 2 improve the mp extraction in sludge through chemical pretreatments such as acid alkali and oxidation treatments 3 and evaluate the effect of the pretreatments on the mp physicochemical properties using various techniques such as ftir sem mass size loss and adsorption potentials to cd 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents five solid matrices i e sewage sludge cattle manure soil sediment and silicon dioxide sio2 were used for mp extraction other four matrices were selected to favorably analyze possible reasons for limiting mp extraction in the sludge sewage sludge was collected from a wwtp in shanghai china cattle manure samples were obtained from a cattle farm in zaozhuang shandong province china soil samples were collected from a farm in qingpu district shanghai china sediment samples were gained from hongguang river along shanghai university in shanghai china and sio2 samples were taken from jingyou sand co ltd in anhui province china physicochemical properties of the five samples including total solids ts content volatile solids vs ts ph electrical conductivity and eps content were analyzed the detailed methods and results of the analyses are outlined in the supporting information si and table s1 of the si polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyamide pa polymethyl methacrylate pmma and polyethylene terephthalate pet ranging from 270 to 550 μm were obtained through cutting the corresponding plastic products and sieving the sample colors were distinct to facilitate their measurement they are blue yellow white red black and green respectively the density of mps is provided in table s2 of the si all metal standard solutions and standard bovine serum albumin were purchased from aladdin industrial corp shanghai china other reagents are analytically pure and were obtained from sinopharm group corp shanghai china 2 2 mp extraction in five matrices thirty particles of each kind of plastic and a total of 180 polymer particles were added to 30 g of each solid matrix for each replicate the mp shapes were granular except for pet which was fibrous the mp particles were thoroughly mixed into the solid matrices for 24 h then the mps were extracted using a two step method hurley et al 2018 in the first step 30 g of a solid matrix was added to an erlenmeyer flask with 300 ml deionized water in which sodium chloride had been added to saturation 1 2 g cm 3 li et al 2018 after stirring for 15 min the mixture was allowed to settle for 2 h then the liquid supernatant was filtered in a vacuum filtration unit using a stainless steel sieve with a pore size of 37 μm in the second step zinc chloride solution zncl2 1 6 1 7 g cm 3 was used to extract higher density mps and the same settling and vacuum procedures were conducted as described above after the extraction the polymer particles were separately counted the tests were carried out in triplicate in all the steps of sample processing the openings were wrapped with an aluminum foil to avoid contamination with other polymer particles synthetic clothing was avoided and the work surface was cleaned with alcohol before use when analyzing the filter paper a blank piece of filter paper was placed under open laboratory conditions to assess the possibility of ambient air pollution 2 3 floating velocity of mps in the presence of eps and flocculant fibrous and granular pets as representative mps were used to test the effect of eps and flocculant on the mp floating velocity during the extraction process an eps solution was prepared using bovine serum albumin and sodium alginate in which the protein content was 80 mg l 1 and the polysaccharide content was 100 mg l 1 priyananda and chen 2006 polyacrylamide pam was chosen as a representative flocculant 0 1 g l 1 pam the floating velocities of the two pets were measured in the following three solutions 1 a zncl2 solution 2 a zncl2 eps solution and 3 a zncl2 eps pam solution the content of zncl2 in the solutions was same as described above the tests were carried out in a settling column with a diameter of 60 mm and a height of 800 mm the column was filled with the simulated solution to a height of 700 mm the device diagram is shown in fig s1 of the si kowalski et al 2016 one polymer particle was used for each test the time elapsed during the particle floating from the bottom of the column to the top was recorded floating velocity of the particle was gained through the height of the solution over the time each test was conducted five to eight times 2 4 pretreatment experiment five main protocols i e h2o2 30 fenton nitric acid hno3 1 m and 5 m hydrochloric acid hcl 1 m and 5 m sodium hydroxide naoh 1 m 5 m and 10 m were selected according to the review of current study hurley et al 2018 sun et al 2019 the selection of the protocols are detailed in the si they were marked as 1 2 3a 3b 4a 4b 5a 5b and 5c respectively to evaluate the effect of the pretreatments on the extraction efficiency of the mps and the dissolution of organic matter in sewage sludge 30 particles of each mp were added to 30 g of sewage sludge wet weight and thoroughly mixed then 30 ml of each pretreatment reagent was added to the mixture and reacted at 60 c for 24 h sujathan et al 2017 the pretreated samples of h2o2 and fenton were placed in a cold bath in the early stage of the reaction to control the temperature at 60 c after the reaction the mp extraction in the pretreated sludge was proceeded as described in section 2 2 meanwhile the pretreated sludge was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was used for soluble chemical oxygen demand scod analysis the control was conducted the same procedure with the deionized water in addition to investigate the effect of the pretreatments on the mp properties 1 g of each mp was added to 50 ml of each reagent after pretreatment at 60 c for 24 h the reaction solution was filtered using vacuum filtration and the plastic particles were washed with deionized water for 15 min and then placed in a clean petri dish the particles were applied for the following analysis after air dried at room temperature 2 5 mp physicochemical analysis sem analysis was conducted using hitachi su 1500 sem hitachi high technologies corp japan to detect any changes in the surface structures of the mps before and after pretreatment ftir spectra were obtained through a nico 380 mx ftir spectrometer using an attenuated total reflectance module thermo fisher scientific inc usa the carbonyl index ci was used to represent the degree of weathering and surface oxidation of mps which was defined as the ratio of the carbonyl absorption intensity around 1870 1650 cm 1 to an internal constant band liu et al 2019 song et al 2017 the details are provided in table s3 of the si the mp mass was measured using the gravimetric method hurley et al 2018 while the size was determined using a stemi 508 stereomicroscope carl zeiss jena germany that was equipped with a high definition electronic microscope and scaleplate the mp adsorption potential to cd iron was evaluated according to our previous study li et al 2019 the adsorption was carried out in a centrifuge tube containing 0 1 g of mp particles and 10 ml of 10 mg l 1 metal solution the blank group was carried out in the same metal solution using the same procedure but without mp particles the metal concentration in the filtrate was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes and the metal content adsorbed onto the mps was calculated through the difference in cd concentration of the filtrate between the test and blank groups each test was run in triplicate the mp zeta potentials were estimated using a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd england 2 6 statistical analysis all the data in this study were the mean values standard deviation sd of replicas statistical analysis was accomplished using the spss 19 0 program significant differences among the tests were analyzed through one way analysis of variance anova followed by duncan s multiple range test nine kinds of pretreatment and six types of mps were categorized using a principal component analysis pca based on the changes in the mass size ci adsorption to cd and the zeta potentials of the mps after the pretreatments the data of these changes are estimated as equation 1 1 p v a v c v c 100 in which p is the change of the mp after the pretreatment v a is the value of the pretreated mp and v c is the value of the corresponding virgin mp 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction efficiency of mps in sludge and the effect of eps as shown in fig 1 a extraction efficiency of the mps in the sludge 87 2 was significantly lower than that in other four matrices implying that sludge has a low mp extraction efficiency corresponding to the previous study hurley et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 reported that the average extraction efficiency of pe particles and pet fibers in the sludge 85 57 is lower than that in soil about 90 the mp extraction efficiency in the sediment can reach more than 95 yu et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 the physicochemical characteristics of the five matrices were further investigated to identify possible mechanism responsible for the low mp extraction in the sludge the results were shown in table s1 of the si the sludge had the highest eps contents in all of the matrices implying that the eps may be an important factor limiting the mp extraction in the sludge manara and zabaniotou 2012 reported that sludge is a viscous substance cross linked by eps and has a high affinity for most polymer surfaces jorand et al 1998 reported that the protein in eps contributes to the sludge s hydrophobicity which is mainly made up of hydrophobic amino acids thus causing the entrapment of hydrophobic mps in the sludge floc polysaccharides in eps with a high molecular weight 100 kda have a long carbon skeleton structure with active side chains leading to high flocculation of the eps yin et al 2015 they trap the mps in the sludge floc causing the floating mp particles to sink cole et al 2016 long et al 2015 and thus hampering the mp extraction in sludge the extraction efficiencies of the six mps in the five matrices are shown in fig 1b pet had the lowest extraction efficiency of all the mps the shape of the pet samples used in this study was fibrous different from with the other plastics which had a granular shape indicating that the mp shape has an effect on the mp extraction efficiency lares et al 2019 suggested that pet fibers are more flexible than other fibers enabling them to pass through sieves more easily the dimensions and shapes of mp fibers are not symmetrical and thus they are difficult to collect from environment samples by sieving compared with the other matrices sludge had the lowest extraction efficiency of pets only 27 8 that significantly contributed to low total extraction efficiency of the mps in the sludge the possible reason was that the microfibers are more easily entangled with sludge organic matter to form compact and rigid structures compared with the mp particles bayo et al 2016 schmiedgruber et al 2019 found that the vast majory of mp fibers approximatly 99 are found to associate with the sludge floc a simulation experiment was conducted to complement and confirm the effect of eps on the extraction efficiency of granular and fibrous mps in the sludge compared with the zncl2 solution the floating velocity of granular and fibrous pet in the zncl2 eps solution decreased from 1 34 cm s 1 to 1 28 cm s 1 and 0 75 cm s 1 to 0 57 cm s 1 respectively fig 2 anova shows that the difference is insignificant for granular pet p 0 05 but significant for fibrous pet p 0 05 indicating that the eps have a significantly negative impact on the fibrous mp extraction compared with the zncl2 eps solution the zncl2 eps pam solution has a lower floating velocity for the two pets but the differences are insignificant p 0 05 implying that the pam has a negligible effect on the mp floating velocity in the presence of eps in addition the granular pet has a significantly higher floating velocity than the fibrous pet in all the three solution the results indicate that the granular mps are more easily extracted compared with the fibrous mps and the eps have a significantly negative impact on the extraction of fibrous mps 3 2 effect of pretreatment on mp extraction and organic matter dissolution as shown in fig 3 a total extraction efficiencies of the mps in the sludge pretreated by h2o2 fenton 1 m hno3 and 1 m hcl were higher than those in raw sludge but the extraction efficiencies by 5 m hno3 5 m hcl 1 m naoh and 5 m naoh were lower the results indicate that pretreatments of oxidation and low concentration acids can improve the mp extraction in the sludge by 2 9 7 6 while other pretreatments cannot compared with raw sludge further analysis found that the pretreatments caused little changes in the extraction efficiencies of pe pp ps and pmma except for 5 m naoh fig 3b compared with raw sludge the extraction efficiency of pa was reduced in the sludge pretreated by 5 m hno3 and hcl because nylon is not resistant to strong acids avio et al 2015 dehaut et al 2016 the extraction efficiency of pet fibers increased by 40 144 after pretreatments using h2o2 fenton 1 m of hno3 and hcl but decreased using 5 m of hno3 and hcl and all alkali corresponding to the results from the total mp extraction efficiency fig 3a the results indicate that the pretreatments have an important influence on the extraction of pet fibers in sludge and thus on the total mp extraction efficiency the effect of the pretreatments on the release of the organic matter in the sludge was further investigated since the above results show that the eps and sludge floc have significantly negative impacts on the mp extraction in this study scod were used to reflect disintegration degree of sludge organic matter xiao et al 2015 compared with raw sludge rs all of the pretreated sludge had higher scod contents fig 4 a implying that the pretreatments promote the dissolution of sludge organic matter the extraction efficiencies of the total mps and pet fibers initially increased and then decreased as the scod content fig 4b and c similar phenomena are also found between sludge dissolution degree and its dewaterability yu et al 2009 yuan et al 2011 at a low scod content by h2o2 and fenton the floc structure may be disrupted because the eps are released into the aqueous phase zhang et al 2012 but the microbial cells were not destroyed due to the relatively minimal change yu et al 2009 yuan et al 2011 this caused the release of the mps from the sludge floc and improved the mp extraction however under a higher concentration acid alkali the microbial cell walls are prone to swelling and rupture and then intracellular protein and carbohydrates are released to the aqueous phase liu et al 2009 causing high scod content excessive chemical action may cause the released substances to form functional groups such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups leading to reflocculation of the cracked sludge zhang et al 2007 and the mps additionally small molecules from the dissolution of the sludge organic matter may adhere to the mp surface kowalski et al 2016 hindering their natural floating therefore proper disintegration of the sludge organic matter is vital for improving the mp extraction especially for pet fibers the findings need to be further verified using the same chemical reagents under different concentrations as different chemical pretreatments may have different mechanisms of organic matter disruption and other influences on the mp extraction for example in the alkaline pretreatment zncl2 used in the two step extraction will forms a precipitate due to the reaction of zn2 and hydroxyl ions which may be not beneficial for mp flotation 3 3 effect of pretreatment on mp properties sem analysis showed that the mp surface morphologies are slightly rough and broken after alkaline pretreatments figs s2 s7 of the si especially for pets implying that the alkaline pretreatments have significant impacts on the mp surface properties compared with other pretreatments the h2o2 and fenton pretreatments caused a hardly change in the sem graphs of the mps indicating that the oxidative treatments have little effect on the surface morphology of the mps avio et al 2015 sujathan et al 2017 meanwhile the ftir spectra of the pretreated mps showed no significant difference in the surface functional groups from the virgin samples figs s8 s10 of the si in addition to pa groups by 5 m of acid solution without available spectra although sem and ftir are widely used to evaluate effect of the pretreatments on the mp properties using them alone may not allow us to fully understand the pretreatments influence due to their limited qualitative information therefore quantitative indicators such as the mass size ci adsorption potential of cd and zeta potentials were used to systematically evaluate the mp changes after the pretreatments in this study table 1 shows the changes in mass and size of the six mps after the chemical pretreatments it is suggested that the mass or size loss rates of more than 5 are valid changes and those of less than 5 are caused by the experimental errors eight data points with valid changes were found in the mp mass analysis while 20 data points in the size analysis the results indicate that changes in the mp size are more sensitive to the effect of the pretreatments compared with the mass the mass and size of pa were reduced by 100 after the pretreatment by 5 m of hno3 and hcl similar results were also found in other studies avio et al 2015 dehaut et al 2016 as the high concentration acid solution caused the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in pa molecules the mass and size of pet decreased by 30 2 53 5 and 9 4 16 7 after the alkali pretreatments respectively the possible reason was that the saponification reaction occurs in ester linkages of pet with the alkali during alkaline pretreatment thus causing a significant decrease in the pet mass hurley et al 2018 ci is often used to quantitatively describe surface alteration properties of the mps during aging process hüffer et al 2018 liu et al 2019 müller et al 2018 as shown in table s4 of the si virgin pet had higher ci values than virgin pmma and pa followed by virgin ps pp and pe showing that the ci values are significantly dependent on the mp types in general the ci values of the pretreated mps increased with varying degree compared with the virgin mps implying that the chemical pretreatments cause surface aging of the mps in accordance with the previous results from uv aging hüffer et al 2018 liu et al 2019 müller et al 2018 compared with other pretreatments the alkaline pretreatments led to higher aging for pp ps pa and pet and the oxidation pretreatments h2o2 and fenton caused less aging for all the mps corresponding to the results of the mass and size liu et al 2019 also found that the alteration degree of fenton for pe and ps is lower than that of heat activated k2s2o8 system according to the ci values the changing ci degree of the six pretreated mps followed a decreasing order pet pmma and pa ps pp pe implying that the chemical composition and inherent structures of polymers affect their alteration properties the polymers with higher oxygen containing groups and higher molecular weight monomers seem more liable to aging under the chemical pretreatment due to easier penetration of oxygen lv et al 2017 researchers also reported that the ci values surface weathering of pe pp and ps have the different changes as the uv exposure duration due to their different chemical structures liu et al 2019 song et al 2017 in this study cd was used as representative metal to evaluate the effect of chemical pretreatment on mp adsorption potentials li et al 2019 and the results are shown in fig 5 compared with virgin mps the cd adsorption on the six corresponding mps pretreated by the alkaline solution significantly increased particularly the cd adsorption of pet pretreated by 10 m naoh reached nearly 148 times that of the virgin one the results imply that the alkaline pretreatment has a significant impact on the vector effect of mps to pollutants the possible reason was that the alkaline pretreatment brings more hydroxyl functional groups on the mp surface thus promoting the adsorption of mps to cations to achieve balanced surface charges turner and holmes 2015 as shown in fig s11 of the si the zeta potentials of the mps significantly decreased after alkaline pretreatments confirming an increase in the negative charge on the mp surfaces unlike the alkaline pretreatment the acid and oxidation pretreatments changed the mp adsorption potentials with a low degree except for pmma and pa by acid pretreatment implying that they exert little impact on the vector effects of the mps the pa adsorption potential decreased significantly after the acid pretreatment possibly attributed to the positive hydrogen ions being attracted to the negatively charged surface of the mps melo et al 2013 thus competing with cd for the mp adsorption sites compared with the virgin pa zeta potential of the pa pretreated by the acid solution increased complementing and confirming the results of the adsorption potentials fig s11 of the si additionally the pretreated pmma and pet had higher adsorption potentials of cd than the corresponding virgin mps respectively possibly ascribed to the significant increase in the ci values after the pretreatment table s4 of the si yang et al 2019 found a positive correlation between the cu adsorption capacities and the number of carbonyl groups of the mps pca was conducted according to the five quantitative indicators of the mps in order to comprehensively understand the effect of the pretreatments as shown in fig 6 a the pretreatments were classified into four main categories category p1 1 m 5 m and 10 m naoh category p2 5 m hno3 and hcl category p3 1 m hno3 and hcl and category p4 h2o2 and fenton the above results imply that the effect of the pretreatments on the mps follows a decreasing sequence category p1 category p2 category p3 category p4 in general all of the alkaline pretreatments produced a strong effect on most of the mp physicochemical characteristics and types especially for adsorption potentials and pa and pet were more susceptible to alkali treatment than other mps unlike alkaline pretreatments high concentration acid pretreatments had a higher effect on mps than low concentration ones especially for pa as shown in fig 6b the six mps are divided into three main categories category m1 pet pa and pmma category m2 ps and category m3 pe and pp the above results indicate that the resistance of the mps to the chemical pretreatments tends to increase as following category m1 category m2 category m3 the mps in category m1 share the characteristics with polar carbonyl group and heteroatoms in the main chain which are different from ps pe and pp solely built of carbon atoms and thus are potentially susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage of e g ester or amide bonds gewert et al 2015 according to the glass transition temperatures ps belongs to glassy plastics while pe and pp pertain to rubbery plastics alimi et al 2018 teuten et al 2009 researchers found that glassy polymers possess dense structures and closed internal nanoscale pores teuten et al 2009 the presence of nanoscale pores may be conducive for chemical materials to attack on the ps carbon backbone during the pretreatment kelkar et al 2019 reported that ps is less resistant to chlorination than pp and pe as the presence of plastic additives promotes the direct attack by chlorine the results indicate that different chemical pretreatments exert different influences on the different mps overall the application of h2o2 and fenton pretreatments will induce the lowest effect on the physiochemical properties of pp and pe 3 4 limitations of this study this study investigates various chemical pretreatments that have widely been used but have lacked the evaluations of physical and biological methods a gentler pretreatment should be sought out in the future to optimize the extraction efficiency and reduce the effects on the extracted mps enzyme pretreatment are able to eliminate more than 97 of biomaterial from seawater and biota during the purification process of mps cole et al 2014 löder et al 2017 however it is unknown whether enzyme pretreatment can effectively improve the mp extraction in the sludge due to the complex composition of sludge organic matter although protease and polysaccharase have been used in sludge pretreatment to accelerate the hydrolysis process luo et al 2019 meanwhile some physical pretreatments such as ultrasonic waves constitute mature sludge decomposition technologies that contribute to the decomposition of sludge flocs and the release of intercellular substances zhen et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to further evaluate the effects of physical and biological pretreatments and their combination on mp extraction and physicochemical characteristics in addition the mps used in this study were virgin commercial plastics and not derived from the practical sewage sludge previous research reported that the surface characteristics of virgin and sludge based mps are different li et al 2019 and thus the results of this study need to be further verified for the sludge based mps 4 conclusions compared with the other solid matrices sewage sludge showed the lowest mp extraction efficiency especially for pet the possible reason was that the eps in the sludge floc produce a negative effect on the extraction of mps by hindering their floating part of chemical pretreatments such as h2o2 and fenton can improve the mp extraction in sludge through the disintegration of the floc structure and the release of organic matter at proper degree high concentration acid and alkaline pretreatments cause excessive dissolution of the sludge organic matter which decreases the mp extraction efficiency the pretreatments affect the mp property such as size surface morphology and adsorption potentials especially for alkaline pretreatments compared with the pe pp and ps solely built of carbon atoms the pet and pa with heteroatoms in their main chains are more susceptible to chemical pretreatments therefore an underestimate for mp abundance or an alteration of their real physicochemical properties in sludge and other matrices may happen if improper pretreatments are used in the mp extraction further investigation needs to be conducted in order to discover more effective and gentler pretreatments for mp extraction in sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

murphy et al 2016 sun et al 2019 however only a small amount of mps in wastewater is directly discharged into the aquatic environment and more than 98 of the mps are trapped in sewage sludge resulting in high concentrations of mps in the sludge carr et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 found that the mp contents in the sludge from the wwtps in the netherlands reach 4196 15385 particles kg 1 dry sludge lassen 2015 reported a mps concentration of 1000 24 000 particles kg 1 dry sludge in germany li et al 2018 found an average mp contents of 22 7 12 1 103 particles kg 1 dry sludge in china the total amount of mps inputted into the soil via land and agricultural use of sludge in europe north america and china can reach 63 000 430 000 tons 44 000 300 000 tons and 1 56 1014 particles per year respectively nizzetto et al 2016 once mps are introduced into the soil and accumulated to a certain extent they will affect soil properties soil functions and biodiversity and cause potential damage to terrestrial ecosystems he et al 2018 therefore mp pollution in sludge and its potential environmental risks need more attention until now our knowledge about the mps in sewage sludge is limited probably due to the lack of standardized methods for the mp analysis which are a prerequisite to effectively characterize the environmental behavior of the mps currently the extraction of mps in sludge mainly refers to the method used in the sediment system i e the separation of light target components from heavy impurity components using density separation mahon et al 2017 nevertheless the extraction efficiency of mps from sludge is not often satisfactory at present especially for fibrous mps lares et al 2019 sludge contains high concentrations of organic particles bacterial micelles and filamentous bacteria produced in the sewage treatment process all of which are encapsulated in a network structure composed of extracellular polymeric substances eps bala subramanian et al 2010 eps are an important component of activated sludge flocs which are widely distributed in the inner and outer layers of flocs and have an important influence on sludge flocculation sedimentation and dewatering performance bala subramanian et al 2010 thus mps may be also embedded in the sludge flocs by the eps thus affecting the mps floating velocity in addition flocculants are widely used in wwtps to improve dewatering and sedimentation performance of sludge dai et al 2014 hence it is hypothesized that the low extraction efficiency of mps in sludge may be related to the eps and flocculants and thus leading to the complication of extraction methods for sludge based mps at present sludge pretreatment processes are widely used to promote the breakdown of eps and microbial cell walls of sludge cells to improve sludge energy conversion and for dewatering zhen et al 2017 therefore the sludge pretreatment may be able to optimize mp extraction by removing the negative impact of eps chemical pretreatment methods are widely applied because of their high processing speed and treatment efficiency carrere et al 2010 which can be divided into two major categories acid alkali treatment and oxidation treatment the ph is adjusted through adding acid or alkali reagents to the excess sludge a lower ph can destroy the floc structure of the microorganisms while a higher ph can effectively dissolve and destroy the cell wall and cell membrane torres and llorens 2008 meanwhile to facilitate mp quantification and identification hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fenton alkaline and acid pretreatments have been used to remove organic matter and purify the mps hurley et al 2018 lares et al 2019 sun et al 2019 although hurley et al 2018 suggested that the ordering of the analytical procedure organic matter removal followed by density separation and vice versa has no significant effect on the recovery of the different mps the information about the effect of chemical pretreatments on the mp extraction in sewage sludge is limited additionally mp physicochemical property may be affected during the process of sludge pretreatment nuelle et al 2014 noted that h2o2 has an effect on the polymer and causes a decrease in surface area of the polymer polyamide pa particles were destroyed after treated by h2o2 at 70 c hurley et al 2018 in contrast tagg et al 2015 demonstrated that fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra of the mps remain unchanged and their surface properties are not affected after seven days of exposure of the samples to h2o2 30 most mps have almost no change in size during the oxidation process nuelle et al 2014 the above results are based on the qualitative analysis using scanning electron microscopy sem and or ftir which may not properly reflect the effect of pretreatment on the mp surface properties due to their high subjectivity and low sensitivity zhang et al 2018 found enhanced adsorption for oxytetracycline in the beached foams compared with that in the virgin foams which may not be visually reflected on the sem image therefore quantitative indicators like adsorption potentials of mps were used to assess the impact of pretreatments in this study in order to fully understand their effect the objectives of this study are to 1 verify extraction efficiency of mps in the sludge and explore the reasons for limiting the mp extraction 2 improve the mp extraction in sludge through chemical pretreatments such as acid alkali and oxidation treatments 3 and evaluate the effect of the pretreatments on the mp physicochemical properties using various techniques such as ftir sem mass size loss and adsorption potentials to cd 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents five solid matrices i e sewage sludge cattle manure soil sediment and silicon dioxide sio2 were used for mp extraction other four matrices were selected to favorably analyze possible reasons for limiting mp extraction in the sludge sewage sludge was collected from a wwtp in shanghai china cattle manure samples were obtained from a cattle farm in zaozhuang shandong province china soil samples were collected from a farm in qingpu district shanghai china sediment samples were gained from hongguang river along shanghai university in shanghai china and sio2 samples were taken from jingyou sand co ltd in anhui province china physicochemical properties of the five samples including total solids ts content volatile solids vs ts ph electrical conductivity and eps content were analyzed the detailed methods and results of the analyses are outlined in the supporting information si and table s1 of the si polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyamide pa polymethyl methacrylate pmma and polyethylene terephthalate pet ranging from 270 to 550 μm were obtained through cutting the corresponding plastic products and sieving the sample colors were distinct to facilitate their measurement they are blue yellow white red black and green respectively the density of mps is provided in table s2 of the si all metal standard solutions and standard bovine serum albumin were purchased from aladdin industrial corp shanghai china other reagents are analytically pure and were obtained from sinopharm group corp shanghai china 2 2 mp extraction in five matrices thirty particles of each kind of plastic and a total of 180 polymer particles were added to 30 g of each solid matrix for each replicate the mp shapes were granular except for pet which was fibrous the mp particles were thoroughly mixed into the solid matrices for 24 h then the mps were extracted using a two step method hurley et al 2018 in the first step 30 g of a solid matrix was added to an erlenmeyer flask with 300 ml deionized water in which sodium chloride had been added to saturation 1 2 g cm 3 li et al 2018 after stirring for 15 min the mixture was allowed to settle for 2 h then the liquid supernatant was filtered in a vacuum filtration unit using a stainless steel sieve with a pore size of 37 μm in the second step zinc chloride solution zncl2 1 6 1 7 g cm 3 was used to extract higher density mps and the same settling and vacuum procedures were conducted as described above after the extraction the polymer particles were separately counted the tests were carried out in triplicate in all the steps of sample processing the openings were wrapped with an aluminum foil to avoid contamination with other polymer particles synthetic clothing was avoided and the work surface was cleaned with alcohol before use when analyzing the filter paper a blank piece of filter paper was placed under open laboratory conditions to assess the possibility of ambient air pollution 2 3 floating velocity of mps in the presence of eps and flocculant fibrous and granular pets as representative mps were used to test the effect of eps and flocculant on the mp floating velocity during the extraction process an eps solution was prepared using bovine serum albumin and sodium alginate in which the protein content was 80 mg l 1 and the polysaccharide content was 100 mg l 1 priyananda and chen 2006 polyacrylamide pam was chosen as a representative flocculant 0 1 g l 1 pam the floating velocities of the two pets were measured in the following three solutions 1 a zncl2 solution 2 a zncl2 eps solution and 3 a zncl2 eps pam solution the content of zncl2 in the solutions was same as described above the tests were carried out in a settling column with a diameter of 60 mm and a height of 800 mm the column was filled with the simulated solution to a height of 700 mm the device diagram is shown in fig s1 of the si kowalski et al 2016 one polymer particle was used for each test the time elapsed during the particle floating from the bottom of the column to the top was recorded floating velocity of the particle was gained through the height of the solution over the time each test was conducted five to eight times 2 4 pretreatment experiment five main protocols i e h2o2 30 fenton nitric acid hno3 1 m and 5 m hydrochloric acid hcl 1 m and 5 m sodium hydroxide naoh 1 m 5 m and 10 m were selected according to the review of current study hurley et al 2018 sun et al 2019 the selection of the protocols are detailed in the si they were marked as 1 2 3a 3b 4a 4b 5a 5b and 5c respectively to evaluate the effect of the pretreatments on the extraction efficiency of the mps and the dissolution of organic matter in sewage sludge 30 particles of each mp were added to 30 g of sewage sludge wet weight and thoroughly mixed then 30 ml of each pretreatment reagent was added to the mixture and reacted at 60 c for 24 h sujathan et al 2017 the pretreated samples of h2o2 and fenton were placed in a cold bath in the early stage of the reaction to control the temperature at 60 c after the reaction the mp extraction in the pretreated sludge was proceeded as described in section 2 2 meanwhile the pretreated sludge was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was used for soluble chemical oxygen demand scod analysis the control was conducted the same procedure with the deionized water in addition to investigate the effect of the pretreatments on the mp properties 1 g of each mp was added to 50 ml of each reagent after pretreatment at 60 c for 24 h the reaction solution was filtered using vacuum filtration and the plastic particles were washed with deionized water for 15 min and then placed in a clean petri dish the particles were applied for the following analysis after air dried at room temperature 2 5 mp physicochemical analysis sem analysis was conducted using hitachi su 1500 sem hitachi high technologies corp japan to detect any changes in the surface structures of the mps before and after pretreatment ftir spectra were obtained through a nico 380 mx ftir spectrometer using an attenuated total reflectance module thermo fisher scientific inc usa the carbonyl index ci was used to represent the degree of weathering and surface oxidation of mps which was defined as the ratio of the carbonyl absorption intensity around 1870 1650 cm 1 to an internal constant band liu et al 2019 song et al 2017 the details are provided in table s3 of the si the mp mass was measured using the gravimetric method hurley et al 2018 while the size was determined using a stemi 508 stereomicroscope carl zeiss jena germany that was equipped with a high definition electronic microscope and scaleplate the mp adsorption potential to cd iron was evaluated according to our previous study li et al 2019 the adsorption was carried out in a centrifuge tube containing 0 1 g of mp particles and 10 ml of 10 mg l 1 metal solution the blank group was carried out in the same metal solution using the same procedure but without mp particles the metal concentration in the filtrate was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes and the metal content adsorbed onto the mps was calculated through the difference in cd concentration of the filtrate between the test and blank groups each test was run in triplicate the mp zeta potentials were estimated using a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd england 2 6 statistical analysis all the data in this study were the mean values standard deviation sd of replicas statistical analysis was accomplished using the spss 19 0 program significant differences among the tests were analyzed through one way analysis of variance anova followed by duncan s multiple range test nine kinds of pretreatment and six types of mps were categorized using a principal component analysis pca based on the changes in the mass size ci adsorption to cd and the zeta potentials of the mps after the pretreatments the data of these changes are estimated as equation 1 1 p v a v c v c 100 in which p is the change of the mp after the pretreatment v a is the value of the pretreated mp and v c is the value of the corresponding virgin mp 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction efficiency of mps in sludge and the effect of eps as shown in fig 1 a extraction efficiency of the mps in the sludge 87 2 was significantly lower than that in other four matrices implying that sludge has a low mp extraction efficiency corresponding to the previous study hurley et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 reported that the average extraction efficiency of pe particles and pet fibers in the sludge 85 57 is lower than that in soil about 90 the mp extraction efficiency in the sediment can reach more than 95 yu et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 the physicochemical characteristics of the five matrices were further investigated to identify possible mechanism responsible for the low mp extraction in the sludge the results were shown in table s1 of the si the sludge had the highest eps contents in all of the matrices implying that the eps may be an important factor limiting the mp extraction in the sludge manara and zabaniotou 2012 reported that sludge is a viscous substance cross linked by eps and has a high affinity for most polymer surfaces jorand et al 1998 reported that the protein in eps contributes to the sludge s hydrophobicity which is mainly made up of hydrophobic amino acids thus causing the entrapment of hydrophobic mps in the sludge floc polysaccharides in eps with a high molecular weight 100 kda have a long carbon skeleton structure with active side chains leading to high flocculation of the eps yin et al 2015 they trap the mps in the sludge floc causing the floating mp particles to sink cole et al 2016 long et al 2015 and thus hampering the mp extraction in sludge the extraction efficiencies of the six mps in the five matrices are shown in fig 1b pet had the lowest extraction efficiency of all the mps the shape of the pet samples used in this study was fibrous different from with the other plastics which had a granular shape indicating that the mp shape has an effect on the mp extraction efficiency lares et al 2019 suggested that pet fibers are more flexible than other fibers enabling them to pass through sieves more easily the dimensions and shapes of mp fibers are not symmetrical and thus they are difficult to collect from environment samples by sieving compared with the other matrices sludge had the lowest extraction efficiency of pets only 27 8 that significantly contributed to low total extraction efficiency of the mps in the sludge the possible reason was that the microfibers are more easily entangled with sludge organic matter to form compact and rigid structures compared with the mp particles bayo et al 2016 schmiedgruber et al 2019 found that the vast majory of mp fibers approximatly 99 are found to associate with the sludge floc a simulation experiment was conducted to complement and confirm the effect of eps on the extraction efficiency of granular and fibrous mps in the sludge compared with the zncl2 solution the floating velocity of granular and fibrous pet in the zncl2 eps solution decreased from 1 34 cm s 1 to 1 28 cm s 1 and 0 75 cm s 1 to 0 57 cm s 1 respectively fig 2 anova shows that the difference is insignificant for granular pet p 0 05 but significant for fibrous pet p 0 05 indicating that the eps have a significantly negative impact on the fibrous mp extraction compared with the zncl2 eps solution the zncl2 eps pam solution has a lower floating velocity for the two pets but the differences are insignificant p 0 05 implying that the pam has a negligible effect on the mp floating velocity in the presence of eps in addition the granular pet has a significantly higher floating velocity than the fibrous pet in all the three solution the results indicate that the granular mps are more easily extracted compared with the fibrous mps and the eps have a significantly negative impact on the extraction of fibrous mps 3 2 effect of pretreatment on mp extraction and organic matter dissolution as shown in fig 3 a total extraction efficiencies of the mps in the sludge pretreated by h2o2 fenton 1 m hno3 and 1 m hcl were higher than those in raw sludge but the extraction efficiencies by 5 m hno3 5 m hcl 1 m naoh and 5 m naoh were lower the results indicate that pretreatments of oxidation and low concentration acids can improve the mp extraction in the sludge by 2 9 7 6 while other pretreatments cannot compared with raw sludge further analysis found that the pretreatments caused little changes in the extraction efficiencies of pe pp ps and pmma except for 5 m naoh fig 3b compared with raw sludge the extraction efficiency of pa was reduced in the sludge pretreated by 5 m hno3 and hcl because nylon is not resistant to strong acids avio et al 2015 dehaut et al 2016 the extraction efficiency of pet fibers increased by 40 144 after pretreatments using h2o2 fenton 1 m of hno3 and hcl but decreased using 5 m of hno3 and hcl and all alkali corresponding to the results from the total mp extraction efficiency fig 3a the results indicate that the pretreatments have an important influence on the extraction of pet fibers in sludge and thus on the total mp extraction efficiency the effect of the pretreatments on the release of the organic matter in the sludge was further investigated since the above results show that the eps and sludge floc have significantly negative impacts on the mp extraction in this study scod were used to reflect disintegration degree of sludge organic matter xiao et al 2015 compared with raw sludge rs all of the pretreated sludge had higher scod contents fig 4 a implying that the pretreatments promote the dissolution of sludge organic matter the extraction efficiencies of the total mps and pet fibers initially increased and then decreased as the scod content fig 4b and c similar phenomena are also found between sludge dissolution degree and its dewaterability yu et al 2009 yuan et al 2011 at a low scod content by h2o2 and fenton the floc structure may be disrupted because the eps are released into the aqueous phase zhang et al 2012 but the microbial cells were not destroyed due to the relatively minimal change yu et al 2009 yuan et al 2011 this caused the release of the mps from the sludge floc and improved the mp extraction however under a higher concentration acid alkali the microbial cell walls are prone to swelling and rupture and then intracellular protein and carbohydrates are released to the aqueous phase liu et al 2009 causing high scod content excessive chemical action may cause the released substances to form functional groups such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups leading to reflocculation of the cracked sludge zhang et al 2007 and the mps additionally small molecules from the dissolution of the sludge organic matter may adhere to the mp surface kowalski et al 2016 hindering their natural floating therefore proper disintegration of the sludge organic matter is vital for improving the mp extraction especially for pet fibers the findings need to be further verified using the same chemical reagents under different concentrations as different chemical pretreatments may have different mechanisms of organic matter disruption and other influences on the mp extraction for example in the alkaline pretreatment zncl2 used in the two step extraction will forms a precipitate due to the reaction of zn2 and hydroxyl ions which may be not beneficial for mp flotation 3 3 effect of pretreatment on mp properties sem analysis showed that the mp surface morphologies are slightly rough and broken after alkaline pretreatments figs s2 s7 of the si especially for pets implying that the alkaline pretreatments have significant impacts on the mp surface properties compared with other pretreatments the h2o2 and fenton pretreatments caused a hardly change in the sem graphs of the mps indicating that the oxidative treatments have little effect on the surface morphology of the mps avio et al 2015 sujathan et al 2017 meanwhile the ftir spectra of the pretreated mps showed no significant difference in the surface functional groups from the virgin samples figs s8 s10 of the si in addition to pa groups by 5 m of acid solution without available spectra although sem and ftir are widely used to evaluate effect of the pretreatments on the mp properties using them alone may not allow us to fully understand the pretreatments influence due to their limited qualitative information therefore quantitative indicators such as the mass size ci adsorption potential of cd and zeta potentials were used to systematically evaluate the mp changes after the pretreatments in this study table 1 shows the changes in mass and size of the six mps after the chemical pretreatments it is suggested that the mass or size loss rates of more than 5 are valid changes and those of less than 5 are caused by the experimental errors eight data points with valid changes were found in the mp mass analysis while 20 data points in the size analysis the results indicate that changes in the mp size are more sensitive to the effect of the pretreatments compared with the mass the mass and size of pa were reduced by 100 after the pretreatment by 5 m of hno3 and hcl similar results were also found in other studies avio et al 2015 dehaut et al 2016 as the high concentration acid solution caused the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in pa molecules the mass and size of pet decreased by 30 2 53 5 and 9 4 16 7 after the alkali pretreatments respectively the possible reason was that the saponification reaction occurs in ester linkages of pet with the alkali during alkaline pretreatment thus causing a significant decrease in the pet mass hurley et al 2018 ci is often used to quantitatively describe surface alteration properties of the mps during aging process hüffer et al 2018 liu et al 2019 müller et al 2018 as shown in table s4 of the si virgin pet had higher ci values than virgin pmma and pa followed by virgin ps pp and pe showing that the ci values are significantly dependent on the mp types in general the ci values of the pretreated mps increased with varying degree compared with the virgin mps implying that the chemical pretreatments cause surface aging of the mps in accordance with the previous results from uv aging hüffer et al 2018 liu et al 2019 müller et al 2018 compared with other pretreatments the alkaline pretreatments led to higher aging for pp ps pa and pet and the oxidation pretreatments h2o2 and fenton caused less aging for all the mps corresponding to the results of the mass and size liu et al 2019 also found that the alteration degree of fenton for pe and ps is lower than that of heat activated k2s2o8 system according to the ci values the changing ci degree of the six pretreated mps followed a decreasing order pet pmma and pa ps pp pe implying that the chemical composition and inherent structures of polymers affect their alteration properties the polymers with higher oxygen containing groups and higher molecular weight monomers seem more liable to aging under the chemical pretreatment due to easier penetration of oxygen lv et al 2017 researchers also reported that the ci values surface weathering of pe pp and ps have the different changes as the uv exposure duration due to their different chemical structures liu et al 2019 song et al 2017 in this study cd was used as representative metal to evaluate the effect of chemical pretreatment on mp adsorption potentials li et al 2019 and the results are shown in fig 5 compared with virgin mps the cd adsorption on the six corresponding mps pretreated by the alkaline solution significantly increased particularly the cd adsorption of pet pretreated by 10 m naoh reached nearly 148 times that of the virgin one the results imply that the alkaline pretreatment has a significant impact on the vector effect of mps to pollutants the possible reason was that the alkaline pretreatment brings more hydroxyl functional groups on the mp surface thus promoting the adsorption of mps to cations to achieve balanced surface charges turner and holmes 2015 as shown in fig s11 of the si the zeta potentials of the mps significantly decreased after alkaline pretreatments confirming an increase in the negative charge on the mp surfaces unlike the alkaline pretreatment the acid and oxidation pretreatments changed the mp adsorption potentials with a low degree except for pmma and pa by acid pretreatment implying that they exert little impact on the vector effects of the mps the pa adsorption potential decreased significantly after the acid pretreatment possibly attributed to the positive hydrogen ions being attracted to the negatively charged surface of the mps melo et al 2013 thus competing with cd for the mp adsorption sites compared with the virgin pa zeta potential of the pa pretreated by the acid solution increased complementing and confirming the results of the adsorption potentials fig s11 of the si additionally the pretreated pmma and pet had higher adsorption potentials of cd than the corresponding virgin mps respectively possibly ascribed to the significant increase in the ci values after the pretreatment table s4 of the si yang et al 2019 found a positive correlation between the cu adsorption capacities and the number of carbonyl groups of the mps pca was conducted according to the five quantitative indicators of the mps in order to comprehensively understand the effect of the pretreatments as shown in fig 6 a the pretreatments were classified into four main categories category p1 1 m 5 m and 10 m naoh category p2 5 m hno3 and hcl category p3 1 m hno3 and hcl and category p4 h2o2 and fenton the above results imply that the effect of the pretreatments on the mps follows a decreasing sequence category p1 category p2 category p3 category p4 in general all of the alkaline pretreatments produced a strong effect on most of the mp physicochemical characteristics and types especially for adsorption potentials and pa and pet were more susceptible to alkali treatment than other mps unlike alkaline pretreatments high concentration acid pretreatments had a higher effect on mps than low concentration ones especially for pa as shown in fig 6b the six mps are divided into three main categories category m1 pet pa and pmma category m2 ps and category m3 pe and pp the above results indicate that the resistance of the mps to the chemical pretreatments tends to increase as following category m1 category m2 category m3 the mps in category m1 share the characteristics with polar carbonyl group and heteroatoms in the main chain which are different from ps pe and pp solely built of carbon atoms and thus are potentially susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage of e g ester or amide bonds gewert et al 2015 according to the glass transition temperatures ps belongs to glassy plastics while pe and pp pertain to rubbery plastics alimi et al 2018 teuten et al 2009 researchers found that glassy polymers possess dense structures and closed internal nanoscale pores teuten et al 2009 the presence of nanoscale pores may be conducive for chemical materials to attack on the ps carbon backbone during the pretreatment kelkar et al 2019 reported that ps is less resistant to chlorination than pp and pe as the presence of plastic additives promotes the direct attack by chlorine the results indicate that different chemical pretreatments exert different influences on the different mps overall the application of h2o2 and fenton pretreatments will induce the lowest effect on the physiochemical properties of pp and pe 3 4 limitations of this study this study investigates various chemical pretreatments that have widely been used but have lacked the evaluations of physical and biological methods a gentler pretreatment should be sought out in the future to optimize the extraction efficiency and reduce the effects on the extracted mps enzyme pretreatment are able to eliminate more than 97 of biomaterial from seawater and biota during the purification process of mps cole et al 2014 löder et al 2017 however it is unknown whether enzyme pretreatment can effectively improve the mp extraction in the sludge due to the complex composition of sludge organic matter although protease and polysaccharase have been used in sludge pretreatment to accelerate the hydrolysis process luo et al 2019 meanwhile some physical pretreatments such as ultrasonic waves constitute mature sludge decomposition technologies that contribute to the decomposition of sludge flocs and the release of intercellular substances zhen et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to further evaluate the effects of physical and biological pretreatments and their combination on mp extraction and physicochemical characteristics in addition the mps used in this study were virgin commercial plastics and not derived from the practical sewage sludge previous research reported that the surface characteristics of virgin and sludge based mps are different li et al 2019 and thus the results of this study need to be further verified for the sludge based mps 4 conclusions compared with the other solid matrices sewage sludge showed the lowest mp extraction efficiency especially for pet the possible reason was that the eps in the sludge floc produce a negative effect on the extraction of mps by hindering their floating part of chemical pretreatments such as h2o2 and fenton can improve the mp extraction in sludge through the disintegration of the floc structure and the release of organic matter at proper degree high concentration acid and alkaline pretreatments cause excessive dissolution of the sludge organic matter which decreases the mp extraction efficiency the pretreatments affect the mp property such as size surface morphology and adsorption potentials especially for alkaline pretreatments compared with the pe pp and ps solely built of carbon atoms the pet and pa with heteroatoms in their main chains are more susceptible to chemical pretreatments therefore an underestimate for mp abundance or an alteration of their real physicochemical properties in sludge and other matrices may happen if improper pretreatments are used in the mp extraction further investigation needs to be conducted in order to discover more effective and gentler pretreatments for mp extraction in sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

variability or the beginning of a slow incremental impact israel is planning to more than double desalination along its 190 km mediterranean coast by 2050 a long term adaptable program in conjunction

marine environment kress 2019 most publications specified only the potential theoretical impacts without actual observational data even now in 2019 the number of studies presenting actual observed impacts if any in the marine environment is lacking the mediterranean coast of israel is an ideal location to research the impact of desalination brine discharge on the marine environment five seawater reverse osmosis swro desalination plants operate along the coastline four within a 40 km stretch fig 1 the plants are among the largest in the world producing close to 590 mm3 y freshwater about 80 of the total domestic and industrial needs of israel two plants ashkelon and hadera are co located with power stations and dispose of the brine at the shoreline next to or mixed with the power stations cooling waters three plants palmachim soreq and ashdod discharge the brine through marine outfalls equipped with diffusers at 20 m water depth all use a submerged intake system for feed water supply kress et al 2017 a tender for the construction and operation of a sixth plant in the palmachim area to be the largest swro in the world 200 mm3 y was issued in october 2018 and a seventh plant to be located at the northern shore is at the planning stages the israeli experience on desalination mainly concerning energy use and carbon footprint has been recently described tal 2018 in israel effluents including desalination brine can be discharged at sea only after a permit is issued by an inter ministerial committee chaired by the ministry of environmental protection as part of the brine discharge permitting process the plants are required to perform biannual compliance monitoring surveys to assess the effects of brine discharge on the receiving marine environment and report the findings to the ministry of environmental protection the goal of this study was to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the brine plume during real operations as opposed to modeling results and determine its impact on seawater quality salinity temperature dissolved oxygen fluorescence turbidity dissolved oxygen nutrients chlorophyll a suspended particulate matter ph and metals the specific aims of the study were 1 to determine the variability of the brine dispersion 2 to compare the field and modeling results providing necessary ground true data for modeling improvement and 3 to assess the quality of the environmental monitoring and provide tools to regulators to improve brine management the importance of seawater quality for plant operations is discussed as well data from 14 surveys four prior to brine discharge serving as the reference conditions and 10 after the start of operations were used to achieve these aims 2 the desalination plants the palmachim and soreq swro plants are located at the southern mediterranean coast of israel ca 17 km south of tel aviv fig 1 the palmachim plant started to operate in 2007 with an installed capacity of 30 mm3 y that was expanded gradually since 2013 the installed capacity is 90 mm3 y seawater is supplied to the plant through two intake heads located 0 94 km from the shoreline the bottom depth at the site is 15 m and the intake heads are located 4 m above the bottom from 2007 up to march 2014 the brine was discharged through a submerged marine outfall hereafter outfall equipped with diffusers at 10 m bottom depth 0 6 km from shore kress and galil 2012 since april 2014 the brine has been discharged through a new outfall located at 20 m bottom depth 1 4 km from the shoreline and 0 67 km westwards from the intake the new submerged outfall is equipped with a diffuser system consisting of 3 discharge ports of 0 8 m diameter placed 6 m from each other the ports are pointed towards 315 azimuth 6 m above the bottom and with a 45 degree angle in relation to the horizon the average discharge rate is ca 15 500 m3 h the soreq plant has been fully operational since september 2013 with an installed capacity of 150 mm3 y seawater is supplied to the plant through two intake heads located 1 3 km from the shoreline bottom depth at the site is 14 m and the intake heads are located 5 8 m above the bottom brine is discharged at 20 m bottom depth 1 9 km from the shoreline and 0 6 km westwards from the intake through an outfall equipped with a diffuser system with 4 discharge ports of 0 8 m diameter placed 2 5 m from each other the ports are arranged parallel to the bathymetry 2 towards the nne 24 azimuth and two towards the ssw 204 azimuth alternately 4 m above the bottom and with a 45 angle in relation to the horizon the average discharge rate is ca 27 700 m3 h the outfall is located 0 8 km nne to the palmachim plant brine outfall since september 2017 electricity for the plant is provided by the new i p p soreq delek ltd power plant located on site the plant uses natural gas as fuel and part of the desalination brine and or seawater as cooling waters that are discharged with the desalination brine the temperature of the combined discharge is higher than ambient seawater by 3 4 c the desalination process at both plants have a recovery of about 50 and the brine s salinity about 80 psu has about twice the salinity of the seawater both the palmachim and soreq plants use polyphosphonate based antiscalants that are discharged at sea with the brine the soreq and palmachim plants discharged 53 2 and 21 ton p in 2018 respectively and 50 4 and 17 7 ton p in 2017 respectively iron salts are used as coagulants in the feedwater pre treatment step only in the soreq plant about 90 of the iron is disposed of inland and only 10 is discharged at sea with the brine the fe loads discharged at sea in 2018 and 2017 were 0 87 and 0 97 ton respectively kress et al 2019b an environmental impact assessment eia was performed during the planning stages of the plants it included among others modeling of the brine dispersion and pre construction marine surveys modeling to optimize the design of the outfalls to achieve maximum dilution was performed at the coastal and marine engineering research institute cameri of the technion israel institute of technology sladkevich et al 2012 improved in 2015 near field simulations were performed with the um3 model from visual plume package developed by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the far field simulations were performed with the cameri3d hd st model four pre construction marine surveys were conducted in 2008 2009 and in 2012 table 1 the aim of these surveys was to characterize the natural spatial and temporal variability of seawater quality parameters to serve as a reference against which to estimate the impact of the plants at the operational stage 3 experimental and methods 3 1 field sampling monitoring cruises were performed twice a year on board the r v etziona or the r v mediterranean explorer a total of 14 surveys were conducted in the area four prior to the construction of the 20 m depth outfalls at the eia stage and 10 at the operational stage table 1 the surveys were timed to take place during maximal production of the plants and hence maximal brine discharge usually at night when electricity costs are lower the sampling scheme consisted of 19 planned stations for discrete seawater sampling and additional stations to follow the spatial dispersion of the brine plume the number and location of these additional stations were based on the actual brine dispersion pattern encountered during the survey table 1 fig 1 station vm49 located 1 4 and 2 2 km from the soreq so24 and palmachim vm43n outfalls respectively towards the north north west 22 azimuth was assigned as the reference station fig 1 the distance between the planned and actual occupied station position was ca 20 m based on the monitoring results the sampling scheme was changed in 2017 to emphasize the near bottom compartment where brine dispersed table 1 during each survey continuous depth profiles of salinity temperature dissolved oxygen turbidity and seawater fluorescence were acquired at all stations using a seabird electronics ctd model sbe 19plusv2 the depth profiles were acquired down to the bottom until the ctd touched the sediments lightly to prevent resuspension although salinity was measured with the ctd as a conductivity ratio and has no physical units millero 1993 2010 it is reported here with the common unit of psu for clarity surficial seawater samples 0 5 m below the surface and near bottom seawater samples 0 5 m above the sediment were sampled at the planned stations using a flowjet membrane pump connected to the ctd seawater for metal determination by icp ms was sampled using a peristaltic pump cole parmer a masterflex e s portable sampler seawater for nutrient analysis were collected into 15 ml acid washed plastic scintillation vials immediately frozen 20 c and kept frozen until analysis samples for chlorophyll a chl a determination were filtered on board on gf f filters and immediately frozen a known volume of seawater usually 2 l for duplicate samples for suspended particulate matter spm determination was pre filtered through a 63 μm plastic sieve to remove large debris and then filtered on pre weighted 0 45 μm polycarbonate filter and immediately frozen seawater for the determination of metals by icp ms was sampled into ldpe bottles acidified to ph 2 and kept in the dark until analysis seawater for hg determination was sampled into plastic vials containing acidified brcl epa method 1631 samples were kept refrigerated in the dark until analysis samples for ph determination were collected in 50 ml sarstedt test tubes and kept refrigerated until analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis nutrients nitrate nitrite phosphate silicic acid total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured with a seal analytical aa 3 system using the methods suggested by the manufacturer and by kress et al 2014a total organic phosphorus top was calculated by subtracting the phosphate concentration from tp chl a was measured fluorimetrically following extraction with 95 acetone holm hansen et al 1965 spm concentration was calculated after the filters were freeze dried and re weighted one replicate filter was digested with hf in teflon vials in a mars 6 cem microwave for al fe mn zn cu determination by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy agilent technologies 280 fs aa and cd cr and pb determination by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy agilent technologies gta 120 hg was determined in the second replicate by atomic fluorescence psa analytical merlin millennium system following digestion with hno3 in the mars 6 cem microwave metals and se in seawater samples except for hg were determined by icp ms at the geological survey of israel gsi hg was determined by us by atomic fluorescence psa analytical merlin millennium system ph in seawater samples was measured on board with a wtw ph ion meter multi 3430 or in the laboratory with a radiometer phm240 phmeter 3 3 calculation and mapping of excess salinity over reference conditions the reference salinity for each survey was set as the seawater salinity measured near the bottom at the reference station vm49 excess salinity over reference hereafter excess salinity was calculated as a percentage from the reference salinity for each data point the calculation performed for each survey generated a normalized parameter factoring out the natural seasonal and inter annual variability of salinity and thus enabling comparison among the surveys and to data from elsewhere kress et al 2017 depth profiles and dispersion maps of the seawater properties measured were generated with the ocean data view software schlitzer r ocean data view odv awi de the sigma plot 2002 version 8 02 from spss inc was used to draw some of the figures 3 4 statistical analysis numerical summary of the data number of data points range mean standard deviation of the mean median median absolute deviation table s1 and comparisons t test mann whitney a parametric test were performed using addinsoft s xlstat2013 add on to the excel software at the 5 significance level 4 results the desalination brine discharged through the two outfalls was saltier and denser than the ambient seawater negatively buoyant and dispersed near the bottom see section 4 1 therefore the results of the discrete measurements performed at the surface and at the near bottom nutrients chl a spm metals in seawater and in spm were classified by sampling depth and by sampling season spring end of summer fall moreover the near bottom samples were divided into two groups based on the excess salinity the affected samples with 1 excess salinity and the non affected samples with 1 excess salinity the results are summarized in table s1 the decision to use the 1 excess salinity as the cutoff between affected and non affected areas was based on modeling results 4 1 salinity during all surveys surficial seawater salinity ranged from 38 94 to 40 02 psu with slight seasonal and temporal variations table s1 brine was not detected at the surface in any of the surveys in the absence of brine bottom salinity ranged from 39 19 to 40 21psu with slight seasonal and temporal variations table s1 the water column was either mixed or slightly stratified with salinity increasing towards the bottom the latter at the deeper stations with no seasonal dependence in the presence of brine salinity increased sharply near the bottom usually with a gradient of 1 5 psu within 2 m representative salinity depth profiles at stations with and without brine presence are depicted in fig 2 a that emphasizes the sharp salinity increase at the affected stations generally the brine dispersed towards the open sea west north west wnw forming a thin saline layer with excess salinity 1 near the bottom as shown in a representative depth section fig 2b similar profiles and sections were observed during all 10 surveys conducted following the start of operations the maximal extent of the dense thin layer l was greater than 4 4 km while the maximal excess salinity observed near the bottom ranged from 4 3 to 9 1 table 2 fig 2 the near bottom area affected by the brine ranged from 2 km2 to more than 13 km2 table 2 figs 2c and s1 the sampling scheme was detailed enough to delimit the whole affected area only during 3 out of the 10 surveys the brine discharged from both outfalls combined to form one area with 3 excess salinity at some of the surveys while at others one or two separate areas were found table 2 fig s1 the maximal area with excess salinity over 3 was found in september 2015 2 6 km2 table 2 fig s1 the areas with excess salinity over 5 were small usually less than 0 1 km2 and confined to the vicinity of each outfall table 2 excess salinity over 7 near the bottom was detected during 2 surveys only at the soreq outfall tables 2 and s1 noteworthy is the fact that the bottom salinity at the reference station in may and october 2018 was higher than expected by 0 04 psu 0 1 excess salinity seemingly due to brine presence therefore a new reference station was set up and used in the surveys conducted in 2018 the new reference station is located 0 5 km north north east from the previous reference station at the same water depth while brine was usually observed at the 1 2 m layer above the bottom during 3 surveys it was detected at the outfall starting at 10 m above the bottom fig 2 table 2 the maximal excess salinity 12 8 was observed in may 2018 at 13 m depth table 2 these mid depth excess salinities were larger than the ones calculated for the bottom layer probably due to their proximity to the discharge ports see section 5 1 4 2 temperature seawater temperatures were natural for the area with seasonal and temporal variations as expected table s1 depth profiles showed usually a mixed water column or slight stratification with temperature decreasing with increasing water depth only within 200 m from the outfalls in the presence of brine seawater temperature was higher than ambient by 0 3 0 7 c fig 2 unusual depth profiles of temperature mirroring salinity occurred at the outfall stations when brine was detected at mid depths fig 2 since october 2017 the temperatures near the soreq outfall were slightly higher by 0 3 c than those measured at the palmachim outfall at the same salinity fig 2d this is due to the co discharge of the soreq brine with cooling waters following the start of operations of the adjacent power plant see section 2 this difference did not exist prior to the operation of the power plant kress et al 2019b 4 3 dissolved oxygen turbidity and fluorescence representative depth profiles of dissolved oxygen turbidity and fluorescence are depicted in fig 2 brine did not affect these seawater quality parameters surficial seawater was saturated with dissolved oxygen with similar or slightly lower saturation near the bottom as expected turbidity usually increased slightly near the bottom at all stations unrelated to the presence of brine fluorescence depth profiles a proxy of chl a concentration were seasonally and temporally dependent 4 4 nutrients chl a spm and ph summary statistics of nutrients chl a and spm concentrations are presented in table s1 brine presence did not affect the concentrations of the nitrogen n species silicic acid and phosphate surface and near bottom concentrations of nox nh4 and tn were similar average values of 0 22 0 38 μm 0 24 0 28 μm and 6 50 1 01 μm respectively with no seasonal nor temporal dependence no differences were found among the silicic acid concentrations in the surface and near bottom samples in the spring nor in the summer however the concentrations in the spring were lower than in the summer 1 55 0 74 μm and 2 09 0 94 μm respectively p 0 0001 phosphate concentrations in the spring were lower than the summer concentrations both at the surface 0 029 0 023 μm and 0 061 0 046 μm in spring and summer respectively p 0 0001 and near the bottom 0 047 0 032 μm and 0 077 0 056 μm in spring and summer respectively p 0 0001 phosphate concentrations at the surface in the spring were lower than the bottom concentrations p 0 0001 while in the summer the concentrations were similar at both sampling depths there was a large temporal variability in the concentrations but no specific trend brine affected only the concentrations of tp in the presence of brine the concentrations of tp near the bottom average of 0 27 0 12 μm in the spring and of 0 33 0 17 μm in the summer were more than twice of those found at the near bottom samples without brine table s1 as phosphate concentrations were not affected by the brine presence this increase in tp is attributed to the presence of total organic p top top probably originated from the polyphosphonate based antiscalants used by both desalination plants and discharged at sea with the brine see section 2 moreover top correlated significantly to excess salinity fig 3 the tp concentrations found at the surface and near the bottom in the absence of brine were similar and no differences were found between spring and summer chl a concentrations during the surveys ranged from 0 07 to 1 65 μg l exhibiting a high temporal variability and well as seasonality the concentrations in the spring were lower than in the summer in particular at the surface table s1 both in the spring and summer the chl a concentrations at the surface were lower than the concentrations measured near the bottom chl a concentrations were not affected by brine presence spm concentrations were natural for the area ranging from 0 38 to 2 95 mg l at the surface and slightly higher at the bottom as expected due to the proximity to the sediments maximal value of 4 91 mg l no seasonal differences nor brine impact on spm concentrations were detected table s1 seawater ph were natural for seawater 8 26 0 08 no seasonal differences nor brine impact were detected 4 5 metals in seawater metals in seawater were measured in two different ways directly in a seawater sample by icp ms except during the 2018 surveys and in spm collected from a known volume of seawater during all surveys the metals analyzed were chosen based on existing israeli guidelines for seawater quality table 3 special emphasis was given to fe used as a coagulant in the pre treatment stage at the soreq plant and to cu and zn reported to accumulate at brine discharge sites of thermal desalination plants ie sadiq 2002 saeed et al 2017 although not expected to be of concern with ro plants metals determination was included in the monitoring program as a precautionary measure all metals concentrations measured directly in seawater excluding hg and al were below the detection limits including the samples with brine table 3 hg concentrations were very low ranging from 5 to 48 ng l 1 and al ranged from 5 to 50 μg l all concentrations were below the proposed israeli water quality guidelines no correlation to the presence of brine nor spatial or temporal variations in the concentrations were found the concentration ranges for metals in seawater calculated from the spm analysis are given in table 3 no correlation was found between metal concentrations and brine presence in the samples only seasonal and temporal variations were detected this is shown by the linear correlation of fe and cu plotted as a function of al fig 4 the latter normalizing for seasonal and temporal variations herut and sandler 2006 some outliers were identified in particular for cu with no temporal nor spatial pattern 5 discussion brine discharge did not impair the surficial seawater salinity and temperature were as expected for the area and exhibited natural seasonal and temporal variability the concentrations of nutrients chl a and spm were in agreement with the reference values derived for the area kress et al 2019 brine affected the water quality mainly near the bottom 2 m layer but from the middle of the water column starting at about 10 m depth in the close vicinity of the discharge ports therefore the following discussion will concentrate on the near bottom seawater quality 5 1 variability of excess salinity and of the spatial extent of brine presence brine dispersion in the marine environment is highly dependent on the site s geographical settings hydrographical conditions desalination technology plant production mode of discharge and on the final brine density following discharge kress 2019 and references therein near field mixing is governed by the specifics of the discharge system while far field dispersion is highly dependent on the hydrographic conditions missimer et al 2015 everything being equal as in this study the dispersion pattern observed during a specific survey will depend on the actual hydrographic conditions encountered during it and on the rate of brine discharge plant operations during the survey quiet seas will reduce mixing and dispersion while rough seas will increase it in this study the surveys took place during calm seas less than 1 m wave height with winds up to 20 knots but the conditions were not identical moreover the maximal production of the plants occurs during the night when electricity costs are lower seawater salinity exactly at the outfall was measured during 3 surveys table 2 brine impacted the water column starting from 10 m water depth at the outfall stations causing a noisy depth profile of salinity temperature and dissolved oxygen probably due to sampling at the brine jets and not in the spreading brine layer the maximal excess salinity 12 8 was observed at 13 m water depth at the soreq outfall in may 2018 fig 2 table 2 although observed during only 3 surveys similar depth profiles are assumed to occur near the outfalls and only the difficulty to reach the exact discharge point during the cruises prevented us from detecting it in all surveys the initial mixing was aided by the orientation of the diffuser heads taking advantage of the predominant alongshore currents rosentraub and brenner 2007 following this initial mixing the brine sank and dispersed near the bottom towards the west and north west figs 2c and s1 the design of the diffuser systems prevented dispersion eastwards towards the coast and the intake heads except for about 200 m mainly from the soreq outfall the extent of the near bottom area affected by the brine was highly variable with no seasonal nor temporal variations table 2 the size of the area with 1 excess salinity ranged from 2 km2 to more than 13 km2 and the area with 3 excess salinity ranged from about 0 1 to 2 6 km2 areas with excess salinity 5 were either confined to the vicinity of the outfalls 0 1 km2 or absent with maximal plume size l table 2 of 500 m although variable in extent and position the impact of the brine on seawater salinity was detected during all surveys with similar maximal excess salinity table 2 in most surveys the higher excess salinity was measured in the vicinity of the soreq outfall compared to the palmachim outfall probably due to the1 7 times larger production capacity of the soreq plant the brine plume dispersing near the bottom started usually as a 2 m deep layer narrowing with increased distance from the outfalls fig 2b when the area exactly at the discharge ports was sampled the vertical width of the brine plume was ca 10 m the brine formed a density current towards the open sea its full extent not characterized yet the bottom at the study area is homogenous with a gentle slope towards the open sea with no known bathymetric barriers such as rock outcrops or reefs that may block the dispersion of the brine and cause its accumulation near the outfall the maximal length of the area with excess salinity 1 was greater than 4 4 km for comparison when the palmachim plant discharged the brine at 10 m depth excess salinity 1 was observed up to 1 km only from the outfall however the maximal excess salinity reached 15 when the production was at 90 mm3 y kress and galil 2012 kress et al 2014b comparison among the modeling results and the field observations showed that the simulated area with excess salinity 1 was usually smaller than the actual observations table 2 fig s1 the same is true for the size of the area with 3 excess salinity that was common to both outfalls in the model but observed at times as two separate areas around the outfalls both the model and the in situ observations showed a small usually 0 1 km2 area with 5 excess salinity a similar underestimation of the model was found for the ashdod swro plant where the simulated area with 1 excess salinity was smaller by factor of 19 and 2 in the spring and fall surveys conducted in 2018 shoham frider et al 2019 an additional modeling of the brine dispersion in the area using the mike3 hd hydrodynamic biton et al 2019 found that the maximal plume size in which excess salinity exceeded 1 was confined to 2 km similar to value found by the cameri simulation and smaller than the lengths observed in the field the brine dispersion in the winter was downslope towards the open sea while in the summer the simulation showed a propagation along the coastline excess salinity of 0 01 was simulated to cover a large part of the coast although not significant ecologically they speculated that brine presence may impact coastal water dynamics 5 2 comparison to other areas and to environmental guidelines in general field studies on swro plants brine discharge found excess salinity mostly in the 1 7 range although at some instances much higher values were reported brine was detected up to 5 km from the discharge site but most studies reported a return to ambient salinity within tens to a few hundred meters from the discharge site kress 2019 as expected large plants discharging brine with low initial dilution had a larger impact on salinity than smaller plants or plants discharging brine through optimized outfalls for example hypersalinity 3 maximal excess salinity was measured for a few kilometers from the outfall of the san pedro del pinatar swro plant spain prior to the installation of a diffuser while no increase in salinity was detected following its installation fernandez torquemada et al 2009 in algeria brine from the mostaganem plant discharged through a submerged outfall equipped with a diffuser increased seawater salinity by up to 9 and brine was detected up to 200 m from the outfall at the beni saf plant algeria with the same production capacity and brine discharge at the same water depth without a diffuser the maximal excess salinity measured was 72 and brine was detected up to 1 5 km from the outfall belatoui et al 2017 swro brine co mingled with cooling waters from power stations is discharged at the shoreline through open outfalls at hadera israel and carlsbad ca usa among others at hadera the brine plume was observed up to 2 5 km from the outfall and the maximal excess salinity measured was 10 while in carlsbad the brine plume was observed up to 1 km from the discharge and the maximal excess salinity observed was 13 petersen et al 2019 shpir and ben yosef 2017a table 4 compiles additional examples from the literature in israel there are no guidelines for the permissible increase of salinity at the discharge site nor on the compliance point distance safrai and zask 2008 globally there are a few usually requiring less than 5 excess salinity at the edge of the regulatory mixing zone 50 300 m from the discharge jenkins et al 2012 uddin et al 2011 viskovich et al 2014 the california ocean plan 2015 limits the increases of salinity to two psu over ambient about 6 excess salinity within 100 m from the discharge point brine discharge near sensitive areas such as near posidonia oceanica seagrass mats in spain may elicit stricter guidelines fuentes bargues 2014 palomar and losada 2010 comparison of the results of this study to the prevalent 5 excess salinity guideline showed that this guideline was exceeded during all surveys except one october 2018 table 2 however the exceedance area was small mostly 0 1 km2 only during the november 2014 survey the impacted area was 0 25 km2 and the maximal plume size 0 5 km table 2 therefore it can be carefully concluded that the excess salinity found in this study is mostly within the guidelines proposed elsewhere and that the design of the outfall systems is efficient for diluting the brine however the extent of the brine dispersion should be carefully followed in particular as brine was present at the reference station in 2018 5 3 seawater quality in addition to salinity increase and hence changes in seawater density it has been generally hypothesized that brine discharge could affect seawater quality by increasing temperature reducing oxygen solubility and concentration increasing turbidity changing ph increasing the ambient concentration of chemicals discharged with the brine originating from the desalination process coagulants antiscalants biocides cleaning solutions and metals from plant corrosion kress 2019 changes in seawater quality may in turn affect the biota in general and the pelagic microbial communities in particular belkin et al 2018 and references therein and affect chl a concentrations almost none were found in this study the results showed that brine had no effect on oxygen concentration and saturation nor on turbidity ph nutrients except for top and hence tp chl a and metal s concentration in seawater brine increased the seawater ambient temperature by up to 1 c at a limited small area around the outfalls this slight increase in temperature is not expected to influence the biota directly but it may give a natural edge to the establishment of non indigenous species nis in the presence of saline brine the israeli coast is known for its large amount of erythraean nis introduced through the suez canal most of the nis identified in the area of study are the macrobiota fish crustaceans polychaeta while smaller size taxa as the phytoplankton and bacteria that could influence the parameters studied here are largely unrecognized and undetected galil et al 2018 zenetos et al 2005 brine increased also the concentration of top in seawater compared to the reference values fig 3 this increase is attributed to the presence the polyphosphonate based antiscalants used by both desalination plants and discharged at sea with the brine fig 3 depicts the relationship of top to excess salinity to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such a correlation has been shown except along the israeli coast kress 2019 kress et al 2017 a similar correlation can be found also at the other desalination plants operating along the israeli mediterranean coast that also use polyphosphonate based antiscalants in the desalination process shoham frider et al 2019 shpir and ben yosef 2017b higher top a possible p source did not increase the phytoplankton community as indicated by chl a concentrations a proxy for phytoplankton this could be due to the existing natural excess of po4 p over n availability in the area kress et al 2019a rahav et al 2018 the average n p ratio computed from all samples in this study was 6 7 12 6 median 2 7 and similar 5 4 8 6 median 3 3 in the samples with excess salinity 1 table s1 these ratios are much lower than the redfield ratio of 16 1 found in phytoplankton redfield et al 1963 indicating n limitation of productivity in the area an additional reason may be that the p in the phosphonate bond c p is not bioavailable to the phytoplankton although it has been hypothesized that prochlorococcus the globally important marine primary producer may have the ability to utilize it feingersch et al 2012 the pelagic microbial community was not part of the monitoring program however in a related research brine discharge was shown in situ to change the relative composition of the community at the mediterranean coast of israel belkin et al 2017 moreover at the shallow palmachim outfall 10 m depth operational until march 2014 autotroph productivity was reduced by 30 in the summer compared to reference conditions at the ashqelon open shoreline outfall phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria biomass were reduced while productivity fluctuated between seasons an earlier study at the same site found a reduction in phytoplankton densities and their productivity per chl a when iron salts used as coagulants were still discharged in pulses with the continuous brine discharge drami et al 2011 in contrast no impact of brine discharge was found in microbial abundance in the red sea van der merwe et al 2014 5 4 plant operations and seawater quality seawater quality in spite of its importance to desalination plant operations is seldom addressed in environmental studies only harmful algal blooms hab have been extensively studied as they reduce production causing even temporary plant shutdowns unesco and ioc 2017 news services have reported on jelly fish clogging intakes and reducing freshwater production https www zavit org il en uncategorized jellyfish outbreaks might cost israel millions of euros each year for example accessed december 9 2019 in this study brine was not detected at the intake heads what could have increased the feedwater salinity and thus energy costs for desalination the engineering design of the discharge systems was able to prevent it however occasional polluted riverine discharge from the soreq river its mouth located opposite the intakes and pollution from the ashdod port fig 1 have caused problems for plant operations on march 2016 poorly treated domestic effluents discharged to the soreq river and subsequently to the sea initiated a bloom of the diatom asterionellopsis glacialis e rahav unpublished results and the palmachim plant was temporarily closed by order of the ministry of health a hermoni ceo palmachim plant personal communication on may 2017 both the soreq and palmachim plants temporarily stopped operations due to oil pollution origination from the ashdod port 5 5 conclusions and implications for environmental management seawater desalination will continue to increase globally and in israel in 2017 seawater desalination in the mediterranean supplied 582 mm3 y freshwater out of the 750 mm3 y planned to be provided by 2020 in 2012 the long term master plan for the national water section was

doclib4 masterplan en v 4 pdf accessed december 9 2019 the increase in desalination effort will in turn increase marine discharge of brine in the already replete mediterranean sea coast the results of this study describing the seawater quality at the outfalls of two adjacent mega sized swro plants can serve as a basis for future management and regulatory acts the results showed that the models underestimated the extent of brine dispersion brine discharge did not impair the seawater quality except for a highly variable area near the bottom with excess salinity 1 ranging from 2 to 13 km2 with a plume size from 1 4 to 4 4 km seawater temperature was elevated near the outfalls and top higher than ambient in the presence of brine however this is a short term study encompassing 6 years since brine discharge started it is still unknown if the results of the study represent a steady state with temporal variability or the beginning of a slow incremental impact one evidence to the expansion of brine presence in the area may be its presence at the reference station in the 2018 surveys marine monitoring should continue for as long as the plants are operational and its findings critically reviewed the monitoring program should be re evaluated periodically for its frequency sampling stations and parameters measured and adapted when necessary based on the results of this study primary and bacterial production would be a useful additional biological parameter to characterize seawater quality moreover regulators should revise the environmental requirements in light of the technological advances in the desalination industry for example phosphorus discharge to the marine environment could be reduced or stopped by 1 improving pre treatment of seawater and thus reducing the use of the polyphosphonate based antiscalant 2 replacing it with green antiscalants biodegradable compounds that do not include phosphorus 3 using chemical free methodology dayarathne et al 2019 giwa et al 2017 pervov et al 2017 among others excess salinity could be decreased by reducing brine discharge implementing 1 hybrid processes 2 new or improved membranes 3 zero liquid discharge and water and salts recovery from the brine amy et al 2017 buonomenna 2013 tong and elimelech 2016 among others clearly implementing changes in the established desalination processes is a difficult task

18191,two mega size seawater desalination plants producing 240 mm3 y freshwater discharge brine into the mediterranean coast of israel through two marine outfalls located 0 8 km apart six years monitoring brine discharge have shown almost no impact on seawater quality the brine dispersed near the bottom following its initial mixing and was not detected near the surface maximal excess salinity at the salty layer ranged from 4 3 to 9 1 over the reference and the affected area was highly variable 2 km2 13 km2 with maximal plume size from 1 75 to more than 4 4 km brine increased seawater temperature by up to 0 7 c near the outfalls it had no impact on oxygen saturation turbidity ph nutrients except for total organic phosphorus top chlorophyll a and metal concentrations top from the polyphosphonate based antiscalant discharged with the brine was correlated with excess salinity it is unknown if the results of this short term study represent a steady state with temporal variability or the beginning of a slow incremental impact israel is planning to more than double desalination along its 190 km mediterranean coast by 2050 a long term adaptable program in conjunction with specific research and modeling should be able to assess and predict the impact of large scale brine discharge on the marine environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater desalination

essential tool to provide clean water and sanitation to the world s population https www un org sustainabledevelopment development agenda accessed december 9 2019 the increasing need for freshwater and the rapid technological development generated an annual growth rate in desalination of 14 17 per year from 1997 to 2012 74 8 mm3 d since 2012 the growth rate decreased but the installed capacity is still increasing 86 5 mm3 d in 2015 and 95 4 mm3 d in 2018 gude 2016 ida 2018 lior 2017 the main global desalination effort 47 5 is concentrated in the middle east north africa mena region desalination produces in addition to freshwater brine that needs to be treated or disposed of a recent synthesis on the global state of desalination suggests that 142 mm3 d of brine were being produced in 2018 by close to 16 000 desalination plants jones et al 2019 seawater sw desalination accounts for 61 of the produced freshwater globally brine originating from sw desalination is usually discharged at sea either at the shoreline through open systems alone or commingled with other discharges or through submerged marine outfalls missimer and maliva 2018 purnama 2015 voutchkov 2011 brine may include chemicals used during the desalination process that are also discharged at sea among them are the coagulants antiscalants biocides neutralized acids and bases used for cleaning the membranes excess lime used to remineralize the product water kress 2019 and references therein however in contrast to the vast number of publications on desalination processes economics and energy use that have been growing exponentially since 1980 jones et al 2019 less than 2000 publications addressing environment and desalination were published from 1960 to 2017 out of them only 194 addressed the marine environment kress 2019 most publications specified only the potential theoretical impacts without actual observational data even now in 2019 the number of studies presenting actual observed impacts if any in the marine environment is lacking the mediterranean coast of israel is an ideal location to research the impact of desalination brine discharge on the marine environment five seawater reverse osmosis swro desalination plants operate along the coastline four within a 40 km stretch fig 1 the plants are among the largest in the world producing close to 590 mm3 y freshwater about 80 of the total domestic and industrial needs of israel two plants ashkelon and hadera are co located with power stations and dispose of the brine at the shoreline next to or mixed with the power stations cooling waters three plants palmachim soreq and ashdod discharge the brine through marine outfalls equipped with diffusers at 20 m water depth all use a submerged intake system for feed water supply kress et al 2017 a tender for the construction and operation of a sixth plant in the palmachim area to be the largest swro in the world 200 mm3 y was issued in october 2018 and a seventh plant to be located at the northern shore is at the planning stages the israeli experience on desalination mainly concerning energy use and carbon footprint has been recently described tal 2018 in israel effluents including desalination brine can be discharged at sea only after a permit is issued by an inter ministerial committee chaired by the ministry of environmental protection as part of the brine discharge permitting process the plants are required to perform biannual compliance monitoring surveys to assess the effects of brine discharge on the receiving marine environment and report the findings to the ministry of environmental protection the goal of this study was to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the brine plume during real operations as opposed to modeling results and determine its impact on seawater quality salinity temperature dissolved oxygen fluorescence turbidity dissolved oxygen nutrients chlorophyll a suspended particulate matter ph and metals the specific aims of the study were 1 to determine the variability of the brine dispersion 2 to compare the field and modeling results providing necessary ground true data for modeling improvement and 3 to assess the quality of the environmental monitoring and provide tools to regulators to improve brine management the importance of seawater quality for plant operations is discussed as well data from 14 surveys four prior to brine discharge serving as the reference conditions and 10 after the start of operations were used to achieve these aims 2 the desalination plants the palmachim and soreq swro plants are located at the southern mediterranean coast of israel ca 17 km south of tel aviv fig 1 the palmachim plant started to operate in 2007 with an installed capacity of 30 mm3 y that was expanded gradually since 2013 the installed capacity is 90 mm3 y seawater is supplied to the plant through two intake heads located 0 94 km from the shoreline the bottom depth at the site is 15 m and the intake heads are located 4 m above the bottom from 2007 up to march 2014 the brine was discharged through a submerged marine outfall hereafter outfall equipped with diffusers at 10 m bottom depth 0 6 km from shore kress and galil 2012 since april 2014 the brine has been discharged through a new outfall located at 20 m bottom depth 1 4 km from the shoreline and 0 67 km westwards from the intake the new submerged outfall is equipped with a diffuser system consisting of 3 discharge ports of 0 8 m diameter placed 6 m from each other the ports are pointed towards 315 azimuth 6 m above the bottom and with a 45 degree angle in relation to the horizon the average discharge rate is ca 15 500 m3 h the soreq plant has been fully operational since september 2013 with an installed capacity of 150 mm3 y seawater is supplied to the plant through two intake heads located 1 3 km from the shoreline bottom depth at the site is 14 m and the intake heads are located 5 8 m above the bottom brine is discharged at 20 m bottom depth 1 9 km from the shoreline and 0 6 km westwards from the intake through an outfall equipped with a diffuser system with 4 discharge ports of 0 8 m diameter placed 2 5 m from each other the ports are arranged parallel to the bathymetry 2 towards the nne 24 azimuth and two towards the ssw 204 azimuth alternately 4 m above the bottom and with a 45 angle in relation to the horizon the average discharge rate is ca 27 700 m3 h the outfall is located 0 8 km nne to the palmachim plant brine outfall since september 2017 electricity for the plant is provided by the new i p p soreq delek ltd power plant located on site the plant uses natural gas as fuel and part of the desalination brine and or seawater as cooling waters that are discharged with the desalination brine the temperature of the combined discharge is higher than ambient seawater by 3 4 c the desalination process at both plants have a recovery of about 50 and the brine s salinity about 80 psu has about twice the salinity of the seawater both the palmachim and soreq plants use polyphosphonate based antiscalants that are discharged at sea with the brine the soreq and palmachim plants discharged 53 2 and 21 ton p in 2018 respectively and 50 4 and 17 7 ton p in 2017 respectively iron salts are used as coagulants in the feedwater pre treatment step only in the soreq plant about 90 of the iron is disposed of inland and only 10 is discharged at sea with the brine the fe loads discharged at sea in 2018 and 2017 were 0 87 and 0 97 ton respectively kress et al 2019b an environmental impact assessment eia was performed during the planning stages of the plants it included among others modeling of the brine dispersion and pre construction marine surveys modeling to optimize the design of the outfalls to achieve maximum dilution was performed at the coastal and marine engineering research institute cameri of the technion israel institute of technology sladkevich et al 2012 improved in 2015 near field simulations were performed with the um3 model from visual plume package developed by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the far field simulations were performed with the cameri3d hd st model four pre construction marine surveys were conducted in 2008 2009 and in 2012 table 1 the aim of these surveys was to characterize the natural spatial and temporal variability of seawater quality parameters to serve as a reference against which to estimate the impact of the plants at the operational stage 3 experimental and methods 3 1 field sampling monitoring cruises were performed twice a year on board the r v etziona or the r v mediterranean explorer a total of 14 surveys were conducted in the area four prior to the construction of the 20 m depth outfalls at the eia stage and 10 at the operational stage table 1 the surveys were timed to take place during maximal production of the plants and hence maximal brine discharge usually at night when electricity costs are lower the sampling scheme consisted of 19 planned stations for discrete seawater sampling and additional stations to follow the spatial dispersion of the brine plume the number and location of these additional stations were based on the actual brine dispersion pattern encountered during the survey table 1 fig 1 station vm49 located 1 4 and 2 2 km from the soreq so24 and palmachim vm43n outfalls respectively towards the north north west 22 azimuth was assigned as the reference station fig 1 the distance between the planned and actual occupied station position was ca 20 m based on the monitoring results the sampling scheme was changed in 2017 to emphasize the near bottom compartment where brine dispersed table 1 during each survey continuous depth profiles of salinity temperature dissolved oxygen turbidity and seawater fluorescence were acquired at all stations using a seabird electronics ctd model sbe 19plusv2 the depth profiles were acquired down to the bottom until the ctd touched the sediments lightly to prevent resuspension although salinity was measured with the ctd as a conductivity ratio and has no physical units millero 1993 2010 it is reported here with the common unit of psu for clarity surficial seawater samples 0 5 m below the surface and near bottom seawater samples 0 5 m above the sediment were sampled at the planned stations using a flowjet membrane pump connected to the ctd seawater for metal determination by icp ms was sampled using a peristaltic pump cole parmer a masterflex e s portable sampler seawater for nutrient analysis were collected into 15 ml acid washed plastic scintillation vials immediately frozen 20 c and kept frozen until analysis samples for chlorophyll a chl a determination were filtered on board on gf f filters and immediately frozen a known volume of seawater usually 2 l for duplicate samples for suspended particulate matter spm determination was pre filtered through a 63 μm plastic sieve to remove large debris and then filtered on pre weighted 0 45 μm polycarbonate filter and immediately frozen seawater for the determination of metals by icp ms was sampled into ldpe bottles acidified to ph 2 and kept in the dark until analysis seawater for hg determination was sampled into plastic vials containing acidified brcl epa method 1631 samples were kept refrigerated in the dark until analysis samples for ph determination were collected in 50 ml sarstedt test tubes and kept refrigerated until analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis nutrients nitrate nitrite phosphate silicic acid total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured with a seal analytical aa 3 system using the methods suggested by the manufacturer and by kress et al 2014a total organic phosphorus top was calculated by subtracting the phosphate concentration from tp chl a was measured fluorimetrically following extraction with 95 acetone holm hansen et al 1965 spm concentration was calculated after the filters were freeze dried and re weighted one replicate filter was digested with hf in teflon vials in a mars 6 cem microwave for al fe mn zn cu determination by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy agilent technologies 280 fs aa and cd cr and pb determination by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy agilent technologies gta 120 hg was determined in the second replicate by atomic fluorescence psa analytical merlin millennium system following digestion with hno3 in the mars 6 cem microwave metals and se in seawater samples except for hg were determined by icp ms at the geological survey of israel gsi hg was determined by us by atomic fluorescence psa analytical merlin millennium system ph in seawater samples was measured on board with a wtw ph ion meter multi 3430 or in the laboratory with a radiometer phm240 phmeter 3 3 calculation and mapping of excess salinity over reference conditions the reference salinity for each survey was set as the seawater salinity measured near the bottom at the reference station vm49 excess salinity over reference hereafter excess salinity was calculated as a percentage from the reference salinity for each data point the calculation performed for each survey generated a normalized parameter factoring out the natural seasonal and inter annual variability of salinity and thus enabling comparison among the surveys and to data from elsewhere kress et al 2017 depth profiles and dispersion maps of the seawater properties measured were generated with the ocean data view software schlitzer r ocean data view odv awi de the sigma plot 2002 version 8 02 from spss inc was used to draw some of the figures 3 4 statistical analysis numerical summary of the data number of data points range mean standard deviation of the mean median median absolute deviation table s1 and comparisons t test mann whitney a parametric test were performed using addinsoft s xlstat2013 add on to the excel software at the 5 significance level 4 results the desalination brine discharged through the two outfalls was saltier and denser than the ambient seawater negatively buoyant and dispersed near the bottom see section 4 1 therefore the results of the discrete measurements performed at the surface and at the near bottom nutrients chl a spm metals in seawater and in spm were classified by sampling depth and by sampling season spring end of summer fall moreover the near bottom samples were divided into two groups based on the excess salinity the affected samples with 1 excess salinity and the non affected samples with 1 excess salinity the results are summarized in table s1 the decision to use the 1 excess salinity as the cutoff between affected and non affected areas was based on modeling results 4 1 salinity during all surveys surficial seawater salinity ranged from 38 94 to 40 02 psu with slight seasonal and temporal variations table s1 brine was not detected at the surface in any of the surveys in the absence of brine bottom salinity ranged from 39 19 to 40 21psu with slight seasonal and temporal variations table s1 the water column was either mixed or slightly stratified with salinity increasing towards the bottom the latter at the deeper stations with no seasonal dependence in the presence of brine salinity increased sharply near the bottom usually with a gradient of 1 5 psu within 2 m representative salinity depth profiles at stations with and without brine presence are depicted in fig 2 a that emphasizes the sharp salinity increase at the affected stations generally the brine dispersed towards the open sea west north west wnw forming a thin saline layer with excess salinity 1 near the bottom as shown in a representative depth section fig 2b similar profiles and sections were observed during all 10 surveys conducted following the start of operations the maximal extent of the dense thin layer l was greater than 4 4 km while the maximal excess salinity observed near the bottom ranged from 4 3 to 9 1 table 2 fig 2 the near bottom area affected by the brine ranged from 2 km2 to more than 13 km2 table 2 figs 2c and s1 the sampling scheme was detailed enough to delimit the whole affected area only during 3 out of the 10 surveys the brine discharged from both outfalls combined to form one area with 3 excess salinity at some of the surveys while at others one or two separate areas were found table 2 fig s1 the maximal area with excess salinity over 3 was found in september 2015 2 6 km2 table 2 fig s1 the areas with excess salinity over 5 were small usually less than 0 1 km2 and confined to the vicinity of each outfall table 2 excess salinity over 7 near the bottom was detected during 2 surveys only at the soreq outfall tables 2 and s1 noteworthy is the fact that the bottom salinity at the reference station in may and october 2018 was higher than expected by 0 04 psu 0 1 excess salinity seemingly due to brine presence therefore a new reference station was set up and used in the surveys conducted in 2018 the new reference station is located 0 5 km north north east from the previous reference station at the same water depth while brine was usually observed at the 1 2 m layer above the bottom during 3 surveys it was detected at the outfall starting at 10 m above the bottom fig 2 table 2 the maximal excess salinity 12 8 was observed in may 2018 at 13 m depth table 2 these mid depth excess salinities were larger than the ones calculated for the bottom layer probably due to their proximity to the discharge ports see section 5 1 4 2 temperature seawater temperatures were natural for the area with seasonal and temporal variations as expected table s1 depth profiles showed usually a mixed water column or slight stratification with temperature decreasing with increasing water depth only within 200 m from the outfalls in the presence of brine seawater temperature was higher than ambient by 0 3 0 7 c fig 2 unusual depth profiles of temperature mirroring salinity occurred at the outfall stations when brine was detected at mid depths fig 2 since october 2017 the temperatures near the soreq outfall were slightly higher by 0 3 c than those measured at the palmachim outfall at the same salinity fig 2d this is due to the co discharge of the soreq brine with cooling waters following the start of operations of the adjacent power plant see section 2 this difference did not exist prior to the operation of the power plant kress et al 2019b 4 3 dissolved oxygen turbidity and fluorescence representative depth profiles of dissolved oxygen turbidity and fluorescence are depicted in fig 2 brine did not affect these seawater quality parameters surficial seawater was saturated with dissolved oxygen with similar or slightly lower saturation near the bottom as expected turbidity usually increased slightly near the bottom at all stations unrelated to the presence of brine fluorescence depth profiles a proxy of chl a concentration were seasonally and temporally dependent 4 4 nutrients chl a spm and ph summary statistics of nutrients chl a and spm concentrations are presented in table s1 brine presence did not affect the concentrations of the nitrogen n species silicic acid and phosphate surface and near bottom concentrations of nox nh4 and tn were similar average values of 0 22 0 38 μm 0 24 0 28 μm and 6 50 1 01 μm respectively with no seasonal nor temporal dependence no differences were found among the silicic acid concentrations in the surface and near bottom samples in the spring nor in the summer however the concentrations in the spring were lower than in the summer 1 55 0 74 μm and 2 09 0 94 μm respectively p 0 0001 phosphate concentrations in the spring were lower than the summer concentrations both at the surface 0 029 0 023 μm and 0 061 0 046 μm in spring and summer respectively p 0 0001 and near the bottom 0 047 0 032 μm and 0 077 0 056 μm in spring and summer respectively p 0 0001 phosphate concentrations at the surface in the spring were lower than the bottom concentrations p 0 0001 while in the summer the concentrations were similar at both sampling depths there was a large temporal variability in the concentrations but no specific trend brine affected only the concentrations of tp in the presence of brine the concentrations of tp near the bottom average of 0 27 0 12 μm in the spring and of 0 33 0 17 μm in the summer were more than twice of those found at the near bottom samples without brine table s1 as phosphate concentrations were not affected by the brine presence this increase in tp is attributed to the presence of total organic p top top probably originated from the polyphosphonate based antiscalants used by both desalination plants and discharged at sea with the brine see section 2 moreover top correlated significantly to excess salinity fig 3 the tp concentrations found at the surface and near the bottom in the absence of brine were similar and no differences were found between spring and summer chl a concentrations during the surveys ranged from 0 07 to 1 65 μg l exhibiting a high temporal variability and well as seasonality the concentrations in the spring were lower than in the summer in particular at the surface table s1 both in the spring and summer the chl a concentrations at the surface were lower than the concentrations measured near the bottom chl a concentrations were not affected by brine presence spm concentrations were natural for the area ranging from 0 38 to 2 95 mg l at the surface and slightly higher at the bottom as expected due to the proximity to the sediments maximal value of 4 91 mg l no seasonal differences nor brine impact on spm concentrations were detected table s1 seawater ph were natural for seawater 8 26 0 08 no seasonal differences nor brine impact were detected 4 5 metals in seawater metals in seawater were measured in two different ways directly in a seawater sample by icp ms except during the 2018 surveys and in spm collected from a known volume of seawater during all surveys the metals analyzed were chosen based on existing israeli guidelines for seawater quality table 3 special emphasis was given to fe used as a coagulant in the pre treatment stage at the soreq plant and to cu and zn reported to accumulate at brine discharge sites of thermal desalination plants ie sadiq 2002 saeed et al 2017 although not expected to be of concern with ro plants metals determination was included in the monitoring program as a precautionary measure all metals concentrations measured directly in seawater excluding hg and al were below the detection limits including the samples with brine table 3 hg concentrations were very low ranging from 5 to 48 ng l 1 and al ranged from 5 to 50 μg l all concentrations were below the proposed israeli water quality guidelines no correlation to the presence of brine nor spatial or temporal variations in the concentrations were found the concentration ranges for metals in seawater calculated from the spm analysis are given in table 3 no correlation was found between metal concentrations and brine presence in the samples only seasonal and temporal variations were detected this is shown by the linear correlation of fe and cu plotted as a function of al fig 4 the latter normalizing for seasonal and temporal variations herut and sandler 2006 some outliers were identified in particular for cu with no temporal nor spatial pattern 5 discussion brine discharge did not impair the surficial seawater salinity and temperature were as expected for the area and exhibited natural seasonal and temporal variability the concentrations of nutrients chl a and spm were in agreement with the reference values derived for the area kress et al 2019 brine affected the water quality mainly near the bottom 2 m layer but from the middle of the water column starting at about 10 m depth in the close vicinity of the discharge ports therefore the following discussion will concentrate on the near bottom seawater quality 5 1 variability of excess salinity and of the spatial extent of brine presence brine dispersion in the marine environment is highly dependent on the site s geographical settings hydrographical conditions desalination technology plant production mode of discharge and on the final brine density following discharge kress 2019 and references therein near field mixing is governed by the specifics of the discharge system while far field dispersion is highly dependent on the hydrographic conditions missimer et al 2015 everything being equal as in this study the dispersion pattern observed during a specific survey will depend on the actual hydrographic conditions encountered during it and on the rate of brine discharge plant operations during the survey quiet seas will reduce mixing and dispersion while rough seas will increase it in this study the surveys took place during calm seas less than 1 m wave height with winds up to 20 knots but the conditions were not identical moreover the maximal production of the plants occurs during the night when electricity costs are lower seawater salinity exactly at the outfall was measured during 3 surveys table 2 brine impacted the water column starting from 10 m water depth at the outfall stations causing a noisy depth profile of salinity temperature and dissolved oxygen probably due to sampling at the brine jets and not in the spreading brine layer the maximal excess salinity 12 8 was observed at 13 m water depth at the soreq outfall in may 2018 fig 2 table 2 although observed during only 3 surveys similar depth profiles are assumed to occur near the outfalls and only the difficulty to reach the exact discharge point during the cruises prevented us from detecting it in all surveys the initial mixing was aided by the orientation of the diffuser heads taking advantage of the predominant alongshore currents rosentraub and brenner 2007 following this initial mixing the brine sank and dispersed near the bottom towards the west and north west figs 2c and s1 the design of the diffuser systems prevented dispersion eastwards towards the coast and the intake heads except for about 200 m mainly from the soreq outfall the extent of the near bottom area affected by the brine was highly variable with no seasonal nor temporal variations table 2 the size of the area with 1 excess salinity ranged from 2 km2 to more than 13 km2 and the area with 3 excess salinity ranged from about 0 1 to 2 6 km2 areas with excess salinity 5 were either confined to the vicinity of the outfalls 0 1 km2 or absent with maximal plume size l table 2 of 500 m although variable in extent and position the impact of the brine on seawater salinity was detected during all surveys with similar maximal excess salinity table 2 in most surveys the higher excess salinity was measured in the vicinity of the soreq outfall compared to the palmachim outfall probably due to the1 7 times larger production capacity of the soreq plant the brine plume dispersing near the bottom started usually as a 2 m deep layer narrowing with increased distance from the outfalls fig 2b when the area exactly at the discharge ports was sampled the vertical width of the brine plume was ca 10 m the brine formed a density current towards the open sea its full extent not characterized yet the bottom at the study area is homogenous with a gentle slope towards the open sea with no known bathymetric barriers such as rock outcrops or reefs that may block the dispersion of the brine and cause its accumulation near the outfall the maximal length of the area with excess salinity 1 was greater than 4 4 km for comparison when the palmachim plant discharged the brine at 10 m depth excess salinity 1 was observed up to 1 km only from the outfall however the maximal excess salinity reached 15 when the production was at 90 mm3 y kress and galil 2012 kress et al 2014b comparison among the modeling results and the field observations showed that the simulated area with excess salinity 1 was usually smaller than the actual observations table 2 fig s1 the same is true for the size of the area with 3 excess salinity that was common to both outfalls in the model but observed at times as two separate areas around the outfalls both the model and the in situ observations showed a small usually 0 1 km2 area with 5 excess salinity a similar underestimation of the model was found for the ashdod swro plant where the simulated area with 1 excess salinity was smaller by factor of 19 and 2 in the spring and fall surveys conducted in 2018 shoham frider et al 2019 an additional modeling of the brine dispersion in the area using the mike3 hd hydrodynamic biton et al 2019 found that the maximal plume size in which excess salinity exceeded 1 was confined to 2 km similar to value found by the cameri simulation and smaller than the lengths observed in the field the brine dispersion in the winter was downslope towards the open sea while in the summer the simulation showed a propagation along the coastline excess salinity of 0 01 was simulated to cover a large part of the coast although not significant ecologically they speculated that brine presence may impact coastal water dynamics 5 2 comparison to other areas and to environmental guidelines in general field studies on swro plants brine discharge found excess salinity mostly in the 1 7 range although at some instances much higher values were reported brine was detected up to 5 km from the discharge site but most studies reported a return to ambient salinity within tens to a few hundred meters from the discharge site kress 2019 as expected large plants discharging brine with low initial dilution had a larger impact on salinity than smaller plants or plants discharging brine through optimized outfalls for example hypersalinity 3 maximal excess salinity was measured for a few kilometers from the outfall of the san pedro del pinatar swro plant spain prior to the installation of a diffuser while no increase in salinity was detected following its installation fernandez torquemada et al 2009 in algeria brine from the mostaganem plant discharged through a submerged outfall equipped with a diffuser increased seawater salinity by up to 9 and brine was detected up to 200 m from the outfall at the beni saf plant algeria with the same production capacity and brine discharge at the same water depth without a diffuser the maximal excess salinity measured was 72 and brine was detected up to 1 5 km from the outfall belatoui et al 2017 swro brine co mingled with cooling waters from power stations is discharged at the shoreline through open outfalls at hadera israel and carlsbad ca usa among others at hadera the brine plume was observed up to 2 5 km from the outfall and the maximal excess salinity measured was 10 while in carlsbad the brine plume was observed up to 1 km from the discharge and the maximal excess salinity observed was 13 petersen et al 2019 shpir and ben yosef 2017a table 4 compiles additional examples from the literature in israel there are no guidelines for the permissible increase of salinity at the discharge site nor on the compliance point distance safrai and zask 2008 globally there are a few usually requiring less than 5 excess salinity at the edge of the regulatory mixing zone 50 300 m from the discharge jenkins et al 2012 uddin et al 2011 viskovich et al 2014 the california ocean plan 2015 limits the increases of salinity to two psu over ambient about 6 excess salinity within 100 m from the discharge point brine discharge near sensitive areas such as near posidonia oceanica seagrass mats in spain may elicit stricter guidelines fuentes bargues 2014 palomar and losada 2010 comparison of the results of this study to the prevalent 5 excess salinity guideline showed that this guideline was exceeded during all surveys except one october 2018 table 2 however the exceedance area was small mostly 0 1 km2 only during the november 2014 survey the impacted area was 0 25 km2 and the maximal plume size 0 5 km table 2 therefore it can be carefully concluded that the excess salinity found in this study is mostly within the guidelines proposed elsewhere and that the design of the outfall systems is efficient for diluting the brine however the extent of the brine dispersion should be carefully followed in particular as brine was present at the reference station in 2018 5 3 seawater quality in addition to salinity increase and hence changes in seawater density it has been generally hypothesized that brine discharge could affect seawater quality by increasing temperature reducing oxygen solubility and concentration increasing turbidity changing ph increasing the ambient concentration of chemicals discharged with the brine originating from the desalination process coagulants antiscalants biocides cleaning solutions and metals from plant corrosion kress 2019 changes in seawater quality may in turn affect the biota in general and the pelagic microbial communities in particular belkin et al 2018 and references therein and affect chl a concentrations almost none were found in this study the results showed that brine had no effect on oxygen concentration and saturation nor on turbidity ph nutrients except for top and hence tp chl a and metal s concentration in seawater brine increased the seawater ambient temperature by up to 1 c at a limited small area around the outfalls this slight increase in temperature is not expected to influence the biota directly but it may give a natural edge to the establishment of non indigenous species nis in the presence of saline brine the israeli coast is known for its large amount of erythraean nis introduced through the suez canal most of the nis identified in the area of study are the macrobiota fish crustaceans polychaeta while smaller size taxa as the phytoplankton and bacteria that could influence the parameters studied here are largely unrecognized and undetected galil et al 2018 zenetos et al 2005 brine increased also the concentration of top in seawater compared to the reference values fig 3 this increase is attributed to the presence the polyphosphonate based antiscalants used by both desalination plants and discharged at sea with the brine fig 3 depicts the relationship of top to excess salinity to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such a correlation has been shown except along the israeli coast kress 2019 kress et al 2017 a similar correlation can be found also at the other desalination plants operating along the israeli mediterranean coast that also use polyphosphonate based antiscalants in the desalination process shoham frider et al 2019 shpir and ben yosef 2017b higher top a possible p source did not increase the phytoplankton community as indicated by chl a concentrations a proxy for phytoplankton this could be due to the existing natural excess of po4 p over n availability in the area kress et al 2019a rahav et al 2018 the average n p ratio computed from all samples in this study was 6 7 12 6 median 2 7 and similar 5 4 8 6 median 3 3 in the samples with excess salinity 1 table s1 these ratios are much lower than the redfield ratio of 16 1 found in phytoplankton redfield et al 1963 indicating n limitation of productivity in the area an additional reason may be that the p in the phosphonate bond c p is not bioavailable to the phytoplankton although it has been hypothesized that prochlorococcus the globally important marine primary producer may have the ability to utilize it feingersch et al 2012 the pelagic microbial community was not part of the monitoring program however in a related research brine discharge was shown in situ to change the relative composition of the community at the mediterranean coast of israel belkin et al 2017 moreover at the shallow palmachim outfall 10 m depth operational until march 2014 autotroph productivity was reduced by 30 in the summer compared to reference conditions at the ashqelon open shoreline outfall phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria biomass were reduced while productivity fluctuated between seasons an earlier study at the same site found a reduction in phytoplankton densities and their productivity per chl a when iron salts used as coagulants were still discharged in pulses with the continuous brine discharge drami et al 2011 in contrast no impact of brine discharge was found in microbial abundance in the red sea van der merwe et al 2014 5 4 plant operations and seawater quality seawater quality in spite of its importance to desalination plant operations is seldom addressed in environmental studies only harmful algal blooms hab have been extensively studied as they reduce production causing even temporary plant shutdowns unesco and ioc 2017 news services have reported on jelly fish clogging intakes and reducing freshwater production https www zavit org il en uncategorized jellyfish outbreaks might cost israel millions of euros each year for example accessed december 9 2019 in this study brine was not detected at the intake heads what could have increased the feedwater salinity and thus energy costs for desalination the engineering design of the discharge systems was able to prevent it however occasional polluted riverine discharge from the soreq river its mouth located opposite the intakes and pollution from the ashdod port fig 1 have caused problems for plant operations on march 2016 poorly treated domestic effluents discharged to the soreq river and subsequently to the sea initiated a bloom of the diatom asterionellopsis glacialis e rahav unpublished results and the palmachim plant was temporarily closed by order of the ministry of health a hermoni ceo palmachim plant personal communication on may 2017 both the soreq and palmachim plants temporarily stopped operations due to oil pollution origination from the ashdod port 5 5 conclusions and implications for environmental management seawater desalination will continue to increase globally and in israel in 2017 seawater desalination in the mediterranean supplied 582 mm3 y freshwater out of the 750 mm3 y planned to be provided by 2020 in 2012 the long term master plan for the national water section was redrawn and the goal is to provide 1750 mm3 y of freshwater by 2050 92 of the forecasted need for urban and industrial use http www water gov il hebrew planning and development planning masterplan doclib4 masterplan en v 4 pdf accessed december 9 2019 the increase in desalination effort will in turn increase marine discharge of brine in the already replete mediterranean sea coast the results of this study describing the seawater quality at the outfalls of two adjacent mega sized swro plants can serve as a basis for future management and regulatory acts the results showed that the models underestimated the extent of brine dispersion brine discharge did not impair the seawater quality except for a highly variable area near the bottom with excess salinity 1 ranging from 2 to 13 km2 with a plume size from 1 4 to 4 4 km seawater temperature was elevated near the outfalls and top higher than ambient in the presence of brine however this is a short term study encompassing 6 years since brine discharge started it is still unknown if the results of the study represent a steady state with temporal variability or the beginning of a slow incremental impact one evidence to the expansion of brine presence in the area may be its presence at the reference station in the 2018 surveys marine monitoring should continue for as long as the plants are operational and its findings critically reviewed the monitoring program should be re evaluated periodically for its frequency sampling stations and parameters measured and adapted when necessary based on the results of this study primary and bacterial production would be a useful additional biological parameter to characterize seawater quality moreover regulators should revise the environmental requirements in light of the technological advances in the desalination industry for example phosphorus discharge to the marine environment could be reduced or stopped by 1 improving pre treatment of seawater and thus reducing the use of the polyphosphonate based antiscalant 2 replacing it with green antiscalants biodegradable compounds that do not include phosphorus 3 using chemical free methodology dayarathne et al 2019 giwa et al 2017 pervov et al 2017 among others excess salinity could be decreased by reducing brine discharge implementing 1 hybrid processes 2 new or improved membranes 3 zero liquid discharge and water and salts recovery from the brine amy et al 2017 buonomenna 2013 tong and elimelech 2016 among others clearly implementing changes in the established desalination processes is a difficult task

18192,the use of coagulants and flocculants in the water and wastewater industry is predicted to increase further in the coming years alum is the most widely used coagulant however the use of ferric chloride fecl3 is gaining popularity drinking water production that uses fecl3 as coagulant produces waste sludge rich in iron we hypothesised that the iron rich drinking water sludge dws can potentially be used in the urban wastewater system to reduce dissolved sulfide in sewer systems aid phosphate removal in wastewater treatment and reduce hydrogen sulfide in the anaerobic digester biogas this hypothesis was investigated using two laboratory scale urban wastewater systems one as an experimental system and the other as a control each comprising sewer reactors a sequencing batch reactor sbr for wastewater treatment sludge thickeners and anaerobic digestion reactors both were fed with domestic wastewater the experimental system received in sewer dws dosing at 10 mgfe l 1 while the control had none the sulfide concentration in the experimental sewer effluent decreased by 3 5 0 2 mgs l 1 as compared with the control while the phosphate concentration decreased by 3 6 0 3 mgp l 1 after biological wastewater treatment in the experimental sbr the dissolved sulfide concentration in the experimental anaerobic digester also decreased by 15 9 0 9 mgs l 1 following the dws dosing to the sewer reactors the dws doing also enhanced the settleability of the mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss svi decreased from 193 2 22 2 to 108 0 7 7 ml g 1 and the dewaterability of the anaerobically digested sludge the cake solids concentration increased from 15 7 0 3 to 19 1 1 8 the introduction of dws into the experimental system significantly increased the cod and tss concentrations in the wastewater and consequently the mlss concentration in the sbr however this did not affect normal operation the results demonstrated that iron rich waste sludge from drinking water production can be used in the urban wastewater system achieving multiple benefits therefore an integrated approach to urban water and wastewater management should be considered to maximise the benefits of iron use in the system graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water sludge integrated urban wastewater system in sewer dosing sulfide removal wastewater treatment phosphorus removal anaerobic digestion dewaterability 1 introduction coagulants and flocculants are commonly used chemicals in water and wastewater treatment coagulants are chemicals added to promote clumping of colloidal particles in wastewater resulting in floc formation and flocculants enhance this process tchobanoglous et al 2014 according to bcc research 2018 the global market for these products was estimated to be 6 billion usd and is expected to rise to around 8 5 billion usd by the year 2023 aluminium or iron based metal coagulants are most commonly used aluminium based coagulants include aluminium sulfate aluminium chloride sodium aluminate and polyaluminium chloride iron based coagulants include ferric sulfate ferrous sulfate ferric chloride and ferric sulfate bratby 2016 zarchi et al 2013 aluminium or iron based metals are used at multiple points in an urban water system in drinking water treatment ferric or aluminium chemicals are added to the raw water for the removal of suspended solids and natural organic matter gitis and hankins 2018 at a controlled concentration and ph the iron and aluminium will precipitate as hydroxide flocs that bind suspended particles in the raw water enabling separation and removal alum which is a hydrated double sulfate salt of aluminium e g al2 so4 3 14h2o is the most popular coagulant with extensive application to drinking water treatment for several centuries however ferric chloride fecl3 is also used for drinking water treatment pikaar et al 2014 highlighted that the use of a sulfate based coagulant in drinking water production directly contributes a significant amount of sulfate to sewage increasing the likelihood of sewer odour and corrosion occurring due to h2s formation in comparison chloride based coagulants such as fecl3 circumvent this problem aluminium or iron based metals are also used in wastewater systems for phosphorus and or sulfide removal for example fecl3 or fecl2 is often added to sewer networks to precipitate sulfide this reduces the level of dissolved sulfide in sewage thus alleviating the notorious sewer corrosion and odour problems fecl3 or fecl2 is also added to anaerobic digesters at wastewater treatment plants to reduce the dissolved sulfide level and consequently the hydrogen sulfide content in biogas the latter causes corrosion of engines running on biogas as well as odour issues tchobanoglous et al 2014 park and novak 2013 similarly alum or fecl3 is also often used for chemical removal of phosphorus from wastewater the release of phosphorus into aquatic ecosystems causes eutrophication hence in many jurisdictions wastewater phosphorus discharge to receiving waters is strictly regulated tchobanoglous et al 2014 the addition of al3 or fe3 leads to metal phosphate precipitation and thus phosphate removal from the liquid phase bunce et al 2018 the addition of chemicals to wastewater changes the wastewater composition and thus impacts wastewater treatment plant operation hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 the effects of in sewer iron dosing on biological wastewater treatment and subsequent downstream processes was investigated by rebosura et al 2018 it was demonstrated at laboratory scale that dosing of fecl3 into sewers could remove phosphorus in the downstream wastewater treatment the ferrous sulfide fes formed in the sewers was oxidised during aeration at the treatment plant and the iron was made available again to precipitate phosphates in the wastewater a study by gutierrez et al 2010 found similar results in batch tests with sewage containing fes being mixed with aerated activated sludge which led to phosphorus decrease in the liquid phase the effects of in sewer dosing of fecl3 on downstream anaerobic digestion was also assessed by rebosura et al 2018 the ferric phosphate precipitates formed during aeration were concentrated in the sludge however under anaerobic conditions during sludge digestion the iron was released to precipitate with sulfides in the sludge the results are in line with the hypothesis of ge et al 2012 based on batch tests the multiple beneficial use of iron in an urban wastewater system has been verified in a recently completed field study salehin et al 2019 the above laboratory and field studies clearly demonstrated that iron added to sewers in the form of fecl3 for sulfide removal can be regenerated in the downstream wastewater treatment plant thus achieving three beneficial uses a question arises if the iron in an iron rich drinking water sludge dws is available for sulfide control in sewer networks and also subsequently available for phosphorus removal from wastewater and h2s removal from biogas at the downstream wastewater treatment plant ferric salts used in previous studies are in solution when dosed in sewers so iron is free to react with other substances however iron rich dws is a waste product where the iron has already been used for coagulation to answer the first part of the question sun et al 2015 conducted preliminary batch tests and showed that sulfide in sewers could be removed by dosing iron rich drinking water sludge with a performance comparable to that with fecl3 dosing zhang et al 2009 however these results were obtained in short term tests the long term performance of such an operation remains to be verified more importantly the availability of iron thus added to a sewer for phosphorus removal from wastewater and h2s removal from biogas at the downstream wastewater treatment plant has not been studied to date moreover the difference in composition between iron rich dws and ferric salts could potentially cause unintended effects dws carries additional solids and other substances which are not characteristics of ferric salts the fate of such solids and organics in a sewer and the downstream wastewater treatment plants is unknown the organic matter contained in the dws may also influence other biotransformation processes in the sewer wastewater treatment and anaerobic sludge digestion an increase in the carbon content of the wastewater could also affect the normal operation during treatment in summary iron rich dws dosing in sewers could potentially deliver beneficial effects to the wastewater system including sulfide control in sewer networks phosphorus removal during biological wastewater treatment and h2s control in biogas however it could also have unintended effects on the normal operation of sewers wastewater treatment and anaerobic digestion due to the additional solids introduced the aim of this study is to investigate all these effects by conducting long term comprehensive laboratory studies two identical laboratory scale reactor systems simulating the urban wastewater system were used each system consisted of sewer reactors an anoxic aerobic wastewater treatment reactor a sludge thickener and an anaerobic digester one of the systems served as the control and the other as the experimental system equipped with a sludge dosing unit to deliver iron rich dws both online monitoring and sampling were performed to comprehensively determine how the presence of iron rich dws affects the wastewater system 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water sludge and domestic sewage used in the study the iron rich drinking water sludge was sourced from a drinking water treatment plant operated by a large water utility in australia this plant uses fecl3 as a coagulant for the treatment of raw water resulting in the production of drinking water sludge the dws was collected from a gate valve that delivers the thickened sludge from the thickening tank to the drying beds of the plant the collected sewage was stored in a cold room at 4 c for use in this study the dws concentration varied in each container hence the feed sludge for the laboratory study was prepared in 1 l batches to an approximate concentration of 16 gsolids l 1 with resulting fe concentration of approximately 2 5 gfe l 1 the feed sludge was constantly stirred during the experiments each batch of dws feedstock was measured for cod and vss which showed little to no change over the duration of the study suggesting no significant signs of degradation the characteristics of the feed dws are summarised in table 1 the main metal component of the sludge is iron with a concentration of 157 9 3 1 mgfe gsolids 1 domestic sewage used for the study was collected weekly from a pumping station in residential saint lucia queensland australia sewage was stored in a cold room at 4 c for use over a week prior to feeding to the system the wastewater was brought to room temperature approximately 22 1 c the domestic sewage contained 7 4 0 6 and 4 5 1 0 mgs l 1 dissolved sulfide and sulfate respectively it also contained 105 7 9 1 mgsolids l 1 of total suspended solids and a total and soluble cod of 448 0 23 0 and 257 1 10 7 mgcod l 1 respectively other details on domestic sewage characteristics are described in table s1 2 2 laboratory scale urban wastewater system operation a laboratory scale reactor system was developed to study the effects of dws dosing on the urban wastewater system fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental laboratory system a similar system without the dws dosing unit was operated in parallel serving as the control the laboratory reactor system consisted of three major components representing the sewer system biological wastewater treatment and anaerobic sludge digestion rebosura et al 2018 the sewer system was constructed to simulate rising mains two gas tight sealed reactors connected in series were set up for each line sewer reactor a and b fig 1 each sewer reactor held a volume of 0 75 l and had an internal diameter of 80 mm every 6 h 2 5 l of raw sewage was pumped to the sewer reactors sewage in the reactors was continuously mixed using magnetic stirrers mixdrive 1 eco at 250 rpm effluent from the sewer reactors was captured in a wet well for sampling a sequencing batch reactor sbr was set up for biological wastewater treatment to remove chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen as seen in fig 1 the reactor had a total volume of 14 l and a working volume of 8 5 l the sbr was operated in 6 h cycles with 2 h of anoxic mixing 3 h of aerobic mixing and around 45 min of settling before decanting wastewater from the buffer tank was fed to the sbr during the first few minutes of the anoxic phase wastewater was continuously stirred using an overhead stirrer labco 20 l stirrer during the anoxic and aerobic periods the sbr was operated with a solids retention time srt of 25 days by wasting 0 085 l of activated sludge to the thickener during the last 5 min of the aerobic phase the ph level and dissolved oxygen concentration were measured online using an inpro 3250i probe with an m400 transmitter and inpro 6860i probe with an m200 transmitter respectively metler toledo compressed air was supplied to the reactor during the aerobic phase and the do concentration was maintained between 1 5 and 3 5 mgo2 l 1 with a switch valve data collected for do and ph were stored in a programmable logic controller plc a program in labview operated the plc which was used to control all pumps and valves wasted sludge from the sbr was sent to the sludge thickener before feeding to the anaerobic digester ad fig 1 anaerobic digestion was carried out using a jacketed glass reactor with a total volume of 1 3 l 1 l working volume and 0 3 l head space maintained at a temperature of 37 c with a water bath the ad was operated with an srt of 20 days by wasting 0 05 l of sludge and feeding the same amount from the sbr for every day of operation the ad inoculum was collected from a full scale ad reactor which was operated for 18 months before the start of this study the biogas produced was measured using a tipping bucket gas counter before collection in a gas bag the ad was continuously mixed with a magnetic stirrer mixdrive 1 eco temperature and ph were monitored online using an inpro 3250i probe with an m200 transmitter from metler toledo with data logged with the plc 2 3 experimental design and monitoring protocol the two reactor systems were operated in two phases the baseline phase phase i and the experimental phase phase ii the reactor systems had already been operated for more than 24 months for experimental dosing of fecl3 rebosura et al 2018 which led to some variability between the experimental and control phase 1 baseline as will be further described the dws experiments were carried out after 9 month recovery of the systems without fecl3 dosing in phase i of the experiment the two systems were operated identically until pseudo steady state was achieved with comparable performance between the control and experimental lines phase ii commenced on day 739 the dws dosing system was designed to deliver around 10 ml of dws 16 gsolids l 1 to the experimental sewer reactor in each pumping event i e to 2 5 l of sewage giving a final fe concentration of approximately 10 mgfe l 1 the dosing rate used in this study was similar to the fecl3 dosing carried out by rebosura et al 2018 an extensive sampling protocol was implemented in conjunction with the online monitoring described in the previous section this was implemented to comprehensively assess the impacts and unintended effects of dws dosing in the system table 2 summarises the sampling protocol for the sewer reactors sbrs and anaerobic digesters to further investigate the biological and chemical reactions occurring in the systems cycle studies were performed on both sewer reactors and sbrs sewer cycle studies involved the collection of filtered grab samples at designated time intervals to determine sulfur transformations and interactions with iron sbr cycle studies were carried out within the 6 h cycle period as described in section 2 2 2 4 analytical methods system samples were measured for dissolved sulfur species so4 2 hs so3 2 and s2o3 2 before analysis samples were prepared by filtering wastewater samples 0 22 μm millipore millex gp immediately after extraction from the system and preserved with a sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob solution developed by keller lehmann et al 2006 which contains a mixture of ascorbic acid and sodium hydroxide the samples were analysed using ion

shimadzu toc l csh total organic carbon analyser with a tnm l tn unit the methane content of the biogas produced in the anaerobic digesters was measured using a gas chromatograph gc 8ait shimadzu japan equipped with a porapak q column and thermal conductivity detector the dissolved methane formed in the sewer reactors was measured using the protocol described by guisasola et al 2008 filtered wastewater samples were injected into a 12 ml vacuumed exetainer vial after reaching equilibrium methane in the gas phase was measured using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 9a equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the concentration of methane in the wastewater was calculated using henry s law and converted to cod units the dewaterability of digested sludge samples was assessed according to wei et al 2018 sludge samples were centrifuged at 3273 g for 10 min decanting the liquid and retaining the settled solids the cationic polymer was added to the solids until coagulation occurred as determined by visual inspection the samples were centrifuged through a belt fibre filter at 3273 g for 10 min the sludge cake was dried for at least 6 h at 105 c in pre weighed crucibles the percent solids content of the sludge was determined after drying the sludge samples for xrd measurement were prepared by freeze drying the samples under vacuum conditions the samples are then powdered in an anaerobic chamber x ray diffactograms were recorded with a d8 bruker diffractometer using a cu kα1 radiation at λ 1 55 å the diffractometer was equipped with a θ 2θ goniometer and a position sensitive detector reflections were collected under ambient conditions within the 5 80 2θ range with a step width of 0 02 and 1 2 s step of collecting time the resultant peaks at 2θ were obtained using diffrac eva v 4 software and the peaks were identified by using the icdd the international centre for diffraction data pdf 4 2019 database 2 5 statistical analysis two time series were generated for each of the measured parameters from the long term monitoring of the control and experimental systems the difference between the series was determined by subtracting the control data from the experimental data and from this the mean and standard error were calculated the t test was used to determine significant differences from zero at 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of dosing iron rich drinking water sludge in sewer the effect of dosing iron rich dws on the dissolved sulfide concentration in the experimental sewer reactor see fig 1 sampling point 2 is shown in fig 2 during the baseline period phase i day 607 738 the difference between the control and experimental lines although statistically significant remained very small 0 4 0 1 mgs l 1 p 0 05 dws dosing started on day 739 phase ii immediately after dws was introduced into the system 3 5 0 1 mgs l 1of dissolved sulfide on average was removed from the experimental sewer reactor throughout phase ii this clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of dws dosing in sewers for sulfide control during phase ii of the study the average sulfide concentration was 9 2 0 4 mgs l 1 in the control sewer reactor effluent and 5 7 0 3 mgs l 1 for the experimental line fig 3 a the relative decrease in dissolved sulfide concentration was 38 2 2 3 comparable to other studies dosing fecl3 into sewers for sulfide control nielsen et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 rebosura et al 2018 the decrease in dissolved sulfide in the sewers was mainly due to physiochemical reactions between sulfide and the iron in the dws sun et al 2015 analysis of the dws used in the study revealed that the majority of the iron was in the sludge solids and that iron content in the aqueous phase was negligible the theoretical molar ratio of sulfide removed by iron from dws was 0 61 mmols mmolfe 1 and this molar ratio was very similar to the fecl3 dosing study by rebosura et al 2018 with 0 68 mmols mmolfe 1 the values are within the range of s fe ratios of 0 5 2 reported by firer et al 2008 this suggests that an equivalent amount of iron is able to precipitate with sulfide in sewer regardless of whether iron rich dws or fecl3 is dosed for the complete removal of sulfides in sewer the dosing rate would need to be higher than what was used in this study here the dosing rate was designed to show the possible flow on effects in the downstream wastewater treatment plant if the experimentally dosed iron was in excess complete removal of sulfides in the sewer reactor would have masked the potential benefits in the sbr and anaerobic digester the sulfate concentrations in the control and experimental sewer reactor effluents were not significantly different p 0 05 at 3 2 0 4 mgs l 1 and 3 4 0 3 mgs l 1 respectively fig 3 in some cases the introduction of iron to the system will inhibit sulfate reducing bacteria activity as much as 60 zhang et al 2009 but that was not the case in this study the phosphate concentration of the sewer experimental line effluent at 5 7 0 3 mgp l 1 was lower than the control line at 6 2 0 2 mgp l 1 p 0 05 the lower phosphate concentration in the experimental line effluent was likely caused by ferric ion reacting with phosphate and precipitating from the bulk liquid the experimental sewer reactor effluent contained fe concentration of 0 5 0 1 mgfe l 1 as compared with 0 1 0 0 mgfe l 1 in the control reactor effluent p 0 05 the low concertation of soluble fe in the experimental system where dws was dosed to the sewer reactor shows that most of the iron participated in precipitation reaction however this did not affect the ph which was similar in the two systems the dosing of iron rich dws in the sewer reactors decreased the soluble cod concentrations by 32 1 11 0 mgcod l 1 p 0 05 this was likely caused by the coagulative nature of iron removing some soluble cod from the bulk liquid binnie et al 2018 however the concentrations of the total cod and tss significantly increased with a mean difference of 66 0 22 9 mgcod l 1 and 52 5 8 6 mgsolids l 1 respectively p 0 05 as compared with the control systems this increase was due to the additional cod and tss contained within the dws dosed into the system 3 2 flow on effects of in sewer dws dosing on wastewater treatment performance in the laboratory scale system sbrs were used to represent biological treatment at a wastewater treatment plant fig 1 the soluble phosphate concentrations of the control and experimental sbrs are shown in fig 4 in phase i during the baseline period the profiles of the control and experimental lines were very similar having a mean difference of 0 1 0 1 mgp l 1 p 0 05 the experimental line sbr effluent exhibited significantly lower concentrations of phosphate as compared with the control line p 0 05 the average phosphate concentration of the control line was 6 4 0 4 mgp l 1 whereas the experimental line was 2 8 0 5 mgp l 1 the mean difference between the two lines was 3 6 0 3 mgp l 1 fig 5 a corresponding to a relative decrease in soluble phosphates of 59 5 5 7 dosing of iron rich dws into sewers removes dissolved sulfides in the wastewater through precipitation forming iron sulfides this study suggests that iron sulfide precipitates that enter the sbr are oxidised during aeration regenerating available iron to precipitate with phosphates the theoretical molar ratio between the phosphorus precipitated and the amount of iron added to the system was calculated to be 0 65 mmolp mmolfe 1 the molar ratio observed in this study was similar to the p fe molar ratio of 0 63 mmolp mmolfe 1 observed by rebosura et al 2018 when fecl3 was dosed into the system similarly gutierrez et al 2010 recorded a p fe molar ratio of 0 79 mmolp mmolfe 1 from laboratory scale batch test experiments finding that the addition of fecl3 to sewers for sulfide control was also able to remove phosphorus in the downstream wastewater treatment the regulations on phosphorus discharge from wwtp are getting tighter and the cost of chemicals getting higher schaum 2018 the additional phosphates removed from wastewater treatment plants could mean savings for utilities in extra chemical costs the average sulfate concentration of the sbr effluents was 15 5 0 6 and 13 8 0 5 mgs l 1 for the control and experimental systems respectively the concentration of sulfate in the control sbr was slightly higher than 1 7 0 8 mgs l 1 that of the experimental sbr fig 5b but the difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 this indicates that when the fes formed in the experimental sewers was oxidised in the sbr most of the sulfate was produced as the oxidation of dissolved sulfide in the control sbr the small difference in sulfate concentration may be attributed to the fes that was not fully oxidised as shown in the xrd analysis the soluble iron concentration fig 5c in the sbr effluent for both control and experimental systems was very low implying most of the fe from the dws participated in reactions which incorporated the fe into the sbr sludge ammonium concentrations fig 5d of the control and experimental sbrs were very similar indicating that the presence of fe in the experimental system did not affect ammonium conversion see also fig s3 nitrate on the other hand was significantly different p 0 05 in the experimental and control effluents in both phase i and phase ii fig 5e this was likely due to the difference in the sludge settleability fig 5o the sludge in the experimental system had poorer settleability in both phases which likely resulted in enhanced denitrification during settling and decanting due to increased contact time between sludge and the treated water it should be highlighted that sludge settleability in the experimental reactor improved significantly with svi decreasing from phase i 193 2 22 2 ml g 1 to 108 0 7 7 ml g 1 in phase ii p 0 05 the introduction of iron with coagulative properties aided sludge settleability the solids concentrations in the control and experimental sbr effluents were similar as was the total cod soluble cod and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations fig 5g h i j k the addition of dws also adds additional solids and organic carbon to the system however these additions did not have negative effects on effluent quality the mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations were also measured in the sbrs fig 5l the mlss and mlvss concentrations were significantly higher i e by 1125 0 168 7 mgsolids l 1 and 624 4 142 5 mgsolids l 1 respectively in the experimental system than in the control system p 0 05 the experimental and control sbrs were operated identically with the same sludge wastage flow to maintain the same srt the increase in solids was a combination of the solids from dws and the precipitated solids from fe reactions this was also evident in the concentration of total iron in the mlss fig 5n with 22 2 8 7 mgfe l 1 in the control and 217 9 10 4 mgfe l 1 in the experimental system this shows that most of the iron that precipitated with the phosphates were contained in the sludge the control and experimental sbr sludges were also analysed via x ray diffraction xrd the spectrum for the experimental sludge showed that along with fes minerals such as vivianite and struvite were also present fig s1 the presence of these minerals may be due to the partial or incomplete oxidation of fes 3 3 flow on effects of in sewer dws dosing on anaerobic digester performance the iron from the dws dosed into the sewers eventually makes its way to the anaerobic digesters ad at the wastewater treatment plant through the thickened waste activated sludge was fed to the digester fig 1 the sulfide that formed during anaerobic digestion precipitated with ferric ions which were released from ferric phosphates that had been formed during biological wastewater treatment the baseline concentrations of dissolved sulfide in the control and experimental ads were different before in sewer dws dosing phase i fig 6 a as mentioned in section 2 3 the control line previously received fecl3 dosing which led to lower dissolved sulfide concentration in the control ad rebosura et al 2018 the dissolved sulfide concentration did not return to the normal level even 9 months after the fecl3 dosing was stopped i e in phase i we hypothesised that some iron might have attached to the walls of the small ad reactor 1 3 l which was gradually released and participated in sulfide removal however there is a clear decrease in dissolved sulfide in the experimental reactor after the start of dws dosing in the sewer the average dissolved sulfide concentration of the experimental ad sludge dropped from 17 3 1 0 mgs l 1 in phase i to 1 4 0 1 mgs l 1 in phase ii corresponding to a 91 9 relative decrease after the introduction of iron rich dws into the system the low concentration of dissolved sulfide in the liquid phase also translates to a lower concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the anaerobic digester biogas as demonstrated by rebosura et al 2018 in a long term study with fecl3 dosing into laboratory scale sewers the control of hydrogen sulfide in wastewater can mitigate odour and corrosion in the treatment plant and also in industries that uses biogas generated from wastewater sludge anaerobic digestion this translates to significant savings in maintenance costs for utilities and biogas utilising industries fig 6b presents the biogas production profiles of the control and experimental ads in phases i and ii the biogas production rate was lower in the experimental line than in the control line in both phases with a difference of 11 6 1 3 ml day 1 the consistent difference suggests that the difference was not caused by the iron rich sludge dosing to the sewer but by some other factors it is also important to observe that the biogas production in the experimental reactor remained similar before and after the introduction of iron sludge into the system at 41 4 0 9 ml day 1 in phase i and 40 0 4 3 ml day 1 in phase ii p 0 05 novak and park 2010 demonstrated with laboratory batch reactors that direct addition of iron to anaerobic digesters did not cause any negative effects on biogas production the methane content in biogas in the control and experimental reactors was almost identical at 76 0 0 8 and 75 9 0 6 respectively p 0 05 the percentage of methane produced in the laboratory scale ads was higher than that typically produced by full scale anaerobic digesters i e 60 70 tchobanoglous et al 2014 the parameters presented did not display significant effects on the ad operation performance the soluble phosphate concentration of the digested sludge from the experimental system was 42 2 5 0 mgp l 1 lower than that of the control p 0 05 fig 7 b the total fe in the system was in excess and was more than enough to have simultaneous precipitation of sulfide and phosphate however iron chemistry is complicated small changes in the iron precipitates have the possibility for enough sulfide removal without necessarily leading to the release of phosphate the difference in phosphate concentration must still be due to the iron phosphate precipitates formed in the ad xrd measurements shown in fig s2a confirms the presence of vivianite in the anaerobically digested sludge the ammonium concentrations for both control and experimental systems were similar as were the respective ph values fig 7c and d the presence of iron did not affect these parameters significantly the total iron concentration in the ad sludges was 71 6 3 7 mgfe l 1 in the control and 669 8 59 0 mgfe l 1 in the experimental system fig 7f similar to the trends in solids content of the mlss in the sbr the solids concentration of the digested sludge was 10 464 8 220 3 mgsolids l 1 in the control system and 13 666 7 500 5 mgsolids l 1 in the experimental system fig 7g this is expected as more solids were fed to the experimental line than to the control line dewaterability of the digested sludge in the control and experimental systems was monitored throughout the study fig 7i the percentage of solids obtained after dewatering the digested sludge was 15 7 0 3 in the control system and 19 1 0 5 in the experimental system the addition of iron rich dws in the sewers and the residual iron that entered the ad improved the dewaterability of the digested sludge with a relative increase of 21 7 0 6 as compared with the control system the presence of iron in the sludge could have increased the flocculation of the sludge which enabled it to release more bound water similar to the addition of sludge conditioners zhou et al 2015 the improvement in dewaterability is also similar to what was observed by rebosura et al 2018 where dosing fecl3 into sewers resulted in a relative increase of around 18 in dewaterability 3 4 fate of cod and solids from the dws in the laboratory wastewater system the addition of dws into the laboratory wastewater system also introduced additional cod and solids fig 8 the influent sewage introduced around 4 48 0 23 gcod day 1 and 1 06 0 09 gsolids day 1 of tss respectively to the systems the experimental system dosed with dws received an additional 0 36 0 09 gcod day 1 and 0 65 0 02 gsolids day 1 of tss very little cod removal took place in the sewer reactors the tss and vss in sewer effluent were slightly lower than their values in the feed 9 13 suggesting some minor breakdown of solids in the sewer reactors the sewer reactor effluent enters the sbr with 4 25 0 27 gcod day 1 and 4 91 0 09 gcod day 1 for the control and experimental systems respectively along with a tss of 0 96 0 08 gsolids day 1 and 1 48 0 05 gsolids day 1 for the control and experimental systems respectively the higher tss of the influent to the experimental sbr was due to the additional tss in the dws and the fes precipitates formed in the sewer reactors the additional solids loading to the experimental sbr resulted in mlss and mlvss concentrations of 4 12 0 10 gsolids l 1 and 3 25 0 08 gsolids l 1 respectively 42 and 24 higher than the respective mlss and mlvss concentrations of 2 90 0 10 gsolids l 1 and 2 62 0 10 gsolids l 1 in the control sbr this means dws dosing to sewers contributes significantly to the mlss in a wastewater treatment reactor and therefore may not be applicable when the wastewater treatment reactor is already working at or close to the acceptable mlss limit the improvement to sludge settleability as observed in this study from 193 2 22 2 ml g 1 in phase i to 108 0 7 7 ml g 1 in phase ii may partially alleviate this issue there were two outgoing streams from the sbr namely the treated effluent and the was the treated wastewater effluent cod concentrations for the control and experimental sbrs were similar at 0 72 0 06 gcod day 1 and 0 66 0 06 gcod day 1 respectively both the control and experimental sbr effluent tss was 0 05 0 01 gsolids day 1 however the experimental sbr produced significantly higher amounts of solids and cod in the was stream than the control sbr the tss and vss discharge rates were 1 40 0 03 gsolids day 1 and 1 10 0 03 gsolids day 1 respectively 43 and 24 higher than the tss and vss discharge rates from the control sbr at 0 98 0 04 gsolids day 1 and 0 89 0 03 gsolids day 1 respectively similarly the was tcod discharge rate from the experimental sbr at 1 64 0 06 gcod day 1 was 32 higher than that from the control sbr at 1 24 0 07 gcod day 1 this means that the dws dosing to the experimental sewer resulted in significantly higher solids and organic loading rate to the ad reactor it is important to note that the total cod loading to the control and experimental lines was 4 48 0 23 gcod day 1 and 4 84 0 23 gcod day 1 respectively fig 8 the total cod discharge sludge effluent was 1 96 0 09 gcod day 1 for the control sbr and 2 30 0 08 gcod day 1 for the experimental sbr this means that the total cod removal was 2 52 0 25 gcod day 1 for the control line and 2 54 0 24 gcod day 1 for the experimental line after aerobic treatment in the sbr the similar removal rates suggest that the cod in the dws was largely non biodegradable waste sludge from the sbr was thickened before feeding to the ad sludge loading to the control ad was 0 83 0 03 gcod day 1 and 0 67 0 02 gsolids day 1 of tss however around 32 of solids were lost in the thickener the experimental system received a sludge loading of 0 82 0 03 gcod day 1 and 0 84 0 04 gsolids day 1 of tss with around 40 solids loss in the thickener due to design limitations of the laboratory scale thickener the two ad reactors achieved similar vss destruction at 23 and 24 respectively if no sludge had been lost in the thickening process the experimental ad would discharge solids at 1 1 0 05 gsolids day 1 while the control ad would discharge solids at 0 76 0 01 gsolids day 1 the additional solids discharge from the experimental line is 0 44 0 06 gsolids day 1 or 40 higher considering the improvement to sludge dewaterability the volume of sludge to be discharged would be only 19 higher as the dws was added at a rate of 0 65 0 02 gsolids day 1 the total solids discharge from the experimental line would be 22 lower than the combined solids discharge rate should the dws and wastewater sludge be discharged separately 3 5 implications iron and aluminium based coagulants are typically used in drinking water treatment however the use of alum as coagulant in drinking water treatment contributes a significant amount of sulfate to sewage sulfate in sewage is converted to hydrogen sulfide in sewer causing sewer odour and corrosion pikaar et al 2014 as demonstrated in this study if drinking water utilities use fecl3 as coagulant instead of alum the iron rich sludge produced when dosed to sewers could significantly reduce the demand and cost for chemical use for sulfide control in sewers phosphate removal in wastewater treatment and hydrogen sulfide control in anaerobic digester biogas production this strategy also turns dws from a waste product into a valuable resource there were concerns of potential unintended consequences brought about by dosing of dws into sewers however this study demonstrated that the in sewer dws dosing does not interfere with biological carbon or nitrogen removal in a wastewater treatment reactor or vss destruction in an anaerobic sludge digester in particular the dissolved organic carbon analysis of the wastewater treatment effluents showed that there was no significant difference between the control and experimental systems suggesting the potential release of organic carbon contained in dws did not result in additional dissolved organic carbon in effluent the dws dosing significantly increased the solids concentration in sewage and also in all process units the elevated solids concentration in sewage could potentially increase sedimentation in sewers unfortunately this could not be assessed in a small scale laboratory sewer as used in this study experiments in larger scale sewers are required to assess this potential issue this study revealed that in sewer dws dosing could substantially increase the mlss concentration in the wastewater treatment reactor 42 in this study this could potentially limit the applicability of the proposed strategy in some of the urban wastewater systems it was observed however that the sludge settleability was improved 44 in this study which could partially alleviate the above issue the in sewer dosing of dws resulted in more solids disposal in the downstream wastewater treatment plant 44 increase was observed in this study although this issue could be partially alleviated by enhanced dewaterability 18 improvement in this study the sludge disposal costs for the wastewater treatment plant are likely to increase significantly however the proposed strategy involves discharging dws to sewers which means the disposal costs for dws would be reduced substantially when the disposal costs for both dws and wastewater sludge are considered the proposed strategy is expected to reduce the overall sludge disposal costs estimated to be 22 in this study this study provides a strong argument that urban drinking water and wastewater systems should be managed holistically as an integrated system for maximum benefits 4 conclusions the feasibility of the use of iron rich dws for in sewer dosing and its flow on effects on the downstream wastewater and sludge treatment processes were investigated this was done using a laboratory scale reactor system simulating the urban wastewater system it can be concluded that in sewer iron rich dws dosing effectively decreases dissolved sulfide concentrations in the sewers contributes to phosphorus removal during downstream wastewater treatment decreases and controls dissolved sulfide in the downstream anaerobic sludge digester with negligible effects on biogas productivity improves activated sludge settleability in wastewater treatment and the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge significantly increases cod and solids concentration in the wastewater treatment plant but does not affect the effluent quality or the anaerobic sludge digestion performance however the higher mlss concentration in the wastewater treatment reactor implies that dws dosing to sewers should be avoided for treatment systems already operated at high mlss concentrations increases sludge disposal costs for the wastewater treatment plant but expected to reduce the combined disposal costs for dws and wastewater sludge iron can be re used for multiple times throughout the urban wastewater system and these

18192,the use of coagulants and flocculants in the water and wastewater industry is predicted to increase further in the coming years alum is the most widely used coagulant however the use of ferric chloride fecl3 is gaining popularity drinking water production that uses fecl3 as coagulant produces waste sludge rich in iron we hypothesised that the iron rich drinking water sludge dws can potentially be used in the urban wastewater system to reduce dissolved sulfide in sewer systems aid phosphate removal in wastewater treatment and reduce hydrogen sulfide in the anaerobic digester biogas this hypothesis was investigated using two laboratory scale urban wastewater systems one as an experimental system and the other as a control each comprising sewer reactors a sequencing batch reactor sbr for wastewater treatment sludge thickeners and anaerobic digestion reactors both were fed with domestic wastewater the experimental system received in sewer dws dosing at 10 mgfe l 1 while the control had none the sulfide concentration in the experimental sewer effluent decreased by 3 5 0 2 mgs l 1 as compared with the control while the phosphate concentration decreased by 3 6 0 3 mgp l 1 after biological wastewater treatment in the experimental sbr the dissolved sulfide concentration in the experimental anaerobic digester also decreased by 15 9 0 9 mgs l 1 following the dws dosing to the sewer reactors the dws doing also enhanced the settleability of the mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss svi decreased from 193 2 22 2 to 108 0 7 7 ml g 1 and the dewaterability of the anaerobically digested sludge the cake solids concentration increased from 15 7 0 3 to 19 1 1 8 the introduction of dws into the experimental system significantly increased the cod and tss concentrations in the wastewater and consequently the mlss concentration in the sbr however this did not affect normal operation the results demonstrated that iron rich waste sludge from drinking water production can be used in the urban wastewater system achieving multiple benefits therefore an integrated approach to urban water and wastewater management should be considered to maximise the benefits of iron use in the system graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water sludge integrated urban wastewater system in sewer dosing sulfide removal wastewater treatment phosphorus removal anaerobic digestion dewaterability 1 introduction coagulants and flocculants are commonly used chemicals in water and wastewater treatment coagulants are chemicals added to promote clumping of colloidal particles in wastewater resulting in floc formation and flocculants enhance this process tchobanoglous et al 2014 according to bcc research 2018 the global market for these products was estimated to be 6 billion usd and is expected to rise to around 8 5 billion usd by the year 2023 aluminium or iron based metal coagulants are most commonly used aluminium based coagulants include aluminium sulfate aluminium chloride sodium aluminate and polyaluminium chloride iron based coagulants include ferric sulfate ferrous sulfate ferric chloride and ferric sulfate bratby 2016 zarchi et al 2013 aluminium or iron based metals are used at multiple points in an urban water system in drinking water treatment ferric or aluminium chemicals are added to the raw water for the removal of suspended solids and natural organic matter gitis and hankins 2018 at a controlled concentration and ph the iron and aluminium will precipitate as hydroxide flocs that bind suspended particles in the raw water enabling separation and removal alum which is a hydrated double sulfate salt of aluminium e g al2 so4 3 14h2o is the most popular coagulant with extensive application to drinking water treatment for several centuries however ferric chloride fecl3 is also used for drinking water treatment pikaar et al 2014 highlighted that the use of a sulfate based coagulant in drinking water production directly contributes a significant amount of sulfate to sewage increasing the likelihood of sewer odour and corrosion occurring due to h2s formation in comparison chloride based coagulants such as fecl3 circumvent this problem aluminium or iron based metals are also used in wastewater systems for phosphorus and or sulfide removal for example fecl3 or fecl2 is often added to sewer networks to precipitate sulfide this reduces the level of dissolved sulfide in sewage thus alleviating the notorious sewer corrosion and odour problems fecl3 or fecl2 is also added to anaerobic digesters at wastewater treatment plants to reduce the dissolved sulfide level and consequently the hydrogen sulfide content in biogas the latter causes corrosion of engines running on biogas as well as odour issues tchobanoglous et al 2014 park and novak 2013 similarly alum or fecl3 is also often used for chemical removal of phosphorus from wastewater the release of phosphorus into aquatic ecosystems causes eutrophication hence in many jurisdictions wastewater phosphorus discharge to receiving waters is strictly regulated tchobanoglous et al 2014 the addition of al3 or fe3 leads to metal phosphate precipitation and thus phosphate removal from the liquid phase bunce et al 2018 the addition of chemicals to wastewater changes the wastewater composition and thus impacts wastewater treatment plant operation hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 the effects of in sewer iron dosing on biological wastewater treatment and subsequent downstream processes was investigated by rebosura et al 2018 it was demonstrated at laboratory scale that dosing of fecl3 into sewers could remove phosphorus in the downstream wastewater treatment the ferrous sulfide fes formed in the sewers was oxidised during aeration at the treatment plant and the iron was made available again to precipitate phosphates in the wastewater a study by gutierrez et al 2010 found similar results in batch tests with sewage containing fes being mixed with aerated activated sludge which led to phosphorus decrease in the liquid phase the effects of in sewer dosing of fecl3 on downstream anaerobic digestion was also assessed by rebosura et al 2018 the ferric phosphate precipitates formed during aeration were concentrated in the sludge however under anaerobic conditions during sludge digestion the iron was released to precipitate with sulfides in the sludge the results are in line with the hypothesis of ge et al 2012 based on batch tests the multiple beneficial use of iron in an urban wastewater system has been verified in a recently completed field study salehin et al 2019 the above laboratory and field studies clearly demonstrated that iron added to sewers in the form of fecl3 for sulfide removal can be regenerated in the downstream wastewater treatment plant thus achieving three beneficial uses a question arises if the iron in an iron rich drinking water sludge dws is available for sulfide control in sewer networks and also subsequently available for phosphorus removal from wastewater and h2s removal from biogas at the downstream wastewater treatment plant ferric salts used in previous studies are in solution when dosed in sewers so iron is free to react with other substances however iron rich dws is a waste product where the iron has already been used for coagulation to answer the first part of the question sun et al 2015 conducted preliminary batch tests and showed that sulfide in sewers could be removed by dosing iron rich drinking water sludge with a performance comparable to that with fecl3 dosing zhang et al 2009 however these results were obtained in short term tests the long term performance of such an operation remains to be verified more importantly the availability of iron thus added to a sewer for phosphorus removal from wastewater and h2s removal from biogas at the downstream wastewater treatment plant has not been studied to date moreover the difference in composition between iron rich dws and ferric salts could potentially cause unintended effects dws carries additional solids and other substances which are not characteristics of ferric salts the fate of such solids and organics in a sewer and the downstream wastewater treatment plants is unknown the organic matter contained in the dws may also influence other biotransformation processes in the sewer wastewater treatment and anaerobic sludge digestion an increase in the carbon content of the wastewater could also affect the normal operation during treatment in summary iron rich dws dosing in sewers could potentially deliver beneficial effects to the wastewater system including sulfide control in sewer networks phosphorus removal during biological wastewater treatment and h2s control in biogas however it could also have unintended effects on the normal operation of sewers wastewater treatment and anaerobic digestion due to the additional solids introduced the aim of this study is to investigate all these effects by conducting long term comprehensive laboratory studies two identical laboratory scale reactor systems simulating the urban wastewater system were used each system consisted of sewer reactors an anoxic aerobic wastewater treatment reactor a sludge thickener and an anaerobic digester one of the systems served as the control and the other as the experimental system equipped with a sludge dosing unit to deliver iron rich dws both online monitoring and sampling were performed to comprehensively determine how the presence of iron rich dws affects the wastewater system 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water sludge and domestic sewage used in the study the iron rich drinking water sludge was sourced from a drinking water treatment plant operated by a large water utility in australia this plant uses fecl3 as a coagulant for the treatment of raw water resulting in the production of drinking water sludge the dws was collected from a gate valve that delivers the thickened sludge from the thickening tank to the drying beds of the plant the collected sewage was stored in a cold room at 4 c for use in this study the dws concentration varied in each container hence the feed sludge for the laboratory study was prepared in 1 l batches to an approximate concentration of 16 gsolids l 1 with resulting fe concentration of approximately 2 5 gfe l 1 the feed sludge was constantly stirred during the experiments each batch of dws feedstock was measured for cod and vss which showed little to no change over the duration of the study suggesting no significant signs of degradation the characteristics of the feed dws are summarised in table 1 the main metal component of the sludge is iron with a concentration of 157 9 3 1 mgfe gsolids 1 domestic sewage used for the study was collected weekly from a pumping station in residential saint lucia queensland australia sewage was stored in a cold room at 4 c for use over a week prior to feeding to the system the wastewater was brought to room temperature approximately 22 1 c the domestic sewage contained 7 4 0 6 and 4 5 1 0 mgs l 1 dissolved sulfide and sulfate respectively it also contained 105 7 9 1 mgsolids l 1 of total suspended solids and a total and soluble cod of 448 0 23 0 and 257 1 10 7 mgcod l 1 respectively other details on domestic sewage characteristics are described in table s1 2 2 laboratory scale urban wastewater system operation a laboratory scale reactor system was developed to study the effects of dws dosing on the urban wastewater system fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental laboratory system a similar system without the dws dosing unit was operated in parallel serving as the control the laboratory reactor system consisted of three major components representing the sewer system biological wastewater treatment and anaerobic sludge digestion rebosura et al 2018 the sewer system was constructed to simulate rising mains two gas tight sealed reactors connected in series were set up for each line sewer reactor a and b fig 1 each sewer reactor held a volume of 0 75 l and had an internal diameter of 80 mm every 6 h 2 5 l of raw sewage was pumped to the sewer reactors sewage in the reactors was continuously mixed using magnetic stirrers mixdrive 1 eco at 250 rpm effluent from the sewer reactors was captured in a wet well for sampling a sequencing batch reactor sbr was set up for biological wastewater treatment to remove chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen as seen in fig 1 the reactor had a total volume of 14 l and a working volume of 8 5 l the sbr was operated in 6 h cycles with 2 h of anoxic mixing 3 h of aerobic mixing and around 45 min of settling before decanting wastewater from the buffer tank was fed to the sbr during the first few minutes of the anoxic phase wastewater was continuously stirred using an overhead stirrer labco 20 l stirrer during the anoxic and aerobic periods the sbr was operated with a solids retention time srt of 25 days by wasting 0 085 l of activated sludge to the thickener during the last 5 min of the aerobic phase the ph level and dissolved oxygen concentration were measured online using an inpro 3250i probe with an m400 transmitter and inpro 6860i probe with an m200 transmitter respectively metler toledo compressed air was supplied to the reactor during the aerobic phase and the do concentration was maintained between 1 5 and 3 5 mgo2 l 1 with a switch valve data collected for do and ph were stored in a programmable logic controller plc a program in labview operated the plc which was used to control all pumps and valves wasted sludge from the sbr was sent to the sludge thickener before feeding to the anaerobic digester ad fig 1 anaerobic digestion was carried out using a jacketed glass reactor with a total volume of 1 3 l 1 l working volume and 0 3 l head space maintained at a temperature of 37 c with a water bath the ad was operated with an srt of 20 days by wasting 0 05 l of sludge and feeding the same amount from the sbr for every day of operation the ad inoculum was collected from a full scale ad reactor which was operated for 18 months before the start of this study the biogas produced was measured using a tipping bucket gas counter before collection in a gas bag the ad was continuously mixed with a magnetic stirrer mixdrive 1 eco temperature and ph were monitored online using an inpro 3250i probe with an m200 transmitter from metler toledo with data logged with the plc 2 3 experimental design and monitoring protocol the two reactor systems were operated in two phases the baseline phase phase i and the experimental phase phase ii the reactor systems had already been operated for more than 24 months for experimental dosing of fecl3 rebosura et al 2018 which led to some variability between the experimental and control phase 1 baseline as will be further described the dws experiments were carried out after 9 month recovery of the systems without fecl3 dosing in phase i of the experiment the two systems were operated identically until pseudo steady state was achieved with comparable performance between the control and experimental lines phase ii commenced on day 739 the dws dosing system was designed to deliver around 10 ml of dws 16 gsolids l 1 to the experimental sewer reactor in each pumping event i e to 2 5 l of sewage giving a final fe concentration of approximately 10 mgfe l 1 the dosing rate used in this study was similar to the fecl3 dosing carried out by rebosura et al 2018 an extensive sampling protocol was implemented in conjunction with the online monitoring described in the previous section this was implemented to comprehensively assess the impacts and unintended effects of dws dosing in the system table 2 summarises the sampling protocol for the sewer reactors sbrs and anaerobic digesters to further investigate the biological and chemical reactions occurring in the systems cycle studies were performed on both sewer reactors and sbrs sewer cycle studies involved the collection of filtered grab samples at designated time intervals to determine sulfur transformations and interactions with iron sbr cycle studies were carried out within the 6 h cycle period as described in section 2 2 2 4 analytical methods system samples were measured for

ionization detector fid the concentration of methane in the wastewater was calculated using henry s law and converted to cod units the dewaterability of digested sludge samples was assessed according to wei et al 2018 sludge samples were centrifuged at 3273 g for 10 min decanting the liquid and retaining the settled solids the cationic polymer was added to the solids until coagulation occurred as determined by visual inspection the samples were centrifuged through a belt fibre filter at 3273 g for 10 min the sludge cake was dried for at least 6 h at 105 c in pre weighed crucibles the percent solids content of the sludge was determined after drying the sludge samples for xrd measurement were prepared by freeze drying the samples under vacuum conditions the samples are then powdered in an anaerobic chamber x ray diffactograms were recorded with a d8 bruker diffractometer using a cu kα1 radiation at λ 1 55 å the diffractometer was equipped with a θ 2θ goniometer and a position sensitive detector reflections were collected under ambient conditions within the 5 80 2θ range with a step width of 0 02 and 1 2 s step of collecting time the resultant peaks at 2θ were obtained using diffrac

data and from this the mean and standard error were calculated the t test was used to determine significant differences from zero at 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of dosing iron rich drinking water sludge in sewer the effect of dosing iron rich dws on the dissolved sulfide concentration in the experimental sewer reactor see fig 1 sampling point 2 is shown in fig 2 during the baseline period phase i day 607 738 the difference between the control and experimental lines although statistically significant remained very small 0 4 0 1 mgs l 1 p 0 05 dws dosing started on day 739 phase ii immediately after dws was introduced into the system 3 5 0 1 mgs l 1of dissolved sulfide on average was removed from the experimental sewer reactor throughout phase ii this clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of dws dosing in sewers for sulfide control during phase ii of the study the average sulfide concentration was 9 2 0 4 mgs l 1 in the control sewer reactor effluent and 5 7 0 3 mgs l 1 for the experimental line fig 3 a the relative decrease in dissolved sulfide concentration was 38 2 2 3 comparable to other studies dosing fecl3 into sewers for sulfide control nielsen et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 rebosura et al 2018 the decrease in dissolved sulfide in the sewers was mainly due to physiochemical reactions between sulfide and the iron in the dws sun et al 2015 analysis of the dws used in the study revealed that the majority of the iron was in the sludge solids and that iron content in the aqueous phase was negligible the theoretical molar ratio of sulfide removed by iron from dws was 0 61 mmols mmolfe 1 and this molar ratio was very similar to the fecl3 dosing study by rebosura et al 2018 with 0 68 mmols mmolfe 1 the values are within the range of s fe ratios of 0 5 2 reported by firer et al 2008 this suggests that an equivalent amount of iron is able to precipitate with sulfide in sewer regardless of whether iron rich dws or fecl3 is dosed for the complete removal of sulfides in sewer the dosing rate would need to be higher than what was used in this study here the dosing rate was designed to show the possible flow on effects in the downstream wastewater treatment plant if the experimentally dosed iron was in excess complete removal of sulfides in the sewer reactor would have masked the potential benefits in the sbr and anaerobic digester the sulfate concentrations in the control and experimental sewer reactor effluents were not significantly different p 0 05 at 3 2 0 4 mgs l 1 and 3 4 0 3 mgs l 1 respectively fig 3 in some cases the introduction of iron to the system will inhibit sulfate reducing bacteria activity as much as 60 zhang et al 2009 but that was not the case in this study the phosphate concentration of the sewer experimental line effluent at 5 7 0 3 mgp l 1 was lower than the control line at 6 2 0 2 mgp l 1 p 0 05 the lower phosphate concentration in the experimental line effluent was likely caused by ferric ion reacting with phosphate and precipitating from the bulk liquid the experimental sewer reactor effluent contained fe concentration of 0 5 0 1 mgfe l 1 as compared with 0 1 0 0 mgfe l 1 in the control reactor effluent p 0 05 the low concertation of soluble fe in the experimental system where dws was dosed to the sewer reactor shows that most of the iron participated in precipitation reaction however this did not affect the ph which was similar in the two systems the dosing of iron rich dws in the sewer reactors decreased the soluble cod concentrations by 32 1 11 0 mgcod l 1 p 0 05 this was likely caused by the coagulative nature of iron removing some soluble cod from the bulk liquid binnie et al 2018 however the concentrations of the total cod and tss significantly increased with a mean difference of 66 0 22 9 mgcod l 1 and 52 5 8 6 mgsolids l 1 respectively p 0 05 as compared with the control systems this increase was due to the additional cod and tss contained within the dws dosed into the system 3 2 flow on effects of in sewer dws dosing on wastewater treatment performance in the laboratory scale system sbrs were used to represent biological treatment at a wastewater treatment plant fig 1 the soluble phosphate concentrations of the control and experimental sbrs are shown in fig 4 in phase i during the baseline period the profiles of the control and experimental lines were very similar having a mean difference of 0 1 0 1 mgp l 1 p 0 05 the experimental line sbr effluent exhibited significantly lower concentrations of phosphate as compared with the control line p 0 05 the average phosphate concentration of the control line was 6 4 0 4 mgp l 1 whereas the experimental line was 2 8 0 5 mgp l 1 the mean difference between the two lines was 3 6 0 3 mgp l 1 fig 5 a corresponding to a relative decrease in soluble phosphates of 59 5 5 7 dosing of iron rich dws into sewers removes dissolved sulfides in the wastewater through precipitation forming iron sulfides this study suggests that iron sulfide precipitates that enter the sbr are oxidised during aeration regenerating available iron to precipitate with phosphates the theoretical molar ratio between the phosphorus precipitated and the amount of iron added to the system was calculated to be 0 65 mmolp mmolfe 1 the molar ratio observed in this study was similar to the p fe molar ratio of 0 63 mmolp mmolfe 1 observed by rebosura et al 2018 when fecl3 was dosed into the system similarly gutierrez et al 2010 recorded a p fe molar ratio of 0 79 mmolp mmolfe 1 from laboratory scale batch test experiments finding that the addition of fecl3 to sewers for sulfide control was also able to remove phosphorus in the downstream wastewater treatment the regulations on phosphorus discharge from wwtp are getting tighter and the cost of chemicals getting higher schaum 2018 the additional phosphates removed from wastewater treatment plants could mean savings for utilities in extra chemical costs the average sulfate concentration of the sbr effluents was 15 5 0 6 and 13 8 0 5 mgs l 1 for the control and experimental systems respectively the concentration of sulfate in the control sbr was slightly higher than 1 7 0 8 mgs l 1 that of the experimental sbr fig 5b but the difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 this indicates that when the fes formed in the experimental sewers was oxidised in the sbr most of the sulfate was produced as the oxidation of dissolved sulfide in the control sbr the small difference in sulfate concentration may be attributed to the fes that was not fully oxidised as shown in the xrd analysis the soluble iron concentration fig 5c in the sbr effluent for both control and experimental systems was very low implying most of the fe from the dws participated in reactions which incorporated the fe into the sbr sludge ammonium concentrations fig 5d of the control and experimental sbrs were very similar indicating that the presence of fe in the experimental system did not affect ammonium conversion see also fig s3 nitrate on the other hand was significantly different p 0 05 in the experimental and control effluents in both phase i and phase ii fig 5e this was likely due to the difference in the sludge settleability fig 5o the sludge in the experimental system had poorer settleability in both phases which likely resulted in enhanced denitrification during settling and decanting due to increased contact time between sludge and the treated water it should be highlighted that sludge settleability in the experimental reactor improved significantly with svi decreasing from phase i 193 2 22 2 ml g 1 to 108 0 7 7 ml g 1 in phase ii p 0 05 the introduction of iron with coagulative properties aided sludge settleability the solids concentrations in the control and experimental sbr effluents were similar as was the total cod soluble cod and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations fig 5g h i j k the addition of dws also adds additional solids and organic carbon to the system however these additions did not have negative effects on effluent quality the mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations were also measured in the sbrs fig 5l the mlss and mlvss concentrations were significantly higher i e by 1125 0 168 7 mgsolids l 1 and 624 4 142 5 mgsolids l 1 respectively in the experimental system than in the control system p 0 05 the experimental and control sbrs were operated identically with the same sludge wastage flow to maintain the same srt the increase in solids was a combination of the solids from dws and the precipitated solids from fe reactions this was also evident in the concentration of total iron in the mlss fig 5n with 22 2 8 7 mgfe l 1 in the control and 217 9 10 4 mgfe l 1 in the experimental system this shows that most of the iron that precipitated with the phosphates were contained in the sludge the control and experimental sbr sludges were also analysed via x ray diffraction xrd the spectrum for the experimental sludge showed that along with fes minerals such as vivianite and struvite were also present fig s1 the presence of these minerals may be due to the partial or incomplete oxidation of fes 3 3 flow on effects of in sewer dws dosing on anaerobic digester performance the iron from the dws dosed into the sewers eventually makes its way to the anaerobic digesters ad at the wastewater treatment plant through the thickened waste activated sludge was fed to the digester fig 1 the sulfide that formed during anaerobic digestion precipitated with ferric ions which were released from ferric phosphates that had been formed during biological wastewater treatment the baseline concentrations of dissolved sulfide in the control and experimental ads were different before in sewer dws dosing phase i fig 6 a as mentioned in section 2 3 the control line previously received fecl3 dosing which led to lower dissolved sulfide concentration in the control ad rebosura et al 2018 the dissolved sulfide concentration did not return to the normal level even 9 months after the fecl3 dosing was stopped i e in phase i we hypothesised that some iron might have attached to the walls of the small ad reactor 1 3 l which was gradually released and participated in sulfide removal however there is a clear decrease in dissolved sulfide in the experimental reactor after the start of dws dosing in the sewer the average dissolved sulfide concentration of the experimental ad sludge dropped from 17 3 1 0 mgs l 1 in phase i to 1 4 0 1 mgs l 1 in phase ii corresponding to a 91 9 relative decrease after the introduction of iron rich dws into the system the low concentration of dissolved sulfide in the liquid phase also translates to a lower concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the anaerobic digester biogas as demonstrated by rebosura et al 2018 in a long term study with fecl3 dosing into laboratory scale sewers the control of hydrogen sulfide in wastewater can mitigate odour and corrosion in the treatment plant and also in industries that uses biogas generated from wastewater sludge anaerobic digestion this translates to significant savings in maintenance costs for utilities and biogas utilising industries fig 6b presents the biogas production profiles of the control and experimental ads in phases i and ii the biogas production rate was lower in the experimental line than in the control line in both phases with a difference of 11 6 1 3 ml day 1 the consistent difference suggests that the difference was not caused by the iron rich sludge dosing to the sewer but by some other factors it is also important to observe that the biogas production in the experimental reactor remained similar before and after the introduction of iron sludge into the system at 41 4 0 9 ml day 1 in phase i and 40 0 4 3 ml day 1 in phase ii p 0 05 novak and park 2010 demonstrated with laboratory batch reactors that direct addition of iron to anaerobic digesters did not cause any negative effects on biogas production the methane content in biogas in the control and experimental reactors was almost identical at 76 0 0 8 and 75 9 0 6 respectively p 0 05 the percentage of methane produced in the laboratory scale ads was higher than that typically produced by full scale anaerobic digesters i e 60 70 tchobanoglous et al 2014 the parameters presented did not display significant effects on the ad operation performance the soluble phosphate concentration of the digested sludge from the experimental system was 42 2 5 0 mgp l 1 lower than that of the control p 0 05 fig 7 b the total fe in the system was in excess and was more than enough to have simultaneous precipitation of sulfide and phosphate however iron chemistry is complicated small changes in the iron precipitates have the possibility for enough sulfide removal without necessarily leading to the release of phosphate the difference in phosphate concentration must still be due to the iron phosphate precipitates formed in the ad xrd measurements shown in fig s2a confirms the presence of vivianite in the anaerobically digested sludge the ammonium concentrations for both control and experimental systems were similar as were the respective ph values fig 7c and d the presence of iron did not affect these parameters significantly the total iron concentration in the ad sludges was 71 6 3 7 mgfe l 1 in the control and 669 8 59 0 mgfe l 1 in the experimental system fig 7f similar to the trends in solids content of the mlss in the sbr the solids concentration of the digested sludge was 10 464 8 220 3 mgsolids l 1 in the control system and 13 666 7 500 5 mgsolids l 1 in the experimental system fig 7g this is expected as more solids were fed to the experimental line than to the control line dewaterability of the digested sludge in the control and experimental systems was monitored throughout the study fig 7i the percentage of solids obtained after dewatering the digested sludge was 15 7 0 3 in the control system and 19 1 0 5 in the experimental system the addition of iron rich dws in the sewers and the residual iron that entered the ad improved the dewaterability of the digested sludge with a relative increase of 21 7 0 6 as compared with the control system the presence of iron in the sludge could have increased the flocculation of the sludge which enabled it to release more bound water similar to the addition of sludge conditioners zhou et al 2015 the improvement in dewaterability is also similar to what was observed by rebosura et al 2018 where dosing fecl3 into sewers resulted in a relative increase of around 18 in dewaterability 3 4 fate of cod and solids from the dws in the laboratory wastewater system the addition of dws into the laboratory wastewater system also introduced additional cod and solids fig 8 the influent sewage introduced around 4 48 0 23 gcod day 1 and 1 06 0 09 gsolids day 1 of tss respectively to the systems the experimental system dosed with dws received an additional 0 36 0 09 gcod day 1 and 0 65 0 02 gsolids day 1 of tss very little cod removal took place in the sewer reactors the tss and vss in sewer effluent were slightly lower than their values in the feed 9 13 suggesting some minor breakdown of solids in the sewer reactors the sewer reactor effluent enters the sbr with 4 25 0 27 gcod day 1 and 4 91 0 09 gcod day 1 for the control and experimental systems respectively along with a tss of 0 96 0 08 gsolids day 1 and 1 48 0 05 gsolids day 1 for the control and experimental systems respectively the higher tss of the influent to the experimental sbr was due to the additional tss in the dws and the fes precipitates formed in the sewer reactors the additional solids loading to the experimental sbr resulted in mlss and mlvss concentrations of 4 12 0 10 gsolids l 1 and 3 25 0 08 gsolids l 1 respectively 42 and 24 higher than the respective mlss and mlvss concentrations of 2 90 0 10 gsolids l 1 and 2 62 0 10 gsolids l 1 in the control sbr this means dws dosing to sewers contributes significantly to the mlss in a wastewater treatment reactor and therefore may not be applicable when the wastewater treatment reactor is already working at or close to the acceptable mlss limit the improvement to sludge settleability as observed in this study from 193 2 22 2 ml g 1 in phase i to 108 0 7 7 ml g 1 in phase ii may partially alleviate this issue there were two outgoing streams from the sbr namely the treated effluent and the was the treated wastewater effluent cod concentrations for the control and experimental sbrs were similar at 0 72 0 06 gcod day 1 and 0 66 0 06 gcod day 1 respectively both the control and experimental sbr effluent tss was 0 05 0 01 gsolids day 1 however the experimental sbr produced significantly higher amounts of solids and cod in the was stream than the control sbr the tss and vss discharge rates were 1 40 0 03 gsolids day 1 and 1 10 0 03 gsolids day 1 respectively 43 and 24 higher than the tss and vss discharge rates from the control sbr at 0 98 0 04 gsolids day 1 and 0 89 0 03 gsolids day 1 respectively similarly the was tcod discharge rate from the experimental sbr at 1 64 0 06 gcod day 1 was 32 higher than that from the control sbr at 1 24 0 07 gcod day 1 this means that the dws dosing to the experimental sewer resulted in significantly higher solids and organic loading rate to the ad reactor it is important to note that the total cod loading to the control and experimental lines was 4 48 0 23 gcod day 1 and 4 84 0 23 gcod day 1 respectively fig 8 the total cod discharge sludge effluent was 1 96 0 09 gcod day 1 for the control sbr and 2 30 0 08 gcod day 1 for the experimental sbr this means that the total cod removal was 2 52 0 25 gcod day 1 for the control line and 2 54 0 24 gcod day 1 for the experimental line after aerobic treatment in the sbr the similar removal rates suggest that the cod in the dws was largely non biodegradable waste sludge from the sbr was thickened before feeding to the ad sludge loading to the control ad was 0 83 0 03 gcod day 1 and 0 67 0 02 gsolids day 1 of tss however around 32 of solids were lost in the thickener the experimental system received a sludge loading of 0 82 0 03 gcod day 1 and 0 84 0 04 gsolids day 1 of tss with around 40 solids loss in the thickener due to design limitations of the laboratory scale thickener the two ad reactors achieved similar vss destruction at 23 and 24 respectively if no sludge had been lost in the thickening process the experimental ad would discharge solids at 1 1 0 05 gsolids day 1 while the control ad would discharge solids at 0 76 0 01 gsolids day 1 the additional solids discharge from the experimental line is 0 44 0 06 gsolids day 1 or 40 higher considering the improvement to sludge dewaterability the volume of sludge to be discharged would be only 19 higher as the dws was added at a rate of 0 65 0 02 gsolids day 1 the total solids discharge from the experimental line would be 22 lower than the combined solids discharge rate should the dws and wastewater sludge be discharged separately 3 5 implications iron and aluminium based coagulants are typically used in drinking water treatment however the use of alum as coagulant in drinking water treatment contributes a significant amount of sulfate to sewage sulfate in sewage is converted to hydrogen sulfide in sewer causing sewer odour and corrosion pikaar et al 2014 as demonstrated in this study if drinking water utilities use fecl3 as coagulant instead of alum the iron rich sludge produced when dosed to sewers could significantly reduce the demand and cost for chemical use for sulfide control in sewers phosphate removal in wastewater treatment and hydrogen sulfide control in anaerobic digester biogas production this strategy also turns dws from a waste product into a valuable resource there were concerns of potential unintended consequences brought about by dosing of dws into sewers however this study demonstrated that the in sewer dws dosing does not interfere with biological carbon or nitrogen removal in a wastewater treatment reactor or vss destruction in an anaerobic sludge digester in particular the dissolved organic carbon analysis of the wastewater treatment effluents showed that there was no significant difference between the control and experimental systems suggesting the potential release of organic carbon contained in dws did not result in additional dissolved organic carbon in effluent the dws dosing significantly increased the solids concentration in sewage and also in all process units the elevated solids concentration in sewage could potentially increase sedimentation in sewers unfortunately this could not be assessed in a small scale laboratory sewer as used in this study experiments in larger scale sewers are required to assess this potential issue this study revealed that in sewer dws dosing could substantially increase the mlss concentration in the wastewater treatment reactor 42 in this study this could potentially limit the applicability of the proposed strategy in some of the urban wastewater systems it was observed however that the sludge settleability was improved 44 in this study which could partially alleviate the above issue the in sewer dosing of dws resulted in more solids disposal in the downstream wastewater treatment plant 44 increase was observed in this study although this issue could be partially alleviated by enhanced dewaterability 18 improvement in this study the sludge disposal costs for the wastewater treatment plant are likely to increase significantly however the proposed strategy involves discharging dws to sewers which means the disposal costs for dws would be reduced substantially when the disposal costs for both dws and wastewater sludge are considered the proposed strategy is expected to reduce the overall sludge disposal costs estimated to be 22 in this study this study provides a strong argument that urban drinking water and wastewater systems should be managed holistically as an integrated system for maximum benefits 4 conclusions the feasibility of the use of iron rich dws for in sewer dosing and its flow on effects on the downstream wastewater and sludge treatment processes were investigated this was done using a laboratory scale reactor system simulating the urban wastewater system it can be concluded that in sewer iron rich dws dosing effectively decreases dissolved sulfide concentrations in the sewers contributes to phosphorus removal during downstream wastewater treatment decreases and controls dissolved sulfide in the downstream anaerobic sludge digester with negligible effects on biogas productivity improves activated sludge settleability in wastewater treatment and the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge significantly increases cod and solids concentration in the wastewater treatment plant but does not affect the effluent quality or the anaerobic sludge digestion performance however the higher mlss concentration in the wastewater treatment reactor implies that dws dosing to sewers should be avoided for treatment systems already operated at high mlss concentrations increases sludge disposal costs for the wastewater treatment plant but expected to reduce the combined disposal costs for dws and wastewater sludge iron can be re used for multiple times throughout the urban wastewater system and these

18193,this study investigates for the first time the integrity of multiple stacked aquitards with different degrees of contaminant degradation aquitard integrity was assessed in a contaminated multi layered alluvial aquifer aquitard system ferrara northern italy the system was contaminated by mixed organic contaminants of industrial origin mostly chlorinated ethenes that were illegally disposed in an urban dump four to five decades ago high spatial resolution profiles of hydraulic head geochemistry and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations were determined through the multi layered system via discrete interval sampling of continuous cores and multilevel groundwater sampling at three locations aligned along a transect adjacent to the buried waste to a maximum depth of 53 m below the water table the profiles revealed that the two shallow aquitards had low integrity with respect to impeding downward migration of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl and provided little protection to the underlying aquifers against dnapl contamination due to preferential pathways through imperceptible fractures and or permeable micro beds however both aquitards inhibited downward dnapl migration to some extent due to dnapl retention along its flow paths and accumulation at lower permeability interfaces with decreasing peak concentrations at the top of successively deeper aquitard units moreover both aquitards enhanced contaminant biodegradation due to the occurrence of organic rich sub layers influencing the contaminant plume composition mobility and fate in the underlying and overlying aquifers the deepest aquitard showed evidence of dnapl accumulation at the top and slow diffusion dominated transport consistent with 40 years of transport suggesting higher integrity compared to the two shallower aquitards however the occurrence of micro fractures and or discontinuities in the aquitard upgradient under the dump source is the most likely explanation for contamination of the deepest aquifer analytical 1 d simulations of the diffusion profiles in the deepest aquitard revealed that dnapl contamination down to the top of this aquitard occurred with minimal delay after dnapl waste disposal began the results highlight the necessity of high resolution vertical profiling for assessing the presence of imperceptible features relevant to dnapl migration and integrity of individual aquitards affecting organic contaminant source zone mass and phase distributions over decades graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquitard integrity chlorinated ethenes dnapl source zone age and evolution diffusion mass transfer fluvial sediments 1 introduction the integrity of an aquitard refers to its capability to protect an underlying aquifer against contamination cherry et al 2006 parker et al 2004 until a few decades ago it was assumed that aquitards generally prevent contamination of underlying confined aquifers from surface contamination sources e g ponzini et al 1989 u s epa 1987 however contaminant occurrences in confined aquifers were observed since the 1990 s often involving chlorinated hydrocarbons as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl in the source zones e g ppg industries 1995 chapuis 2013 pedretti et al 2013 fjordbøge et al 2017 this contradicts the assumption that low permeability sediments with hydraulic conductivities less than 10 7 cm s based on usepa guidance for compacted clay landfill liners e g green et al 1981 generally prevent the migration of contaminants into underlying aquifers research at industrial waste disposal sites in the 1990 s suggested that deep dnapl migration can be attributed to pre existing fractures in natural clay rich sediments that are imperceptible in bulk hydraulic conductivity testing cherry et al 2006 wills et al 1992 mathematical modeling and laboratory studies jørgensen et al 1998 o hara et al 2000 kueper and mcwhorter 1991 mcwhorter and kueper 1996 demonstrated that dnapls have an exceptional propensity to enter and migrate through very small fractures even those with hydraulic apertures smaller than 10 μm these observations were confirmed by several field studies ppg industries 1995 reported the migration of tetrachlorethylene pce and trichlorethylene tce dnapls through a 50 m thick alluvial clay aquitard to the underlying aquifer at a chemical manufacturing facility due to root holes and fractures acting as preferential pathways for dnapl migration chapuis 2013 observed high concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons in a confined aquifer overlain by a glacial till aquitard where dnapl migration through micro fractures was the most likely explanation fjordbøge et al 2017 characterized a clay till aquitard underlying a pce and tce dnapl source zone where vertical migration of dnapl occurred through fractures in a shallow oxidized zone and to a lesser extent through a less fractured reduced zone reaching the underlying confined limestone aquifer beside fractures unlithified clay rich aquitards in alluvial settings often enclose thin sand intercalations that can create a stair step pattern of preferential flow paths for dnapl flow e g morrison et al 1998 parker 1996 pedretti et al 2013 observed lithologic heterogeneities in a shallow clay aquitard while investigating the distribution of chlorinated hydrocarbon contamination mainly pce and tce at the regional scale in an alluvial multi aquifer aquitard system where contaminants breached the clay aquitard at several sites in the region reaching the underlying confined aquifer the literature also reports some aquitards capable of preventing dnapl penetration or allow only partial migration morrison et al 1998 reported partial pce dnapl penetration in a thin surficial clayey aquitard at a site where dnapl was released under controlled conditions vertical microfractures allowed dnapl migration through an upper part whereas the lower part provided resistance to dnapl flow parker et al 2004 showed tce dnapl accumulation at the bottom of a sandy aquifer overlying a thick aquitard at an industrial property diffusion profiles of dissolved contaminants were observed in the upper part of the aquitard but with no evidence of dnapl penetration attributed to lack of fractures given the plasticity of this lacustrine sediment and lack of post deposition exposure adamson et al 2015a and adamson et al 2015b advanced the use of diffusion transport contaminant concentration profiles in low permeability clay rich sediments as a means to assess contaminant source zone history after parker et al 1994 and parker et al 2004 the source history model proposed by adamson et al 2015b was demonstrated at two industrial sites with chlorinated ethenes and ethanes showing that some decades after the first contaminat spill most of the contaminant mass occurred in the low permeability layers aquitards due to diffusion enhanced by sorption the results suggested high aquitard integrity with respect to dnapl penetration but also how diffusive mass transfer alters the location and phase of contamination notwithstanding the existing literature the parameters that control the integrity of clayey aquitards are not yet clear and often appear to be strongly site specific requiring careful investigation methods including collection and sampling of minimally disturbed continuous cores thus there is a need for improving the scientific knowledge with respect to different dnapl source conditions and geologic settings for assessing aquitard integrity the objective of this paper is to evaluate the integrity of distinct silt and clay rich non indurated unlithified aquitards of fluvial origin with different degrees of reactivity to contaminant biodegradation to the best of our knowledge the assessment of the integrity of multiple stacked reactive aquitards was never reported in the literature for this purpose a site was selected where a 60 m thick multi layered aquifer aquitard system of alluvial origin was contaminated by chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons predominantly with chloroethenes originating from a known mixed dnapl source high resolution hydraulic head geochemistry and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration profiles were determined using continuous cores along a transverse cross section i e transect adjacent to the contamination source the investigated multi layered aquifer aquitard configuration is representative of many other alluvial systems e g blum and törnqvist 2000 so the insights as well as the methods applied are useful for assessment of non indurated aquitard integrity at other sites 2 site description the selected caretti site is located 1 km east of the historical center of ferrara in the eastern sector of the padana plain about 4 km south of the po river and covers an area of about 1 km2 fig 1 the hydrostratigraphy exhibits an alternation of fine to coarse grained sands of higher hydraulic conductivity aquifers and silty clayey layers of lower hydraulic conductivity aquitards to a depth of around 200 m below ground surface m bgs molinari et al 2007 three aquifers are located in the upper 60 m bgs indicated as a0 upper a1 and lower a1 regione emilia romagna and eni agip 1998 whereby each of them is overlain by a non indurated aquitard named after the underlying aquifer q0 upper q1 and lower q1 fig 2 the a0 aquifer consists of scattered sandy lenses intermingled with fine grained deposits amorosi and colalongo 2005 the upper a1 aquifer is characterized by low spatial continuity i e low amalgamation between sandy lenses that form sandy bodies extended for 10 100 m2 whereas the lower a1 aquifer is a regionally extensive sandy body on the scale of 10 000 m2 the main groundwater flow direction at the caretti site is nne in the a0 aquifer nw in the upper a1 aquifer and e in the lower a1 nijenhuis et al 2013 filippini et al 2016 two main sources contribute to the recharge of the multi aquifer system the po river lateral recharge and the local rainfall vertical recharge rapti caputo and martinelli 2009 the averaged contribution of vertical recharge decreases from 75 in the a0 down to 26 in the lower a1 whereas the lateral recharge increases with increasing aquifer depth from 25 in the a0 up to 74 in the lower a1 filippini et al 2015 in the ferrara region the confined lower a1 aquifer is exploited at several locations for irrigation or drinking water supply and the overlying lower q1 aquitard is considered capable to protect the quality of this aquifer as reported in several technical documents not published previous investigations at the caretti site gargini et al 2011 revealed that the aquifers a0 and upper a1 are contaminated by chlorinated hydrocarbons originating from urban waste and chlorinated pitches containing a mixture of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes that were deposited primarily as dnapl in a clay pit known as southern dump between the late 1950s and 1970s fig 1 groundwater contamination by chlorinated hydrocarbons was first detected in 2000 by the local environmental authority during an investigation for the development of a new residential area two chlorinated hydrocarbon plumes were identified in the a0 and upper a1 aquifers that have migrated about 500 m down gradient of the southern dump fig 1 the plume in the a0 aquifer consists primarily of chloroethenes pce tce 1 1 dichloroethene 11dce cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce trans 1 2 dichloroethene tdce vinyl chloride vc and secondarily of chloroethanes 1 1 1 2 tetrachloroethane 1112teca 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane 1122teca 1 1 2 trichloroethane 112tca 1 2 dichloroethane 12dca and chloromethanes carbon tetrachloride ct chloroform cf dichloromethane dcm only chloroethenes pce tce 11dce cdce tdce and a few chloroethanes and chloromethanes 1122teca 112tca cf dcm were detected in the plume of the upper a1 aquifer the lower a1 aquifer is considered uncontaminated based on separate characterization efforts by the local authorities 3 materials and methods 3 1 types of data collected stratigraphic hydraulic head and chemical data were collected along a 60 m wide x 60 m deep cross section i e transect located at the northern end of the southern dump perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction of the a0 aquifer the transect consists of two deep profiles 60 m bgs mc1 2 and mc4 5 at both ends and one shallower profile 30 m bgs mc3 in the center fig 2 whereby the horizontal distance between the three profiles is 30 m data collection and analysis are described in the following sections and further in the supplementary material sm 3 2 continuous coring and core subsampling continuous cores were collected from the three locations in july 2013 using a wireline coring system with triple tube core barrel that provided consistent high core recovery of 95 98 for the two deep profiles mc1 2 and mc4 5 cores were collected at slightly different locations 4 5 m apart for the shallower 0 30 m bgs and the deeper interval 28 60 m bgs fig 2 before collecting cores from the deeper interval the upper 28 m of the borehole was sealed with permanent casing to avoid cross contamination of the deepest aquifer lower a1 upon retrieval at ground surface the cores were split longitudinally one half was used for detailed lithostratigraphic descriptive logging and pocket penetrometer tests eijkelkamp pocket penetrometer model 06 03 to evaluate sediment consistency while the other half was used for collection of large sediment samples 250 g each the sediment samples were collected at a 1 m spacing at locations mc1 2 and mc3 for measurement of grain size distributions in the sandy and silty clay rich layers at the mc4 5 location the other half of the cores was subsampled for measurement of chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations and for determination of porosity and organic carbon content the mc4 5 location was selected to perform the sediment core subsampling as it was expected to be the most contaminated profile based on previous site characterization gargini et al 2011 nijenhuis et al 2013 stratigraphic information from the cores was complemented by piezocone penetration tests cptu to 30 m depth performed by the municipality of ferrara 50 m southeastward from the transect fig 1 core subsampling was conducted following the procedure described by wanner et al 2016 adamson et al 2015a parker et al 2004 and parker et al 2003 targeting a vertical spacing along the core axis of about 10 cm three subsamples were collected at each depth 297 sampling depths in total one for chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration analyses one for sediment properties total porosity ϕ and organic carbon fraction foc and a third for screening for the presence of dnapl phase using a hydrophobic dye oil red o 3 3 multilevel systems for hydraulic head and groundwater chemistry profiles after coring groundwater multilevel monitoring systems were installed in the five boreholes along the transect fig 2 among the commercially available multilevel systems the solinst cmt system einarson 2006 was selected because 1 it is suitable for unconsolidated sediment settings einarson and cherry 2002 and 2 it allows selection of screen position and lengths in the field based on borehole specific lithology distributions from core logging each of the five cmt systems was equipped with 7 screens at discrete depths targeting both aquifers and aquitards and avoiding cross connection across visually distinct permeability zones fig 2 groundwater from the cmts was sampled in november 2013 using dedicated 6 mm od teflon tubing and a peristaltic pump model 410 peristaltic pump solinst to perform cation anion and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration analyses hydraulic heads were manually monitored in the cmts twice a week between september 9 2013 and july 28 2014 321 days using a 4 mm diameter water level meter model 102 narrow diameter cable water level meter solinst 3 4 lab analyses of sediment and groundwater samples chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration analyses on core subsamples was performed at the university of guelph on canada the contaminants were extracted from the sediment subsamples as described by dincutoiu et al 2003 the analytical technique provides the total chlorinated hydrocarbon analyte mass per mass of wet sediment ct and does not distinguish between the aqueous sorbed and napl phases assuming dnapl free conditions the pore water concentration cw and sorbed mass concentration cs in the sediment subsamples can be estimated assuming equilibrium partitioning between dissolved and sorbed phases e g parker et al 2004 adamson et al 2015a in addition to direct field screening tests with dye occurrence of pure phase dnapl in the sediment samples was verified by comparing the estimated cw of each compound derived from ct measurements in sediment samples with their effective solubility based on an estimated analyte mole fraction provided in sm anion concentrations in groundwater were analyzed at the university of bologna italy by ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography using a metrohm 883 basic ic plus chromatograph cations were analyzed in the same lab by flame atomic absorption spectrometry using a perkinelmer aa100 spectrometer chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater samples were analyzed by a private certified laboratory chelab s r l treviso italy using the analytical methods epa 5030 c u s epa 2003 and epa 8260 c u s epa 2006 3 5 analytical modeling of diffusive transport in aquitard lower q1 the aim of the analytical modeling was to estimate the time of contaminant arrival based on the fitting of the concentration with distance profiles measured in the lower q1 aquitard with field and or literature derived parameters for the sediment and solute the pce and tce profiles appeared to be diffusion controlled and pce and tce transport in the lower q1 aquitard was simulated using a 1d analytical solution of fick s second law assuming linear instantaneous sorption e g parker et al 2004 parker 1996 narasimhan 2004 for a homogeneous semi infinite porous medium e g carslaw and jaeger 1959 1 cw c0 erfc z 2 tde r 1 2 where cw is the chlorinated hydrocarbon pore water concentration mg l co is the concentration at the

z is the vertical depth cm with z 0 at the aquitard interface and t is time s biodegradation of parent compounds in the lower q1 aquitard was assumed to be minor and not included in the simulations as the chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration analyses did not show occurrence of the dechlorination product vc and relatively low concentrations of cdce max 0 6 mg l compared to much higher concentrations of the parent compounds pce and tce max 37 and 10 mg l respectively in the case of pce a constant concentration was fixed at the model interface based on the characteristic shape of the profile with concentrations declining with distance into the aquitard suggesting relatively steady concentrations at the interface and the diffusion time was used as a fitting parameter by varying it until a minimal deviation between measured and modeled concentrations was obtained in contrast the tce profile showed a profile shape consistent with a declining concentration at the interface and thus a temporal evolution step decline of the tce concentration at the interface was evaluated this decline was taken into account by superimposing analytical solutions to simulate a two step concentration at the interface with cw calculated for both steps using eq s 7 in the sm in the first step a high tce concentration representative of an earlier contamination stage was fixed at the model interface applying the entire diffusion time obtained from the pce modeling in the second step a lower tce concentration was assigned at the interface over a shorter time period to simulate a second stage when the boundary concentration was clearly lower and by applying the concept of superposition these results were subtracted from results of the first step to obtain the combined profile the diffusion time of the second step and the interface tce concentrations of both steps were varied until reaching minimal deviation between measured and modeled concentrations deviation between measured m and modeled m concentrations was quantified using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 legates and mccabe jr 1999 2 nse 1 i n 1 mi mi 2 i n 1 mi mm 2 where mm is the measured mean nse ranges from minus infinity to 1 with higher values indicating better fit adamson et al 2015b recently provided a source history model for estimating interface concentration history based on measured low k zone profiles which was applied as a verification for the analytically simulated profiles and for refining the concentration history at the interface for the tce profile the primary difference for the fits using the source history model is that the total mass concentrations ct are used as primary input whereas the porewater concentration cw are estimated by the model applying average parameter values for bulk density porosity ϕ and estimated r factor the source history simulation results are provided in the sm 4 results and discussion 4 1 contaminant distributions as evidence for aquitard integrity the thickness of aquitard q0 at the site is clearly altered due to past excavation for waste disposal the waste material likely reaches a thickness equal to or higher than the thickness of q0 in the area of the transect e g in the mc3 profile only 1 m of fine grained deposits of the q0 aquitard separate the wastes from the a0 aquifer fig 3 thus the integrity of the aquitard q0 is difficult to assess as the contaminants may have reached the underlying a0 aquifer either due to poor integrity of the q0 or because the waste dumps penetrated the q0 due to excavations and contacted the top of the a0 directly peaks of chloroethene concentrations were detected into the q0 aquitard from sediment samples along core mc4 5 mostly cdce and vc with estimated pore water concentrations cw up to 197 and 16 μg l respectively that suggest strong contaminant retention and degradation in the aquitard layer fig 4 occurrence of chloroethenes in the q0 is also confirmed by groundwater concentrations gw along profiles mc4 5 and mc3 the absence of contaminants into this aquitard along profile mc1 2 is more likely justified by the absence of residual waste above the profile fig 3 rather than locally high q0 aquitard integrity since the profile is positioned at the edge of or beyond the source zone the cumulative mass distribution per unit area of total vocs chloroethenes chloroethanes and chloromethanes along the mc4 5 profile suggests accumulation contaminants at the interface between aquifer a0 and aquitard upper q1 especially pce cdce 1122teca and 112tca with peak cw of 54 141 86 and 23 μg l respectively and at the interface between aquifer upper a1 and aquitard lower q1 mostly pce and tce with max cw of 37 and 10 μg l respectively in a manner consistent with dnapl migration and preferential accumulation at those interfaces where capillary pressures were insufficient to invade sediments with different and smaller pore geometry fig 5 the major mass accumulation zone occurs at the top of the upper q1 aquitard showing strong resistance of dnapl penetration i e resistance to vertical flow and enhanced lateral dnapl migration in this system as evidenced by the sudden occurrence of the chloroethanes and their absence above this depth this mass accumulation also corresponds to organic rich sublayers in the top meter of the upper q1 aquitard max foc of 2 6 at 9 5 m bgs see fig 3 where the organic sediment facilitates contaminant retention by sorption the same organic rich sublayers provide a favorable environment for reductive dechlorination filippini et al 2016 observed reductive dechlorination of chloroethenes pce and tce and accumulation of by products mainly cdce and vc during contaminant retention and migration within these fine organic rich sediments by analogy chlorinated ethanes 112tca 12dca and methanes dcm cm that occur exclusively in the shallowest 10 12 m of the profile are likely by products from dechlorination of higher chlorinated compounds e g 1112teca 1122teca and cf despite the high resistance to dnapl penetration inferred for the upper q1 aquitard the cumulative mass profiles strongly support some dnapl invasion through this aquitard given the contamination throughout the underlying upper a1 aquifer down to the top of lower q1 where the second largest chloroethene mass accumulation was registered the low contaminant concentrations in the aquifer upper a1 interposed between the two contaminated aquitards upper and lower q1 at the time of this investigation are explainable due to the active groundwater flow in the aquifer over the last decades and much lower sorption in the sandy sediments compared to fine grained organic rich sediments of the underlying and overlying aquitards thus the present day contaminant distributions appear strongly affected by an earlier contamination stage when dnapl was migrating preferentially downward and laterally along lower kv aquitard interfaces even though field tests with dye provided negative results along the whole profile the occurrence of pure phase dnapl could be inferred in at least one sample within the a0 aquifer where estimated pce pore water concentration most likely exceeded effective solubility limits see sm few other shallow samples i e from q0 aquitard a0 aquifer and upper q1 aquitard showed pore water concentration possibly close to effective solubility for some compounds this suggests little remaining and highly residualized dnapl at the time of investigation but most likely much more mobile dnapl nearer the time of disposal the contaminant profiles from mc4 5 cores show evidence of diffusion dominated transport i e characteristic diffusion profiles at the top of the lower q1 aquitard with rapid decrease of concentration below the aquifer aquitard interface see fig 8 suggesting good aquitard integrity preventing deeper dnapl penetration into and below this zone however the aquitard did not prevent migration of some contaminants into the lower a1 aquifer pce and tce concentrations up to 3 mg l much lower than in the overlying aquitard showing evidence of some dnapl migration pathways to these depths which might come from breaches in this aquitard upgradient from the core location with horizontal migration by groundwater flow in the lower a1 consideration was given to possible cross contaminant due to drag down of much higher concentrations and presence of dnapl shallower in the profile however the field methods involved significant steps to reduce this situation using a separate borehole with a blank casing through the shallower zone for the deep coring locations this makes the cross connection explanation unlikely with the more likely scenario that preferential contaminant pathways must have existed at an early stage when mobile dnapls were present the propensity for deep migration pathways no longer exists once the mobile dnapl phase dissolves away to the point where the driving force diminishes which is the condition expected at the drilling locations but maybe not internal to the dump area contaminant concentration profiles at the top of the lower q1 aquitard are discussed in section 4 3 providing insights on source history 4 2 hydraulic head and hydrochemistry profiles as complementary evidence the strongest vertical hydraulic head variations δhv of about 0 1 m with depth are localized within the upper q1 and lower q1 aquitards fig 6 a similar variation is observed in the aquitard below the lower a1 aquifer which is beyond the zone of relevance of this paper but confirms repeated occurrence of head losses in all aquitards the vertical gradient variability along the thickness of an aquitard layer is caused by heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity in the vertical direction kv with steeper gradient in sub layers of lower kv cherry et al 2006 from a stratigraphic viewpoint the main δhv in the upper q1 aquitard occur inside the organic rich layer from 8 to 11 m bgs suggesting this is a sub layer of lower vertical hydraulic conductivity able to reduce groundwater and dnapl flow between the aquifers a0 and upper a1 the vertical distribution of field parameters and ion concentrations shows decreasing trends increasing in the case of ph from aquifer a0 to aquifer upper a1 suggesting vertical migration down to the upper a1 aquifer of dissolved components originating from dump leachate and redox influences by the presence of high voc concentrations fig 7 an exception was observed for potassium k and fluoride f where concentrations drop close to zero below the upper q1 aquitard possibly due to adsorption onto clay minerals oxides and or hydroxides pickering 1985 mitra and prakash 1956 which are abundant in the ferrara aquitards amorosi et al 2002 based on these observations the upper q1 appears to be an ineffective barrier against the vertical migration of dissolved ions and especially ineffective barrier to dnapl otherwise if the a0 and upper a1 aquifer were effectively insulated by the upper q1 aquitard a change in the vertical trends would have been observed between the two aquifers since they are recharged by different sources filippini et al 2015 and have different hydrochemistry at the regional scale molinari et al 2007 the low integrity of the upper q1 aquitard is likely due to the occurrence of imperceptible fractures and coarse grained sub layers of higher kv that facilitate vertical groundwater exchanges between the over and underlying a0 and upper a1 aquifers the higher ion concentration observed in this aquitard and in the overlying and underlying aquifers along mc4 5 and mc3 profiles in comparison to mc1 2 is explained considering that residual waste only remained at the top of the first two profiles fig 3 an exception is so4 which shows the highest concentration in profile mc1 2 while in the more contaminated mc4 5 and mc3 profiles this had likely been depleted as an electron acceptor for reductive biotransformation of chlorinated compounds ndon et al 2000 the lithostratigraphic features of the lower q1 aquitard uniform grain size high clay content of 40 no visual evidence of fracturing suggest absence of preferential pathways for contaminant migration and thus a higher degree of integrity compared to the shallower aquitard units hydraulic heads in the lower q1 shows the occurrence of a sub layer of low vertical hydraulic conductivity main δhv localized in the zone of a markedly clayey section from 28 to 30 5 m bgs characterized by hard consistency from pocket penetrometer tests see fig 3 such layer is expected to provide an effective insulation between the overlying upper a1 and underlying lower a1 aquifers despite the absence of visible fractures in the aquitard at the core scale the pore pressure trend u kpa obtained from a cptu performed 50 m southeastward from the transect shows a sudden decrease of u at the same depth of the main δhv in the lower q1 aquitard fig 6 indicating an over consolidation of the layer chen and mayne 1996 mayne et al 1990 amorosi and marchi 1999 and a consequent prone to fracturing behavior fragility with probable occurrence of micro fractures such micro fractures represent an ideal preferential pathway for the migration of small amounts of dnapl thought the protective clayey layer of the lower q1 aquitard in the context of the southeastern po river plain a high consolidation of clays with consequential micro fracturing is likely attributed to cohesive sediment desiccation during the prolonged phase of subaerial exposure that characterized the area during the last glacial maximum and the first stages of transgression amorosi and marchi 1999 rizzini 1974 the typical occurrence of fractures and dnapl migration pathways in natural clay rich aquitards was also reported by morrison et al 1998 and cherry et al 2006 especially in clayey aquitards thinner than 15 m of fluvial origin and overconsolidated hydrochemistry further distinguishes the lower q1 aquitard conditions compared to the shallower system field parameters and ion concentrations show sharp changes of vertical trends below the lower q1 aquitard suggesting that the upper and lower a1 aquifers have dissimilar hydrochemistry with the lower q1 aquitard reducing fluxes between the two aquifers fig 7 in particular the lowest ion concentrations of the entire profiles were observed at the top of the lower a1 aquifer suggesting no or much lower influence from the surficial contaminant inputs compared to the two shallower aquifers this observation confirms that the propensity for deep migration pathways through the deeper aquitard is only effective in the presence of mobile dnapl phase but not for dissolved components 4 3 lower q1 aquitard integrity from diffusion transport the contaminant distributions of pce and tce at the top of the lower q1 aquitard show concentration profiles characteristic of transient diffusive transport fig 8 the opportunity was taken to use these profiles for assessing the time of first contaminant arrival at the lower q1 aquitard to this aim the pce and tce profiles were reproduced using a mathematical model for 1 d diffusive transport with linear instantaneous sorption described in section 3 5 the shape of the pce profile shows the peak concentration at the aquifer aquitard interface with pce boundary concentration of 37 mg l not far from the lower limit of estimated effective solubility i e 54 mg l see sm suggesting possible occurrence of dnapl over most or nearly all of the contamination history based on site history dnapl contaminants were disposed in the southern dump between the late 1950s and 1970s transport time was varied from 10 to 60 years to represent the possible time lapse between initial contamination and field characterization in 2013 a best fit between modeled and measured profiles was obtained for 40 years of diffusive migration fig 8 suggesting contamination reached the interface shortly after the waste disposal occurred the tce profile in the lower q1 aquitard has its peak concentration a few cm below the aquifer aquitard interface showing back diffusion from the lower q1 aquitard into the upper a1 aquifer suggesting a recent shift to a lower concentration at the boundary over the diffusion time period chapman and parker 2005 although both pce and tce were likely present as dnapl at this interface a faster decline of tce compared to pce may be best explained by their original composition in the dnapl and higher effective solubility for tce causing a more rapid depletion in tce at the boundary as a result in the case of the tce modeling the time for 1 d diffusive migration derived from the pce best fit time i e 40 years and the concentration of tce at the interface was used as the fitting or adjustment parameter a best fit was determined considering two steps of decreasing tce at the boundary corresponding to 70 mg l for the first 12 years and 10 mg l for the remaining 28 years the iterative modeling approach described above was corroborated using the source history model developed by adamson et al 2015b with the same boundary concentrations sm figs s4 and s5 however the assumption of a two stage boundary condition over simplifies the possibility for strong initial gradients and tce mass transfer loss from the dnapl source followed by a stage with low concentrations at the boundary and a concentration gradient reversal that would attenuate strongly due to diffusion both in and out of the lower q1 aquitard as an alternative scenario the source history model tool was applied assuming an exponentially declining source sm fig s6 also providing a reasonable fit to the measured profile although with slightly larger associated error this shows the non unique nature of fits for various assumptions regarding source history conditions further to this dnapl invasion into the micro fractures of the lower q1 cannot be completely ruled out thus the influence of a single fracture volume of dnapl invading a typical size fracture in clays assumed to by 10 50 μm in aperture e g jørgensen et al 1998 o hara et al 2000 hinsby et al 1996 mckay et al 1993 jørgensen et al 2002 rudolph et al 1991 was evaluated the time of diffusion based mass transfer of pce and tce from dnapl phase in the fractures causing complete dnapl dissolution from the fractures was estimated between 38 days and 2 6 years for pce and between 1 and 32 days for tce following parker et al 1994 details in the sm given such quick disappearance times by a single loading of dnapl invading these fractures with small apertures possible dissolution of dnapl by diffusion from the micro fractures would have unlikely interfered with the observed diffusion transport characteristics of the profiles as confirmed by the ability to simulate these pce and tce profiles however it is also unlikely that a single fracture filling of dnapl would occur after entry when dnapl persists at the overlying aquifer aquitard interface hence the simplest scenario of no dnapl entry into the lower q1 aquitard seems most reasonable and defensible interpretation furthermore it is also expected that dnapl retention occurs with depth of migration causing lower volumes of dnapl at the top of this lower q1 aquitard interface making it difficult to overcome entry pressures in deep micro fractures 5 conclusions three clay rich non indurated aquitards in a multi layered aquifer aquitard system of alluvial origin did not prevent deep dnapl migration to lower aquifers likely due to the occurrence of small scale lithologic heterogeneities and micro fractures this observation was made in a setting where before this study the aquitards were considered protective of groundwater in the underlying aquifers based on standard methods of site characterization such as lithology descriptions and bulk hydraulic conductivities whereas the intermediate aquitard showed low integrity allowing fast advective migration of contaminants towards the underlying aquifer due to occurrence of lithologic heterogeneities the deepest aquitard showed evidence of dnapl accumulation at the upper boundary and only diffusive transport i e diffusion profiles with sorption due to partitioning to solid phase organic carbon without discernible effects of advection suggesting much higher aquitard integrity the high resolution concentration profiles showed that the two shallower aquitard units q0 and upper q1 retained considerable dnapl mass at near their upper boundaries and strongly reduced the flux of dnapl to the lower system but not completely preventing deep migration both aquitards enhanced contaminant biodegradation due to high organic carbon content influencing the contaminant mixtures that reached the underlying aquifers at the core locations it appears that dnapl did not enter the deepest lower q1 aquitard as diffusion transport matches the sharp concentration decline with distance from the top of the aquitard over approximately 40 years however deeper contamination in the lower a1 aquifer although at much lower concentrations is observed most likely due to some dnapl penetration of the lower q1 aquitard up gradient from the core locations or aqueous phase transport along flow lines traveling through the dnapl in the overlying units making the integrity assessment of the lower q1 aquitard uncertain beyond the local study area concentration profiles produced by diffusive transport in this aquitard allowed assessing the approximate timing since initial contaminant arrival at the top of the aquitard which appears to have occurred with minimal delay from surficial contamination events suggesting rapid dnapl migration through the subsurface the two deeper aquitards impeded dnapl fluxes to some extent with accumulation on these units fostering diffusion into aquitards where substantial mass resides as dissolved and sorbed phases posing a secondary long term source of contamination to the adjacent aquifers due to slow back diffusion even after complete dissolution of the dnapl or active remediation of the waste zone knowing that preferential accumulation occurred at the top of lower k clay rich units should also guide placement of future monitoring points the different behavior observed for distinct aquitards of the same multi layer aquifer aquitard system highlights the need for high resolution aquitard specific investigations for 1 defining the degree of protection provided to the underlying aquifers and 2 assessing the long term influence that aquitards might have

18193,this study investigates for the first time the integrity of multiple stacked aquitards with different degrees of contaminant degradation aquitard integrity was assessed in a contaminated multi layered alluvial aquifer aquitard system ferrara northern italy the system was contaminated by mixed organic contaminants of industrial origin mostly chlorinated ethenes that were illegally disposed in an urban dump four to five decades ago high spatial resolution profiles of hydraulic head geochemistry and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations were determined through the multi layered system via discrete interval sampling of continuous cores and multilevel groundwater sampling at three locations aligned along a transect adjacent to the buried waste to a maximum depth of 53 m below the water table the profiles revealed that the two shallow aquitards had low integrity with respect to impeding downward migration of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl and provided little protection to the underlying aquifers against dnapl contamination due to preferential pathways through imperceptible fractures and or permeable micro beds however both aquitards inhibited downward dnapl migration to some extent due to dnapl retention along its flow paths and accumulation at lower permeability interfaces with decreasing peak concentrations at the top of successively deeper aquitard units moreover both aquitards enhanced contaminant biodegradation due to the occurrence of organic rich sub layers influencing the contaminant plume composition mobility and fate in the underlying and overlying aquifers the deepest aquitard showed evidence of dnapl accumulation at the top and slow diffusion dominated transport consistent with 40 years of transport suggesting higher integrity compared to the two shallower aquitards however the occurrence of micro fractures and or discontinuities in the aquitard upgradient under the dump source is the most likely explanation for contamination of the deepest aquifer analytical 1 d simulations of the diffusion profiles in the deepest aquitard revealed that dnapl contamination down to the top of this aquitard occurred with minimal delay after dnapl waste disposal began the results highlight the necessity of high resolution vertical profiling for assessing the presence of imperceptible features relevant to dnapl migration and integrity of individual aquitards affecting organic contaminant source zone mass and phase distributions over decades graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquitard integrity chlorinated

contamination cherry et al 2006 parker et al 2004 until a few decades ago it was assumed that aquitards generally prevent contamination of underlying confined aquifers from surface contamination

liquids dnapl in the source zones e g ppg industries 1995 chapuis 2013 pedretti et al 2013 fjordbøge et al 2017 this contradicts the assumption that low permeability sediments with hydraulic conductivities less than 10 7 cm s based on usepa guidance for compacted clay landfill liners e g green et al 1981 generally prevent the migration of contaminants into underlying aquifers research at industrial waste disposal sites in the 1990 s suggested that deep dnapl migration can be attributed to pre existing fractures in natural clay rich sediments that are imperceptible in bulk hydraulic

demonstrated that dnapls have an exceptional propensity to enter and migrate through very small fractures even those with hydraulic apertures smaller than 10 μm these observations were confirmed by several field studies ppg industries 1995 reported the migration of tetrachlorethylene pce and trichlorethylene tce dnapls through a 50 m thick alluvial clay aquitard to the underlying aquifer at a chemical manufacturing facility due to root holes and fractures acting as preferential pathways for dnapl migration chapuis 2013 observed high concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons in a confined aquifer overlain by a glacial till aquitard where dnapl migration through micro fractures was the most likely explanation fjordbøge et al 2017 characterized a clay till aquitard underlying a pce and tce dnapl source zone where vertical migration of dnapl occurred through fractures in a shallow oxidized zone and to a lesser extent through a less fractured reduced zone reaching the underlying confined limestone aquifer beside fractures unlithified clay rich aquitards in alluvial settings often enclose thin sand intercalations that can create a stair step pattern of preferential flow paths for dnapl flow e g morrison et al 1998 parker 1996 pedretti et al 2013 observed lithologic heterogeneities in a shallow clay aquitard while investigating the distribution of chlorinated hydrocarbon contamination mainly pce and tce at the regional scale in an alluvial multi aquifer aquitard system where contaminants breached the clay aquitard at several sites in the region reaching the underlying confined aquifer the literature also reports some aquitards capable of preventing dnapl penetration or allow only partial migration morrison et al 1998 reported partial pce dnapl penetration in a thin surficial clayey aquitard at a site where dnapl was released under controlled conditions vertical microfractures allowed dnapl migration through an upper part whereas the lower part provided resistance to dnapl flow parker et al 2004 showed tce dnapl accumulation at the bottom of a sandy aquifer overlying a thick aquitard at an industrial property diffusion profiles of dissolved contaminants were observed in the upper part of the aquitard but with no evidence of dnapl penetration attributed to lack of fractures given the plasticity of this lacustrine sediment and lack of post deposition exposure adamson et al 2015a and adamson et al 2015b advanced the use of diffusion transport contaminant concentration profiles in low permeability clay rich sediments as a means to assess contaminant source zone history after parker et al 1994 and parker et al 2004 the source history model proposed by adamson et al 2015b was demonstrated at two industrial sites with chlorinated ethenes and ethanes showing that some decades after the first contaminat spill most of the contaminant mass occurred in the low permeability layers aquitards due to diffusion enhanced by sorption the results suggested high aquitard integrity with respect to dnapl penetration but also how diffusive mass transfer alters the location and phase of contamination notwithstanding the existing literature the parameters that control the integrity of clayey aquitards are not yet clear and often appear to be strongly site specific requiring careful investigation methods including collection and sampling of minimally disturbed continuous cores thus there is a need for improving the scientific knowledge with respect to different dnapl source conditions and geologic settings for assessing aquitard integrity the objective of this paper is to evaluate the integrity of distinct silt and clay rich non indurated unlithified aquitards of fluvial origin with different degrees of reactivity to contaminant biodegradation to the best of our knowledge the assessment of the integrity of multiple stacked reactive aquitards was never reported in the literature for this purpose a site was selected where a 60 m thick multi layered aquifer aquitard system of alluvial origin was contaminated by chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons predominantly with chloroethenes originating from a known mixed dnapl source high resolution hydraulic head geochemistry and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration profiles were determined using continuous cores along a transverse cross section i e transect adjacent to the contamination source the investigated multi layered aquifer aquitard configuration is representative of many other alluvial systems e g blum and törnqvist 2000 so the insights as well as the methods applied are useful for assessment of non indurated aquitard integrity at other sites 2 site description the selected caretti site is located 1 km east of the historical center of ferrara in the eastern sector of the padana plain about 4 km south of the po river and covers an area of about 1 km2 fig 1 the hydrostratigraphy exhibits an alternation of fine to coarse grained sands of higher hydraulic conductivity aquifers and silty clayey layers of lower hydraulic conductivity aquitards to a depth of around 200 m below ground surface m bgs molinari et al 2007 three aquifers are located in the upper 60 m bgs indicated as a0 upper a1 and lower a1 regione emilia romagna and eni agip 1998 whereby each of them is overlain by a non indurated aquitard named after the underlying aquifer q0 upper q1 and lower q1 fig 2 the a0 aquifer consists of scattered sandy lenses intermingled with fine grained deposits amorosi and colalongo 2005 the upper a1 aquifer is characterized by low spatial continuity i e low amalgamation between sandy lenses that form sandy bodies extended for 10 100 m2 whereas the lower a1 aquifer is a regionally extensive sandy body on the scale of 10 000 m2 the main groundwater flow direction at the caretti site is nne in the a0 aquifer nw in the upper a1 aquifer and e in the lower a1 nijenhuis et al 2013 filippini et al 2016 two main sources contribute to the recharge of the multi aquifer system the po river lateral recharge and the local rainfall vertical recharge rapti caputo and martinelli 2009 the averaged contribution of vertical recharge decreases from 75 in the a0 down to 26 in the lower a1 whereas the lateral recharge increases with increasing aquifer depth from 25 in the a0 up to 74 in the lower a1 filippini et al 2015 in the ferrara region the confined lower a1 aquifer is exploited at several locations for irrigation or drinking water supply and the overlying lower q1 aquitard is considered capable to protect the quality of this aquifer as reported in several technical documents not published previous investigations at the caretti site gargini et al 2011 revealed that the aquifers a0 and upper a1 are contaminated by chlorinated hydrocarbons originating from urban waste and chlorinated pitches containing a mixture of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes that were deposited primarily as dnapl in a clay pit known as southern dump between the late 1950s and 1970s fig 1 groundwater contamination by chlorinated hydrocarbons was first detected in 2000 by the local environmental authority during an investigation for the development of a new residential area two chlorinated hydrocarbon plumes were identified in the a0 and upper a1 aquifers that have migrated about 500 m down gradient of the southern dump fig 1 the plume in the a0 aquifer consists primarily of chloroethenes pce tce 1 1 dichloroethene 11dce cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce trans 1 2 dichloroethene tdce vinyl chloride vc and secondarily of chloroethanes 1 1 1 2 tetrachloroethane 1112teca 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane 1122teca 1 1 2 trichloroethane 112tca 1 2 dichloroethane 12dca and chloromethanes carbon tetrachloride ct chloroform cf dichloromethane dcm only chloroethenes pce tce 11dce cdce tdce and a few chloroethanes and chloromethanes 1122teca 112tca cf dcm were detected in the plume of the upper a1 aquifer the lower a1 aquifer is considered uncontaminated based on separate characterization efforts by the local authorities 3 materials and methods 3 1 types of data collected stratigraphic hydraulic head and chemical data were collected along a 60 m wide x 60 m deep cross section i e transect located at the northern end of the southern dump perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction of the a0 aquifer the transect consists of two deep profiles 60 m bgs mc1 2 and mc4 5 at both ends and one shallower profile 30 m bgs mc3 in the center fig 2 whereby the horizontal distance between the three profiles is 30 m data collection and analysis are described in the following sections and further in the supplementary material sm 3 2 continuous coring and core subsampling continuous cores were collected from the three locations in july 2013 using a wireline coring system with triple tube core barrel that provided consistent high core recovery of 95 98 for the two deep profiles mc1 2 and mc4 5 cores were collected at slightly different locations 4 5 m apart for the shallower 0 30 m bgs and the deeper interval 28 60 m bgs fig 2 before collecting cores from the deeper interval the upper 28 m of the borehole was sealed with permanent casing to avoid cross contamination of the deepest aquifer lower a1 upon retrieval at ground surface the cores were split longitudinally one half was used for detailed lithostratigraphic descriptive logging and pocket penetrometer tests eijkelkamp pocket penetrometer model 06 03 to evaluate sediment consistency while the other half was used for collection of large sediment samples 250 g each the sediment samples were collected at a 1 m spacing at locations mc1 2 and mc3 for measurement of grain size distributions in the sandy and silty clay rich layers at the mc4 5 location the other half of the cores was subsampled for measurement of chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations and for determination of porosity and organic carbon content the mc4 5 location was selected to perform the sediment core subsampling as it was expected to be the most contaminated profile based on previous site characterization gargini et al 2011 nijenhuis et al 2013 stratigraphic information from the cores was complemented by piezocone penetration tests cptu to 30 m depth performed by the municipality of ferrara 50 m southeastward from the transect fig 1 core subsampling was conducted following the procedure described by wanner et al 2016 adamson et al 2015a parker et al 2004 and parker et al 2003 targeting a vertical spacing along the core axis of about 10 cm three subsamples were collected at each depth 297 sampling depths in total one for chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration analyses one for sediment properties total porosity ϕ and organic carbon fraction foc and a third for screening for the presence of dnapl phase using a hydrophobic dye oil red o 3 3 multilevel systems for hydraulic head and groundwater chemistry profiles after coring groundwater multilevel monitoring systems were installed in the five boreholes along the transect fig 2 among the commercially available multilevel systems the solinst cmt system einarson 2006 was selected because 1 it is suitable for unconsolidated sediment settings einarson and cherry 2002 and 2 it allows selection of screen position and lengths in the field based on borehole specific lithology distributions from core logging each of the five cmt systems was equipped with 7 screens at discrete depths targeting both aquifers and aquitards and avoiding cross connection across visually distinct permeability zones fig 2 groundwater from the cmts was sampled in november 2013 using dedicated 6 mm od teflon tubing and a peristaltic pump model 410 peristaltic pump solinst to perform cation anion and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration analyses hydraulic heads were manually monitored in the cmts twice a week between september 9 2013 and july 28 2014 321 days using a 4 mm diameter water level meter model 102 narrow diameter cable water level meter solinst 3 4 lab analyses of sediment and groundwater samples chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration analyses on core subsamples was performed at the university of guelph on canada the contaminants were extracted from the sediment subsamples as described by dincutoiu et al 2003 the analytical technique provides the total chlorinated hydrocarbon analyte mass per mass of wet sediment ct and does not distinguish between the aqueous sorbed and napl phases assuming dnapl free conditions the pore water concentration cw and sorbed mass concentration cs in the sediment subsamples can be estimated assuming equilibrium partitioning between dissolved and sorbed phases e g parker et al 2004 adamson et al 2015a in addition to direct field screening tests with dye occurrence of pure phase dnapl in the sediment samples was verified by comparing the estimated cw of each compound derived from ct measurements in sediment samples with their effective solubility based on an estimated analyte mole fraction provided in sm anion concentrations in groundwater were analyzed at the university of bologna italy by ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography using a metrohm 883 basic ic plus chromatograph cations were analyzed in the same lab by flame atomic absorption spectrometry using a perkinelmer aa100 spectrometer chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations in groundwater samples were analyzed by a private certified laboratory chelab s r l treviso italy using the analytical methods epa 5030 c u s epa 2003 and epa 8260 c u s epa 2006 3 5 analytical modeling of diffusive transport in aquitard lower q1 the aim of the analytical modeling was to estimate the time of contaminant arrival based on the fitting of the concentration with distance profiles measured in the lower q1 aquitard with field and or literature derived parameters for the sediment and solute the pce and tce profiles appeared to be diffusion controlled and pce and tce transport in the lower q1 aquitard was simulated using a 1d analytical solution of fick s second law assuming linear instantaneous sorption e g parker et al 2004 parker 1996 narasimhan 2004 for a homogeneous semi infinite porous medium e g carslaw and jaeger 1959 1 cw c0 erfc z 2 tde r 1 2 where cw is the chlorinated hydrocarbon pore water concentration mg l co is the concentration at the

z is the vertical depth cm with z 0 at the aquitard interface and t is time s biodegradation of parent compounds in the lower q1 aquitard was assumed to be minor and not included in the simulations as the chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration analyses did not show occurrence of the dechlorination product vc and relatively low concentrations of cdce max 0 6 mg l compared to much higher concentrations of the parent compounds pce and tce max 37 and 10 mg l respectively in the case of pce a constant concentration was fixed at the model interface based on the characteristic shape of the profile with concentrations declining with distance into the aquitard suggesting relatively steady concentrations at the interface and the diffusion time was used as a fitting parameter by varying it until a minimal deviation between measured and modeled concentrations was obtained in contrast the tce profile showed a profile shape consistent with a declining concentration at the interface and thus a temporal evolution step decline of the tce concentration at the interface was evaluated this decline was taken into account by superimposing analytical solutions to simulate a two step concentration at the interface with cw calculated for both steps using eq s 7 in the sm in the first step a high tce concentration representative of an earlier contamination stage was fixed at the model interface applying the entire diffusion time obtained from the pce modeling in the second step a lower tce concentration was assigned at the interface over a shorter time period to simulate a second stage when the boundary concentration was clearly lower and by applying the concept of superposition these results were subtracted from results of the first step to obtain the combined profile the diffusion time of the second step and the interface tce concentrations of both steps were varied until reaching minimal deviation between measured and modeled concentrations deviation between measured m and modeled m concentrations was quantified using the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 legates and mccabe jr 1999 2 nse 1 i n 1 mi mi 2 i n 1 mi mm 2 where mm is the measured mean nse ranges from minus infinity to 1 with higher values indicating better fit adamson et al 2015b recently provided a source history model for estimating interface concentration history based on measured low k zone profiles which was applied as a verification for the analytically simulated profiles and for refining the concentration history at the interface for the tce profile the primary difference for the fits using the source history model is that the total mass concentrations ct are used as primary input whereas the porewater concentration cw are estimated by the model applying average parameter values for bulk density porosity ϕ and estimated r factor the source history simulation results are provided in the sm 4 results and discussion 4 1 contaminant distributions as evidence for aquitard integrity the thickness of aquitard q0 at the site is clearly altered due to past excavation for waste disposal the waste material likely reaches a thickness equal to or higher than the thickness of q0 in the area of the transect e g in the mc3 profile only 1 m of fine grained deposits of the q0 aquitard separate the wastes from the a0 aquifer fig 3 thus the integrity of the aquitard q0 is difficult to assess as the contaminants may have reached the underlying a0 aquifer either due to poor integrity of the q0 or because the waste dumps penetrated the q0 due to excavations and contacted the top of the a0 directly peaks of chloroethene concentrations were detected into the q0 aquitard from sediment samples along core mc4 5 mostly cdce and vc with estimated pore water concentrations cw up to 197 and 16 μg l respectively that suggest strong contaminant retention and degradation in the aquitard layer fig 4 occurrence of chloroethenes in the q0 is also confirmed by groundwater concentrations gw along profiles mc4 5 and mc3 the absence of contaminants into this aquitard along profile mc1 2 is more likely justified by the absence of residual waste above the profile fig 3 rather than locally high q0 aquitard integrity since the profile is positioned at the edge of or beyond the source zone the cumulative mass distribution per unit area of total vocs chloroethenes chloroethanes and chloromethanes along the mc4 5 profile suggests accumulation contaminants at the interface between aquifer a0 and aquitard upper q1 especially pce cdce 1122teca and 112tca with peak cw of 54 141 86 and 23 μg l respectively and at the interface between aquifer upper a1 and aquitard lower q1 mostly pce and tce with max cw of 37 and 10 μg l respectively in a manner consistent with dnapl migration and preferential accumulation at those interfaces where capillary pressures were insufficient to invade sediments with different and smaller pore geometry fig 5 the major mass accumulation zone occurs at the top of the upper q1 aquitard showing strong resistance of dnapl penetration i e resistance to vertical flow and enhanced lateral dnapl migration in this system as evidenced by the sudden occurrence of the chloroethanes and their absence above this depth this mass accumulation also corresponds to organic rich sublayers in the top meter of the upper q1 aquitard max foc of 2 6 at 9 5 m bgs see fig 3 where the organic sediment facilitates contaminant retention by sorption the same organic rich sublayers provide a favorable environment for reductive dechlorination filippini et al 2016 observed reductive dechlorination of chloroethenes pce and tce and accumulation of by products mainly cdce and vc during contaminant retention and migration within these fine organic rich sediments by analogy chlorinated ethanes 112tca 12dca and methanes dcm cm that occur exclusively in the shallowest 10 12 m of the profile are likely by products from dechlorination of higher chlorinated compounds e g 1112teca 1122teca and cf despite the high resistance to dnapl penetration inferred for the upper q1 aquitard the cumulative mass profiles strongly support some dnapl invasion through this aquitard given the contamination throughout the underlying upper a1 aquifer down to the top of lower q1 where the second largest chloroethene mass accumulation was registered the low contaminant concentrations in the aquifer upper a1 interposed between the two contaminated aquitards upper and lower q1 at the time of this investigation are explainable due to the active groundwater flow in the aquifer over the last decades and much lower sorption in the sandy sediments compared to fine grained organic rich sediments of the underlying and overlying aquitards thus the present day contaminant distributions appear strongly affected by an earlier contamination stage when dnapl was migrating preferentially downward and laterally along lower kv aquitard interfaces even though field tests with dye provided negative results along the whole profile the occurrence of pure phase dnapl could be inferred in at least one sample within the a0 aquifer where estimated pce pore water concentration most likely exceeded effective solubility limits see sm few other shallow samples i e from q0 aquitard a0 aquifer and upper q1 aquitard showed pore water concentration possibly close to effective solubility for some compounds this suggests little remaining and highly residualized dnapl at the time of investigation but most likely much more mobile dnapl nearer the time of disposal the contaminant profiles from mc4 5 cores show evidence of diffusion dominated transport i e characteristic diffusion profiles at the top of the lower q1 aquitard with rapid decrease of concentration below the aquifer aquitard interface see fig 8 suggesting good aquitard integrity preventing deeper dnapl penetration into and below this zone however the aquitard did not prevent migration of some contaminants into the lower a1 aquifer pce and tce concentrations up to 3 mg l much lower than in the overlying aquitard showing evidence of some dnapl migration pathways to these depths which might come from breaches in this aquitard upgradient from the core location with horizontal migration by groundwater flow in the lower a1 consideration was given to possible cross contaminant due to drag down of much higher concentrations and presence of dnapl shallower in the profile however the field methods involved significant steps to reduce this situation using a separate borehole with a blank casing through the shallower zone for the deep coring locations this makes the cross connection explanation unlikely with the more likely scenario that preferential contaminant pathways must have existed at an early stage when mobile dnapls were present the propensity for deep migration pathways no longer exists once the mobile dnapl phase dissolves away to the point where the driving force diminishes which is the condition expected at the drilling locations but maybe not internal to the dump area contaminant concentration profiles at the top of the lower q1 aquitard are discussed in section 4 3 providing insights on source history 4 2 hydraulic head and hydrochemistry profiles as complementary evidence the strongest vertical hydraulic head variations δhv of about 0 1 m with depth are localized within the upper q1 and lower q1 aquitards fig 6 a similar variation is observed in the aquitard below the lower a1 aquifer which is beyond the zone of relevance of this paper but confirms repeated occurrence of head losses in all aquitards the vertical gradient variability along the thickness of an aquitard layer is caused by heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity in the vertical direction kv with steeper gradient in sub layers of lower kv cherry et al 2006 from a stratigraphic viewpoint the main δhv in the upper q1 aquitard occur inside the organic rich layer from 8 to 11 m bgs suggesting this is a sub layer of lower vertical hydraulic conductivity able to reduce groundwater and dnapl flow between the aquifers a0 and upper a1 the vertical distribution of field parameters and ion concentrations shows decreasing trends increasing in the case of ph from aquifer a0 to aquifer upper a1 suggesting vertical migration down to the upper a1 aquifer of dissolved components originating from dump leachate and redox influences by the presence of high voc concentrations fig 7 an exception was observed for potassium k and fluoride f where concentrations drop close to zero below the upper q1 aquitard possibly due to adsorption onto clay minerals oxides and or hydroxides pickering 1985 mitra and prakash 1956 which are abundant in the ferrara aquitards amorosi et al 2002 based on these observations the upper q1 appears to be an ineffective barrier against the vertical migration of dissolved ions and especially ineffective barrier to dnapl otherwise if the a0 and upper a1 aquifer were effectively insulated by the upper q1 aquitard a change in the vertical trends would have been observed between the two aquifers since they are recharged by different sources filippini et al 2015 and have different hydrochemistry at the regional scale molinari et al 2007 the low integrity of the upper q1 aquitard is likely due to the occurrence of imperceptible fractures and coarse grained sub layers of higher kv that facilitate vertical groundwater exchanges between the over and underlying a0 and upper a1 aquifers the higher ion concentration observed in this aquitard and in the overlying and underlying aquifers along mc4 5 and mc3 profiles in comparison to mc1 2 is explained considering that residual waste only remained at the top of the first two profiles fig 3 an exception is so4 which shows the highest concentration in profile mc1 2 while in the more contaminated mc4 5 and mc3 profiles this had likely been depleted as an electron acceptor for reductive biotransformation of chlorinated compounds ndon et al 2000 the lithostratigraphic features of the lower q1 aquitard uniform grain size high clay content of 40 no visual evidence of fracturing suggest absence of preferential pathways for contaminant migration and thus a higher degree of integrity compared to the shallower aquitard units hydraulic heads in the lower q1 shows the occurrence of a sub layer of low vertical hydraulic conductivity main δhv localized in the zone of a markedly clayey section from 28 to 30 5 m bgs characterized by hard consistency from pocket penetrometer tests see fig 3 such layer is expected to provide an effective insulation between the overlying upper a1 and underlying lower a1 aquifers despite the absence of visible fractures in the aquitard at the core scale the pore pressure trend u kpa obtained from a cptu performed 50 m southeastward from the transect shows a sudden decrease of u at the same depth of the main δhv in the lower q1 aquitard fig 6 indicating an over consolidation of the layer chen and mayne 1996 mayne et al 1990 amorosi and marchi 1999 and a consequent prone to fracturing behavior fragility with probable occurrence of micro fractures such micro fractures represent an ideal preferential pathway for the migration of small amounts of dnapl thought the protective clayey layer of the lower q1 aquitard in the context of the southeastern po river plain a high consolidation of clays with consequential micro fracturing is likely attributed to cohesive sediment desiccation during the prolonged phase of subaerial exposure that characterized the area during the last glacial maximum and the first stages of transgression amorosi and marchi 1999 rizzini 1974 the typical occurrence of fractures and dnapl migration pathways in natural clay rich aquitards was also reported by morrison et al 1998 and cherry et al 2006 especially in clayey aquitards thinner than 15 m of fluvial origin and overconsolidated hydrochemistry further distinguishes the lower q1 aquitard conditions compared to the shallower system field parameters and ion concentrations show sharp changes of vertical trends below the lower q1 aquitard suggesting that the upper and lower a1 aquifers have dissimilar hydrochemistry with the lower q1 aquitard reducing fluxes between the two aquifers fig 7 in particular the lowest ion concentrations of the entire profiles were observed at the top of the lower a1 aquifer suggesting no or much lower influence from the surficial contaminant inputs compared to the two shallower aquifers this observation confirms that the propensity for deep migration pathways through the deeper aquitard is only effective in the presence of mobile dnapl phase but not for dissolved components 4 3 lower q1 aquitard integrity from diffusion transport the contaminant distributions of pce and tce at the top of the lower q1 aquitard show concentration profiles characteristic of transient diffusive transport fig 8 the opportunity was taken to use these profiles for assessing the time of first contaminant arrival at the lower q1 aquitard to this aim the pce and tce profiles were reproduced using a mathematical model for 1 d diffusive transport with linear instantaneous sorption described in section 3 5 the shape of the pce profile shows the peak concentration at the aquifer aquitard interface with pce boundary concentration of 37 mg l not far from the lower limit of estimated effective solubility i e 54 mg l see sm suggesting possible occurrence of dnapl over most or nearly all of the contamination history based on site history dnapl contaminants were disposed in the southern dump between the late 1950s and 1970s transport time was varied from 10 to 60 years to represent the possible time lapse between initial contamination and field characterization in 2013 a best fit between modeled and measured profiles was obtained for 40 years of diffusive migration fig 8 suggesting contamination reached the interface shortly after the waste disposal occurred the tce profile in the lower q1 aquitard has its peak concentration a few cm below the aquifer aquitard interface showing back diffusion from the lower q1 aquitard into the upper a1 aquifer suggesting a recent shift to a lower concentration at the boundary over the diffusion time period chapman and parker 2005 although both pce and tce were likely present as dnapl at this interface a faster decline of tce compared to pce may be best explained by their original composition in the dnapl and higher effective solubility for tce causing a more rapid depletion in tce at the boundary as a result in the case of the tce modeling the time for 1 d diffusive migration derived from the pce best fit time i e 40 years and the concentration of tce at the interface was used as the fitting or adjustment parameter a best fit was determined considering two steps of decreasing tce at the boundary corresponding to 70 mg l for the first 12 years and 10 mg l for the remaining 28 years the iterative modeling approach described above was corroborated using the source history model developed by adamson et al 2015b with the same boundary concentrations sm figs s4 and s5 however the assumption of a two stage boundary condition over simplifies the possibility for strong initial gradients and tce mass transfer loss from the dnapl source followed by a stage with low concentrations at the boundary and a concentration gradient reversal that would attenuate strongly due to diffusion both in and out of the lower q1 aquitard as an alternative scenario the source history model tool was applied assuming an exponentially declining source sm fig s6 also providing a reasonable fit to the measured profile although with slightly larger associated error this shows the non unique nature of fits for various assumptions regarding source history conditions further to this dnapl invasion into the micro fractures of the lower q1 cannot be completely ruled out thus the influence of a single fracture volume of dnapl invading a typical size fracture in clays assumed to by 10 50 μm in aperture e g jørgensen et al 1998 o hara et al 2000 hinsby et al 1996 mckay et al 1993 jørgensen et al 2002 rudolph et al 1991 was evaluated the time of diffusion based mass transfer of pce and tce from dnapl phase in the fractures causing complete dnapl dissolution from the fractures was estimated between 38 days and 2 6 years for pce and between 1 and 32 days for tce following parker et al 1994 details in the sm given such quick disappearance times by a single loading of dnapl invading these fractures with small apertures possible dissolution of dnapl by diffusion from the micro fractures would have unlikely interfered with the observed diffusion transport characteristics of the profiles as confirmed by the ability to simulate these pce and tce profiles however it is also unlikely that a single fracture filling of dnapl would occur after entry when dnapl persists at the overlying aquifer aquitard interface hence the simplest scenario of no dnapl entry into the lower q1 aquitard seems most reasonable and defensible interpretation furthermore it is also expected that dnapl retention occurs with depth of migration causing lower volumes of dnapl at the top of this lower q1 aquitard interface making it difficult to overcome entry pressures in deep micro fractures 5 conclusions three clay rich non indurated aquitards in a multi layered aquifer aquitard system of alluvial origin did not prevent deep dnapl migration to lower aquifers likely due to the occurrence of small scale lithologic heterogeneities and micro fractures this observation was made in a setting where before this study the aquitards were considered protective of groundwater in the underlying aquifers based on standard methods of site characterization such as lithology descriptions and bulk hydraulic conductivities whereas the intermediate aquitard showed low integrity allowing fast advective migration of contaminants towards the underlying aquifer due to occurrence of lithologic heterogeneities the deepest aquitard showed evidence of dnapl accumulation at the upper boundary and only diffusive transport i e diffusion profiles with sorption due to partitioning to solid phase organic carbon without discernible effects of advection suggesting much higher aquitard integrity the high resolution concentration profiles showed that the two shallower aquitard units q0 and upper q1 retained considerable dnapl mass at near their upper boundaries and strongly reduced the flux of dnapl to the lower system but not completely preventing deep migration both aquitards enhanced contaminant biodegradation due to high organic carbon content influencing the contaminant mixtures that reached the underlying aquifers at the core locations it appears that dnapl did not enter the deepest lower q1 aquitard as diffusion transport matches the sharp concentration decline with distance from the top of the aquitard over approximately 40 years however deeper contamination in the lower a1 aquifer although at much lower concentrations is observed most likely due to some dnapl penetration of the lower q1 aquitard up gradient from the core locations or aqueous phase transport along flow lines traveling through the dnapl in the overlying units making the integrity assessment of the lower q1 aquitard uncertain beyond the local study area concentration profiles produced by diffusive transport in this aquitard allowed assessing the approximate timing since initial contaminant arrival at the top of the aquitard which appears to have occurred with minimal delay from surficial contamination events suggesting rapid dnapl migration through the subsurface the two deeper aquitards impeded dnapl fluxes to some extent with accumulation on these units fostering diffusion into aquitards where substantial mass resides as dissolved and sorbed phases posing a secondary long term source of contamination to the adjacent aquifers due to slow back diffusion even after complete dissolution of the dnapl or active remediation of the waste zone knowing that preferential accumulation occurred at the top of lower k clay rich units should also guide placement of future monitoring points the different behavior observed for distinct aquitards of the same multi layer aquifer aquitard system highlights the need for high resolution aquitard specific investigations for 1 defining the degree of protection provided to the underlying aquifers and 2 assessing the long term influence that aquitards might have

site than in that from the rural site but similar to that from the aquafarm site in the abiotic matrices different mp polymer compositions were observed among the three sites diverse polymers were found in marine matrices from the urban site implying diverse mp sources in highly populated and industrialized areas polystyrene was more abundant in the aquafarm site reflecting the wide use of expanded polystyrene aquaculture buoys polypropylene was more abundant at the rural site probably due to the use of polypropylene ropes and nets in fishing activity mp accumulation profiles in marine invertebrates showed trends similar to those exhibited by abiotic matrices reflecting coastal area use patterns these results indicate that marine mps are generated from both land and marine based sources and that the abiotic and biotic marine matrices reflect the mp characteristics graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic aquatic environment coastal area use pattern polymer composition source environmental matrix 1 introduction microplastics mps are a form of marine debris measuring 5 mm in size arthur et al 2009 gesamp 2019 mps are classified as either primary or secondary according to their production method such that primary mps are intentionally manufactured and added to products such as cosmetic products and abrasive materials and secondary mps are formed through the breakdown of larger plastics during use or after disposal to the environment arthur et al 2009 contamination by mps has become a global environmental concern due to their ubiquitous distribution in the ocean from pole to pole from the surface to the seafloor sul and costa 2014 auta et al 2017 and within marine species at every level of the food web gall and thompson 2015 rochman 2018 ingested mps can cause physical damage such as intestinal obstruction and stomach ulcers carpenter et al 1972 and can transfer contaminants such as plastic additives and sorbed chemicals from seawater to marine organisms jang et al 2016 ziccardi et al 2016 inducing adverse biological effects von moos et al 2012 browne et al 2013 rochman et al 2013 like macro debris mps in the ocean can come from a variety of land and marine based sources roughly 80 of marine debris of which 60 80 is plastic has been estimated to originate from land based sources and the remainder from marine based activity sheavly 2005 therefore land based input is considered a major source of microplastics in the ocean some studies have attempted to identify the sources of mps on land e g clothes washing and cosmetics fendall and sewell 2009 browne et al 2011 and input pathways into the ocean e g sewage treatment plant effluents and riverine input leslie et al 2017 hurley et al 2018 previous studies have reported increasing mp levels in coastal sediments and seawater near populated areas frère et al 2017 vianello et al 2013 yonkos et al 2014 song et al 2018 implying a close relationship between land based human activities and mp pollution of marine environments not only land based but also marine based human activities e g shipping fisheries and aquaculture can be important sources of marine mps however our understanding of these sources their emission amounts their pathway to the environment and the fragmentation of plastic debris after disposal remain minimal mp physicochemical properties such as shape color and polymer type can provide information about their sources shim et al 2018 the original shape and color of plastics can be lost or changed by environmental weathering processes such as fragmentation and discoloration but their main polymer type does not change therefore polymer composition is a useful tool for identifying mp sources or origins in the environment for example alkyd particles on the ocean surface are derived from ship paint song et al 2014 polyester and acrylic fibers are commonly used for fabric browne et al 2010 and synthetic rubber is a tire ingredient wagner et al 2018 however most studies performed polymer identification for a small portion of suspected particles in their samples to validate their optical microscopy particle count estimate li et al 2016 leslie et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2018 nel et al 2018 because spectroscopic identification for all suspected particles on filter paper is a time consuming job song et al 2015 the polymer composition of mp can provide additional information about chemical substances contained because additive chemicals differ among plastic products and polymer types lithner et al 2011 jang et al 2017 and their leachates have a different toxicity to organisms bejgarn et al 2015 in this study we hypothesize that the polymer composition of mps in marine matrices would differ between regions according to coastal area use pattern and that these compositions would be reflected in marine species inhabiting these regions we analyzed mps in abiotic matrices seawater and sediment and biotic matrices mussels oysters and polychaetes from three coastal sites representing urban aquafarm and rural areas the polymer compositions of all plastic like particles were identified road dust and creek water were also collected from the urban area to compare their polymer compositions with those of marine matrices collected nearby 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling strategy we collected samples of abiotic matrices including seawater and sediment and biotic matrices including mussels mytilus edulis oysters crassostrea gigas and polychaetes perinereis aibuhitensis from the southern part of south korea between march and april 2016 fig 1 and fig s1 we selected three sites urban aquafarm and rural differing in land or sea use and pollution load fig 1 the urban site is located in masan bay a semi enclosed bay surrounded by the densely populated city of changwon 2682 people km2 which has petrochemical heavy metal electrical and plastic industries in 1983 masan bay was designated a special management area in korea due to its heavy loads of land driven contaminants shim et al 1999 hong et al 2003 li et al 2008 the aquafarm site is located in jinhae bay and has relatively low population density 198 people km2 compared to the urban site a number of oyster farms are distributed inside the bay employing a suspended culture technique using expanded polystyrene eps buoys this bay is the main shellfish farming area in the gyeongnam do region producing about 0 3 million tons of bivalves accounting for about 80 of the total shellfish production in korea gndi 2012 the rural site is located in the southernmost island of geoje and contains a small fishing village with low population density 55 people km2 and a small harbor for fishing boats but no industrial facilities or aquafarms the abiotic and biotic matrix sampling sites and the sampling points at each site are presented in fig 1 and fig s1 more than 30 mussels 4 5 5 cm and 30 oysters 4 9 cm were collected from intertidal rocky shores from the urban and rural sites and from under high density polyethylene hdpe buoys floating on the sea surface at the aquafarm site we sampled 100 l of surface seawater top 0 10 cm in triplicate near the bivalve sampling sites by hand filtering through a net mesh 20 μm and collected 100 l of sub surface water top 1 m from the aquafarm site in january 2017 more than 30 polychaete worms 10 30 cm were collected from the intertidal zone of aquafarm and rural sites using a shovel during low tide and from the subtidal zone of the urban site using a van veen grab sampler intact polychaetes were sampled and rinsed with filtered seawater whatman gf f 0 75 μm to remove all external particles and then transferred to a glass bottle containing 150 ml of filtered seawater three polychaetes were placed in a beaker for 3 days and their feces were collected for mp analysis during polychaete sampling at each site we also collected sediment top 0 5 cm in duplicate all samples except for the polychaetes were stored at 20 c until analysis creek discharge and urban runoff were expected to be important sources of mps in the environment to compare the mp contamination characteristics between land based mp input sources and marine matrices in urban area creek water and road dust were collected in this region road dust surface area 4 m2 was collected from the road right next to the urban sampling site bivalves and seawater in january 2017 figs 1 and 5 and creek water 100 l was collected from namcheon stream across the city in masan bay during low tide in july 2018 2 2 microplastic analysis the information on the volume and number of samples subjected to microplastic analysis is summarized in table s1 sediment samples were analyzed following the method of eo et al 2018 about 50 ml of wet sediment was weighed in a polyethylene pe bottle and then mixed with diluted lithium metatungstate solution lmt 50 ml 1 6 g ml and shaken for 1 min after settling the supernatant was transferred to a glass beaker this process was repeated three times the supernatant was passed through a 20 μm metal sieve the isolated particles were treated with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 and fe іі solution 75 c 100 rpm to remove organic matter secondary density separation was then conducted using sodium chloride nacl 1 2 g ml and supernatant was filtered through filter paper 20 μm polycarbonate sterlitech using a vacuum system road dust samples 50 ml 228 g were treated in the same manner as sediment samples the analysis of mps in seawater and creek water was performed following the method of song et al 2018 the water sample was passed through a 20 μm metal sieve to reduce the volume the remaining sample in the sieve was transferred to a glass beaker and wet peroxide oxidation with 35 h2o2 and fe ii solution added at 75 c after removing organic matter 6 g of nacl was added per 20 ml of sample and stirred at 100 rpm the sample was transferred to glass funnel for density separation after one day the settled particles were drained and the supernatant was filtered through filter paper 20 μm polycarbonate sterlitech bivalve samples were analyzed following the method of jang et al 2016 and cho et al 2019 after removing the shell the soft tissue was rinsed with commercial ultrapure water hplc grade daejung chemicals and metals co to remove remaining particles the sample was placed in a glass beaker and then 10 ml lipase lipex 100l novozymes bagsværd denmark 5 ml of protease savinase 16l novozymes and 185 ml of distilled water was added to digest organic matter using a magnetic stirrer the sample solution was stirred overnight at 200 rpm and 60 c after this digestion step the digested solution was sieved through a 20 μm sieve and rinsed with ultrapure water the particles remaining on the sieve were transferred to a glass funnel with nacl 1 2 g ml and left overnight the precipitate was removed twice the supernatant was filtered through filter papers 20 μm polycarbonate sterlitech the poychaete feces were prepared for microplastic analysis in accordance with the methods described in jang et al 2018 the fecal samples were treated with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic material and left 3 days the samples were transferred to a glass funnel with lmt solution for density separation the supernatant was filtered through filter papers 20 μm polycarbonate sterlitech filters were dried at room temperature and stored in glass petri dishes all suspected mp particles to 50 μm found on filter paper were identified using a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir microscope thermo nicolet 6700 continuum thermo scientific waltham ma usa song et al 2015 μft ir spectra of all particles were collected with an average of 128 scans over the spectral range of 650 4000 cm 1 in attenuated total reflectance atr mode and their polymer types were confirmed based on comparison with a spectral library database thermo scientific and recorded spectral matching with a hit index 70 was considered acceptable all mps were imaged and the longest axis was recorded according to their shape mps were categorized as fragment fiber film or sphere by the following criteria fragment is the irregularly shaped particle that appears to be broken down from a large object fiber is a thread shaped item with aspect ratio length to width 5 1 film is a flat and flexible particle with smooth or angular edges sphere is a particle with spherical smooth or granular shape to prevent contamination cotton lab coats and latex gloves were worn during the experiment and samples were kept covered with aluminum foil or glass the apparatus made of glass or metal was used in all processes except for pe bottle in sediment analysis all equipment was rinsed twice with filtered milli q water millipore tokyo japan and all liquid solutions were filtered through glass fiber filters gf f 0 75 μm whatman maidstone united kingdom uk the contamination of pe particle originated from the pe bottle was checked by analyzing water samples rinsed the inside of the bottles with filtered milli q water 100 ml 3 times n 3 before use and also by running a procedural blank sample as a result three zero and zero pe particles were detected in three bottle washed samples which is very limited compared to mp numbers found in sediment samples in addition no pe particle was found in the procedural blank sample this result indicates that microplastic contamination by pe bottle was negligible method validation was performed for organic matter digestion h2o2 or enzyme mixture and density separation lmt or nacl processes through spike tests pe specific density 0 95 g cm3 polypropylene pp 0 94 g cm3 eps 0 015 g cm3 and polyester 1 35 g cm3 particles 1 mm were made in the lab by grinding large plastic products and used as test materials ten particles of each polymer were spiked for each test in triplicate in both digestion processes h2o2 and enzyme mixture all test particles were recovered without physical damage or discoloration of polymers the recoveries of microplastics in density separation process were as follows pe 100 pp 97 6 eps 90 10 and polyester 60 10 for the nacl treatment group and pp 100 pe 100 eps 97 6 and polyester 97 6 for the lmt treatment group procedural blank samples were analyzed for every matrix the background mp levels were 0 7 0 5 particles filter paper in bivalve samples number of procedural blank samples n 18 0 particles filter paper in polychaete samples n 1 2 3 1 9 particles filter paper in seawater samples n 4 and 0 particles filter paper in sediment samples n 1 accounting for less than 10 of the mps in all samples table s2 it is difficult to completely prevent contamination when detecting particles in the micron range however the background levels should be 10 of the average values determined from the samples hanke et al 2013 a matrix spike test was performed for bivalve samples ten particles of each pe pp eps and polyester 1 mm length n 3 the mean recoveries n 3 of the added mps were 90 17 for pe 97 6 for pp 97 6 for eps and 87 6 for polyester 2 3 statistical analyses statistical analyses were conducted using spss v 19 and sigma plot v 12 0 software statistical differences in mp abundance among the matrices and or study sites were assessed using analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s test if the data were normally distributed otherwise the kruskal wallis test was used followed by multiple comparisons normality was tested using the shapiro wilk w test differences in polymer types between the sites were assessed using principal component analysis pca 3 results 3 1 regional mp contamination characteristics 3 1 1 abundance shape color and size

levels in seawater and polychaetes from the aquafarm site were higher than those from other sites but not significantly p 0 5 anova or kruskal wallis the mp concentration in sediment from the urban site was significantly higher than that from the rural site p 0 05 anova but not different from that of the aquafarm site fig 2 mps were found in various sizes shapes and colors in all matrices we determined the frequency of mps in various size ranges with results as follows 50 100 μm 10 8 100 200 μm 38 4 200 300 μm 18 1 300 400 μm 8 3 400 500 μm 8 1 500 600 μm 4 8 600 700 μm 3 9 700 800 μm 4 1 800 900 μm 1 8 and 900 1000 μm 1 7 fig s2a the most common size class was 100 200 μm in all matrices greater proportions of mp particles 300 μm were found in biotic matrices including mussel 83 oyster 78 and polychaete 70 than in abiotic matrices including seawater 59 and sediment 47 fig s2a fragments were the most dominant component across all matrices accounting for 89 of mp particles fig s2b and table s5 fibers were more abundant in polychaetes 23 and sediments 19 than in bivalves 7 and seawater 10 but the difference was statistically insignificant film and sphere type of mp were not found in all samples various colors were detected including blue black pink yellow red green and purple however colorless or transparent mp was dominant in both the abiotic and biotic matrices accounting for 95 of all mps fig s2c more colored mp was found in polychaete matrices than in other matrices due to the high proportion of black fibers 28 in polychaete samples there was no significant difference in mp size shape or color among the matrices or sampling sites 3 1 2 mp polymer types a total of 12 polymer types were identified including pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps nylon polyester acrylic polyvinyl acetate pva polyurethane pu alkyd polyoxymethylene pom polyvinyl chloride pvc and styrene butadiene sb copolymer fig 3 and table s4 most ps mps were composed of white eps density 0 02 06 g cm3 with a glossy fluffy surface among all sites and matrices low density compared to seawater specific density 1 02 g cm3 polymers pe pp and eps were more common than high density polymers nylon polyester acrylic pva pu alkyd pom pvc and sb copolymer fig 3 and table s3 in abiotic matrices seawater and sediment we found nine polymer types in the urban site samples the percentage of polymer type to the total microplastic found in abiotic matrices from urban site is as in the following pp 33 pe 28 polyester 22 pu 20 ps 10 acrylic 6 pva 4 alkyd 4 pom 2 fig 3a the proportion of high density polymers was significantly higher 33 7 in abiotic matrices from the urban site than in those from the aquafarm 1 9 and rural sites 6 7 p 0 05 kruskal wallis at the aquafarm site seven polymer types were found in abiotic matrices with the following composition ps 49 pp 26 pe 23 pva 0 8 polyester 0 4 acrylic 0 4 pu 0 4 fig 3a the proportion of ps was significantly higher in abiotic matrices from the aquafarm site 49 3 than those from the urban 5 8 and rural 1 3 sites p 0 05 anova fig 3a reflecting the widespread use of eps buoys in the aquaculture industries moe 2012 lee et al 2015 at the rural site seven polymer types were found in abiotic matrices with the following composition pp 64 pe 28 polyester 2 7 ps 1 3 pva 1 3 pu 1 3 pom 1 3 fig 3a pp mps were abundant probably due to the common use of pp rope in fishing activity jang et al 2014a pca was performed to identify regional mp contamination characteristics by examining the polymer compositions of abiotic samples from the three regions fig 4 two principal components explained 75 of the total variance in the data matrix on the loading plot pp ps and other polymers were well separated the major negative loading polymer of component 1 was pp and the major positive loading polymer was ps pe and various other polymers were loaded between pp and ps the distribution pattern of samples on the score plot is based on regional differences abiotic samples from the urban site are located at the middle of the plot whereas those from rural and aquafarm sites are at the left and right sides respectively thus our pca analysis indicates high polymer diversity in the urban site with ps and pp polymers mainly occurring in the aquafarm and rural sites respectively thus within abiotic matrices mp contamination was closely related to regional human activities we then compared the mp polymer compositions between biotic and abiotic matrices fig 3b and table s4 as in abiotic matrices we observed high polymer composition diversity ten polymer types in biotic matrices at the urban site there was a significantly higher proportion of high density polymers in bivalves at the urban site 20 5 than at the aquafarm 7 3 and rural 0 sites p 0 05 kruskal wallis sb copolymers were found in bivalve samples from the urban site fig 3b the proportion of high density polymers found in polychaetes at the urban site 25 was similar to that at the aquafarm site 35 7 however the diversity of polymer types was higher in samples from the urban site n 5 nylon polyester pva pu and pvc than in those from the aquafarm site n 1 polyester at the aquafarm site ps was dominant among polychaetes 42 9 like as in sediment 66 4 and seawater 44 9 fig 3b the proportion of ps was low among bivalves 5 6 living in the sub surface water column reflecting its reduced composition in the sub surface layer of water column 5 3 fig s3 only three polymer types were found in biotic matrices from the rural site fig 3b pp and pe were abundant in both bivalves 95 4 and polychaetes 100 and in abiotic matrices 91 9 fig 3 these results show that the bioaccumulation profiles of mps in marine invertebrates reflected those of the abiotic matrices 3 2 mps in urban creek water and road dust eight polymer types including pe 5 pp 29 ps 5 polyester 24 acrylic 5 pva 5 pvc 24 and sb copolymer 5 were found in creek water from the urban site indicating that diverse polymers are discharged from the city to the ocean via river streams the proportion of high density polymers in creek water 63 was higher than those in seawater 37 and sediment 29 table s3 from the urban site the high diversity of polymer types and large proportion of high density polymers in both creek water and marine matrices suggest that mps within masan bay come from inland sources table s3 within the road dust samples we found five polymer types in the following proportions pp 41 pe 31 ps 17 sb copolymer 7 pva 5 table s3 black mps were dominant 52 fig s4 representing 36 of pe 46 of pp 14 of ps 9 of pva and 9 of sb copolymer particles sb copolymer widely used as a tire ingredient was found in both road dust and bivalve samples from the urban site implying that tire particles are transported from roads to marine environments eventually accumulating in marine biota fig 5 4 discussion mps collected from marine matrices in this study were mainly identified as pe and pp fig 3 which are the most common polymer types in seawater marine sediment and marine organisms worldwide frère et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 phuong et al 2018 pe and pp are produced in large quantities globally and are widely used andrady 2015 their low specific density pp 0 95 g cm3 pe 0 91 0 97 g cm3 allow them to float on water surfaces and travel long distances via ocean currents resulting in wide distribution even to non urbanized or remote areas in the current study the lowest polymer diversity was observed at the rural site which mainly containing pe and pp figs 3 and 4 the mp abundance was slightly lower at the rural site than at the urban or aquafarm sites this result raises the possibility of the existence of a local source for mps at the rural site in rural coastal areas small scale capture fisheries widely employ fishing nets and ropes the weathering and fragmentation of fishing gear can be a potential mp source for marine environments fishing rope and rope debris from korean coasts mainly consist of pp and pp pe copolymer polypropylene poly propylene ethylene jang et al 2014a interestingly many pp mps found in samples from the rural site had line patterned surfaces fig 6 a resembling those of pp rope fig 6c in contrast many pp mps from the urban site had smooth or solid surfaces fig 6b which are consistent with pp baskets and containers fig 6d pp mps with line patterns were most prevalent at the rural site 67 followed by the aquafarm 37 and urban sites 19 this result indicates that the surface characteristics of mps can provide information about their origins ps mp was more abundant than other polymer types in seawater sediment and polychaetes from the aquafarm site figs 3 and 4 reflecting the widespread use of eps buoys in this region the suspended long line culture system supported by numerous floating eps buoys is commonly used for oyster production in south korea about 2 million eps buoys are newly deployed every year but only 28 of these are retrieved by the government for recycling moe 2012 it is estimated that 990 000 eps buoys were lost or disposed of inappropriately in 2012 jang et al 2014b resulting in the prevalence of eps debris and its fragments on the korean coasts lee et al 2013 heo et al 2013 kang et al 2015 eps debris is easily fragmented by mechanical abrasion because it is a cellular plastic material consisting of numerous small spherical balls 2 4 mm in diameter ultraviolet uv radiation can produce micro and nano sized eps particles directly on the surface of eps debris song et al 2017 polychaetes inhabiting eps debris can also create numerous micro sized eps particles jang et al 2018 in the current study we expected high ingestion of eps particles by bivalves from the aquafarm site however less ps mp was found at this site than pe or pp this finding is inconsistent with the relatively high proportion of ps observed in surface seawater this difference may be related to exposure conditions in the water column bivalve samples were collected under floating pe buoys at the aquafarm site fig s3 therefore these bivalves should not have been exposed to the top surface layer including microlayer of the water column but instead to the sub surface layer where eps particles were less abundant due to their high buoyancy 0 02 06 g cm3 fig s3 in contrast polychaetes inhabiting the intertidal zone at the aquafarm site showed high proportions of ps mps nevertheless the concentration of ps mps in bivalves at the aquafarm site 0 67 1 48 particles individual was higher than those from the urban 0 36 0 72 particles individual and rural 0 11 0 24 particles individual sites but the difference was statistically insignificant the unexpectedly high pe particle abundance 7 21 6 05 particles individual among aquafarm bivalve samples was responsible for the low proportion of ps particles the high ingestion of pe particles by oysters and mussels at this site may be due to the wide use of pp pe copolymer ropes and hdpe buoys along with eps buoys for aquafarming in this region fig s5 the aquafarms use the hanging long line culture system where the oyster strings are suspended on submerged pp pe ropes supported by numerous eps and hdpe floating buoys fig s5 each long line is around 100 m of rope jang et al 2014a reported that polymer type of ropes n 9 currently employed in aquacultures fishing nets and ships was pp pe copolymer 78 and pe 22 hdpe buoys an alternative to eps buoys are constructed with rotomoulded polyethylene hulls filled with eps foam since 2009 the korean government has encouraged the replacement of eps buoys with more durable buoys to reduce eps pollution in the korean coastal environment lee et al 2015 pe buoys are now frequently found in oyster aquaculture farms fig s5 pe mps are likely to be produced from pe buoys ropes and their debris via weathering processes song et al 2017 providing a pe source in marine environments diverse polymers were found in marine matrices from the urban site figs 3 and 4 similarly a high diversity of polymer types pe pp ps polyester acrylic pva sb copolymer and pvc was observed in creek water that had passed through the city indicating that mps in marine matrices may have come from inland sources table s3 song et al 2018 also reported that high density polymers are frequently detected in seawater from urban area compared to that from rural area sewage treatment plant effluents are the major discharge route of domestic and industrial wastewater about 260 000 tons day into the bay some untreated sewage and wastewater also enters the bay through streams momaf 2004 lee et al 2011 eo et al 2019 lebreton et al 2017 estimated that 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic waste enters the ocean yearly from global rivers hardesty et al 2016 reported that plastic transport by water e g by storm drains and creeks is the second most important factor in plastic load to coastal regions in road dust samples sb copolymer a known tire ingredient was found along with pe pp ps and pva table s3 and fig 5 tire materials are complex mixtures comprising natural and synthetic petroleum based rubber and other materials such as carbon black mineral oils zno and sulfur wagner et al 2018 styrene butadiene rubber sbr is a component of synthetic rubber the interaction of tires with pavement generates numerous mp particles kole et al 2017 estimated that 5 9 million tons of tire particles are emitted globally each year about 90 of these particles are deposited on or beside roads to eventually be carried away by surface runoff wicke et al 2012 huber et al 2016 we detected sb copolymers in road dust 9 and in bivalves 7 living near roads fig 5 and table s3 this result indicates that tire particles are transported from roads to the marine environment to our knowledge this is the first field report of tire particle ingestion by marine biota in a recent study individual level adverse effects such as on survival growth and feeding rate were not found in freshwater benthic invertebrates following ingestion of tire particles redondo hasselerharm et al 2018 however tire particle ingestion by low trophic level marine organisms provides new insight into their potential ecological risks to marine communities these organisms are likely to carry tire particles and their associated chemicals into the marine food web wright et al 2013 humans can also ingest micro sized tire particles via seafood consumption in many studies fibers have been reported as the predominant mp shape among marine matrices 90 cesa et al 2017 leslie et al 2017 much attention has been paid to synthetic fiber pollution washing machine effluents are a major source of mp fibers in the ocean hartline et al 2016 napper and thompson 2016 however in this study fragments were the most common type of mp found perhaps due to different plastic usage patterns between countries differing mp analysis methods especially size range and chemical characterization may also have contributed to this difference eo et al 2019 observed that fragment type was predominant in mp 300 μm in river water but fiber type was dominant in mp 300 μm in a number of recent european studies mp fragments were found to be the dominant shape in bivalves when spectroscopy was used to identify suspected plastics digka et al 2018 phuong et al 2018 whereas fibers were dominant when visual identification was conducted along with spectroscopy identification for sub samples commonly 10 of total particles catarino et al 2017 leslie et al 2017 renzi et al 2018 cho et al 2019 reported that 80 of microfibers on filter papers was identified as natural fibers such as cotton and paper visual identification cannot successfully distinguish between synthetic and natural fibers because many synthetic fibers are colorless and natural fibers can contain various colors that appear in synthetic fibers such as yellow and red song et al 2015 resulting in overestimations of microfiber concentration in this study the polymer composition of fiber mps was 63 for pp 16 for pe 13 for polyester and 6 for pu implying that most fibers originated from fishing activities it is commonly thought that 80 of marine debris originates from land based sources andrady 2011 nelms et al 2017 wang et al 2017 similarly high mp abundances have been reported in seawater sediment and bivalves near populated regions frère et al 2017 antunes et al 2018 li et al 2018 eo et al 2018 however in this study the mean mp concentrations at the aquafarm site population density 198 people km2 were similar to or higher than those at the urban site 2683 people km2 fig 2 moreover although the population density was much lower at the rural site 55 people km2 than at the urban site the mp abundances in seawater and marine invertebrates were not significantly different between these sites fig 2 this result indicates a wide dispersion of mps in a large region along the coast and the existence of regional sources for mps in both the aquafarm and rural sites the polymeric composition also supports regional marine based human activities as a source of mps hong et al 2014 reported that eps buoys 12 8 of marine debris and fishing ropes 8 2 account for most of the beach macro debris along the coasts of korea meaning that the main sources of beach marine debris in korea being fisheries including commercial fisheries and marine aquaculture due to its high salt content the recycling rate of plastic waste is much lower for plastics used for marine based activities than for land based activities resulting in a higher abundance of singular fishery items debris in coastal regions jang et al 2014a similar to korea marine debris originating from marine based sources has been reported to be dominant in australia brazil japan and chile where fisheries are active edyvane et al 2004 santos et al 2005 hinojosa and thiel 2009 goto and shibata 2015 jambeck et al 2015 estimated that 4 8 12 7 million metric tons of plastic waste generated on land enters the ocean every year similarly lebreton et al 2017 estimated that 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic waste currently enters the ocean from land via rivers every year however there is no estimation of the mass of plastic marine debris generated from marine based sources the results of this study highlight need for research on plastic waste generated from marine based human activities such research is even more important for countries with developed marine industries 5 conclusion mps are being introduced into the ocean at an unprecedented rate several studies have been conducted on the impact of human activities on the mp abundance in the surrounding marine environment however limited information is available on the impact of different types of human activity on the characteristics e g shape and polymer type of mps in the marine environment in this study mp contamination was studied in abiotic and biotic marine matrices from three coastal regions with different types of local human activities in samples from the urban site mps of diverse polymer types were found in marine matrices demonstrating a close relationship with inland sources such as road dust and creek water mp polymer types and shapes revealed that marine based human activities such as fisheries and marine aquaculture have become important sources of mps in aquafarm and rural sites our results indicate that regional human activities affect the contamination characteristics of mps in the marine environment further research should be performed to evaluate the mp contamination caused by marine based human activities especially in countries

18194,human activity is thought to affect the abundance and contamination characteristics of microplastics mps in the environment which may in turn affect aquatic species however few studies have examined the impact of coastal area use pattern on characteristics of mps in coastal regions in this study we investigated mp contamination of abiotic matrices seawater and sediment and biotic matrices bivalves and polychaetes in three coastal regions characterized by different types of human activity covering urban aquafarm and rural areas mp abundance was higher in sediment from the urban site than in that from the rural site but similar to that from the aquafarm site in the abiotic matrices different mp polymer compositions were observed among the three sites diverse polymers were found in marine matrices from the urban site implying diverse mp sources in highly populated and industrialized areas polystyrene was more abundant in the aquafarm site reflecting the wide use of expanded polystyrene aquaculture buoys polypropylene was more abundant at the rural site probably due to the use of polypropylene ropes and nets in fishing activity mp accumulation profiles in marine invertebrates showed trends similar to those exhibited by abiotic matrices reflecting coastal area use patterns these results indicate that marine mps are generated from both land and marine based sources and that the abiotic and biotic marine matrices reflect the mp characteristics graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic aquatic environment coastal area use pattern polymer composition source environmental matrix 1 introduction microplastics mps are a form of marine debris measuring 5 mm in size arthur et al 2009 gesamp 2019 mps are classified as either primary or secondary according to their production method such that primary mps are intentionally manufactured and added to products such as cosmetic products and abrasive materials and secondary mps are formed through the breakdown of larger plastics during use or after disposal to the environment arthur et al 2009 contamination by mps has become a global environmental concern due to their ubiquitous distribution in the ocean from pole to pole from the surface to the seafloor sul and costa 2014 auta et al 2017 and within marine species at every level of the food web gall and thompson 2015 rochman 2018 ingested mps can cause physical damage such as intestinal obstruction and stomach ulcers carpenter et al 1972 and can transfer contaminants such as plastic additives and sorbed chemicals from seawater to marine organisms jang et al 2016 ziccardi et al 2016 inducing adverse biological effects von moos et al 2012 browne et al 2013 rochman et al 2013 like macro debris mps in the ocean can come from a variety of land and marine based sources roughly 80 of marine debris of which 60 80 is plastic has been estimated to originate from land based sources and the remainder from marine based activity sheavly 2005 therefore land based input is considered a major source of microplastics in the ocean some studies have attempted to identify the sources of mps on land e g clothes washing and cosmetics fendall and sewell 2009 browne et al 2011 and input pathways into the ocean e g sewage treatment plant effluents and riverine input leslie et al 2017 hurley et al 2018 previous studies have reported increasing mp levels in coastal sediments and seawater near populated areas frère et al 2017 vianello et al 2013 yonkos et al 2014 song et al 2018 implying a close relationship between land based human activities and mp pollution of marine environments not only land based but also marine based human activities e g shipping fisheries and aquaculture can be important sources of marine mps however our understanding of these sources their emission amounts their pathway to the environment and the fragmentation of plastic debris after disposal remain minimal mp physicochemical properties such as shape color and polymer type can provide information about their sources shim et al 2018 the original shape and color of plastics can be lost or changed by environmental weathering processes such as fragmentation and discoloration but their main polymer type does not change therefore polymer composition is a useful tool for identifying mp sources or origins in the environment for example alkyd particles on the ocean surface are derived from ship paint song et al 2014 polyester and acrylic fibers are commonly used for fabric browne et al 2010 and synthetic rubber is a tire ingredient wagner et al 2018 however most studies performed polymer identification for a small portion of suspected particles in their samples to validate their optical microscopy particle count estimate li et al 2016 leslie et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2018 nel et al 2018 because spectroscopic identification for all suspected particles on filter paper is a time consuming job song et al 2015 the polymer composition of mp can provide additional information about chemical substances contained because additive chemicals differ among plastic products and polymer types lithner et al 2011 jang et al 2017 and their leachates have a different toxicity to organisms bejgarn et al 2015 in this study we hypothesize that the polymer composition of mps in marine matrices would differ between regions according to coastal area use pattern and that these compositions would be reflected in marine species inhabiting these regions we analyzed mps in abiotic matrices seawater and sediment and biotic matrices mussels oysters and polychaetes from three coastal sites representing urban aquafarm and rural areas the polymer compositions of all plastic like particles were identified road dust and creek water were also collected from the urban area to compare their polymer compositions with those of marine matrices collected nearby 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling strategy we collected samples of abiotic matrices including seawater and sediment and biotic matrices including mussels mytilus edulis oysters crassostrea gigas and polychaetes perinereis aibuhitensis from the southern part of south korea between march and april 2016 fig 1 and fig s1 we selected three sites urban aquafarm and rural differing in land or sea use and pollution load fig 1 the urban site is located in masan bay a semi enclosed bay surrounded by the densely populated city of changwon 2682 people km2 which has petrochemical heavy metal electrical and plastic industries in 1983 masan bay was designated a special management area in korea due to its heavy loads of land driven contaminants shim et al 1999 hong et al 2003 li et al 2008 the aquafarm site is located in jinhae bay and has relatively low population density 198 people km2 compared to the urban site a number of oyster farms are distributed inside the bay employing a suspended culture technique using expanded polystyrene eps buoys this bay is the main shellfish farming area in the gyeongnam do region producing about 0 3 million tons of bivalves accounting for about 80 of the total shellfish production in korea gndi 2012 the rural site is located in the southernmost island of geoje and contains a small fishing village with low population density 55 people km2 and a small harbor for fishing boats but no industrial facilities or aquafarms the abiotic and biotic matrix sampling sites and the sampling points at each site are presented in fig 1 and fig s1 more than 30 mussels 4 5 5 cm and 30 oysters 4 9 cm were collected from intertidal rocky shores from the urban and rural sites and from under high density polyethylene hdpe buoys floating on the sea surface at the aquafarm site we sampled 100 l of surface seawater top 0 10 cm in triplicate near the bivalve sampling sites by hand filtering through a net mesh 20 μm and collected 100 l of sub surface water top 1 m from the aquafarm site in january 2017 more than 30 polychaete worms 10 30 cm were collected from the intertidal zone of aquafarm and rural sites using a shovel during low tide and from the subtidal zone of the urban site using a van veen grab sampler intact polychaetes were sampled and rinsed with filtered seawater whatman gf f 0 75 μm to remove all external particles and then transferred to a glass bottle containing 150 ml of filtered seawater three polychaetes were placed in a beaker for 3 days and their feces were collected for mp analysis during polychaete sampling at each site we also collected sediment top 0 5 cm in duplicate all samples except for the polychaetes were stored at 20 c until analysis creek discharge and urban runoff were expected to be important sources of mps in the environment to compare the mp contamination characteristics between land based mp input sources and marine matrices in urban area creek water and road dust were collected in this region road dust surface area 4 m2 was collected from the road right next to the urban sampling site bivalves and seawater in january 2017 figs 1 and 5 and creek water 100 l was collected from namcheon stream across the city in masan bay during low tide in july 2018 2 2 microplastic analysis the information on the volume and number of samples subjected to microplastic analysis is summarized in table s1 sediment samples were analyzed following the method of eo et al 2018 about 50 ml of wet sediment was weighed in a polyethylene pe bottle and then mixed with diluted lithium metatungstate solution lmt 50 ml 1 6 g ml and shaken for 1 min after settling the supernatant was transferred to a glass beaker this process was repeated three times the supernatant was passed through a 20 μm metal sieve the isolated particles were treated with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 and fe іі solution 75 c 100 rpm to remove organic matter secondary density separation was then conducted using sodium chloride nacl 1 2 g ml and supernatant was filtered through filter paper 20 μm polycarbonate sterlitech using a vacuum system road dust samples 50 ml 228 g were treated in the same manner as sediment samples the analysis of mps in seawater and creek water was performed following the method of song et al 2018 the water sample was passed through a 20 μm metal sieve to reduce the volume the remaining sample in the sieve was transferred to a glass beaker and wet peroxide oxidation with 35 h2o2 and fe ii solution added at 75 c after removing organic matter 6 g of nacl was added per 20 ml of sample and stirred at 100 rpm the sample was transferred to glass funnel for density separation after one day the settled particles were drained and the supernatant was filtered through filter paper 20 μm polycarbonate sterlitech bivalve samples were analyzed following the method of jang et al 2016 and cho et al 2019 after removing the shell the soft tissue was rinsed with commercial ultrapure water hplc grade daejung chemicals and metals co to remove remaining particles the sample was placed in a glass beaker and then 10 ml lipase lipex 100l novozymes bagsværd denmark 5 ml of protease savinase 16l novozymes and 185 ml of distilled water was added to digest organic matter using a magnetic stirrer the sample solution was stirred overnight at 200 rpm and 60 c after this digestion step the digested solution was sieved through a 20 μm sieve and rinsed with ultrapure water the particles remaining on the sieve were transferred to a glass funnel with nacl 1 2 g ml and left overnight the precipitate was removed twice the supernatant was filtered through filter papers 20 μm polycarbonate sterlitech the poychaete feces were prepared for microplastic analysis in accordance with the methods described in jang et al 2018 the fecal samples were treated with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic material and left 3 days the samples were transferred to a glass funnel with lmt solution for density separation the supernatant was filtered through filter papers 20 μm polycarbonate sterlitech filters were dried at room temperature and stored in glass petri dishes all suspected mp particles to 50 μm found on filter paper were identified using a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir microscope thermo nicolet 6700 continuum thermo scientific waltham ma usa song et al 2015 μft ir spectra of all particles were collected with an average of 128 scans over the spectral range of 650 4000 cm 1 in attenuated total reflectance atr mode and their polymer types were confirmed based on comparison with a spectral library database thermo scientific and recorded spectral matching with a hit index 70 was considered acceptable all mps were imaged and the longest axis was recorded according to their shape mps were categorized as fragment fiber film or sphere by the following criteria fragment is the irregularly shaped particle that appears to be broken down from a large object fiber is a thread shaped item with aspect ratio length to width 5 1 film is a flat and flexible particle with smooth or angular edges sphere is a particle with spherical smooth or granular shape to prevent contamination cotton lab coats and latex gloves were worn during the experiment and samples were kept covered with aluminum foil or glass the apparatus made of glass or metal was used in all processes except for pe bottle in sediment analysis all equipment was rinsed twice with filtered milli q water millipore tokyo japan and all liquid solutions were filtered through glass fiber filters gf f 0 75 μm whatman maidstone united kingdom uk the contamination of pe particle originated from the pe bottle was checked by analyzing water samples rinsed the inside of the bottles with filtered milli q water 100 ml 3 times n 3 before use and also by running a procedural blank sample as a result three zero and zero pe particles were detected in three bottle washed samples which is very limited compared to mp numbers found in sediment samples in addition no pe particle was found in the procedural blank sample this result indicates that microplastic contamination by pe bottle was negligible method validation was performed for organic matter digestion h2o2 or enzyme mixture and density separation lmt or nacl processes through spike tests pe specific density 0 95 g cm3 polypropylene pp 0 94 g cm3 eps 0 015 g cm3 and polyester 1 35 g cm3 particles 1 mm were made in the lab by grinding large plastic products and used as test materials ten particles of each polymer were spiked for each test in triplicate in both digestion processes h2o2 and enzyme mixture all test particles were recovered without physical damage or discoloration of polymers the recoveries of microplastics in density separation process were as follows pe 100 pp 97 6 eps 90 10 and polyester 60 10 for the nacl treatment group and pp 100 pe 100 eps 97 6 and polyester 97 6 for the lmt treatment group procedural blank samples were analyzed for every matrix the background mp levels were 0 7 0 5 particles filter paper in bivalve samples number of procedural blank samples n 18 0 particles filter paper in polychaete samples n 1 2 3 1 9 particles filter paper in seawater samples n 4 and 0 particles filter paper in sediment samples n 1 accounting for less than 10 of the mps in all samples table s2 it is difficult to completely prevent contamination when detecting particles in the micron range however the background levels should be 10 of the average values determined from the samples hanke et al 2013 a matrix spike test was performed for bivalve samples ten particles of each pe pp eps and polyester 1 mm length n 3 the mean recoveries n 3 of the added mps were 90 17 for pe 97 6 for pp 97 6 for eps and 87 6 for polyester 2 3 statistical analyses statistical analyses were conducted using spss v 19 and sigma plot v 12 0 software statistical differences in mp abundance among the matrices and or study sites were assessed using analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s test if the data were normally distributed otherwise the kruskal wallis test was used followed by multiple comparisons normality was tested using the shapiro wilk w test differences in polymer types between the sites were assessed using principal component analysis pca 3 results 3 1 regional mp contamination characteristics 3 1 1 abundance shape color and size

levels in seawater and polychaetes from the aquafarm site were higher than those from other sites but not significantly p 0 5 anova or kruskal wallis the mp concentration in sediment from the urban site was significantly higher than that from the rural site p 0 05 anova but not different from that of the aquafarm site fig 2 mps were found in various sizes shapes and colors in all matrices we determined the frequency of mps in various size ranges with results as follows 50 100 μm 10 8 100 200 μm 38 4 200 300 μm 18 1 300 400 μm 8 3 400 500 μm 8 1 500 600 μm 4 8 600 700 μm 3 9 700 800 μm 4 1 800 900 μm 1 8 and 900 1000 μm 1 7 fig s2a the most common size class was 100 200 μm in all matrices greater proportions of mp particles 300 μm were found in biotic matrices including mussel 83 oyster 78 and polychaete 70 than in abiotic matrices including seawater 59 and sediment 47 fig s2a fragments were the most dominant component across all matrices accounting for 89 of mp particles fig s2b and table s5 fibers were more abundant in polychaetes 23 and sediments 19 than in bivalves 7 and seawater 10 but the difference was statistically insignificant film and sphere type of mp were not found in all samples various colors were detected including blue black pink yellow red green and purple however colorless or transparent mp was dominant in both the abiotic and biotic matrices accounting for 95 of all mps fig s2c more colored mp was found in polychaete matrices than in other matrices due to the high proportion of black fibers 28 in polychaete samples there was no significant difference in mp size shape or color among the matrices or sampling sites 3 1 2 mp polymer types a total of 12 polymer types were identified including pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps nylon polyester acrylic polyvinyl acetate pva polyurethane pu alkyd polyoxymethylene pom polyvinyl chloride pvc and styrene butadiene sb copolymer fig 3 and table s4 most ps mps were composed of white eps density 0 02 06 g cm3 with a glossy fluffy surface among all sites and matrices low density compared to seawater specific density 1 02 g cm3 polymers pe pp and eps were more common than high density polymers nylon polyester acrylic pva pu alkyd pom pvc and sb copolymer fig 3 and table s3 in abiotic matrices seawater and sediment we found nine polymer types in the urban site samples the percentage of polymer type to the total microplastic found in abiotic matrices from urban site is as in the following pp 33 pe 28 polyester 22 pu 20 ps 10 acrylic 6 pva 4 alkyd 4 pom 2 fig 3a the proportion of high density polymers was significantly higher 33 7 in abiotic matrices from the urban site than in those from the aquafarm 1 9 and rural sites 6 7 p 0 05 kruskal wallis at the aquafarm site seven polymer types were found in abiotic matrices with the following composition ps 49 pp 26 pe 23 pva 0 8 polyester 0 4 acrylic 0 4 pu 0 4 fig 3a the proportion of ps was significantly higher in abiotic matrices from the aquafarm site 49 3 than those from the urban 5 8 and rural 1 3 sites p 0 05 anova fig 3a reflecting the widespread use of eps buoys in the aquaculture industries moe 2012 lee et al 2015 at the rural site seven polymer types were found in abiotic matrices with the following composition pp 64 pe 28 polyester 2 7 ps 1 3 pva 1 3 pu 1 3 pom 1 3 fig 3a pp mps were abundant probably due to the common use of pp rope in fishing activity jang et al 2014a pca was performed to identify regional mp contamination characteristics by examining the polymer compositions of abiotic samples from the three regions fig 4 two principal components explained 75 of the total variance in the data matrix on the loading plot pp ps and other polymers were well separated the major negative loading polymer of component 1 was pp and the major positive loading polymer was ps pe and various other polymers were loaded between pp and ps the distribution pattern of samples on the score plot is based on regional differences abiotic samples from the urban site are located at the middle of the plot whereas those from rural and aquafarm sites are at the left and right sides respectively thus our pca analysis indicates high polymer diversity in the urban site with ps and pp polymers mainly occurring in the aquafarm and rural sites respectively thus within abiotic matrices mp contamination was closely related to regional human activities we then compared the mp polymer compositions between biotic and abiotic matrices fig 3b and table s4 as in abiotic matrices we observed high polymer composition diversity ten polymer types in biotic matrices at the urban site there was a significantly higher proportion of high density polymers in bivalves at the urban site 20 5 than at the aquafarm 7 3 and rural 0 sites p 0 05 kruskal wallis sb copolymers were found in bivalve samples from the urban site fig 3b the proportion of high density polymers found in polychaetes at the urban site 25 was similar to that at the aquafarm site 35 7 however the diversity of polymer types was higher in samples from the urban site n 5 nylon polyester pva pu and pvc than in those from the aquafarm site n 1 polyester at the aquafarm site ps was dominant among polychaetes 42 9 like as in sediment 66 4 and seawater 44 9 fig 3b the proportion of ps was low among bivalves 5 6 living in the sub surface water column reflecting its reduced composition in the sub surface layer of water column 5 3 fig s3 only three polymer types were found in biotic matrices from the rural site fig 3b pp and pe were abundant in both bivalves 95 4 and polychaetes 100 and in abiotic matrices 91 9 fig 3 these results show that the bioaccumulation profiles of mps in marine invertebrates reflected those of the abiotic matrices 3 2 mps in urban creek water and road dust eight polymer types including pe 5 pp 29 ps 5 polyester 24 acrylic 5 pva 5 pvc 24 and sb copolymer 5 were found in creek water from the urban site indicating that diverse polymers are discharged from the city to the ocean via river streams the proportion of high density polymers in creek water 63 was higher than those in seawater 37 and sediment 29 table s3 from the urban site the high diversity of polymer types and large proportion of high density polymers in both creek water and marine matrices suggest that mps within masan bay come from inland sources table s3 within the road dust samples we found five polymer types in the following proportions pp 41 pe 31 ps 17 sb copolymer 7 pva 5 table s3 black mps were dominant 52 fig s4 representing 36 of pe 46 of pp 14 of ps 9 of pva and 9 of sb copolymer particles sb copolymer widely used as a tire ingredient was found in both road dust and bivalve samples from the urban site implying that tire particles are transported from roads to marine environments eventually accumulating in marine biota fig 5 4 discussion mps collected from marine matrices in this study were mainly identified as pe and pp fig 3 which are the most common polymer types in seawater marine sediment and marine organisms worldwide frère et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 phuong et al 2018 pe and pp are produced in large quantities globally and are widely used andrady 2015 their low specific density pp 0 95 g cm3 pe 0 91 0 97 g cm3 allow them to float on water surfaces and travel long distances via ocean currents resulting in wide distribution even to non urbanized or remote areas in the current study the lowest polymer diversity was observed at the rural site which mainly containing pe and pp figs 3 and 4 the mp abundance was slightly lower at the rural site than at the urban or aquafarm sites this result raises the possibility of the existence of a local source for mps at the rural site in rural coastal areas small scale capture fisheries widely employ fishing nets and ropes the weathering and fragmentation of fishing gear can be a potential mp source for marine environments fishing rope and rope debris from korean coasts mainly consist of pp and pp pe copolymer polypropylene poly propylene ethylene jang et al 2014a interestingly many pp mps found in samples from the rural site had line patterned surfaces fig 6 a resembling those of pp rope fig 6c in contrast many pp mps from the urban site had smooth or solid surfaces fig 6b which are consistent with pp baskets and containers fig 6d pp mps with line patterns were most prevalent at the rural site 67 followed by the aquafarm 37 and urban sites 19 this result indicates that the surface characteristics of mps can provide information about their origins ps mp was more abundant than other polymer types in seawater sediment and polychaetes from the aquafarm site figs 3 and 4 reflecting the widespread use of eps buoys in this region the suspended long line culture system supported by numerous floating eps buoys is commonly used for oyster production in south korea about 2 million eps buoys are newly deployed every year but only 28 of these are retrieved by the government for recycling moe 2012 it is estimated that 990 000 eps buoys were lost or disposed of inappropriately in 2012 jang et al 2014b resulting in the prevalence of eps debris and its fragments on the korean coasts lee et al 2013 heo et al 2013 kang et al 2015 eps debris is easily fragmented by mechanical abrasion because it is a cellular plastic material consisting of numerous small spherical balls 2 4 mm in diameter ultraviolet uv radiation can produce micro and nano sized eps particles directly on the surface of eps debris song et al 2017 polychaetes inhabiting eps debris can also create numerous micro sized eps particles jang et al 2018 in the current study we expected high ingestion of eps particles by bivalves from the aquafarm site however less ps mp was found at this site than pe or pp this finding is inconsistent with the relatively high proportion of ps observed in surface seawater this difference may be related to exposure conditions in the water column bivalve samples were collected under floating pe buoys at the aquafarm site fig s3 therefore these bivalves should not have been exposed to the top surface layer including microlayer of the water column but instead to the sub surface layer where eps particles were less abundant due to their high buoyancy 0 02 06 g cm3 fig s3 in contrast polychaetes inhabiting the intertidal zone at the aquafarm site showed high proportions of ps mps nevertheless the concentration of ps mps in bivalves at the aquafarm site 0 67 1 48 particles individual was higher than those from the urban 0 36 0 72 particles individual and rural 0 11 0 24 particles individual sites but the difference was statistically insignificant the unexpectedly high pe particle abundance 7 21 6 05 particles individual among aquafarm bivalve samples was responsible for the low proportion of ps particles the high ingestion of pe particles by oysters and mussels at this site may be due to the wide use of pp pe copolymer ropes and hdpe buoys along with eps buoys for aquafarming in this region fig s5 the aquafarms use the hanging long line culture system where the oyster strings are suspended on submerged pp pe ropes supported by numerous eps and hdpe floating buoys fig s5 each long line is around 100 m of rope jang et al 2014a reported that polymer type of ropes n 9 currently employed in aquacultures fishing nets and ships was pp pe copolymer 78 and pe 22 hdpe buoys an alternative to eps buoys are constructed with rotomoulded polyethylene hulls filled with eps foam since 2009 the korean government has encouraged the replacement of eps buoys with more durable buoys to reduce eps pollution in the korean coastal environment lee et al 2015 pe buoys are now frequently found in oyster aquaculture farms fig s5 pe mps are likely to be produced from pe buoys ropes and their debris via weathering processes song et al 2017 providing a pe source in marine environments diverse polymers were found in marine matrices from the urban site figs 3 and 4 similarly a high diversity of polymer types pe pp ps polyester acrylic pva sb copolymer and pvc was observed in creek water that had passed through the city indicating that mps in marine matrices may have come from inland sources table s3 song et al 2018 also reported that high density polymers are frequently detected in seawater from urban area compared to that from rural area sewage treatment plant effluents are the major discharge route of domestic and industrial wastewater about 260 000 tons day into the bay some untreated sewage and wastewater also enters the bay through streams momaf 2004 lee et al 2011 eo et al 2019 lebreton et al 2017 estimated that 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic waste enters the ocean yearly from global rivers hardesty et al 2016 reported that plastic transport by water e g by storm drains and creeks is the second most important factor in plastic load to coastal regions in road dust samples sb copolymer a known tire ingredient was found along with pe pp ps and pva table s3 and fig 5 tire materials are complex mixtures comprising natural and synthetic petroleum based rubber and other materials such as carbon black mineral oils zno and sulfur wagner et al 2018 styrene butadiene rubber sbr is a component of synthetic rubber the interaction of tires with pavement generates numerous mp particles kole et al 2017 estimated that 5 9 million tons of tire particles are emitted globally each year about 90 of these particles are deposited on or beside roads to eventually be carried away by surface runoff wicke et al 2012 huber et al 2016 we detected sb copolymers in road dust 9 and in bivalves 7 living near roads fig 5 and table s3 this result indicates that tire particles are transported from roads to the marine environment to our knowledge this is the first field report of tire particle ingestion by marine biota in a recent study individual level adverse effects such as on survival growth and feeding rate were not found in freshwater benthic invertebrates following ingestion of tire particles redondo hasselerharm et al 2018 however tire particle ingestion by low trophic level marine organisms provides new insight into their potential ecological risks to marine communities these organisms are likely to carry tire particles and their associated chemicals into the marine food web wright et al 2013 humans can also ingest micro sized tire particles via seafood consumption in many studies fibers have been reported as the predominant mp shape among marine matrices 90 cesa et al 2017 leslie et al 2017 much attention has been paid to synthetic fiber pollution washing machine effluents are a major source of mp fibers in the ocean hartline et al 2016 napper and thompson 2016 however in this study fragments were the most common type of mp found perhaps due to different plastic usage patterns between countries differing mp analysis methods especially size range and chemical characterization may also have contributed to this difference eo et al 2019 observed that fragment type was predominant in mp 300 μm in river water but fiber type was dominant in mp 300 μm in a number of recent european studies mp fragments were found to be the dominant shape in bivalves when spectroscopy was used to identify suspected plastics digka et al 2018 phuong et al 2018 whereas fibers were dominant when visual identification was conducted along with spectroscopy identification for sub samples commonly 10 of total particles catarino et al 2017 leslie et al 2017 renzi et al 2018 cho et al 2019 reported that 80 of microfibers on filter papers was identified as natural fibers such as cotton and paper visual identification cannot successfully distinguish between synthetic and natural fibers because many synthetic fibers are colorless and natural fibers can contain various colors that appear in synthetic fibers such as yellow and red song et al 2015 resulting in overestimations of microfiber concentration in this study the polymer composition of fiber mps was 63 for pp 16 for pe 13 for polyester and 6 for pu implying that most fibers originated from fishing activities it is commonly thought that 80 of marine debris originates from land based sources andrady 2011 nelms et al 2017 wang et al 2017 similarly high mp abundances have been reported in seawater sediment and bivalves near populated regions frère et al 2017 antunes et al 2018 li et al 2018 eo et al 2018 however in this study the mean mp concentrations at the aquafarm site population density 198 people km2 were similar to or higher than those at the urban site 2683 people km2 fig 2 moreover although the population density was much lower at the rural site 55 people km2 than at the urban site the mp abundances in seawater and marine invertebrates were not significantly different between these sites fig 2 this result indicates a wide dispersion of mps in a large region along the coast and the existence of regional sources for mps in both the aquafarm and rural sites the polymeric composition also supports regional marine based human activities as a source of mps hong et al 2014 reported that eps buoys 12 8 of marine debris and fishing ropes 8 2 account for most of the beach macro debris along the coasts of korea meaning that the main sources of beach marine debris in korea being fisheries including commercial fisheries and marine aquaculture due to its high salt content the recycling rate of plastic waste is much lower for plastics used for marine based activities than for land based activities resulting in a higher abundance of singular fishery items debris in coastal regions jang et al 2014a similar to korea marine debris originating from marine based sources has been reported to be dominant in australia brazil japan and chile where fisheries are active edyvane et al 2004 santos et al 2005 hinojosa and thiel 2009 goto and shibata 2015 jambeck et al 2015 estimated that 4 8 12 7 million metric tons of plastic waste generated on land enters the ocean every year similarly lebreton et al 2017 estimated that 1 15 2 41 million tons of plastic waste currently enters the ocean from land via rivers every year however there is no estimation of the mass of plastic marine debris generated from marine based sources the results of this study highlight need for research on plastic waste generated from marine based human activities such research is even more important for countries with developed marine industries 5 conclusion mps are being introduced into the ocean at an unprecedented rate several studies have been conducted on the impact of human activities on the mp abundance in the surrounding marine environment however limited information is available on the impact of different types of human activity on the characteristics e g shape and polymer type of mps in the marine environment in this study mp contamination was studied in abiotic and biotic marine matrices from three coastal regions with different types of local human activities in samples from the urban site mps of diverse polymer types were found in marine matrices demonstrating a close relationship with inland sources such as road dust and creek water mp polymer types and shapes revealed that marine based human activities such as fisheries and marine aquaculture have become important sources of mps in aquafarm and rural sites our results indicate that regional human activities affect the contamination characteristics of mps in the marine environment further research should be performed to evaluate the mp contamination caused by marine based human activities especially in countries
